transcribers note in memoriam michael s hart inventor of the ebook and founder of project gutenberg across the stream by e f benson across the stream by e f benson london john murray albemarle street w introduction there is a very large class of persons alive today who believe that not only is communication with the dead possible but that they themselves have had actual experience of it many of these are eminent in scientific research and on any other subject the world in general would accept their evidence there is possibly a larger class of persons who hold that all such communications if genuine come not from the dead but from the devil this is the taught opinion of the roman catholic church a third class far more numerous than both of these is sure that any one who holds either of these beliefs is a dupe of conjurers or the victim of his own disordered brain this type of robust intellect has during the last ten decades affirmed that hypnotism aviation in machines heavier than air telepathy wireless telegraphy and other nonproved phenomena are superstitious and unscientific balderdash in an earlier century it was equally certain that the earth did not go round the sun it is happily never disconcerted by the frequency with which the superstitions and impossibilities of one generation become the science of the next the first part of this book may be accepted by the first of these three classes the second by the second and none of it by the third its aim is to state rather than solve the subject with which it deals and to suggest that the dead and the devil alike may be able to communicate with the living e f benson book i chapter i certain scenes certain pictures of his very early years of childhood stood out for archie like clear sunlit peaks above the dim clouds that shrouded the time when the power of memory was only beginning to germinate he had no doubt and was probably right about it as to which the earliest of those was it was the face of his nurse blessington leaning over his crib she held a candle in her hand which a little dazzled him but the sight of her face tender and anxious and divinely reassuring was the point of that memory he had been asleep and had awoke with a start and finding himself alone in the midst of the immense desolation of the dark that pressed on him like an invader from all sides he had lifted up his voice and yelled then as by a conjuringtrick blessington had appeared with her comforting presence that quite robbed the dark of its terrors it must still have been early in the night for she had not yet gone to bed and had on above her smooth grey hair her cap with its adorable blue ribands in it at her throat was the brooch made of the same stuff as the shining shillings with which a year or two later she bought the buns and spongecakes for tea he remembered no more than that he knew nothing of what she had said the whole of that memory consisted in the fact of the secure comfort and relief which her face brought it was just a vignette of memory the earliest of all there was nothing whatever before it and nothing for some time after gradually the horizon widened scenes and situations in which archie was still a detached observer as if looking through a telescope made themselves visible he remembered gazing through the bars of the high nursery fireguard at the joyful glow of the fuel at the corner of the grate he remembered this with extreme distinctness there was a black coal the edge of which was soft and bubbly a thin streamer of smoke blew out of it and from time to time this smoke caught light and flared very satisfactorily but all that the joyfulness and the satisfaction was external to him it was the coals and the streams of burning gas that were in themselves joyful and satisfactory that must have been in the winter and it was in the same winter perhaps that he came home with blessington and two other childrengirls and larger than himselfwhom he grew to believe were his sisters through a wood of firtrees between the trunks of which shone a round red ball that resembled the coals in the nurserygrate he knewperhaps blessington perhaps a sister perhaps his mother had told himthat it was christmas eve and he saw that when blessington spoke to him she steamed delightfully at the mouth as if there had been a hot bath just inside her lips at her suggestion he found he could do it too and his sisters also whereafter they played hotbaths all the way home but of the christmas day that followed he had no recollection whatever his observation became a little less detached he began to form in his mind an explorers map of the places where these phenomena occurred to be dimly aware that he was taking some sort of part in them and was not a mere spectator and one summer evening he definitely knew that the daynursery and the nightnursery and the room beyond where his sisters slept were all part of the redbrick house which he and others inhabited just as according to blessington the rabbit which he had seen pop into its hole in the wood beyond the lawn had a home within it he had already had his bath on a patch of sunlight that lay across the nurseryfloor and escaping slippery as a trout from blessingtons towelling hands had run with a squeal of delight across to the window outside was the lawn which hitherto he had thought of as a thing apart a picture by itself and beyond was the wood where the rabbit had a house on the lawn was his mother playing croquet with his two sisters and of a sudden it flashed upon him that the wood and the rabbit the lawn and the croquetplayers the nightnursery blessington the shine of the sun low in the west and his own wet self were all in some queer manner part of the same thing and made up that to which he and blessington went back when at the limit of their walk she said it was time to go home oh theres mummy he cried mummy and he danced naked at the window blessington caught him in the towel again well i never she said thats not the way for a young gentleman to behave there let me dry you dear and put your nightshirt on and you shall say goodnight to your mamma out of the window this was duly done and it struck archie as a very novel and delightful discovery that he could say goodnight to his mother when she was on the croquetlawn and he up in the nightnursery it shed a new light on existence generally and coloured with a new interest the few drowsy moments which intervened between his being put into bed and falling asleep blessington still moved quietly about the room emptying his bath and putting his clothes tidy and he just remembered her kissing him when she had finished he was already too suffused with drowsiness to make any response and he slid softly out over the tides of sleep that night he became acquainted with a new sort of experience something hitherto quite foreign to him once again he woke in the night and found himself surrounded by the vast dark save where in a corner of the nursery there burned the shaded nightlight but now there was no sense of terror he did not want to call for blessington but lay openeyed and absorbed in the amazing thing that was happening the nightnursery where he knew he was and he with it were expanding and extending till they comprised the lawn and the wood beyond the lawn and all else that he had ever known his sisters and his mother and father were all there though he could not see them blessington was there and graves the butler and walter and william the two footmen he could not see them any more than he could see the moon and the sun which were there also but they were there as part of an unusual presence that filled the place he could not see that unusual presence either but it was tremendously real and filled him not in the least with awe but with the feeling with which blessingtons face and his mothers face inspired him and the next thing that he was aware of was the rattle of the blind and blessingtons voice saying eh what a time of morning to have slept to i know a sleepyhead he recounted this remarkable experience to blessington at breakfast who was quite sure that it was all a dream a nice dream but a dream wasnt a dream said archie firmly and where did mr contradiction go asked blessington archie knew where mr contradiction went for mr contradiction lived in a very dull corner of the nursery with his face to the wall for five minutes well it didnt seem like a dream he said may i get down yes and say your grace thank god for my good dinner said archie who was not attending say it again dear said blessington and think i meant breakfast said archie amen the discovery of the connection made last night between himself in the nightnursery and his mother on the lawn which proved that the lawn and the house were part of the same thing produced further results that day instead of memory consisting of different and severed pictures it began to flow into one coherent whole he knew of course already that at the end of the nursery passage was a wooden wicketgate and that outside that was the long gallery that skirted round three sides of the hall while on the fourth ran a broad staircase each step of which had to be surmounted and descended either by a series of jumps or if the feet were tired by the extension of one foot on to the next stair where it was joined by the other but he began now to put these isolated facts together and form them into the conception of a house when the staircase was negotiated you found yourself in a large oakfloored hall where you were not allowed to slide on purpose though both blessington and his mother had the sense to distinguish between deliberate and unintentional slidings there were bright rugs spread here and there over the hall forming islands in a glassy sea archie knew it was not made of glass really but he chose to think that it was for it had the qualities of a lookingglass in that it reflected his own barelegged form above it and the slipperiness of glass as exhibited in the windowpanes of the nursery and he chose also to think that it was to the hallfloor that the hymn alluded which was sung last sunday morning in a dazzling and populous place to which his mother had taken him the people who sang loudest were two rows of boys dressed in crinkly white nightshirts in company with some grownup men who were attired in the same curious manner but none of them went to bed and at a pause in the proceedings archie had suddenly asked his mother in a piercing voice why they didnt go to bed evidently that had puzzled her too for she had no reply to give him except hush darling which wasnt an answer at all then another man had begun talking all by himself he had a quantity of hair on his chin which wagged in so delightful a manner when he spoke that archie watched him entranced for a little and then afraid that his mother was missing this lovely sight said o mummy isnt that a funny man upon which blessington magically communicated with appeared by his side and whispered that they were going for a walk and towed him down the aisle still rapturously looking back at the funny man archie had thought it all very entertaining but he was told afterwards by his father that he had disgraced himself and should not go to church again for many sundays to come archie was frightened of his father and always went warily by the door of the room at the dark corner of the hall where this tremendous person lived there were other dangers about that corner for on the floor were two tigerskins which looked as if the animal in question had with the exception of its head been squashed out flat like as when he and blessington sometimes put a flower they had gathered on their walks between two sheets of blottingpaper and piled books on the top so that it ceased to be a flower and became the map of a flower archie wished the tigers heads had been pressed in the same way as it was they were disconcertingly solid and lifelike with long teeth and snarling mouths and glaring eyes he had always made blessington come right up to his fathers door with him when he went in to say goodnight so that she should pilot him safely past the tigers on his entry and escort him by them again on his return but one night his father had come out with him and finding blessington waiting there had divined as by some awful black magic why the nurse was waiting and had decreed that archie should in future make his way across the danger zone unattended but next evening the trembling archie hurrying away in the dusk had fallen down on the glassy sea between the awful scylla and charybdis and convinced that his last hour had come when these two cruel heads beheld him prostrate on the floor had cried himself to sleep from terror of that awful ending but next day his mother who understood about things in general better than anybody had caused the tigers to make friends with him and in token of their amity they had each of them presented him with a whiskerhair that assured their friendship and they wished it to be understood that their snarlings and glarings were directed not at archie but at archies enemies this naturally changed their whole aspect and archie after he had wished his father goodnight kissed the hairy heads that had once been so terrifying and thanked them for successfully keeping his enemies from molesting him but though now the presence of the tigers ceasing to be a terror by night had become a protection to archie their corner of the hall still constituted a danger zone to be gone by swiftly and silently lest a raised voice or an incautious noise should cause him to be called from within the closed door of his fathers room there were risks in that room you never quite knew whether you were not going to be blamed for doing something which you had no idea was blameworthy one day archie had found a lovely wax match with a blue head to it on the floor and had put it in his pocket where he fingered it delightedly for he knew it to be the sort which flamed when you rubbed it against your boot or the bricks of the house as he had seen his father do but then when a little later he had come to sit on his fathers knee and be shown pictures in a book of natural history it was detected that his small fingers smelled of phosphorus and when the reason was discovered he was told by his father that he had stolen that match to archies mind there was something inexplicably unfair and unjust about this he knew quite well that the match was not his but he had no idea that it was stealing if you appropriated something that was dropped on the floor a thing dropped on the floor was nobodys and anybody so he supposed might take it it had been quite another affair when he had taken eight lumps of sugar out of the basin on the teatable in the drawingroom and hidden them in his dominobox he had been perfectly well aware that he was stealing them and had no sense of injustice when his mother had promptly and soundly smacked him for it but he intensely resented being told by his father that he had stolen even though he was not smacked when he had not the least idea that a match dropped on the floor was a stealable article at all and he felt it far more bitter to be unjustly blamed than justly punished but i didnt know it was stealing daddy said he but didnt you know it wasnt yours yes and didnt you know that to take what isnt yours is stealing archie couldnt explain but he was still quite sure he had not been stealing his fathers room then at least when that potentate was in it was a place where extreme caution was necessary and however cautious you were he had not felt guilty of the smallest temerity in picking up that match you could never be quite sure that fate like some great concealed cat would not pounce upon you from the most unexpected quarter but considered in itself the room had a tremendous attraction for him there was a delicious smell about it subtly compounded of the leather backs of books and the aroma of tobacco which to archies dawning perception had something virile and masculine about it he could understand the manliness of the place it answered to something that was shared by him and not shared by his mother or blessington or his sisters and belonged to a man the furniture and the appurtenances of the room conveyed the same message they were strong and solid without frillings or frippery and had a decisive air and a purpose about them which somehow concerned that mysterious difference between boys and girls and between men and women his mothers sittingroom it is true seemed to archie a fairypalace of loveliness with its spindlelegged tables its laceedged curtains its soft silky cushions its china its glittering silver toys on a particular black lacquer table its nameless feminine fragrance but this room with its solid leather chairs which held small limbs as in a tender male embrace its guncase in the corner its whiprack its few solid sober pictures which hung above the bookshelves struck a different and more intimate and more intelligible note archie felt that he knew what it was all about it was about a man to which genus he himself belonged this particular specimen his father might be unjust to him and severe to him but in some secret inexplicable manner archie understood him though fearing him better than he understood either his mother or blessington both of whom he loved his two sisters in the same way had a quality of enigma about them these floating impressions the untranslatable instincts of early childhood began to thicken when archie was getting on for six years old into thoughts capable of being solidified into language he could not have solidified them himself but if any one capable of presenting them to him in actual words had asked him is it this you mean he would have assented and his solidified thoughts would have taken the following mould there was something odd about females and it was a mystery into which he did not at all want to enquire they wore skirts which perhaps concealed some abnormality which would be fearful to contemplate they had soft faces and soft bodies when his mother took him on her kneeshe already said that he was getting too big a boy to sit on her knee which to archie sounded very grand and delightfulshe was soft to his shoulder and her cheek was soft to his but when he sat on his fathers knee he felt a hard firm substance behind him and the contrast was similar to the contrast between his mothers soft cushions and his fathers leatherclad chairs and his father had a hard bristly cheek on which to receive archies goodnight kiss judged by the standards of pleasure and luxury it was not nearly as nice as his mothers but it gave him however great need there was for caution a sense of identity with himself he was of that species and this conception of abnormality in women was strongly confirmed when one morning he went as usual to his mothers bedroom to see her before she went down to breakfast she had been late in getting up that day and not finding her in her bedroom archies attention had been arrested by hearing sounds from her bathroom next door and very naturally had turned the handle in order to enter but a voice from inside had said is that you darling wait just a minute but i want to come in now said archie im coming in archie i shall be very angry if you come in before i give you leave said the voice then there were rustlings come in now and there was his mother standing by her bath which smelt deliciously fragrant in a lovely blue bathtowel dressinggown goodmorning darling said she but you must never come into a ladys bathroom unless she gives you leave why not said archie you come to see me in my bath without my saying yes she gave that delicious bubble of laughter that reminded archie of the sound of cool lemonade being poured out of the bottle i shant when youre as old as me she said i shall always ask your leave and probably you wont give it me why not its only me said archie youll know when youre older said she archie rather despised that argument it seemed to apply to so many situations in life but he had already formed the very excellent habit of crediting his mother with the gift of common sense for was it not she who had discovered that the snarl of the tigerheads was a snarl not at archie but at his enemies but on this occasion it merely confirmed his conviction that women were somehow deformed they wore skirts instead of breeches and though judging by his younger sister they were normal up to about the level of the knee it seemed likely that their legs extended no farther but that they became like pegtops swelling out in one round piece till their bodies were reached what confirmed this impression was that they seemed to run from their knees instead of striding with a swung leg blessington always ran like that her feet twinkled in ridiculously short steps and after a moment or two she said eh i cant run any more ive got a bone in my leg and havent i asked archie no dear youre just made of gristle and quicksilver said blessington with a sudden lyrical spasm as she looked at the shining face of her most beloved whats quicksilver asked archie and why havent i got a bone in my leg oooh and a sudden thought struck him have women got bones in their legs and not boys is that why they cant run properly mummy cant run nor can you but william can damn him master archie said blessington in her most severe voice what for asked archie you must never say that master archie said blessington who only called him master archie on impressive occasions you must never say what you said after william can but daddy said it to william this morning said archie blessington still wore the iron mask on her face it was lucky for her that archie did not know how puzzled she was as to the correct answer your papa says what he thinks fit she said and that is right for him but young gentlemen never say it how old shall i have to be began archie and look at your shoelace all untied said blessington with extreme promptitude do it up at once or youll be treading on it and then it will be time for you to go in and you can write your letter to miss marjorie before your dinner miss marjorie was the elder of archies two sisters she was ten years older than he and at the present time was staying with her grandmother whom archie strongly suspected of being either a witch or a man she was large and rustling and had a bass voice and a small moustache and a small husband who was an earl to whom when he came to stay with archies father who appeared to be his son every one paid a great deal of unnecessary attention both of them archies father and archies fathers father were lords and archie distinctly thought he ought to be a lord too considering that both his father and his grandfather were blessington had hinted that he would be a lord too some day if he were good but when pressed she couldnt say when in fact there was a ridiculous reticence about the whole matter for when he had asked his mother in the presence of his grandfather when he was going to be a lord his grandfather quite inexplicably had giggled with laughter and said ive got one foot in the grave already archie and you want me to have both that was a very cryptic remark and when archie asked william the footman what grandpapa tintagel had meant william had said that he couldnt say sir on which archie looking hastily round and feeling sure that blessington was not present had repeated damn you william as daddy said then william after endeavouring not to show two rows of jolly white teeth had said you must never say that to me master archie in fact there was clearly a league blessington and william who didnt love each other as archie had ascertained by direct questions to each were at one over the question of him not saying that under the stress of independent evidence archie decided not to say it any more without further experiments as to the effect it would have on his mother if william and blessington were both agreed about it it had clearly better not be done any more than it was wise to walk about among the flowers of the big herbaceous border the gardener and the gardeners boy and his mother were all of one mind about that and the gardeners boy had threatened to turn the hose on to him if he caught him at it the gardeners boy was quite grown up and so for archie he had a weight of authority that befitted his years it was a lovely disconnected life there were all sorts of delightful and highly coloured strands that contributed to it and others of a more sombre hue and others again quite secret which concerned archie alone and of which he never spoke to anybody of the delightful and highly coloured strands there were many waking in the morning and knowing that there was going to be another day was one of them and perhaps that was the most delightful of all except when rarely it was clouded with some trouble of the evening before as when archie had broken a window in his fathers study in the laudable attempt to kill a wasp with a fireshovel and had been told by blessington that his father wished to see him the moment he was dressed in the morning but usually the wakings were ecstatic and often he used to return to consciousness in those summer months long before blessington came in to call him the window was always openall the windows in the nightnursery were opened as soon as he got into bedand the blinds were up and on the ceiling was the most delicious green light for the early sun shone through the branches of the beeches outside and painted archies ceiling with a pale milky green which was adorable to contemplate he would pull up his nightshirt and with his bare arms clasp his bare knees and lying on his back rather unsteadily anchored would roll backwards and forwards looking at the green light and rehearsing all the delightful probabilities of the day sometimes his mother had promised him that he should go out fishing on the lake when his lessons were done and this implied the wonderful experience of seeing walter or william come out on to the lawn and pour out of a tin gardening can a mixture of mustard and water when the footman did that it was certain that in a short time the grass would be covered with worms which william put in a tin box lined with moss then archie and william sometimes with a sister whose presence archie thought was not wholly desirable since she impeded the free flow of talk between him and william would go down to the lake and william who could do everything put worms on hooks they did not seem to mind for they said no word of protest and sculled across to the sluice above which was deep water where the fish fed and away from the reeds where the line got entangled so that it was impossible to know whether you were engaged with a fish or a vegetable the fishingrod came out of his fathers studythat was another delightful male attribute about the roomand when archie went in to ask for it william came too not in his livery but in ordinary clothes and his father said take good care of master archie william good sport archie sometimes again if he was not busy lord davidstow came out with archie instead of william that was somehow an honour but archie did not like it so much once there was a great happening william produced a curious object that looked like the bowl of a spoon with hooks set all round it he said there were going to be no worms this time and instead of drifting about he rowed up and down while archie with his rod over the stern saw the spoon flashing through the water then a great shadow came over it and archie felt the rod bend in his hands he was so excited that he stepped on to the seat of the boat in order to see better and promptly fell overboard he was not the least frightened and rather enjoyed the splash and the sense of sodawater round him with both hands he held on to the fishingrod which seemed an absolutely essential thing to do and sank down down in the deep water seeing it green and yellow above his head and then instantly he knew he was going to be drowned and a feeling precisely identical to that which he had experienced one night when he woke of a universal presence round about him took complete possession of him then even before he was conscious of the least sense of choking or discomfort but was still only aware of coolness and depth and greenness a great dark splaying object came right down upon him from above and he found himself tucked underneath a human arm coatless and in shirtsleeves which he took to be williams but still archie did not let go of the fishingrod and mistakenly trying to speak bidding william take care of it his mouth and apparently his whole interior filled with water and drowning suddenly seemed to be a disagreeable process next moment however his head emerged from the water again and william caught hold of the boat let go the rod master archie said he and catch hold of the boat but theres a fish on it spluttered archie do as i tell you sir said william quite crossly archie had been told that when he went out in the boat with william he had to do precisely as william told him he was not it is true in the boat at the moment but the injunction probably applied so he let go of the rod and the moment afterwards found himself violently propelled over the side of the boat and tumbled all abroad on the floor of it they were but a dozen yards from land and william having once got archie into the boat grabbed hold of the rod with his spare hand and swam shoving the boat in front of him oh well done william oh william i love you screamed archie when having righted himself he observed this brilliant manoeuvre is the fish there still william scrambled up the bank still holding the rod run indoors at once master archie he said dont wait a moment but william is the fish began archie do as i tell you sir said william again ill bring the fish for you if i get him archie ran with backward glances across the lawn where he was met by blessington who had observed the accident out of the window and before he could explain half the thrilling things that had happened was undressed and rubbed down and put between blankets and then after a few minutes in came william having also changed his clothes with a great pike and his father followed and shook hands with william and his mother did the same saying things that made william blush and stand first on one foot and then on the other murmuring it was nothing at all my lady and archie asked if he and william might go out again that afternoon and catch another pike then in came his younger sister jeannie who was only two years his senior she appeared to be on the point of crying and she flung her arms round archies neck in an uncomfortable sort of way and archie told her she was messing him after that in reaction from those thrilling affairs he felt suddenly tired and being encouraged to go to sleep nestled down in the blankets and woke up to find that there was his fish stuffed for dinner and for himself and william an era of unexampled popularity archie did not understand at the time why he had suddenly blossomed into such favouritism unless it was for having clung tight to his fathers fishingrod but he enjoyed it immensely it was pleasant too not long afterwards to be given a gold watch by his father to present to william with a gold chain provided by his mother and william permitted him to put the gold watch into one waistcoat pocket and the end of the gold chain into the other and his father and mother and jeannie all shook hands with william again every one seemed to be spending their time in shaking hands with william so archie since william was his friend more than anybody elses kissed him in order to mark the difference between himself and other people with regard to him he was surprised to find that william had got a soft cheek like his mothers and supposed that mens faces grew hard as they grew older he instantly mentioned this surprising fact and william appeared rather glad to leave the room but in all archies life no event ever occurred which approached the splendour and public magnificence of this whole experience every day the world widened and lying looking at the green light on the ceiling in the cool still mornings of that summer which seemed to last for years and years archie found himself not only speculating on what fresh joys the day would bring but joining together in his mind the happenings that at the time seemed disconnected but which proved to be part of a continuous thread of existence just as the nursery passage and the steep stairs and his fathers room and the lawn and the lake passed from being isolated phenomena into pieces of a whole so things that happened proved to be the experiences of the person who was known to others as archie morris and to archie as himself sometimes he so tingled with vigour when he woke that contrary to orders he stepped out of bed and leaned out of the window to look at the bright dewy world with one ear alert to hear blessingtons foot along the passage in order to leap back into bed again for now he had the nightnursery to himself and blessington slept next door at that hour the lawn would be covered with a shimmering grey mantle pearlcoloured and here and there a few diamonds had got in by mistake which shone with just the brilliance of his mothers necklace perhaps these were the bedclothes of the lawn and when day came they were covered over by the green bedspread like that which lay on his own bed the lake away to the right had different bedclothes thicker ones but of the same colour no doubt they were thicker because the lake was colder for on some mornings he could not see through them at all to the left out of the window rose the wood where the rabbits lived sometimes one of them an early riser like archie would have found a gap in the netting and was out on the lawn nibbling the grass the gardener did not approve of that for the lawn it appeared belonged to the people who lived in archies house and not to the folk in the wood and this was a trespass on the part of the rabbits for which the punishment rather a severe one was death by shooting this had added a new terror to the notice in another wood where he and blessington sometimes walked which announced that trespassers would be prosecuted blessington was foolhardy enough to disregard that notice altogether saying that it was his daddys notice and didnt apply to them but for some time archie never chose that walk for fear that blessington might be wrong about it and that they would meet somebody in the wood who would instantly shoot them both for trespassing but in childish fashion he kept those terrors to himself sooner than enquire about them till one day they actually did meet in that wood a man with a gun then in a sudden wild terror archie clung to blessington crying out oh ask him not to shoot us this time eh darling said blessington whos going to shoot us its only one of your daddys keepers no but he will shoot us screamed archie were trespassers and hell shoot us like the rabbits matters being thereupon explained and archie convinced that he and blessington were not going to be shot for trespassing he found that he could make up for himself an entrancing story of how master rabbit and his nurse who were good never trespassed on the lawn and that the rabbits he saw there corresponded to grandmamma tintagel and so he did not care whether they were shot or not these stories which he told himself in the early morning looking out on to the lawn or lying curled up on his back in bed looking at the green ceiling were not vague dreamlike imaginings but were endowed with a vividness that made blessingtons entry with his bath and his clothes seem less real than they it became impossible indeed for him to disentangle reality as judged by people like his father and the gardener from imagination he told himself so strongly that there was grandmamma tintagel sitting on the lawn trespassing and nibbling grass for her breakfast that her presence there or her absence when there was no trespassing rabbit became things as vivid as his subsequent dressing and breakfast had he been definitely asked if he believed it was grandmamma tintagel he would have said no but in his imaginative life so hard for a child to dissociate from his real life there was no question as to her identity it happened also that at this time his mother was reading to him the realest of all books namely alice in wonderland no imaginative boy of five could possibly doubt the actual existence of the white rabbit in that convincing history and archie would not have been surprised if one morning there had proved to be a white rabbit sitting by the fence who looked at his watch and put on his gloves yet he never spoke of this possibility even to blessington or william it did not belong to the sphere of things about which it was reasonable to converse to grownup people simply because they were stupid about certain matters and would not understand him the fact that grandmamma tintagel sometimes sat on the lawn in the early morning was among the topics which he kept quite completely to himself there were other such topics sometimes when he lay in bed waiting for blessington to call him and did not choose to get up and look out of the window it was because these other secret affairs engaged him if he lay still and stared at the greenhued ceiling curious waves of shadow appeared to pass over it and it seemed like that sunny floor of water that had closed above his head on the morning when he fell out of the boat there was he lying in bed deep below some surface of liquid light that cut him off from the outer world and he wondered if in a moment a splayed starfish of arms and legs which turned out to be william would dive down for him and bring him up among the common things again but william never made this impressive entry through the ceiling and if he stared long enough archie only seemed to himself to slip down and down gently and rapturously through deep water and another world the world of hidden things that dwelt below the surface came slowly into existence like as when on mounting a slope fresh valleys and hillsides arise and unfurl themselves only in this case you had to go down somewhere inside yourself to become aware of them and something some inner consciousness recognized and hailed them it was not that he was getting sleepy and sinking into the waters of dreams rather the experience was the result of a more vivid life and awakened perceptions but he never got further than that and during the day he was far too busy with the affairs of normal life to trouble about those perceptions that dawned on him on still quiet mornings when he lay abed and stared at the ceiling with its flickering green lights and moving shadows chapter ii archies birthday was in november and for a day or two before that tremendous annual event there was always a certain atmosphere of mystery abroad which he was conscious of at odd minutes he met marjorie on the morning of the day before he would be six walking down the nursery passage with a parcel in her hand the contents of which she would not divulge that afternoon too his mother drove into the neighbouring town in the motor and would not take him with her on the excuse that she had some shopping to do though it was the commonest thing in the world for her to take him with her when she went shopping this year he vaguely connected these odd happenings with his birthday as he did also the fact that a week ago blessington had brought a total stranger into the nursery who had very politely asked him to take off his coat the stranger had then knelt down on the floor in front of him and had produced a tape with which he proceeded to measure archie all over from his hip to his knee and his knee to his ankle and round his waist and round his chest and all along his arms making notes of those things in a book blessington had told him that mr johnson wanted to see how much he had grown which was certainly a very gratifying attention especially since archie had grown a good deal and was extremely proud of the fact mr johnson congratulated him too and said that he himself hadnt grown as much as that for many a year and tried to account for his visit on general grounds of interest in archie but in spite of that archie connected this call with his birthday though he did not arrive at the deduction that it meant clothes his mother came up to tea in the nursery on her return from her mysterious drive and said that she had just caught sight of the fairy abracadabra as she drove down the high street she had not known that abracadabra was in the neighbourhood she asked archie if abracadabra had called while she was out and archie after a moments pause said that he hadnt seen her but in that pause something of the glory faded out of the bright trailing clouds when he was asked that directly he did not feel sure whether he believed in abracadabra in the same way in which he believed in blessington or jeannie so short a time agolast summer onlyalice in wonderland and the identity of grandmamma tintagel had been so much realler than the paltry happenings that took place in the light of common day now quite suddenly and unexpectedly at the mere question as to whether he had seen abracadabra they all began to fade indeed it was more than fading it was as if they passed out of sight behind a corner archie had been told that he must never if he could help it hurt peoples feelings the particular occasion when that had been brought home to him was when his sister jeannie had to wear a rather delightful sort of band round her front teeth which showed a tendency to grow crooked she was shy about it and hoped nobody saw it and when archie called the attention of the public to it she turned very red he had not had the least intention of embarrassing her for he thought the band rather nice himself and would have liked to have had one had his teeth been sufficiently advanced for such a decoration but on this occasion he saw instantly and clearly that he must not hurt his mothers feelings by expressing scepticism about abracadabra perhaps his mother still believed in her herself though there were difficulties about supposing that seeing that if abracadabra was not abracadabra she was certainly his mother but in any case she thought archie believed in abracadabra which made quite sufficient reason for his appearing to do so if abracadabra was an invention designed to awe delight and mystify him the most elementary obligation of not embarrassing other people enjoined on him that he must be awed delighted and mystified perhaps by next year something would have happened to abracadabra for nowadays she only made her appearance on his birthday whereas he could remember when she paid jeannie also a birthday visit but this year she had not come on jeannies birthday and the various members of the family had given her birthday presents themselves which did not happen when abracadabra came for she was the chief dispenser of offerings so archie replied that abracadabra had not been during his mothers absence and in order to spare his mother the mortification of knowing that he had doubts about that benevolent fairy laid himself out to ask intelligent questions why didnt you speak to her mummy he said when you saw her in the high street because she was in a hurry she went by like a flash of lightning in her pearl chariot was there any thunder asked he yes just one clap but that might have been the wheels of the chariot what do you think shell bring you archie was holding his mothers hand and slipping her rings up and down her fingers as he held it he suddenly became aware what one of these presents would be a clockwork train he said quickly he knew more than that about the clockwork train he felt perfectly certain that it was in his mothers bedroom at this moment reposing in the big cupboard where she kept her dresses do you want a clockwork train she asked yes mummy frightfully said he feeling that he was playing a part for he knew his mother knew that he wanted a clockwork train what else oh thousands of things particularly a pen that writes without your dipping it in the ink well if i were you i should write down all the things you want and leave the paper lying on your counterpane when you go to sleep whatll that do asked archie its the fairypost instead of putting letters into boxes to be posted when you want them to reach the fairies you have always to put them on your bed mind you address it to her fairy majesty the empress abracadabra then when the fairies come round to collect the post they will find it there and take it to abracadabra and perhaps if she comes tomorrowlet me see it must be a year since she was hereshe will bring a few things for your birthday i cant tell but i think that is the best chance of getting them certainly this seemed a very pleasant sort of plan archie had never heard of it before and the extremely matteroffact tone in which his mother spoke lit again a dawning hope in his mind that perhaps it was all true why shouldnt be a fairy abracadabra and a fairypost just as there had been and now was no longer a glassy sea between the rugs in the hall and snarling tigers to keep off his enemies if you believed a thing enough it became real with a few trifling exceptionsas for instance when on one of the days last summer a day crammed full of the most delightful events archie had found himself firmly believing that that particular day was never coming to an end true it had come to an end but that perhaps was because he hadnt believed strongly enough there was a lovely story which his mother had read him about a man called joshua who wanted a day to remain until he had killed all his enemies and sure enough the sun stood still until he had accomplished that emphatic task he never doubted that because it came out of the bible and in the spirit of joshua he set himself now to believe in abracadabra and the fairypost and with that in his mind he kept his eyes firmly away from the cupboard where his mother kept her dresses that evening when her maid opened it lest he should see there the parcel which he felt secretly convinced was there and contained the clockwork train which his mother had bought and which abracadabra would tomorrow assuredly bring out of the basket of pure gold with which she habitually travelled archie put the letter for the fairypost on his bed and determined to keep awake so that he should see the fairy postman come for it it was a very cold night and a big fire burned in his grate so that though the windows as usual were all open there was a clear brisk warmth about the room and a frosty and soapy smell for his bright brown hair had been washed that nightthis was a special evening bathnight for by now baths had been promoted to the morningand stuck up all over his head in a novel and independent manner blessington had dried it by the fire for him with hot towels and a very extraordinary thing had happened for when she brushed it afterwards it gave forth little cracklings which she told him was electricity which was the thing that made the lamps burn she had allowed him to take a brush to bed with him and make more cracklings for five minutes until she returned to put his light out and archie made a wonderful story to himself as he looked at the fire that he would get an electric lamp and paste it to his head so that he should be able to read by the light of his hair all at once this seemed so feasible so easy of belief that he pictured to himself everybody walking about the house in the evening lit by themselves and then william came round the corner he did not know what corner carrying an electric pike for a birthday present to himself and when blessington stole in five minutes afterwards archies brush had slipped from his fingers and his breath came evenly between his parted lips there was a gap in his front teeth because a tooth had come out only today embedded in a piece of toffy he was eating which had made archie squeal with laughter for here was a new substance called toothtoffee and blessington softly lifted his arm and laid it under the bedclothes without awaking him and looked at him a moment with her old face beaming with love and put down on his chair out of sight at the bottom of his bed the new sailorsuit and took away the note to her fairy majesty the empress abracadabra archie woke next morning and instantly remembered that he had attained the magnificent age of six six had long seemed to him one of the most delightful ages to be eighteen was another mainly because william was eighteen but six was the best of all for at eighteen you must inevitably feel that you have lived your life and that there is nothing much left to live for for the rest would be but a slow descent into the vale of years but today he was six and it was his birthday and and there was no sign of the letter he had written to abracadabra on his counterpane but it might have slipped on to the floor and not have been taken away by fairies after all or it might have slipped over the bottom of the bed and archie got up to see no there was no note there but on the chair at the foot of his bed was a suit of sailorclothes archie gave a gasp certainly their presence there constituted a possibility that they were for him but he hardly dared let himself contemplate so dazzling a prospect for fear it should be whisked out of sight yet who could they be for if not for him they couldnt be blessingtons for she was a female and wore mysterycloaking skirts sailorsuits were boys clothes harry travers the son of a neighbouring squire aged eight had a sailorsuitit was the thing that archie most envied about that young man harry had taken the coat and trousers off one day in the summer when the two boys were playing in the copse by the lower end of the lake and had let archie put them on for three minutes that had been a thrilling adventure it implied undressing out of doors which was a very unusual thing to do and he loved the feeling of the rough serge down his bare calves he had of course offered harry the privilege of putting on his knickerbockers and jacket if he could get into them without splitting them but harry from that pisgahsummit of eight years had no desire to go back to the childish things of the land of bondage but had danced about barelegged while archie enjoyed his three minutes in these voluminous and grownup lendings and now perhaps for him too not for three minutes only but for every day and he took a leap back into bed again as blessingtons tread sounded on the boards outside archie pretended to be asleep for he wanted to be awakened by blessington and hear his birthday greetings he loved the return of consciousness in the morningwhen he had not already been awake and speculating about grandmamma tintagel on the lawnto find blessington with her hand on his shoulder gently stirring him and her face close to his whispering to him eh its time to get up so this morning not for the first time he simulated sleep in order to recapture that lovely sense of being awakened by love you must understand that he did not put it to himself like that for archie just at the age of six was not a mature and selfconscious prig but he wanted to know what blessingtons greeting to him would be when she thought she woke him up on the morning of his sixth birthday from the narrow chink of his eyelids not quite closed he could see some of her movements she took the exciting suit of sailorclothes from the bottom of his bed and laid it on the chair where she always put his clothes with a flannel shirt of a quite unusual shape and his socks on top already archie had heartburnings at the knowledge of his knowledge of the sailorsuit blessington meant it to be a surprise to him and a surprise he determined it should be in the interval there was another surprise how would blessington wake him she would be sure to rise to the immense importance of the occasion she moved quietly about she shut the windows and brought in his bath and then she came close up to his bed he felt her hand stealing underneath the bedclothes to his shoulder and she shook it gentlyeh master six she said oh she had done exactly the right thing she had divined archie as he had divined himself knowing himself that was just the only thing to think about this morning he ceased to imagine blessington out of her simplicity of love had given the real birthday greeting he rolled a little sideways and there was her face close to his and her hand still underneath his bedclothes he put up both of his hands and caught it many happy returns said blessington wake up my darling its your birthday happy returns she repeated archie released her hand and flung his arm round her neck oh blessington isnt it fun he said what did you do when you were six i got up directly said blessington kissing him and had my bath and put my clothes on now will you do the same for im going downstairs for ten minutes and then i shall be back all right said archie she went out and archie again as with the question of abracadabra last night felt he must make it a surprise that there were sailorclothes on his chair it was quite likely that he would not be supposed to notice them at once and so he stripped off his nightshirt and took his bath in the prescribed manner he had to lie down on the floor first of all and wave his legs about then he had to stand upright still with no clothes on and put his hands each side of his waist and wave his body about eight times in each direction then he was allowed to pour out the hot water into his bath in order to encourage himself but before he stepped into that delicious steamy warmth he had to bend down eight times with a long frosty expulsion of breath and stand up eight times with a great draught of cold air in his lungs all this had been explained to him by a strangernot mr johnsonwho a year ago had come into his nursery and had been very much interested in his anatomy archie understood that this was a doctor though he didnt give him any medicine but had merely showed him how to do these things after first putting a sort of plug on archies chest which communicated with two other plugs that the stranger put in his ears then archie had to say ninetynine several times which seemed to be a sort of game though it didnt lead any further the doctor for instance didnt say a hundred and then he had to promise to practise those contortions every morning all this was done and archie fled from the cold of the morning to his bath the water was of that divinest temperature so that when he stopped still it was lovely but when he moved he almost screamed with the rapturous heat of it it cooled a little as he sat in it and still remembering that he was six he poured a spongefull down his spine that over he might wash his face and his neck and well behind his ears with soap up till a few months ago blessington had always superintended the bath and done these things for him but now he did them for himself as agent with blessington as inspectorgeneral in the background who might always make the strictest scrutiny into the place behind the ears and the toenails to see that the effects of the bath were perfectly satisfactory if not blessington superintended again for the next three mornings so archie was very careful since it was so much grander to wash oneself than to be washed by anybody else then came the most exciting part of the bath for close at the side of it was a big tin full of the coldest possible water he had then to stand up in his bath and after washing his face in the cold water to put cold water everywhere within reach of him on one arm and then the other on a chest on a stomach on one leg and on another right down to the foot and finally a vocal piece to squeeze a full sponge down his back archie squealed at this and flew for a towel he flung himself into his new clothes and was already halfdressed when blessington returned oh blessington he said look at me and theyre just as easy to manage as the old ones and may i go to see harry after breakfast and show him master harry will be here for tea said blessington yes but i want him to know sooner than that did they come just ordinarily like other clothes or are they a birthday present well i should say they were a birthday present said blessington who from demanded archie and then suddenly he guessed oh blessington he said i like them better than anything he said well dear and i wish you health to wear them and strength to tear them she said eh but how youre disarranging my cap archie promptly handselled his clothes by spilling egg on the coat and breadandbutter upside down on the trousers and when the time came for him to make his public entry into the world was seized with a sudden fit of shyness at the thought of anybody seeing him the housemaid would stare and william would laugh and marjorie would pretend not to know him and for the moment of leaving the daynursery which from this morning was to be known as archies sittingroom he would almost have wished himself back in his knickerbockers but the remembered rough touch of the serge on his legs provided encouragement and soon the new glories burst upon a sympathetic and not a mocking world they were at breakfast downstairs and archie though he had already had his was bidden by his father to have a cup of coffee which he poured out himself at the sidetable and to drink it slowly and at the bottom of it among the melted sugar there came to his astonished eyes the gleam of silver and there was a new halfcrown with his fathers happy returns thereafter came a hurried visit to harry a motor drive with his mother and jeannie archie sitting on the boxseat and permitted to blow the bugle practically as often as he wanted and the return to dinner to find that the two things he liked best namely boiled rabbit and spotted dog pudding formed that memorable repast up till now he had received only two birthday presents the clothes and the halfcrown and he could not help feeling that a visit from abracadabra was more than likely since no one else had made the slightest allusion to clockwork trains or pens that wrote without being dipped but in the afternoon as he returned home from his walk with blessington and jeannie in the early dusk he received an impression which was to be more inextricably connected with his sixth birthday than even the sailor suit they were within a few yards of the frontdoor when there ran out of the bushes cyrus the great blue persian cat he held something in his mouth which archie saw to be a bird there he stood for a moment with the gleaming eyes of the successful hunter and twitching tail and then trotted in front of them towards the porch simultaneously jeannie called out oh blessington cyrus has caught a thrush we must get it from him it may be still alive till then archie had only thought about the cleverness of cyrus in catching a bird which was clearly a very remarkable feat since cyrus could only run and climb and a bird could fly but as jeannie spoke he suddenly thought of himself in the jaws of a tiger of the clutch of the long white teeth of the fear and the helplessness and a queer tremor made him catch his breath as there smote upon him an emotion that had never yet been awakened by the passage of his sunny days pity took hold of him for the brighteyed bird it suffered his imagination told him that and never yet had the fact of suffering come home to him they hemmed cyrus in and blessington took the thrush out of his mouth while cyrus growled and struck at her with his paws and then greatly incensed bounded out into the garden again so as not to lose the chance at this cathour of dusk of a further stalk and capture they carried the bird into the hall where they looked at it but it lay quite still in blessingtons hand with its helpless little claws relaxed and with its eyes fast glazing in death its beak was open and on its speckled breast were two oozing drops of blood that stained the feathers eh poor thing its dead said blessington archie felt all the desolation of an unavailing pity no it cant be dead blessington he said itll get all right wont it and his lip quivered no dear its quite dead said blessington but if you like well bury it therell be just time before tea shall i run upstairs and get a box to bury it in without doubt this was a consoling and attractive proposal and while blessington went to get a suitable coffin archie held the small slain body in reverent hands it was warm and soft and still by now the bright eyes had grown quite dull and the blood on the speckled breast was beginning to coagulate and once again even with the novel prospect of a birdfuneral in front of him archies heart melted in pity why did cyrus kill it jeannie he said the thrush hadnt done any harm cats do kill birds said jeannie same as birds kill worms or you and william kill worms when you go out fishing yes but worms arent birds said archie worms arent nice they dont fly and sing its an awful shame blessington returned with a suitable cardboard box which had held chocolates and into this fragrant coffin the little limp body was inserted this certainly distracted archie from his newfound emotion oh that will be nice for it he said it will smell the chocolate it cant its dead said hopeless jeannie but blessington understood better yes dear the chocolate will be nice for it she said and then well cover it up with leaves and put the lid on oh and may it have a crisa crisantepum said archie may i pick one yes just one archie laid this above the birds head and the lid was put on oh and lets have a procession to the toolshed to get a trowel said jeannie yes squealed archie now thoroughly immersed in the fascinating ritual and ill carry the coffin and go first and you and blessington shall walk behind and sing well we must be quick said blessington no not quick said jeannie its a funeral what shall we sing oh anything the walrus and the carpenter thats sad because the oysters were dead so to the moving strains the procession headed across the lawn and found a trowel in the toolshed and excavated a grave underneath the laurestinus the coffin was once more opened to see that the thrush was quite comfortable and then deposited in its sepulchre and the earth filled in above it but archie felt that the ceremony was still incomplete ought we to say a prayer jeannie he said no its only a thrush archie considered a moment i dont care he said i shall all the same he took off his sailor cap and knelt down closing his eyes god bless the poor thrush he said goodnight thrush i cant think of anything more amen say amen jeannie amen said jeannie and do get up from that damp earth dear said blessington and lets see who can run the fastest back to the house blessington ran the least fast and archie tripped over a croquethoop and so jeannie won and very nearly began telling her mother about it all before archie arrived but though breathless he shrilly chipped in and then i picked a crisantepum and we had a procession across the lawn and made a lovely grave by the toolhouse and i said prayers though jeannie told me you didnt have prayers for thrushes mummy when i grow up may i be a clergyman why dear dont they have lots of funerals pooh thats the undertaker said jeannie besides i did say amen archie i know but mummy why did cyrus kill the thrush why did he want to hurt it and kill it that was the part i didnt like and i expect the thrush hated it wasnt it cruel of him but if he kills another may we have another funeral he stood still a moment cudgelling his small brain in order to grasp exactly what he felt the poor thrush he said i wish cyrus hadnt killed it but if its got to be dead i like funerals tea on such solemn occasions as birthday feasts took place for archie not in the nursery but in the drawingroom as better providing the proper pomp he appreciated that and secretly was pleased that harry travers should be ushered by william into the drawingroom and have the door held open for him and be announced as mr travers with that streak of snobbishness common to almost all small boys archie thought it rather jolly without swaggering at all to be able to greet his friend in the midst of these glories so that he could see their splendour for himself in other ways he would have perhaps preferred the nursery and certainly would have done so when the moment came for him to cut his birthdaycake for the sugar on the side of it cracked and exploded as such confectionery will do when archie hewed his way down that white perpendicular cliff and a number of fragments falling on the floor he had to stand quite still knife in hand till william got a housemaids brush and scoop and removed the debris for fear it should be trodden into the carpet marjorie had not appeared at tea at all and when this sumptuous affair was over jeannie and harry and archie gathered round lady davidstow on the hearthrug with a box of chocolates planted at a fair and equal distance between them and she told them the most delicious story about a boy whose mother had lost his birthdays so that year after year went by without his having a birthday at all the lights had been put out and only the magic of leaping firelight guided their hands to the chocolatebox and every moment the phantasy of the story got more and more interwoven with the reality of the chocolates eventually while the birthdayless boys mother was clearing out the big cupboard underneath the stairs she came across all his birthdays put away in a purple box with a gold lock on it was it the cupboard underneath the stairs in the hall here asked archie for questions were permitted yes there they all were eight birthdays in all so he had one every day for more than a week my dears whats that it certainly was very startling a noise like a mixture between the chinese gong and the bell for the servants dinner broke in upon the quiet with the most appalling clamour archie swallowed a chocolate whole and harry with great prudence took two more in a damp hand to sustain him in these rather alarming occurrences it sounds as if it was in the hall said lady davidstow harry will you open the door and see what it is yes ill go he said firmly butbut shant archie come too the noise ceased as suddenly as it had begun and with a pleasing sense of terror the two boys went to the drawingroom door and opened it but its quite dark said archie oh mummy what is happening i cant think i only know one person who makes a noise the least like that oh is it abracadabra asked archie excitedly finding that his scepticism of the day before had vanished like smoke it had occurred to him that abracadabra was his mother but here was his mother telling them stories well the only time i ever heard her sneeze it was just like that said lady davidstow archie came running back shrieking with laughter and what does she do when she blows her nose he asked the words were hardly out of his mouth when a piercing trumpetblast sounded and his mother got up she did it then she whispered what had we better do shall we go into the hall she would like us to be there to meet her perhaps if shes coming she went to the door followed by the children and they all looked out into the black hall the woodfire in the hearth there had died down to a mere smoulder of red which sent its illumination hardly farther than the stone fendercurb but theres something there said lady davidstow in an awestruck whisper theres something sitting in the chair oh mummy said archie coming close to her i dont think i like it im sure theres nothing to be frightened at archie said she which of us shall go and see what it is there was no volunteer for this hazardous job for now with eyes more accustomed to the faint light they could all see that it was not something there but somebody the outlines of a head of a body of legs all clothed in black could be seen and somebody sat there perfectly still then all of a sudden the gong and the bell and the trumpet broke out into a clamour fit to wake the dead the great chandelier in the hall flared into light and the black figure sprang up throwing its darkness behind it and there glittering with silks and gems and gold and the flowers of fairyland stood abracadabra she had on a huge pokebonnet which cast a shadow over her face and left it terrifyingly vague her bonnet was trimmed with sunflowers and lilies of the valley and round the edge of it went a row of diamonds which were quite as big as the drops in a glass chandelier another necklace of the same brilliance went round her throat and rested on a crimson satin bodice covered with gold from her shoulders sprang spangled wings and from below her skirt with its garlands of roses were silver shoes with diamond buckles in her hand she carried a blue wand hung with bells and by her side was a clothesbasket such was its shape made of gold she stamped her foot with rage heres a nice welcome lady davidstow she said in a thin cracked voice i sneezed to show i was coming and when i got through the keyhole i found the hall dark and no one to receive me how dare you lady davidstow advanced with faltering steps and fell on her knees oh your majesty forgive me she said why should i forgive you squeaked the infuriated fairy why shouldnt i take you away in my basket and put you in the tower of toads archie gasped he would have given much for a touch of yesterdays scepticism but he couldnt find an atom of it the thought of his mother being whisked off to the tower of toads was insupportable oh please dont he said and who is that asked abracadabra archie almost wished he hadnt spoken and took hold of jeannie on one side and harry on the other its me its archie he said and you dont want me to take your ridiculous mother away she asked no please dont said archie very well as its your birthday i wont instead ill make her extra ladyinwaiting on my peacockstaircase and mistress of my tortoiseshell robes oh mummy that will be lovely for you said archie remembering that his mother was something of the kind to somebody already then there came the giving of presents with the surprises that occurred during such processes archie was told to advance and put his hand in the left far corner of the golden basket and as he prepared to do so abracadabra sneezed so loudly that he fled back to the bottom stair of the staircase where they had been all commanded to sit there was a tennis racquet for harry but the lights all went out when he had just reached the clothesbasket and abracadabra blew her nose so preposterously that his ear sang with it afterwards there was a great parcel for lady davidstow as big as a football which was found to contain when all the paper was stripped off nothing more than a single acid drop in order to teach the mistress of the tortoiseshell robes better manners when her mistress came to pay a visit and blessington summoned from the nursery was presented with a new cap but the bulk of the gifts as was proper was for archie a clockwork train and a pen that needed no dipping and a fishingrod and a second suit of sailorclothes and then the light went out again and abracadabra began sneezing and blowing her nose with such deafening violence that the screen which stood just behind her rocked with the concussion and the children at the suggestion of the mistress of the tortoiseshell robes groped their way back into the drawingroom with their presents and shut the door till abracadabra was better and when from the cessation of these awful noises they conjectured she might be better and ventured out into the hall again that audiencechamber was just as usual and archies father came out of his room looking vexed and asking what that beastly noise was about but when he heard it was abracadabra who had gone away again he was greatly upset and said that it wasnt a beastly noise at all but the loveliest music he had ever heard then came bedtime and archie still excited said his prayers with a special impromptu clause for abracadabra and another for the thrush which he suddenly remembered again and then lay staring at the fire with his hands clasped round his knees as his custom was certainly abracadabra had been wonderfully real today and certainly she was not his mother then he recollected that marjorie had not appeared at all and wondered if marjorie perhaps was abracadabra or if the thrush was abracadabra of cyrus and his hands relaxed their hold on his knees and when blessington came in he did not know that she kissed him and tucked the bedclothes up under his chin chapter iii archie did not often come into contact with miss schwarz his sisters governess she was not a person to be lightly encountered sometimes if blessington was busy he and jeannie went out for their walk with his eldest sister and miss schwarz and on these occasions miss schwarz and marjorie would talk together in an unknown guttural tongue very ugly to hear which archie vaguely understood was german and the sort of thing that everybody spoke in the country to which miss schwarz went for her holiday at midsummer and christmas that uncouth jargon full of such noises as you made when you cleared your throat was quite unintelligible and it seemed odd that marjorie should converse in it when she could speak ordinary english but it somehow seemed to suit miss schwarz who had a sallow face prominent teeth and cold grey eyes otherwise he did not often meet her for she led an odd secret existence in his sisters schoolroom breakfasting and having lunch downstairs in the diningroom but eating her evening meal all by herself in the schoolroom she had a black unrustling dress for the day and a black rustling dress for the evening and a necklace of onyx beads which she used to finger with her dry thin hands which reminded archie of the claws of a bird his mother had told him that after christmas he would do his lessons with miss schwarz and this prospect rather terrified him he supposed that miss schwarz would probably teach him in the guttural language that jeannie was beginning to understand too and he had moments of secret terror when he pictured miss schwarz enraged at his not comprehending her striking at him with those clawlike hands he was coming upstairs one evening rather later than usual for his father had been showing him the contents of a cabinet of butterflies and archie enraptured with the gorgeous brilliant creatures had begged to be allowed to wait till the gong rang for dinner on his way upstairs he remembered that he had lent jeannie the pen that wrote without being dipped with which to write her german exercise she had gone to bed early that night with a bad cold and archie recognizing the impossibility of going to sleep without the precious pen in his possession again ran along the passage to the schoolroom where he was likely to find it this might entail a momentary encounter with miss schwarz but the recovery of the pen was essential and he entered miss schwarz had finished her dinner and was sitting by the fire on which steamed a kettle she held a big glass in her hand and was pouring something into it from a bottle there was a high colour in her usually sallow face and as she saw archie she made one of those guttural exclamations what do you want she said and though she spoke english archie noticed that she spoke it in the same thick guttural manner as german archie froze with terror this was quite a new miss schwarz a gleaming eager miss schwarz oh i lent jeannie my pen he stammered i came to look for it but it doesnt matter nonsense that is not why said miss schwarz angrily then she suddenly seemed to take hold of herself ach that sweet little pen you will find it on the table my dear luke and find it and then say goodnight to poor miss schwarz ach i am so ill this evening such a heartburn and i was just about to take the medicine vat makes it better do not tell any one dear archie that poor miss schwarz is ill i wish to troble nobody poor miss schwarz naiver geeve troble if she can elp ach you have your pen goodnight my deear archie fled down the passage to the nursery with terror giving wings to his heels this miss schwarz angry one moment and affectionate and effusive the next was a new and a more awful person than the one he was acquainted with and he felt sure she must be very ill indeed it would be a terrible affair if miss schwarz was found dead in her bed in spite of her medicine just because he had not told anybody that she was ill and so a doctor had not been fetched there would be a burden on his conscience for ever if he did not tell somebody he burst into the nursery with a wild look behind him to make sure that miss schwarz was not following him in her evening rustling dress oh blessington he cried miss schwarz is ill do go and see what is the matter i went to the schoolroom for my pen and she was sitting by the fire all red and angry and then polite mixing her medicine blessington got up from her rockingchair eh ill go and see she said dont tell her i told you said archie nay of course i wont now you begin your undressing and ill be back very soon excited and frightened and yet hugely interested archie stood at the door of his room listening suddenly he heard the sound of miss schwarzs voice raised almost to a scream then there came the crash of a glass and the ringing of a bell while still miss schwarzs voice gabbled on shrill and guttural trembling and yet unable to resist the call of his curiosity he stole to the corner of the nursery passage and saw william come upstairs and go along to the schoolroom then blessington came out and instead of coming back to the nursery she went downstairs and presently his father came up again with her he too went along the schoolroom passage and suddenly as if a tap had been turned off the shrill voice ceased once for a moment it broke out again and as suddenly stopped and then came the very odd sight of miss schwarz being led along the landing to her room by his father and blessington blessington and miss schwarz entered together his father went downstairs after a moments conversation with william and presently william came along the landing towards the nursery oh william whats happened said archie is miss schwarz very ill well she aint very well said william lumme what does that mean asked archie it dont mean anything particular master archie will miss schwarz be better in the morning asked archie lord yes theyre always better in the morning though they dont feel so now blessington wont be back yet awhile so im to look after you and see you safe to bed suddenly the thought of lying helpless in bed with no blessington next door and the possibility of miss schwarz guessing that archie had told of her illness filled him with awful apprehension she might come screaming down the passage with her clawlike hands starving for archies face oh william dont leave me till blessington comes back he entreated no sir of course i wont there let me undo your shoes for you youve got the laces in a knot and she wont hurt blessington either asked archie bless you no sir said william and theres your nightshirt now jump into bed and ill open the windows william put out the light and archie with a delicious sense of security seeing him seated by the fire dozed off once just before he got fairly to sleep an awful vision of miss schwarzs red face came across the field of his closed eyelids and he started up but in a moment william was by him its all right sir he said im on the look out there was a decided air of mystery concerning miss schwarz next morning she was better but she remained unseen and nobody would answer any questions about her but in the afternoon archie met walter and the odd man carrying her luggage downstairs and he gleaned the information that she was going away and again later in the day archie saw a housemaid coming out of her bedroom with a basket full of her medicinebottles and he drew the conclusion that she must have been ill a long time without anybody knowing not a syllable of news could he obtain from anybody and as the image of miss schwarz faded now that her dark illomened presence was withdrawn there was left in archies mind no more than a general sense of some connection between screaming voices red faces indistinct utterance and the drinking of yellow medicine out of a large glass instead of the usual small one there was a pleasant holiday sense for a few days after the departure of miss schwarz for marjorie took jeannies and archies lessons which made a perfect festival of learning but immediately almost came the ominous news that a new governess was coming next day archie believed that miss schwarz was a typical specimen of the genus governess who were all probably in league together and that some colleague of miss schwarzs bent on avenging her would render his own security a very precarious matter it was indeed some consolation to know that miss bampton was a personal friend of his mothers and was not a regular governess at all but was just going to stay at lacebury and teach lessons yet archie wondered when he went downstairs on the morning after her arrival whether he would not detect under the guise of his mothers friend some secret agent of miss schwarz jeannie had lately been promoted to have breakfast with the rest of the family and as archie opened the door he heard a burst of laughter there was miss schwarzs secret agent sitting next his father and she it must have been who had made them all laugh for she was not laughing herself and archie already knew that a joke was laughed at most by the people who hadnt made it she was a little roundabout person with blue eyes and a short nose and pincenez and she got up as he entered and is this archie she said why i always thought of archie as a baby and heres an ablebodied seaman how are you archie archie stared a moment he reviewed his suspicion about governesses in general but certainly if this plump genial female was a secret colleague of miss schwarz her disguise was of the most ingenious kind but it was as well to be careful im quite well thank you he said and perceiving that a kiss had been intended presented a sideways cheek miss bampton made a sucking sound against it and sat down again well as i was saying she went on the only plan of teaching is the cooperative principle there are such heaps of jolly things to learn that if the girls and i have a meeting as i suggested after breakfast im sure we can find plenty of subjects between us so i summon the meeting for a quarter past ten in the schoolroom archie suddenly felt he was being left out a meeting to discuss what you were going to learn sounded most promising in the way of lessons he ran round to his mothers side oh mummy may i go to the meeting he said you must ask miss bampton said she archie stifled his sense of distrust for he wanted tremendously to go to a meeting where you settled what you were going to learn he hated lessons in the ordinary acceptation of that term with their tiresome copybooks in which he had to write the same moral maxim all down the page and the stupid exercisecalled french lessonin which he had to address himself to a cat and say in french of a cat to a cat with the female cat with the male cat and a thing called geography which was a brown book with lists of countries and capital towns in it but cooperative lessons though he had no idea what cooperation meant sounded far more attractive may i come to the meeting miss bampton he said yes my dear of course said miss bampton if your mother will let you thereupon there dawned for archie a great light hitherto his lessons had been conducted by his mother with occasional tuition from his father and they had always made the impression that they were tasks not difficult in themselves but dull he had learned the various modes of access in french to male and female cats he had grasped the fact that rome and not berlin was the capital of italy and paris not vienna the capital of france but these pieces of information were mere disconnected formulae lessons in other words which had to be learned and which if imperfectly learned caused him to be called lazy or inattentive in the same way the fact that he had to write in a laborious round hand all down the page to be good is to be happy meant nothing more than the necessity of filling the page without a plethora of blots or erasures but from the date of this exciting meeting on cooperative learning a whole new horizon dawned on him it was settled at once that he was to do his lessons with miss bampton and from that moment they ceased to be lessons at all instead of the lists of countries and capitals to be learned by heart there was provided a jigsaw puzzle of the map of europe and italy became a leg and foot perpetually kicking sicily and rome the button through which italys bootlace passed and instead of the dreary copybook maxims heading each page miss bampton in a hand quite as perfect as mr darnells wrote the most stimulating sentiments on the top of each blank leaf he would not sit down so we bit him was one and archie with the tip of his tongue at the corner of his mouth an attitude which is almost indispensable to roundhand orthography was filled with delightful conjectures as to who the person was who would not sit down and who were those tigerish people who bit him in consequence and then miss bampton had the most delightful plans of where lessons might be done one day when it was snowing hard she conceived the brilliant plan of doing lessons in the motor in the garage which gave the most extraordinary stimulus to the proceedings for early english history was the lesson that morning and so she and archie and jeannie were royal anglosaxons specially invited to come in their coach to the coronation of william the conqueror and it would never do if at the coronation banquet afterwards he asked them questions about their ancestors and they didnt know another day when the sun shone frostily and the lawn was covered with hoarfrost they wrapped themselves up in furs and worked at geography as laplanders in the summerhouse marjorie was too old to need such spurs to industry but miss bampton had enticing schemes for her also giving her verse translations of heine and goethe and encouraging her to see how near she got to the original when she translated them back into their native tongue the christmas holidays looked forward to with such eager expectation in the baleful reign of miss schwarz drew near but now instead of counting the hours till the moment when miss schwarz safe in the motor would blow clawfingered kisses to them the children got up a round robin or rather a triangular robin which marjorie translated into german begging miss bampton to stop with them for the holidays for she was as admirable in playtime as she was over their lessons she told them enchanting stories on their walks and painted for them in real smelly oilpaints the most lovely snowscenes pinewoods laden with whiteness and cottages with red blinds lit from within never had any one such a repertory of games to be played in the long dark hours between tea and bedtime and it was during one of these that archie made a curious discovery the game in question was animal vegetable or mineral one of them thought of anything in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth and the rest by questions answered only by yes or no had to arrive at it on this occasion miss bampton had thought it was known to be animal and not in the house archie was sitting on the floor in the schoolroom leaning against miss bamptons knee he had been staring at the coals holding miss bamptons hand in his when suddenly there came over him precisely the same sensation that he remembered feeling one night years ago when he woke and imagined himself and the nightnursery expanding and extending till they embraced all that existed that sensation throbbed and thrilled through him now and he said oh miss bampton how easy why its the longest tailfeather of the thrush that cyrus killed oh archie dont guess said jeannie its no use just guessing but it is said archie im not guessing i know isnt it miss bampton it certainly was and so by the rules of the game since it had been guessed in under five minutes miss bampton had to think again but now archie tried in vain to recapture the mood that made miss bamptons mind so transparently clear to him he knew what that mood felt like that falling away of the limitations of consciousness that expansion and extension of himself but he could not feel it it would not come by effort on his part it came he must suppose as it chose like a sneeze as christmas drew near another amazing talent of miss bamptons showed itself marjorie had been up to london one day to combine the pains of the dentist with the pleasure of a play and came back with a comforted tooth and the strong desire to act instantly miss bampton rose to the occasion lets get up a play to act to your father and mother on new years night she said oh it would be fun said marjorie but what play could we act ill write you one said miss bampton and write it she did with a speed and a lavishness of plot that would have astonished more deliberate dramatists there was a villain a usurper king miss bampton there was a fairy marjorie there was the rightful and youthful king archie who lived act i in painful squalor in a dungeon attended only by the jailers daughter jeannie who knew his identity and loved him whether he was in a dungeon or on a throne luckily he loved her too anywhere and they were kind to a beggarwoman who turned out to be the fairy and did the rest miss bampton was consigned to the lowest dungeon and everybody else lived happily ever afterwards then came the question of dresses and marjorie rather thoughtlessly exclaimed im sure mother will let me have her abracadabra clothes for the fairy ohi forgot she added remembering that archie was present there was an attempt feeble so archie thought it on the part of miss bampton to explain this away she said that abracadabra kept a suit of birthday clothes in every house she visited archie received the information quite politely said oh i see and remained wholly incredulous his faith in the abracadabra myth had tottered before this was the blow that finally and completely compassed its ruin and it disappeared in the limbo of discredited imaginings like the glassy sea between the rugs in the hall and the snarl of the tigers at his enemies never again would the combined crash of the servants dinnerbell and the chinese gong make him wonder at the magnificence of abracadabras sneezings and when the play arrived at the stage of dressrehearsal it was no shock to see marjorie in abracadabras pokebonnet and bediamonded bodice but it must not be supposed that with the disappearance of those childish illusions the world became in any way duller or less highly coloured to archie it grew on the contrary more and more fairylike the outburst of spring that year filled him with an ecstasy that could best be expressed by running fast and jumping in the air with shouts of joy the unfolding of gummy buds on the horsechestnut by the lake filled him with a rapture all the keener because he could not comprehend it presently the sight of pale green fivefingered leaves weak as newdropped lambs made him race round and round blessington till she got giddy there was a smell of damp earth in the air of young varnished grassblades pushing up among the discoloured and faded foliage of the lawn and for the hard bright skies or the sullen clouds of winter a new and tender blue was poured over the heavens and clouds white as washed fleeces pursued one another aloft even as their shadows bowled over the earth beneath birds began to sing again and sparrows chattering in the ivy pulled straws and twigs about practising for the nestbuilding time which would soon be upon them a purplish mist hung over the birchtrees and soon it changed to a mist of green as the buds expanded violets hidden behind their leaves bedecked the lanesides and one morning the first primrose appeared last year no doubt and in all preceding springs the same things had happened but now for the first time they were significant and penetrated further than the mere field of vision they filled archie with an unreasoning joy anything in the shape of natural history received strong encouragement from lord davidstow as well as anything archie did not fully grasp this that tended to keep him out of doors when his short lessons were done and he and jeannie started this year a series of joint collections certain rules had to be observed flowers that they picked must be duly pressed and mounted on sheets of cartridge paper and their names must be ascertained one birds egg might be taken in the absence of the motherbird from any nest which contained four and must be blown and put in its labelled cell in the eggcabinet but when three specimens of any sort had been collected no more must be acquired that perhaps was the collection archie liked best though the joys of the aquarium ran it close the aquarium was a big breadbowl lined at the bottom with spa and crystals and in it lived caddisworms and watersnails and a daceprobably weak in the head for he had allowed himself to be caught in the landingnet without the least effort to get out of the way he had an inordinate passion for small breadpills in pursuit of which he was so violently active that he often hit his nose against the side of the aquarium so hard that you could positively hear the stunning blow when satiated he would still continue to rush after breadpills but after holding them in his mouth a moment he would expel them again with such force that he resembled some submarine discharging torpedoes then there was the butterfly and moth collection which was of short duration and was abandoned on account of a terrible happening the insects were emptied into the killingbottle and when dead transfixed with a pin and set but one morning archie examining the settingboard to see if they were stiff and ready to be transferred into the corklined boxes found to his horror that so far from being stiff two butterflies a tortoiseshell and a brimstone were alive still with waving antennae and twitching bodies that dreadful incident poisoned the joy of that collection he felt himself guiltier of a worse outrage than cyrus and all blessingtons wellmeant consolations that insects hardly felt anything at all would not induce him to run the risk of committing further atrocities for a day and a night the two had writhed under their crucifixion and that day the caterpillars were released from their breedingcage even including that piece of preciousness the caterpillar of the convolvulus hawk with a horn on his tail and the killingbottle was relegated to the attic the sunday churchgoings for which an intermission had been ordained in consequence of archies infant remarks about the amusingness of the man with the wagging beard had long ago been resumed again and this year he had a sudden attack of spurious and sentimental religion that caused his mother some little anxiety he developed a dreadful conscience and came to her with a serious face and confessed trivial wrongdoings this phase she comforted herself to think occurred in the autumn of this year at a time when there was nothing much to be done in the way of collecting one morning archie came to her with a crime that sorely oppressed him nearly two years ago somebody had sent her a painted easter egg an ostrichs egg adorned with gilt designs of a cross and a crown and some rays which archie had been forbidden to touch i touched it he said i wetted my finger and rubbed it on the crown and some of it came off well dear of course you shouldnt have done it if i had told you not to she said but dont bother about it any more what made you come and tell me so long after archie grew more solemn still i was leaning out of the nurserywindow he said and i heard charles singing a few more years shall roll so i came and told you before i was asleep within the tomb his mother laughed quite as if she was amused well hope therell be more than a few years before that darling she said and shall i be forgiven now ive told you asked archie yes of course dont think anything more about it archie would have preferred a more sentimental treatment of his offence and rather wished his mother bore a stronger resemblance to mrs montgomery in the wide wide world whose edifying tears fell so fast and frequently and after this he tended to keep his misdeeds more to himself and repent of them in secret simultaneously also the copy of the wide wide world which he had discovered in a passage bookcase mysteriously vanished and no one appeared to have the slightest idea where it had gone so unable to stuff himself further with that brand of mawkishness the desire that his mother should be more like mrs montgomery faded somewhat and there seemed but little pleasure in repentance at all if your confessions were received in so unsentimental a manner and it was no fun really keeping them to oneself but for some weeks sunday morning service in church he had expressed a wish to go to evening church as well but his mother had told him that once was as much as was good for him became the emotional centre of his life though his religion was strangely mixed up with a far more mundane attraction there was a particular choirboy there with blue eyes pink cheeks and a crop of yellow curls who sang solos and thrilled archie with a secret and perfectly sexless emotion only last sunday he had sung oh for the wings of a dove and religion and childish adoration together had brought archie to the verge of tears he longed to be good to live until a few more years should roll for he felt that he was going to die young a noble and beautiful life he longed also to fly away and be at rest with the choirboy he made up pathetic scenes in which he should be lying on his deathbed with his weeping family round him and the choirboy would sing to him as he died and they would smile at each other when this vision proved almost too painful for contemplation he would console himself by picturing an alternative scheme in which there were to be no deathbeds at all but instead he would get into the church choir and sit next the choirboy and they would sing duets together before a rapt congregation but adorable though his idol was he did not really want to know him or even find out who he was the idol existed for him in some remote sphere becoming incarnate just for an hour on sunday morning a goldenhaired surpliced voice that suggested the vanished thrills of the wide wide world he pronounced certain words rather oddly and had a slight lisp which archie tried to copy until one day his father told him never to say yeth again or he should write out yes a hundred times then came the most exciting discovery this vocal angel proved to be the son of the headkeeper and it was therefore perfectly easy to make his acquaintance the notion of meeting him face to face of exchanging a goodmorning with him was almost overpowering and yet archie instinctively shrank from bringing the idol into contact with actual life he began to choose for his walk the rather dank and gloomy path that led past the keepers cottage and yet when that abode where the idol lived came within sight archie with beating heart would avert his eyes for fear he should see him then one day as they got opposite the gate a small boy in corduroy knickerbockers with a rather greasy scarf round his neck and a snuffling nose came out and touched his cap there could be no doubt about his identity and archie suffered the first real disillusionment of his life the fading of abracadabra was nothing to this that had been a gradual disillusionment whereas this was sudden as a lightningstroke he was a shattered idol and from that moment archie could hardly recall what it had been about or recapture the faintest sense of the emotion which had filled him before that encounter in the wood which caused it to reel and totter and fall prone from its unsubstantial pedestal this blow on the top of the robust reception of his confession did much to restore archie to the ways of normal boyhood and it was really rather a relief to his mother when his expanding experimenting nature took a very different turn and he became for a time obstreperously naughty she thought quite rightly that this evinced a greater vigour that it undoubtedly did and the imagination contained in some of archies exploits rivalled the more visionary power that constructed deathbed scenes for himself and the idealization cruelly shattered of the choirboy one very dreary november afternoon shortly after his seventh birthday he was sitting alone in his mothers room all day the sullen heavens had poured their oblique deluge on the earth and sheets of water were being flung against the windows by the cold southeasterly gale archie was suffering from a slight cold and had not been out of doors for a couple of days and this unusual detention in the house had caused him to be very cross and also had dammed up within him a store of energy which could not disperse itself innocuously in violent movement jeannie had gone for a motordrive with his mother marjorie and miss bampton were closely engaged over their rotten german and archie that morning had been stingingly rebuked by his father for sliding down the banisters in the hall a mode of progress strictly forbidden blessington had not been less stinging for an hour ago archie had been extremely rude to her and with a dignity that he both respected and resented she had said then ive nothing more to say to you master archie till youve remembered your manners again and had thereupon continued her sewing archie knew he had been rude but his sense of that was not yet strong enough to enable him to apologize though of sufficient energy to make him feel woebegone and neglected he had been allowed by his mother to sit in her room that afternoon when she went out with jeannie and to investigate what was known as her workbox which contained her treasures in earlier days these had been a source of deep delight there was a minute china elephant with a silk palanquin on his back there was a porcupines quill there was a set of dolls teathings a pink umbrella the ferrule of which was a pencil a chain of amber once these had held magic for archie they were mummys treasures and could only be seen on wet afternoons or in hours of toothache but today they appeared to him perfectly rubbishy not a gleam of glamour remained they were as dull as the leaden skies of this interminable afternoon archie lay in the windowseat and wondered that his sailortrousers only a year ago had given him so complete a sense of happiness he rubbed one leg against the other trying to recollect how it was that that rough serge against his bare calf felt so manly he tried to interest himself in alice in wonderland and marvelled that he could have cared about an adventure with a pack of cards he longed to throw the book at the foolish dresden shepherdess that stood on the mantelpiece he supposed there would be trouble if he did that his mother would be vexed but trouble was better than this nothingatall probably it would rain again tomorrow and he would have another day indoors and the thought of nothing happening either today or tomorrow seemed the same as the thought of nothing happening for ever and ever there was a bright fire in the hearth and beyond the steel fender a thick hearthrug of long white sheeps wool suddenly archie remembered the odour that diffused itself when one day a fragment of hot coal flew out of the fire and lodged in this same hearthrug there was a fatty burning smell most curious and simultaneously the wild irresistible desire of doing something positively wicked enthralled him instantly he knew what he was going to do and with set determined face he took the fireshovel in one hand and the tongs in the other and heaped the shovel high with burning coals he emptied them on the hearthrug the smoke of singeing burning wool arose and he took several more lumps of glowing coal from the fireplace and deposited them on the rug then a panic seized him and he tried to stamp the conflagration out but he only stamped the glowing coals more firmly in and though amazed at his audacity he did not really want to extinguish it he wanted something to happen quite deliberately though with cheeks burning with excitement he walked out of the room leaving the door open and simultaneously heard the crunch of the gravel under the wheels of his mothers returning motor he did not wish to see her and went straight to the nightnursery now his exclusive bedroom and locked himself in but he was not in the least sorry for what he had done if anything he wished he had put more coals there nor was he frightened at the thought of possible consequences merely he did not care what happened so long as something happened that he reflected it was pretty certain to do but he made no plans before very long he heard some one turning the handle of his door and he kept quite still then his fathers voice said are you there archie and still he said nothing the voice grew louder and the handle rattled archie open your door immediately said his father not in the least knowing why archie proceeded to do so he still felt absolutely defiant and desperate but for some instinctive reason he obeyed enormous and terrible his father stood before him did you put those coals on your mothers hearthrug asked lord davidstow no said archie then how did you know they were there asked his father archie had something of the joy of the desperate adventurer because i put them there he said then you have lied to me as well yes said archie lord davidstow pointed to the door go downstairs at once he said and wait in my study archie obeyed still not knowing why at the top of the stairs was standing his mother who took a step forward towards him archie my darling she began leave the boy to me said his father who was following him archie marched downstairs still without a tremor it occurred to him that his father was going to kill him as cyrus killed the thrush there was a whispered conversation between his mother and father and he heard his mother say no dont dont and he felt sure that this referred to his being killed but he was quite certain that whatever happened he was not going to say he was sorry he went into his fathers study and shut the door on the table he noticed that there was standing one of miss schwarzs medicinebottles and a syphon beside it and wondered whether miss schwarz had come back but there was no other sign of her in another moment his father entered now you thoroughly deserve a good whipping archie he said you might have burned the house down and if you were a poor boy youd have been put into prison for this but your mother has been pleading for you and if youll say you are sorry and beg her pardon for burning her hearthrug ill let you off just this time well he was not going to be killed but he was going to be whipped archie felt his heart beating small and fast with apprehension but he was not sorry and did not intend to say he was well said his father im not sorry said archie ill give you one more chance said his father moving towards a cupboard above one of the bookcases im not sorry said archie again his father opened the cupboard lock the door he said but before he could lock it it was opened from without and his mother entered his father had already a cane in his hand and he turned round as she came in she looked at him and then at miss schwarzs medicinebottle on the table go away marion he said im going to give the boy a lesson she pointed at the bottle you had better learn yours first she said never mind that archie says hes not sorry it is my duty to teach him suddenly archie felt tremendously interested he had no idea what all this was about or what his fathers lesson was but he felt he was in the presence of some drama apart from his own it was with a sense of the interruption of this that he saw his mother turn to him archie my dear she said you have vexed and grieved me very much supposing i had felt wicked and had burned you stylograph pen shouldnt i be sorry for having injured you and arent you sorry for having burned my hearthrug what had i done to deserve that hadnt i given you leave to sit in my room and look at my treasures why did you hurt me immediately the whole affair wore a different aspect instead of anger and justice there was the sound of love his heart melted and he ran to her oh mummy i didnt mean to vex you he cried i didnt think of that you hadnt done anything beastly to me he burst into tears oh mummy forgive me he said i dont mind being whipped at least not much but im sorry i beg your pardon please stop my allowance till ive paid for it yes dear its only right that you should pay some of it you shall have no more allowance for three weeks now go straight upstairs and go to bed till i come to you and tell you that you may get up and blessington tells me you have been rude to her go and beg her pardon first the effect of this episode on archies mind was that his mother understood and his father didnt the prospect of a whipping had not made him falter in his resolve not to say he was sorry so long as he wasnt sorry but the moment his mother had put his misdeeds in a sensible light he saw them sensibly and would not have minded being whipped if by that drastic method he could have borne witness to the reality of his sorrow but only three days later he received six smart cuts with that horrible cane for climbing on to the unparapetted roof of the house out of his bedroom window which he had been expressly forbidden to do but then there was no question of being sorry or notas a matter of fact he was notsummary justice was executed for mere disobedience and before doing the same thing again he added up the pleasure of going on the roof and balanced it against the pain inflicted on the tight seat of his sailortrousers as he bent over a chair and found it wanting it was during this same month which saw his seven completed years that he did a very strange and unintelligible thing though he suffered it rather than committed it he did it that is to say quite involuntarily and did not know he was doing it till it was done this was the manner of it miss bampton had set him one of her delightful exercises in handwriting in his copybook never brush your teeth with the housemaids broom she had written in her beautiful copperplate hand at the top of the page and archie was sitting with his tongue out copying this remarkable maxim and amusing himself with conjectures as to what other strange habits such people as were likely to brush their teeth with the housemaids broom might be supposed to haveperhaps they would lace their boots with the tongs or write their letters with a poker he had got about halfway down the page when suddenly there came over him that sensation with which he was beginning to become familiar that feeling of extension and expansion within himself that falling away of the limitations of consciousness which opened some new interior world to him his pen paused and then in the wrist of his right hand and in the fingers that still held his pen he felt a curious imperative kind of twitching and knew that they wanted to write of their own volition as it were though it was not his copy that they were concerned with under this sensation of absolute compulsion he took a sheet of paper that lay at his elbow and let his pen rest on it watching with the intensest curiosity what it would do he had no idea what would happen but he felt that something had to be written for a couple of minutes perhaps his pen traced random lines on the paper moving from left to right with a much greater speed than it was wont to go and the letters began to form themselves with a rapidity and certainty unknown to his careful halting calligraphy and in firm upright characters he saw his own name traced on the paper followed by a sentence and then his pen still apparently obedient to some unknown impulse from his fingers gave a great dash and stopped altogether and this is what he read archie do let me talk to you sometimes martin the queer sensation had ceased altogether and archie stared blankly at the words that he knew his hand had written but what they meant he had no notion nor did he know who martin was the whole thing was quite unintelligible to him both the impulse that made him write and that which he had written miss bampton had left the room on some errand when she had set archie his copy and came back at this moment expecting to find the copy finished she looked over his shoulder to see how he was getting on my dear havent you got further than that she said i thought you would have finished it by this time she saw the other piece of paper halfconcealed by archies left hand why youve been writing something else she said thats why you havent got on further let me look please not said archie its private miss bampton remembered that a week ago archie had been seized with a strong desire for literary composition and had composed a very remarkable short story which may be given in full chapter i there was once a merderer with yellow eyes and his wife said to him if you merder me you will be hung and he was hung on tuesday next finis when archie had brought this yarn to her she had laughed so uncontrollably that he was hurt so in the hope of finding another such though archie had no business to write stories in lessontime she said my dear do show me i wont laugh archie hesitated he felt shy about disclosing this sentence he had written but on the other hand miss bampton who appeared to know everything might help him towards the interpretation well its not a story he said its just this i wrote it without knowing oh miss bampton what does it mean and who is martin if it was archie who hesitated before it was miss bampton who hesitated now suddenly she had a clever thought my dear youve been thinking about the martins that built in the sandpit last spring she said dont you remember how you and jeannie made up a story about them this was true enough but it failed to satisfy archie also he had a notion that miss bampton had made a call on her ingenuity in offering this explanation but isnt there any other martin he asked none that you ever knew archie she said i think its one of those in the sandpit now get on with your copy and well walk there before your dinner the incident passed into the medley of impressions that were crowding so quickly into the storehouse of archies consciousness but it did not lie there quite unconnected with others he laid it on the same shelf so to speak as that which held the memory of his waking vision one night in remote days and held also the fact of his knowing what miss bampton had thought of in the guessing game but those were among the secret things of which he spoke to nobody one more impression for secret pondering though of different sort from those he had lately added to his store and that was when a whipping seemed imminent and he saw one of miss schwarzs medicinebottles standing on his fathers table chapter iv lady davidstow and miss bampton were sitting together that night in lady davidstows bedroom she had sent her maid away saying that she would not want her again that night and now she held in her hand the sheet of paper covered with lines of meaningless scribbles with the one intelligible sentence at the end which archie had written that day when he should have been doing his copy in the other hand she held a letter written in ink that was now rather faded and she was comparing the two she looked at them for some time in silence then turned to miss bampton yes you are quite right cathie she said what archie wrote might actually be in martins handwriting look for yourself theres the last letter he ever wrote to me miss bampton took the two papers from her theres absolutely no difference she said the moment i saw what archie had written i thought of martins handwriting and then it was signed martin are you sure he has never heard of him not that that would account for the handwriting lady davidstow shook her head i think its impossible she said jeannie assured me she had never spoken to him about martin nor has blessington he may have heard his name he probably has heard his name mentioned i remember mentioning it in archies hearing the other day but he didnt pay the slightest attention and he cant possibly recollect him even in the vaguest way it is five years now since martin died and archie was then only just two and for six months before that martin was with me at grives cathie bampton laid down the two papers i cant think why you never told archie about him she said lady davidstows great grey eyes grew dim ah my dear if you were martins mother and archies mother you would know she said if you had seen your eldest son die of consumption and your second son threatened with it you would understand how natural it was not to tell archie yet of the brother he had never consciously seen jack agreed with me too i have long been prepared for archie asking questions which certainly i would answer truthfully and let the knowledge come to him quietly by degrees i may have done wrong i dont know but i think i did right i couldnt begin saying to archie you had a brother but he died more would have come out that he died of consumption that for fear of that archie lives so much in the open air but my dear how will archie begin to know unless you tell him oh in many ways there is martins picture for instance in my room archie may ask who it is or when he hears martins name mentioned he will ask some time who martin was indeed i have often thought it odd that he hasnt only the other day jack was talking to me about it suggesting that it was time that archie knew indeed he rather urged me to tell him and now all of a sudden we find archie writing in martins handwriting and signing with martins name shall you tell lord davidstow asked miss bampton no i certainly shall not jack hates all that approaches the neighbourhood of anything that might be called occult or spiritualistic he says pshaw as you know if even hypnotism is mentioned i did tell him about archies intuition in that guessing game and as you again know he asked you not to play it any more though at the same time he insisted that it was a mere guess on archies part cathie was silent a moment and those scribbles of archies she asked do they not make it more difficult for you to tell him about martin now a sensitive boy like that might get it into his head that his dead brother was writing to him certainly i dont want archie to think that said his mother no i shall put off telling him now and if he asks said miss bampton i have an idea that he wont ask she got up and moved about the room for a moment in silence my dear all children have got a secret life of their own she said and oh how their mothers want to be admitted but every young thing has a walledup place in his heart to which he admits nobody and if you ask to be admitted not only is the door shut but locked we all had our secret places and i make a guess that this bit of paperby the way mind you put it back in the schoolroom where archie left itlives in archies secret place how i long to get in the darling but all i can do is to wait outside and take what he gives me archie doesnt tell me everything why should he he didnt tell me what it was that made him put the burning coals out of the fire on to my hearthrug probably he didnt know something inside him knew or else he wouldnt have done it all we do is accountable for by what is inside us impulses come from within but they are suggested by what is without said miss bampton yes thats the box on which the match is struck but the fire is in the match all you can do for a child even your own child is to suggest and hope hell take your suggestions miss bampton got up its late i must go she said but i want to ask you one thing do you believe in the possibility of martins having made a communication to archie yes i think i do thats why this affair has upset me so the idea is so strange and new that im frightened about it though why i should be so i cant tell with my whole heart i believe that my darling is living somewhere in an existence as individual as ever and even more vivid because the weakness and the illness and the weariness are past so why should i be frightened at the thought that he could communicate with archie ah my dear if only he would communicate with me or with jack poor jack how he would scout the idea how shocked he would be i suppose thats part of my secret garden which i keep from jack she held her friend a moment after kissing her jack never really got over martins death she said he couldnt bring himself into line with it it was then that it became a settled habit with him to try to forget just lately he has been very bad there goodnight my dear i cant talk about it the whole incident affected archie far less than it affected either his mother or his governess and next day when he found his scribbled paper lying where he had left it the day before it excited no further curiosity in his mind he put the thought of it away on his shelf of secret things which had nothing to do with his ordinary normal life in certain moods which after all only lasted for a moment or two the things that shelf contained became far more real to him than any other of his experiences but for weeks and months at a time its contents remained out of his reach and if he shared them as his mother had said with nobody else he had no share in them himself except at these odd queer moments so when next day he came across this curious sentence again caught by him as by some process of wireless telegraphy he felt but little interest in it though he sat for a couple of minutes with his pen held idly in his hand just to see if anything else happened but there was no sensation that ever so faintly resembled the twitching and yearning of his hand to write he knew not what and he crumpled the paper up and put it into the fire somewhere below the threshold of his conscious self lay the perceptions that were concerned with it those perceptions that guessed what miss bampton had thought of that somehow swam up to the surface as he used to lie in bed of a morning and sink into the depths that lay below the greentinted ceiling of his room and while they lay dormant it was as if they never existed but now for some weeks there had been no light whatever on his ceiling and morning after morning he awoke with no sense of exhilaration at all in the coming of another day but with a drowsy depression lying thick upon him as he heard the rustle of the endless rain in the shrubs outside and languidly went through those exercises that used to invigorate him but now only tired him all through the month the damp chilly weather persisted and day after day the same lowering heavens obscured the sun never in this bright sussex upland had there been so continuous a succession of rainstreaked hours the wonder of seeing the lake slowly rising till it engulfed the lower end of the lawn and made an island of the summerhouse failed to stir him and there was no magic in the unique experience of punting across the lawn to it then one morning early in december the deluge was stayed once more the sun slid up a cloudless sky and the whole nature of the world was changed archie had again been indoors for a couple of days with a return of the cold that really was responsible for the burning of his mothers hearthrug and once more the ecstasy of living possessed him as consolation for his imprisonment he and jeannie were both given a holiday and breakfast over they scampered out and once more saw their shadows racing in front of them the game was to tread on somebody elses shadow blessingtons shadow did not count because anybody could tread on that but it required real agility to tread on jeannies for it had the nippiest way of dodging before your foot could really descend on it so they ran in circles round blessington and marco the collie ran in circles round them and though it counted two to tread on marcos shadow you must not hold marco and then stamp on his shadow no one had got nearer than a doubtful claim to have trod on his tail quite suddenly archie stopped he had an odd warm sensation in his mouth that required investigation two days ago jeannies nose had bled which archie thought rather grand there had been rather a fuss about it she was laid down on the floor and miss bampton put the doorkey down her back and eventually some ice was brought and it was all quite important but now it was not his nose that was bleeding but his mouth oh i say im bleeding in my mouth he said thats just as good as jeannies nose even while he spoke he felt rather giddy and instantly blessingtons arm was round him eh my dear she said thatll never do you lean against me and well go home very quietly you mustnt chase any more shadders this morning as a matter of fact archie did not want to he felt a rather enjoyable lightness in his head but he felt weak also and disinclined to run oh here it is again he said and once more now with a sensation of choking he coughed up blood he saw blessingtons tender anxious face above him exactly as it had appeared in the earliest of all his memories and as then felt absolutely comfortable in the thought that she was there her arm was close round his neck now and with her other hand she made a sign to jeannie run straight back home dear she said and tell your mamma to come out here at once and bring william master archie and i are going to sit down quietly till she comes archie rather enjoyed all this he was completely in blessingtons hands and utterly content to be so then blessington did a very odd thing well im so hot with seeing you and miss jeannie running about she said that im going to sit down and wait for a bit and youll wait with me dear wont you there put your head on my knee and lie down i know youre hot with running about as by a conjuring trick archie knew that blessingtons cloak with its collar of rabbits fur was tucked round him it was rather odd to be lying with his head on blessingtons knee out of doors in the winter but he had no desire to question the propriety of all this for it fitted in so well with his main desire which was to stop still a couple of minutes ago he had been running about at topspeed now he had no wish except to do as he was told to put himself into responsible hands it was all rather dreamlike his mother and william were coming here soon but that seemed quite natural and it was still rather grand to bleed at the mouth then came a gentle singing in his ears a pleasant sense of complete indolence that never quite passed into unconsciousness and presently it was just as natural to find himself in williams arms out of a halfopened eye he saw william was in livery for the blue and white stripes of his low waistcoat were close to him and his cheek rested on williams shirtfront and then he saw that there was a bright red stain there which certainly was not part of williams ordinary livery oh william ive messed you he said i am sorry thats all right master archie said william it wasnt a new shirt this morning some dim reminiscence about something william had told him concerning beermoney and washing came into his head william had beermoney or washing he could not remember which i shall pay for it anyhow he said still feeling rather dizzy he had the impression of his own room with blessington and his mother near him apparently he had been laid on the floor for his bed looked tall beside him then he was not on the floor any more but in his bed and whether it was at once or later he never knew but presently there was in the room the stranger who once had made him play the pointless game of saying ninetynine here he was again with a plug against archies chest and two other plugs in his own ears archie remembered him quite distinctly he was a doctor who didnt give any medicine shall i say ninetynine he asked no just think ninetynine and dont talk if you think ninetynine it will do just as well archie had no desire to do anything beyond what he was told to do he thought ninetynine and the stranger smiled very kindly at him thats capital he said now just go on thinking ninetynine and whether he floated out of the window or vanished like the cheshire cat or walked away in the ordinary manner archie was quite unaware then he was hungry and behold there was blessington with boiled rabbit and he was sleepy and hungry again and again sleepy sometimes his mother was there and sometimes his father who looked rather odd and sometimes william brought coals though the housemaid usually did that and there was blessington again who washed his face and then uncovering him limb by limb washed these also archie could not understand why he acquiesced in this odd state of things or why he did not ask to get up and run about and play the shadowgame again but merely he was quite content to lie still and he hoped that when jeannie came and talked to him she would not suggest the resumption of the game that had been so ecstatic but had been interrupted so suddenly and miss bampton came in and read to him something she had been writing he noticed that she read from printed pages not like the pages of an ordinary book but long strips it appeared that it was a story she had written which had got printed and he asked whether his story about the merderer would ever get printed they all came in and talked gently and melted away again then arrived a memorable morning when instead of being gently awakened by blessington he awoke entirely of his own accord and felt strong and cross cross he certainly proved to be for when the morning washing began which hitherto had been a pleasant and luxurious performance he found that blessington could do nothing right she put soap into his eyes she tickled his feet and scratched his shoulder with her disgusting flannel archie made firm complaints against each of these outrages of a sort that would usually lead to rebuke on blessingtons part indeed he had not been nearly so rude on the occasion when he had been told to apologize to her but now she merely beamed at each disagreeable remark and instead of scolding him she made a most cryptic answer eh my darling she said thank god you feel like blaming me again what do you mean blessington said archie angrily oh do take care of my little toe youve nearly pulled it off once already well then ill kiss it said blessington and did archie looked at her why are you crying he asked wriggling his foot away from her he did not want it to be kissed crying im just laughing said blessington and that was true she was laughing but she was crying also an idea struck archie which had not occurred to him before am i ill blessington he asked am i going to die at that there was no question of what blessington was doing her laughing quite ceased and she gave a great sob no my darling youre not going to die she said get that out of your silly head youre not and then she broke down altogether and hid her face in the towel with which she had been washing archies left foot he saw her shoulders shaking he knew that for some reason she could not speak but she was crying and was not cross with him for being cross it behoved a man to administer consolation oh dont cry blessington he said what is there to cry about unless its because im so cross i dont mind your crossness she said you let me finish wiping your foot and then ill go down and tell your mamma oh dont say i was cross said archie im sorry i was cross nay ill just tell her how much better you feel this morning and i shouldnt wonder if there was a great treat coming something youll like ever so much is it another train asked archie bless the boy said she how you think about trains archie ate his breakfast and passed an entrancing morning everybody seemed desirous of congratulating him as if he had done something particularly meritorious as on the occasion of his not getting drowned when he jumped out of the boat after the pike he held a sort of levee the most remarkable incident of which was the appearance of miss bampton with a piece of white chalk with which she drew on the green drugget by his bed so that he could easily see it a great map of england and central europe there was the south of england with london written large and here was lacebury also conspicuously marked then there was the english channel with france below it and paris in the middle and away to the right some distance below the lake of geneva then still explaining she made marks like caterpillars which were mountains and said that now the mountains were covered with snow even down to the tails of the caterpillars and below was the lake of geneva quite blue all the roads were covered with snow up by the caterpillars tails and there were no wheels on the carriages but they slid over the frozen snow instead there was skating up there for they made lakes which were covered with ice they just put water into flat places and there was your lake and it instantly froze it never rained there but if it wanted to do anything it just snowed usually it didnt want to do anything and there was the sun and the snow and wouldnt it be jolly to go there this presented itself to archies mind as a purely abstract proposition of course it would be jolly to go to a place where you saw the real mountains and had a glimpse of the real lake of geneva and slid instead of walking but what next did any one ever go there apparently right at the tail of the caterpillar was a place called grives there it was written down the railway only went as far as bex and there the sledges began and always the sun shone so that you sat out of doors with the snow all round you and felt perfectly warm suddenly archie could stand it no longer it was like talking to a starving man about roast beef there was roast beef somewhere in the world and he wanted it so badly in the same way something inside archie starved for sun and snow and thin air oh shut up miss bampton he said i want it so frightfully his mother was sitting on the edge of his bed watching the map of europe archie were going to grives in a few days she said you and blessington and jeannie and i it was memorable moment when the boat rose up and then curtsied to the big seas that were jostling each other up the channel archies only knowledge of the sea was culled from a single visit to brighton two years ago and the sea to him then appeared but one among an assembly of unusual bright objects niggerminstrels and tin buckets and piers and pennyintheslot machines but on this bright winter day he hailed a new and glorious creature when he saw the steep whitecapped waves grey in the bulk but lit with lovely green where they grew thin come streaming up to the ships side and fall away again in puffs of white smoke and squirts of highflung foam warmly wrapped up in his new furcoat he sat on deck sheltered from the weather and watched with ecstatic wonder the rollicking untamed creatures that sent the boat now over on one side now on the other and threw it up and caught it again within their firm liquid embrace behind it lay a wake of white foam like a long string still tying them to dazzling chalk cliffs and the wavesmothered pier and overhead the masts thrumming to the wind struck right and left across a wide arc of the sky and their shadows sped across the deck these swervings and upliftings and descents of the ship as she whacked her way across the shifting mountains produced in him no physical discomfort but only the sense that a new and glorious being had come into his life all too soon even as the jigsaw puzzle of the map of europe had warned him by the narrowness of the straits the shores of france began to rear themselves up above the wavemoulded horizon and presently another pier received them and men spoke a strange tongue probably french though it might have been hebrew and made novel gestures and wore blouses and boots that turned up at the toes more than was usual in england there were no platforms you had to climb the sheer carriage side from groundlevel and the engines were altogether different and the movement of the train was other than that he was accustomed to then sure enough they came after nightfall to a great town and drove across it keeping firmly to the wrong side of the road though as everybody else did the same there were not so many collisions as might have been expected then came the novelty of eating dinner in a restaurant perched up in another station from the windows of which you could romantically observe train after train sliding out into the winter night before long archies train did the same and then came the glorious experience of undressing in a train while it was going at full speed there was never so remarkable a bedroom all gold and lookingglass and stamped leather and instead of his bed and blessingtons being put on the floor one which archie begged to have was put above the other close by him in the roof of the carriage was the electric light which when you turned a small handle the requisite distance dwindled to a mere speck at some timeless hour he woke up and found a very polite stranger in his bedroom to whom blessington explained that they had neither spirits nor lace nor tobacco in their luggage and the total stranger then apparently guessed that he had been misinformed for he went away again without another word the clever train found its way without any mistake through the darkness of the long winters night for next morning it was skimming along by the edge of a lake so large that no wonder it appeared on the jigsaw map of europe the lake at home once an almost boundless sheet of water was no more than a wayside puddle to this the hills at home were no more than the tunnelled earth of moles compared with those slopes on which the rows of pines looked smaller than the edging of a tablecloth against the blue blue archie thought he had never known what blue was till now not what sunshine was until he saw the dazzle of it on those sparkling slopes and they so his mother told him were not mountains at all they were only hills but soon he should see what mountains meant as they passed through the glittering towns that stood on the edge of the lake he could see the sleighs sliding over the streets with jingle of bells crisply sounding in the alert air other smaller sleighs were drawn by pleased smiling dogs there was never such a morning of discoveries the only drawback was that though it ought only to have been ten oclock the swiss chose that it should be eleven and thus an hour of this immortal day was lost but his mother told him that the french had taken care of it and would give it back to them when they returned all this was romantic enough but the romance grew more deephued yet when in the early afternoon archie was packed into a sleigh and the journey up through the pinewoods began whitecapped and whitecloaked stood the redtrunked trees and now and then with a falling puff of snow a laden branch free of its burden sprang upwards again then the pines were tired of climbing and the sleigh left them and came out on to a plateau high above the valley and could that have been sunshine down there for the valley seemed choked with grey fog and here above was real sunshine and air that refreshed you as with wine the hills that had appeared so gigantic had sunk below them but behind them rose the spears and precipices remote and blue of the real mountains and as they went upwards these soared ever above them and presently the blue on them was tinged with apricot and rose in the glow of the declining sun and the driver cracked his whip and the horses jingled their bells in response and pointing with it to a row of toy houses still far above them he grinned at archie and said grives the rose of sunset had faded and the snows were turned to ivorycrystal beneath the full moon when they entered the long lit village street with its old carved wooden houses deepbalconied towards the south and the modern hotels now just opening again for the winter season these too they left behind them and again mounting a steep slope came to where round a sudden corner stood the big chalet which archies mother had taken and here we are she said archie sat staring somehow he felt he knew the house perhaps it was a house he had dreamed of there were pines to right and left of it just as there were in this picture of a house that existed somewhere in his mind it had the same broad balconies where you could lie all day in the sun and look over the village roofs below and across the valley from which all afternoon they had climbed he felt he knew it inside too there would be rooms with wooden walls and china stoveswhere had he heard of china stovesand the smell of pinewood haunting all the house it was extraordinarily interesting a big genial woman had turned up the electric light outside the door when she heard the crack of the drivers whip and stood bareheaded ready to welcome them archie felt that he knew something about her too ah miladi she said to his mother in very crisp good english yet with a funny precision as if she had learned it as a lesson i give you welcome back to grives and how is my dear madame blessington archie thought his mother interrupted these greetings rather suddenly how are you madame seiler she said and here is my daughter jeannie and archieand she added something in an undertone which sounded like the language miss schwarz used to talk madame seiler whisked round with renewed cordiality and such lovely weather you have come to she said the sun all day and the frost all night but we keep out the frost and let the sun in they passed into the entrancehall aromatic and warm heated by a big china stove that roared pleasantly and instantly without any reason there came into archies mind the remembrance of the words his hand had scribbled one morning with the signature martin it came out of the darkness like a light seen distantly at night it flashed like a signal and vanished again but for one second it had been there remote but visible and luminous lady davidstow for some obscure and grownup reason thought good at supper that night to explain incidentally that she had written to madame seiler that blessington was coming and that was how she had known blessingtons name archie had a very strong and wholesome confidence in his mother but he knew that grownup people sometimes made statements which have got by the rules to be accepted but which do not always convince blessingtons saying that she could not run any more because she had a bone in her leg was an instance of this class of statement as also was the occasion when his mother spoke a year ago about abracadabras sneezings this mode of accounting for madame seilers knowing blessingtons name came under the same head as far as it went it might be true and though it did not particularly interest him whether it was true so to speak all the way he felt that there was something mildly mysterious about it and having made this unconvincing statement his mother at once passed on to more interesting topics it was a blow when blessington called him next morning to be told that he was tired with the journey and must stop in bed for breakfast that was a perfectly unfounded statement but like those others had grumblingly to be accepted though archie knew quite well that he had never felt less tired you maynt feel it dear said blessington but you are i should think i ought to know best said archie no i know best said blessington firmly and your mamma says so too archie began to wonder they were not right he did not feel tired as he had told blessington but something inside him said that it did not want to run about or even skate but it was very well pleased that his body well wrapped up should sit up in bed and bask in the sun which blazed in through the opened french window communicating with the big balcony outside his room then after breakfast there came in his mother with a big jovial man whose name was dr dobie i never saw such a lazy fellow exclaimed this rather attractive person fancy not being up yet they wouldnt let me said archie well as soon as ive had a look at you up you shall get said the doctor but i cant wait till youre dressed now undo your coat a minute once again the instrument with plugs was produced and the ninetynine game played thats capital said the doctor and now in a minute ill have done with you just put that into your mouth with the end under your tongue there like that this was a very short process and dr dobie got up now my plan for you is this he said you shall dress and lie out in the sun on your balcony and after youve had dinner you shall go for a sleigh drive and walk a little on your way back then balcony again till its dark but maynt i skate asked archie who didnt really want to no not just yet well have you skating before long but not at present the more you do as youre told the sooner youll skate during the next week but so gradually that at no moment was it a discovery it dawned on archie that he was ill and that his illness dated from the time when his mouth bled the knowledge did not in the least depress him because with it came the absolute certainty in his own mind that he was going to get quite well again for the most part he did not feel ill though there was often an uncomfortable period towards evening when he felt sometimes hot and sometimes cold and one moment would want another coat on and soon would have liked to throw off all the clothes he had these odd feelings were accompanied by a sort of extra vividness in his perceptions he felt tingling and alert and the lights seemed brighter than their wont but when this had been more marked than usual in the evening he always felt very tired next day and more than once he did not get up at all but had his bed pulled out on to the balcony then as the weeks passed on there was less of this and before long he was allowed to tie his toboggan to the back of the sleigh and be towed uphill through the pinewood that climbed the slopes behind the village that was a delightful experience on each side stood the snowy trees frosted like a christmas cake now almost meeting above the narrow track and then standing away from it again so that the deluge of sun poured down as into a pool while from in front came the jingle of the horses bells and from below him the squeak of his runners then they came out again on to the skiing slopes where visitors to grives played the entrancing game of seeing apparently who could fall down most often in the most complicated manner where the slope was steepest there was erected a sort of platform so that the runner flying down the slope above was shot into the air touching ground again yards below or on other mornings when things went well and there had been no hotandcold period the evening before he tobogganed down the slope below the house to the edge of the skatingrink and sat there in the snow with everything round frozen hard yet feeling perfectly warm so potent were the beams of this ineffable sun through the thin dry air jeannie was learning to skate and progressed in wobbling halfcircles and shrilly announced that this and no other was the outside edge or four of the experts in a railedoff and hallowed place at the end of the huge rink would put down an orange and proceed to weave a mystic dance in obedience to the shouted orders of one of them at one moment all four would be swiftly converging on a backedge to their orange and just at the moment when a complicated collision seemed imminent would somehow change their direction and lo all four were sailing outwards and forwards again in big sweeping curves then there were the hoarse angry cries of the curlers to listen to and the pleasant sight of the stone sliding swiftly down the ice and butting with a hollow chunk into any other that stood in its way and then a slow sliding stone would come down and people swept violently in front of it to encourage it not to lie down and die which for the most part it did but always too soon his mother or blessington would come to tell him that it was time to go home again and he would tie his toboggan to the back of the sleigh and be pulled uphill to the house that was a tiresome moment and archie found himself wondering with a pang of jealousy why when so many were hale and hearty round him it should be just he who was obliged to go and lie down on the roofed balcony instead of skating or curling but even when he had setbacks and had to lie all day on the balcony he never faltered in his belief that he was going to get well here then in brief were the outward aspects of archies life at grives new and attractive and full of sun and dry powdery snow he took no active part in the activities and was but an observer but all the time there were inward aspects of his life which no one shared with him and which no one ever observed he was always on the alert even on those mornings of tiredness after he had had a rise of temperature the evening before for the development of a certain thing the existence of which came to him only in hints and whispers but the thing itself was always there though he had no control over its manifestations he could no more bring it into the exterior life of the senses he could no more see or hear it or produce any evidence of it as he willed than he could make the sun pierce and scatter the clouds which for a whole week in january alternately rained and snowed on to grives all he could do was to wait for it and he waited in a perpetual serene excitement it came always when he was alone he got to think of solitude in this present stage as an essential for its manifestation and as the weeks went on he associated it more and more with the balcony on which he lay for the greater part of the day it the thing he waited for and was completely silent about even when he had intimate goodnight talks with his mother was no other than martin whoever martin might be whose presence had come into his mind with such unexpected vividness when first he saw the chalet never was the idea of martin absent from his mind it might lurk concealed behind the excitement of trailing after the sleigh or of watching the skaters on the ice but at all times it was ready to enfilade him and among all the diversions of the snow and the ice and the sun he had an inward eye turned towards this inscrutable martinno winged nester in the sandcliffs but somebody somebody lessons in a mild way had begun again before this wretched rainy and snowy week and miss bampton sent out from home the most entrancing and topical copies hot outsideedge for lunch was one in allusion to the news of jeannies skating cold insideedge for dinner was another whatever the weather was archie was out of doors all day and jeannie during lessontime used to sit out on his balcony and do her more advanced tasks which with his were taken in to lady davidstow for correction more often his mother used to sit on the balcony too but during this damp abominable week she suffered from a heavy cold and the lessons were brought to her by jeannie and on this particular morning jeannie had finished her french translation first and so went in to her mother to have it corrected leaving archie to finish the last three lines of his copy ever since his first entry into the house there had been for him nothing more than the perception of martins presence with the patience of a child who wants something a thing only equalled by the patience of a cat watching a mousehole he had never taken his inward eye off this he was always ready for it as jeannie went in with her completed french lesson he laid down his pen and looked for a moment at the streaming icicles on the eaves of his shelter and listened with a sense of depression to the drip of the melted water that formed grey pits in the whiteness of the snow below because there was a thaw the air felt colder than when there were twenty degrees of frost and the blanket on his couch was studded with condensed moisture it is warmer thought archie to himself so it ought to be warmer but its colder at this moment he felt a sudden thrill in his right wrist and thought that a melted drop had fallen on it but he saw there was no drop there and wondered at this sensation of touch then he saw his fingers begin to twitch and instantly recognized the sensation he had felt once before he swept his incomplete copy off his pad of blottingpaper and took his pen up again surely he could write on his blottingpaper at first the meaningless scribbles appeared made more grotesque and senseless by the running of the ink there was a pencil on the table by him and he took that up instead of the pen while his hand twitched and jerked to be at its task again the day before he had pinched his finger in the hinge of a slamming window and he saw the moonshaped blot of blood below the nail quivering as his fingers starved to hold an instrument of writing again then his hand settled down like a hovering bird on to a bough as he picked up the pencil for a little while the scribbles went on then watching the marks on the blottingpaper just as an excited spectator watches the action of a play he saw words coming his brain did not know what they were till they appeared on the paper archie archie said the pencil i want to talk to you i cant always but sometimes i can dear archie try to be ready when i get through lovely to talk to you cant to mother an incontrollable excitement seized the boy oh who is it he said aloud is it martin he felt the twitching die away in his fingers and presently he was left sitting there his copy on the floor and the scrawl on the blottingpaper but he had somewhere inside him a sense of extraordinary satisfaction something or somebody had got through whatever that meant the words in pencil on his blottingpaper had got through and he turned it over hastily and picked up the unfinished copy as the doorhandle into his room rattled and jeannie came out on to the balcony again with her corrected french exercise several days of this chilly dripping weather with the foehn wind from the south went by and when that ceased and the wind veered to the north blowing high over grives and raising feathers of snowdust on the peaks to the north while the sheltered valley basked in calm and sunlight again there were eventful days of carting the snow from the rinks before any further development took place in archies secret life this carting of the snow was splendid fun for when a handsleigh of it was piled high archie would squat on the front of it thereby adding considerably to the weight and in a shrill voice direct the men who pushed it to right or left in order to reach the steep bank down which they discharged their burden when they were come to the edge of it some large strong man lifted archie off his perch and waited with him while the sleigh was pushed to the very brink and its burden overturned in a jolly lumpy avalanche that poured down the builtup bank of the rink then archie mounted his throne again and was pulled back to where the men with spades loaded up again when the sleigh seemed to be sufficiently full he called out stop and made the return journey to the side of the rink this was all tremendously grand and he had an idea that the clearing of the rink could never have taken place without him certainly his sleigh worked much faster than any other for in his honour those who pushed always ran to discharge their burden at top speed instead of going slowly like the others oh that was a pace he would say as somebody lifted him off look mummy theyre going to turn it over the rink then was clear again thanks to archies great exertions before his secret life made any step forward but one afternoon when he had been watching the skating from his balcony something further occurred he was alone for his mother had gone down with jeannie to the rink and blessington had gone shopping and there was a bell by him by means of which he could summon madame seiler if he wanted anything but he had no thoughts of summoning madame seiler he was extremely content to lie in the sun and watch the rink sometimes and sometimes to read a fascinating book called the rose and the ring which his mother had given him there were absurd pictures of prince bulbo an enormously fat young gentleman whom archie did not wish to resemble but was rather afraid of resembling since dr dobie at his last visit had told him he was getting fat it was all very peaceful and happy and he had lost interest in jeannies falls and even in prince bulbos executions and was staring placidly at a very bright spot of glistening snow which caught the sun at the edge of the rink when lines of shadow began to pass over the field of his vision exactly as they used to pass over the greenlit ceiling of his nightnursery at home this was interesting he did not feel in the least sleepy but very wide awake and was conscious of sinking down through this lovely luminous air with the bright spot of light getting every moment higher above him when he suddenly heard his name called archie archie said the voice which was close to him and wonderfully friendly and at the same moment he felt on the back of his hand the touch of another hand that was smooth and young and somehow familiar though he had never felt it before he tried not to disturb the impression there was some sort of spell on him light as a gossamerweb which the slightest movement physical or mental on his part might break yes im archie he said but the moment he spoke he knew that he had spoken somehow in the wrong way another part of him not his lips and their voluntary movements should have answered he ought to have thought the answer with that part of him that saw the lines of shadow passing across the bright steel surface of the rink below that felt himself sinking down and down beneath the bright spot opposite he could not have explained but he knew it was so and instantly there was he back on his balcony again with the rose and the ring in his hand and jeannie on the rink madame seiler clattering dishes in the kitchen and himself all alone lying in the sunshine he knew that something inside him had been tremendously happy when his name was called and his hand touched in that intimate manner and now that the touch and the voice were gone he felt something akin to what he felt when he was feverish and blessington had said goodnight and left him but then he always knew that blessington had only gone into the next room and could be summoned and he could not summon him who had called archie to him he had not the least doubt that it was martin who had called that it was martins hand that had been laid on his but who was this dear person called martin and where was martin secure in the knowledge that it was martin who had come to him and touched him and called to him he put down his book and shut his eyes so that his feeling of being alone should be intensified martin he whispered oh martin he lay there tense and excited sure that martin would come again then in a dim childlike manner not formulating anything to himself but only feeling his way he knew he had called wrong he must call differently if he hoped to have any reply call from inside but the more earnestly he attempted to call from inside the further he got away from that inside mood which he knew but could not recapture oh what rot he said at length and picked up the rose and the ring again to ascertain whether bulbo was really going to be executed on this second occasion when he piled his table on his bed and his chair on his table and his hatbox on his chair and peeped out of the window from his horrid cell to see whether it was eight oclock yet every day in this return of frost and sunshine archie felt stronger and soon the desire to skate took firm hold of him oddly enough the pleasant dr dobie began to agree with him and within a day or two of the time when archies desire to skate became a pressing need dr dobie sanctioned it and archie had a humiliating hour or two he had seen jeannie lean outwards and announce the outside edge he had seen jeannie lean a little inwards and proclaim the inside edge and round she went in curves that archie could not but envy he had only got to lean outwards and inwards like that and surely he was master of his curves but he found that his curves were master of him and tumbled him down instead or would have done so if a kind swiss on skates had not always been on hand to prevent any disaster of this kind but then jeannie had learned so it seemed to archie by falling down and he resented the hand that saved him from falling do let me fall down he said i cant learn unless i fall down better not fall down sir said this amiable young man i hold you you learn best so but jeannie didnt said archie no but she is a girl whispered his swiss oh ought girls to fall down and not boys asked archie rather interested in this new difference between the sexes archie was allowed by the end of january to skate for half an hour before lunch with his swiss hovering over him like a friendly eagle to have lunch with jeannie seated side by side on a toboggan at the edge of the rink and skate for half an hour again afterwards at the end of which time a second eagle appeared in the person of blessington or his mother and carried him off to the sleigh right on through half february lasted the golden frosty weather then came a great snowfall and with that the frost broke the snow degenerated into rain the wind veered again into the slack south and the roofs dripped and the trees tossed their white burdens from them but as the snow melted wonderful things happened in the earth at the summons of the suns of spring for gentians pushed their lengthening stems up through the thinning crust and put forth their starlike flowers deep as the blue of night and brilliant as the blue of day the call of the spring though yet the snowwreaths lingered pierced through them and the listening grasses and bulbs pricked up their little green ears above the soil wonderful as last spring had been the first that archie had ever consciously noticed this alpine primavera was twice as magical for winter was caught in her very arms and warmed to life again morning by morning the pinewoods steamed like the hot flank of a horse and when the mists cleared natures great colourbox had been busy again with fresh greens and more vivid reds on the treetrunks and weak pale snowdrops and mountain crocuses shone like silver and gold in the sheltered hollows a more tender blue took the place of the crystallized skies of winter and for the barren brilliant light of the january sun was exchanged a fruitful and caressing luminousness that flooded the world instead of merely looking down upon it soon from the lower slopes the snow was quite vanished and instead of the tinkle of sleighbells there came from the pastures the deeper note from the bells of feeding cattle which all winter long had been penned up in chalets eating the dry cakes of last years harvest of grass archie had been lying in his balcony one morning writing an account of these things to miss bampton his mother had gone back to england to take jeannie home but would be back at the end of the week and in the absence of an instructor archies task was to write a long letter daily to somebody at home this he enjoyed doing for the search for words in which to express himself had begun to interest him and he had just written if you listen very hard you can almost hear the grass and the flowers fizzing is it the sap its like fizzing anyhow thats what i mean as he paused at the end of his third page he felt something in his hand that also reminded him of fizzing there was that queer thrill and twitching in his fingers which he recognized at once and words not searched for by him but coming from some other source began to trace themselves on the blank fourth page today there were no preliminary scrawls the firm upright handwriting was coherent from the first archie ive got through again it wrote isnt it fun if you want a test test thought archie whats that youll find a circle cut on the bark of the pine opposite the frontdoor dig in the earth just below it theres a box and some things in it i hid them a wave of conscious excitement came over the boy and instantly his hand stopped writing oh bother its stopped he said to himself i wish i hadnt interrupted it but he had interrupted it and since he could not get back into that particular quiescence which he had begun to see always accompanied these manifestations he could at least do what the writing suggested and slipping off his couch he tiptoed downstairs in order not to let blessington hear his exit there were two pinetrees either of which might have been described as opposite the frontdoor and he searched in vain round the first of these for any sign of the circle cut on the bark then coming to the other he at once saw with a sudden beating of his heart a rough circle cut in the bark just opposite his eyes a grey ring of lichen had grown into it making it so conspicuous that he wondered he had never noticed it before next moment he was down on his knees grubbing up the loose earth directly below it with the eager absolute certainty of success the earth came away very easily and his hole was not yet a foot deep when he saw something white and shining at the bottom of it and presently he drew out a small round tin box like that which stood on the table in his fathers study and held tobacco he hastily filled the earth into his excavation again and undetected tiptoed back to his balcony for a while the lid resisted his efforts to open it but soon he got it loose and looked inside on the top lay a folded piece of paper below there was a stick of chocolate in lead paper a pencil a matchbox and a photograph of a boy about nine years old whom archie instantly knew to be like himself then he opened the piece of folded paper and saw words written on it in a hand he knew quite well this is martin morriss was the inscription and belongs to him alone and not anybody else at all ever archie read this looked at the photograph again and a flood of light poured in on his mind it was no wonder that he had felt that martin was friendly and affectionate that martin wanted to talk to him that martin told him of the cache he had made for to whom should he tell it but to his brother yes martin was here for martin had written to him had called him and then in a moment more light flashed on him certainly martin was alive but he was not alive in the sense that his mother was alive or blessington in that sense martin was dead there was nothing in the least shocking or terrifying in the discovery and it burst upon him as the sense of spring had done it was just a natural thing wonderfully beautiful to find out for certain as he felt he had found out that there was close to him always perhaps and certainly at times this presence of the brother whom he had never seen but who in some way not more inexplicable than the appearance of the blue gentians pricking up through the snow could occasionally speak to him calling him by name or using his hand to write with a few days afterwards lady davidstow arrived back from england and on the first evening of her return after dusk had fallen archie was sitting on the floor against her knee in front of the one open fireplace in the house where pinelogs fizzed and smouldered and burst into flame and glowed into a core of heat sometimes for that pleasant hour before bedtime she read to him but tonight there had been no reading for she had been telling him of the week she had passed at home they had moved up to london while she was there and london was miry and foggy and cold altogether disgusting dear she said you dont want to go there do you not an atom said archie firmly i like this place better than any i have ever been in im so glad archie i was afraid you would dislike it after the frost went archie was staring dreamily at the fire and suddenly he knew that martin was here and he looked quickly round wondering if by any new and lovely miracle he should see the boy whose face was now familiar to him from the photograph but there was nothing visible only the firelight leaped on the wooden walls what is it archie asked his mother suddenly archie felt that he could preserve his secret no longer as on the day in church when he wanted his mother to share with him the pleasure of that glorious comedian the man with the wagging beard so now he wanted her to share with him the secret joy of martins presence mummy i want to tell you about martin he said you know whom i mean martin my brother archie who has been telling you about martin she asked archie laughed why martin of course its too lovely once he called me out loud and he writes for me hes written for me three times once at home and twice here i knew he was particularly here the moment we got here and last time he told me about what he had hidden under the pinetree and i found it dont you want to see it i hid it away in the paper in my portmanteau oh and what is a test he said it was a test a test a test is a proof archie laughed again that makes sense he said now shall i show you the test i kept it all together with what he wrote to me about it first he came back in a moment with his precious possession look thats what he wrote on the paper of my letter to miss bampton he said he said there was a circle cut on the pinetree and i found it and i dug as he told me and found this look isnt it lovely and thats martins photograph isnt it it was impossible to question the validity of this evidence and indeed lady davidstow had no desire to do so for herself she believed implicitly in the fact of life everlasting without which the whole creation of god with its pains and its agonies and its yearning and its love becomes the cruellest of all sorry jests concocted by the omnipotent power of a mind infinitely brutal and cynical who tortures the puppets he has created with unutterable anguish or ravishes their souls with a joy as meaningless as dreams well she remembered martins cutting the circle on the pinetree but what its significance was he had never told her but now five years after his death he had told it she could not doubt to the brother who had no normal remembrance of him there they were the little pathetic tokens of his childish secrecy a pencil a piece of chocolate a photograph and above all the wellformed upright handwriting identical with that of the message traced on the last page of archies unsent letter how it happened what was the strange mechanism that fashioned by material means this mysterious communication between the living and the dead she had no idea but of its having happened she had no doubt she turned these relics over she kissed the handwriting so long buried and tears of tender amazement rose in her eyes oh archie my darling she said you lucky boy arent i said archie but does martin never write to you no dear i suppose he cannot and why is he so particularly here demanded archie she paused a moment he died here she said in this house asked he which room blessingtons archie gave a great sigh oh mummy do let me have that room instead of mine he said book ii chapter v archie was precariously perched on the side of his little unarigged redsailed boat looking with dancing blue eyes at the rocky coast all smothered in billows and sunlit spray some quarter of a mile ahead and wondering if he would be able to make the harbour of silorno on this tack he wondered also what was the best thing to do if he could not there seemed to be two alternatives the one to beat out to sea again and come in on another tack the other to run before the wind to the head of the bay away to the right where he knew there was a sandy beach tumble himself out as best he might and he was afraid see his beloved amphitrite being pounded to bits by the rollers for with all his optimism he could not picture himself hauling her up out of harms way but even this seemed preferable to the other alternative for to beat out again in such a sea seemed really a challenge to the elements to swamp him in which case he was like to lose the amphitrite and his own life as well the wind was blowing with all the violence of a summer italian gale straight down the bay from the open sea a high wall of rock against which the breakers smashed themselves and would smash anything else that rode them was in front of him then came the narrow opening into silorno harbour for which he was making after which the rocks on the top of which ran the road to santa margharita continued right up to the head of the bay it had been rough when he started to sail there in order to get some cigarettes which now were stowed away in his coat which he had wrapped round them and placed where it would receive as small a share as possible of the spray that from time to time fell in a solid sheet into the boat that seemed almost the most important thing of all to keep the cigarettes dry for it would be too futile to have taken all this trouble and so greatly have ventured himself and his amphitrite if at the end the cigarettes should prove to be a mash of tobacco and salt water for they were only in a cardboard box and next in importance came the need of demonstrating to his mother and harry and helena and jessie that he had been perfectly wise and prudent in sailing across to santa margharita in spite of their landlubber fears in a freshening gale and a lumpy sea in order to get these egyptian cigarettes instead of the despised italian brand he made no doubt that the whole party of them were at this moment watching him through glasses from the terraced garden of the castello that sat perched at the top of the steep oliveclothed hill in front of him and he spared a second to wave a hand in their direction in case they were there but he did it in a rather hurried manner for he wanted that hand to be ready to loosen the sheet in case any more wind was on its way to him and the other hand must retain its hold on the tiller archie was clad in a jersey stained and whitened with saltwater and the rest of his attire consisted of grey flannel trousers his coat was defending to its last dry stitch the trophy of cigarettes his shoes he had put under his coat for it was just as well to keep them dry while if by any chance he had to swim they would be of no use to him either dry or wet the sleeves of his jersey rolled up nearly to his shoulder disclosed slim strong arms incredibly browned with a month of seabathing and his sockless feet were of the same fine tan of constant exposure his hair thick and dripping from the spray had for the present lost its tawny curliness and he had to throw back his head from time to time in order to keep it out of his eyes and in his mind there was the same wildness of outofdoors rapture that characterized the youth of his supple body he could have laughed with pleasure at the mere fact of this doubtful battle between himself and the windmaddened sea but all the time in some secret chamber of his brain there sat so to speak a steadfast and keen observer who was making notes with all his might and pushing them down into the cool caves of memory to be brought forth in case archie came safely to land from their cold storage and fitted with words which should reproduce the exultation of wind and sun and sea and in a chamber more secret yet a chamber not in his brain but in his heart sat the knowledge that among the others his second cousin helena vautier in particular was surely looking at him from the terraced garden high above the cliff she should see and for that matter so should her sister jessie how to handle a boat she had been strong in her dissuasion of his starting at all and that if archie was quite honest with himself was one of the principal reasons why he had insisted on doing so she had mentioned casually the other day that there was nothing in the world she liked better than the careless gotothedeuce attitude towards danger which to her represented manliness and archie had been only too delighted to give her this vigorous exhibition of it but it tremendously pleased him that on his announcement of his intention to go across the bay she should have so strenuously dissuaded him to his mind that conveyed the impression that she liked him as much as she liked exhibitions of manliness he was already opposite the opening into the harbour and still several hundred yards distant and for the time all the attention of the observer who some day was going to put this experience into words and of the other observer who knew that helena was watching him was diverted to the job that engaged his more superficial self but that part of him intent and eager though it was on the hazard that lay before it sang and shouted with glee at the fact that he was alone out here on the sea for this very sane and healthy personage archie morris might almost be described as an aquamaniac so intense was his passion for that gladdest and most glorious creature of god he did not want to be a sailor for a sailor inhabited an impregnable fort which though surrounded by sea was still impenetrably removed from it and defied it by means of colossal cylinders and pounding pistons and steel sides best of all was to be swimming in the sea but not far removed from that was to coax and wheedle the sea through the medium of a big sail and a tiny boat being alone with the sea as with all lovers was necessary to the full realization of passion a river was a fair substitute for the sea or a lake but there had to be a quantity of water he loved to dive and open his eyes under water so as to see the sun shining through it that was a very early passion dating from the time when he had stepped out of a boat in his anxiety about a pike that was on the end of his line then for a moment all other considerations were subordinated to keen physical activity the wind was sweeping him across the mouth of the harbour and he had either to put about at once to avoid being taken onto the rocks at its northern end or risking being swamped put his helm even harder aport and tighten his sheet with his habit of swift decision he determined to go for it and throwing his leg across the tiller he pulled on his sheet with both hands the spray from the waves that broke themselves on the rocks fell solid and drenched him but next moment with but a yard or two to spare he skimmed by them into the broadening harbour there the promontory on which the castello stood came between him and the wind his sail flapped idly and in dead calm he picked up his sculls to row the amphitrite to her anchorage but before he took them up he laughed aloud gosh what sport he said the anchorage of the amphitrite lay in a bay not far from the entrance to the harbour screened by the steepclimbing olive groves belonging to this castello of silorno which archies mother had taken for the months of may and june silorno itself that incredibly picturesque huddle of pink and yellow walls of campaniles and lacemakers who with bright coloured kerchiefs over their comely heads plied their wooden bobbins all day in the shade of its narrow streets rose roof over roof at the head of the harbour a big cobbled piazza sloped down to the quay wall where sailors chatted and dozed in the shadow all day putting to sea for their nightfishing by the light of flares about the time of sunset the village was impenetrable to wheeled traffic for the road along the bay came to an end at its outskirts and thereafter became a narrow cobbled track built in steps where the steepness of its streets demanded round the town rose an amphitheatre of hills broken only by the low saddle where the final promontory on which the castello stood swam out seawards in three wooded humps of hills and sitting here you could observe on days like these the breakers crashing on the reefs to the right where the seas rolled in from the open mediterranean while the landlocked harbour into which archie had just brought his boat lay smooth as a mirror at your feet towards the left straight in front ran the ascending path that passed below the castello to the head of the promontory where enlightened italian enterprise was building an execrable and totally useless lighthouse to supplant the little madonna chapel that had stood there for centuries archie took down his sail anchored the amphitrite and punted himself across in a small boat to the landingstage at the foot of the hill on which the castello stood here the trees stood untroubled by the gale that poured high over them from the south though on the other side of the harbour the wind roared in the olives and turned their green to the grey of the underleaf and the great surges beat and burst on the rocks he had narrowly avoided but here that tumultuous stir was unfelt and the resinous smell of pines and the clean odour of the eucalyptustrees hung in the warm and sheltered air out of that denser shade he passed into the belt of olives that grew higher on the slope mixed with angled and contorted figtrees where the fruit was already beginning to swell and ripen above rose the great grey bastion of the retaining fortress wall tufted with stonecrop and valerian that was rooted in the crevices and above that again was spread the umbrella of the stonepine that grew at the corner of the garden the path he followed wound round the base of this wall and passed below its easterly side where he came into the blast of the warm south wind again that swept along the face of the castello and made the cypresses bend and buckle like fishingrods which feel the jerk and pull of some hooked giant of the waters the hillside here plunged very precipitously downwards to the bay three hundred feet below wrinkled with waves and feathered with foam and lover of the sea though he was he felt content to observe that tumult of windy water not a sail was visible right across to the farther shore of the gulf and tonight there would be no illumination of the fishingboats that in calm weather rode out there twinkling and populous as a town but he stood looking at the sea a moment before he turned into the narrow stone passage that led to the gate of the house as a man may look with love on his horse that unruly and obstreperous has yet carried him so gallantly a girl came up the cobbled way from the town just as he turned in she had on a very simple linen dress that the wind blew close to her body and a flapping linen sunbonnet tied below her chin to prevent the wind capturing it she was tall and slight moved easily as with a boyish carelessness a very pleasant face also boyish and quite plain peered from under her flapping bonnet her hands were noticeable they were large but extremely well shaped and the fingers showed both perception and efficiency it may be remarked that archie had never noticed her hands at all hullo jess said he im just back lord ive had such a ripping afternoon and the cigarettes are quite dry where have you been just down into silorno cousin marion wanted a telegram sent about their sleepingberths tomorrow archie frowned he had noticed that jessie was often sent on errands people who can absolutely be relied on usually are i should have thought my mother might have sent pasqualino he observed the girl laughed oh she wanted to but i said i would go instead you see cousin marion and helena were getting in what might be called rather a state about you i tried to infect them with my own calm but they wouldnt catch it so i thought a little walk would be pleasant oh was helena frightened asked archie rather greedily yes so was cousin marion i wasnt then you were beastly unsympathetic i had an awful shave getting into the harbour remarked archie but you knew what you were about and i didnt nor did helena so i preferred to have confidence in you and go for a walk rather than observe you in what looked remarkably like danger archie had walked up from the landingstage with his shoes and his coat under his arm the coat was too wet to put on so he dusted his feet with it and resumed his shoes oh a ripping afternoon he said again the sound of the clanging gate into the castello was heard out in the garden and as they walked up the dim stoneflagged passage that led out into it another girl came running in she like her sister was tall and slight but there the resemblance altogether ended a delicate smallfeatured face entirely feminine gleamed below yellow hair her eyes set rather wide apart giving her an adorably childish look opened very widely below their dark eyelashes beside her jessie looked somewhat like a wellbred ploughboy oh archie she cried how horribly rash of you your mother and i have had a terrible halfhour i bring you cigarettes to soothe your disordered nerves said archie sententiously i am happy to say that they are dry though i am not jessie had walked on with that pleasant expression on her face that might or might not be a smile and the two were left alone for a moment as if i cared about the cigarettes she said you did this morning but you werent really anxious were you indeed i was you were naughty to sail back in this gale do be good now and change your clothes at once i will bring you some fresh tea into the garden cousin marion and i have had tea we drank cup after cup to fortify ourselves and looked over the wall at your boat between each sip then we trembled and had another sip before you got past that horrid rock we had drained the teapot and broken our chairs with our tremblings the strict veracity of this entertaining summary did not of course concern archie it was sufficient that it had helenas light and picturesque touch it made a tableau that caused him to smile to himself as he changed his shirt that was now stiffening with salt and put on a pair of socks over his tanned feet all this he did hurriedly for it was the last evening so he told himself that they would all be together by which he really meant that it was the last evening on which helena would be here since tomorrow at break of dawn she and his mother would start for england leaving jessie harry travers and himself to follow after another fortnight when a week before that scheme had been suggested it seemed to archie the most admirable of plans since though his mother and helena would be gone he would secure another fortnight of intercourse with his beloved sea instead of inhabiting that smoky cave known as london but since then helena had begun to dawn on him though as yet it would be an exaggeration to say that he was in love with her but she was dawning her light illuminated the sky above the horizon and if the plan was to be suggested again to him in his present attitude of attracted expectancy it is probable that he would have voted for london and helena rather than an extension of his days at the castello the scheme had originally been helenas and like all her plans had been exceedingly well thought out before it was produced in the guise of an impulse prompted by kindliness and thought for others it was when edited as an impulse of the simplest and most considerate sort the hot weather did not really suit cousin marion so why should not cousin marion go back to england with herself helena as travelling companion of course silorno was the most delicious place and she would be ever so sorry to go but certainly cousin marion felt the heat and though she was far too unselfish to suggest breaking up the party she would be glad to go northwards earlier than the end of june when her two months tenancy expired helena had produced this plan to archie one morning as they sat after breakfast under the stonepine but my mother would not in the least mind going home alone if she preferred to go before the end of june he said helena shook her head oh i know she would say she didnt mind she said or she would stop on in spite of her headaches sooner than break up the party has she been having headaches asked archie yes but you mustnt know that she told me not to tell any one said helena with complete selfpossession promise archie all right helena felt quite safe now so she must go back sooner than at the end of june she continued and clearly i am the right person to go with her for she hates travelling alone oh well all go then said archie it isnt the least necessary jessie or i must go with her for she certainly wouldnt hear of your going and jessie is enjoying this so much that i couldnt bear that she should have her days here cut short so its for me to go thats awfully good of you said he only as yet half convinced it isnt the least its a necessity though you are so kind as to make a virtue of it and then theres this as well cousin marion would never consent to go if she thought it was for her sake that i was going with her so you must go to her and say you think that its me whom the heat doesnt suit and you will see if she doesnt say at once that she will go back with me and the real reason for her going will be our secret just yours and mine archie looked at her for a moment in silence and the silence was one of unspoken admiration somehow this kindly thoughtful plan kindled his appreciation of her beauty her beauty took on a tenderer and more touching look before now it had vaguely occurred to him that of the two sisters it was jessie who most gave up her own way to serve the ways of others but this secret of helenas made him feel that he had done her an injustice but i dont want you to give up your time here if you enjoy it he said ah dont make me tell a fib and say that i dont enjoy it she said i will if you press me ill say it bores me frightfully sooner than give up my plan well i think its wonderfully kind of you he said now im to tell my mother that you are feeling the heat and see what she says is that it yes just that said helena archie had strolled indoors to put this plan to the test and before he returned a quarter of an hour later with his mother helena had approved of her own ingenuity very warmly she had if her scheme succeeded secured for herself an additional fortnight of the london season for she and jessie were for the present going to make their home with their cousins and she was already satisfied that her unselfishness had made a considerable impression on archie this was the most important thing hitherto she felt she had failed to make her mark so to speak he was on excellent friendly terms with her just as he was with jessie but she wanted or at any rate wished for something more than that it was not that she wanted him to flirt with her she had much more serious ends in view she wanted and here was her perspicacity to dazzle his eyes by means of touching his heart for she guessed with clearsighted vision that he was the kind of young man who if he did not mean everything would mean nothing and she believed that she could not entangle his affection by mere superficial appeals and indeed she was not a flirt herself she was poor and clever and attractive and she proposed to use her cleverness and attraction in the legitimate pursuit of securing a husband who was not poor that archie was now lord davidstow and at his fathers death would be lord tintagel was in his favour and to make an impression on him and then to go selfsacrificingly away seemed to her a very promising manoeuvre she was not in the least afraid of leaving jessie with him for with her habitual adroitness she had conveyed to her sister by little sighs glances and words that seemed to escape from her lips unawares what her design yet without making it appear a design on archie was she had but allowed her feelings all unconsciously to betray themselves as when she said darling wouldnt it be lovely to be archies sister instead of only cousin that put it quite plainly enough and she felt sure that jessie understood and in addition to this impregnable safeguard of jessies loyalty she was satisfied that jessies friendliness with archie was of the most unsentimental character indeed to speak of her sense of security with regard to jessie would be a labouring of the point she was so secure that her security scarcely struck her any more than the security of a house consciously strikes its inhabitant the week that had passed between the acceptance of her plan and this the last night of her stay at silorno confirmed the soundness of her strategy archies frank friendliness towards herself had undergone a subtle change while his relations with her sister remained precisely on the same calm tableland of comradeship but below his comradeship with herself like the sun glowing faintly through a mist without heat at present but with penetration of light she knew that there was growing an emotional brightness it was with light and with a nameless quickening that his eye dwelt on her and now as they sat in the deep dusk of the garden illumined only by the stars that twinkled like minute golden oranges in the boughs of the stonepine she knew that he was looking at the pale wraith of her face which was all the starlight left her with in a manner that was not yet a week old it was so dark here in the deep shade that she saw nothing of his suntanned face beyond a featureless oval but when from time to time he drew on his cigarette it leaped into distinctness there was emotion there or at any rate the stuff from which emotion is made there was need not yet wholly conscious of itself but waiting like buried treasure to be released and on her side also something was astir behind her calculated plan she felt sorry until the wisdom of her project laid its calming hand upon her again that she was being so unselfish as to accompany cousin marion back to town it would have been extraordinarily pleasant to sit here many times more with archie and both watch and take part in the growth of the situation of which the seed had been deliberately planted by herself it was but a weak little spike as yet but undeniably there was the potentiality of growth in it suddenly his face leapt into light as he struck a match and the gain of a fortnights london season seemed to her insignificant and the success of her plan the wisdom of which she still endorsed was but a frigid triumph for she felt to a degree yet unknown to her his personal charm oh archie i wish i wasnt going away she said it has been a nice time i wishno i suppose thats selfish of me i want to know what is selfish of you said he do you well as its our last evening you shall i wish i thought you would miss me more he moved just a shade closer to her oh i shall miss you quite enough he said she laughed i dont think you will she said youll have your bathing and your boating and your writing i expect you will have a very jolly time he seemed to think over this yes i shall have all those things he said and i like them why shouldnt i butno like you i wont say that but i did she remarked well i will too i shall miss you much more than i should have missed you if you had gone away a week ago she too hesitated a moment then very coolly she replied thank you very much there was calculation in that she had thought over her polite chilly manner swiftly but carefully and she had calculated rightly he chucked away the cigarette he had only just lit helena have i offended you he asked why do you speak like that again she traversed a seconds swift thought of course you havent offended me she said lightly youll have to try harder than that if you want to offend me my dear do try again try to make me feel hurt archie was a little excited there was some small intimate contest going on that affected him physically with secret delight just as he was affected in his limbs by some crosscurrent to the direction of his swimming or in his brain by the tussle for the word he wanted when he was writing he was sparring with something dear to him try to hurt me she said softly very well said he im glad youre going away tomorrow will that do she laughed again it would do excellently well if you meant it she said but you dont mean it youre very hard to please said he not in the least if you want to please me say that youll be very glad to see me again in a few weeks i certainly shall but i shant say it you know it quite well enough without my assurance she leaned forward a little but say it all the same archie she said say it quite out loud archie threw back his head and shouted at the stonepine i shall be very glad to see you again inwhat was itin a few weeks he cried ah that is nice of you no im not sure that its nice because youve brought jessie and mr harry out into the garden that seemed to be the case for undeniably the two moved out into the bright square of light cast from the lit passage within archie got up swiftly and suddenly with a bubble of laughter oh lets be like the garden scene in faust he whispered dont you know when the two couples wander about ah theyve seen us they dont do that in wellconducted opera this was true enough for immediately helenas name was called by her sister she gave a little sigh yes darling she said cousin marion thinks its time you went to bed said jessie and is archie there too she wants to see him archie and helena exchanged a quick glance in the darkness they knew it rather than saw it helena at any rate was quite certain of it i must go in then he said your fault for making me shout helena recollected a revue that she and archie had seen together the woman pays she said in a histrionic falsetto and without further word ran into the house feeling very well satisfied with herself she was sure that she had made herself a little enigmatical to him had roused his curiosity decidedly he wanted to know more archie always slept in a hammock slung between the stonepine and the acacia in the garden for though that year which he had spent at grives with which our history of his childhood closed seemed to have eradicated the deadly seeds he was still recommended to pass as much of his time as possible out of doors the fourteen years that had elapsed since then had given him six feet of robust height and there seemed now but little danger of the hereditary foe again beleaguering him he had spent five years at eton and now had just finished his course at cambridge where he had contrived to combine classics and rowing in a thoroughly satisfactory manner distinguishing himself in each even as he seemed to have outgrown his physical weakness so too he had outgrown to all appearance those strange abnormal experiences which had been his in childhood his power of automatic writing and the inexplicable communications from his dead brother certainly since his fourteenth year there had been no more of them it was as if they had belonged entirely to the years when he trailed the clouds of glory that hang about childhood but even now in the normal vigour of his young manhood they did not seem to him to be in the least unreal indeed they were to him in spite of their fantastic and unusual nature the most substantial treasures in his storehouse of memory the difference was that now they were sealed up some key had been turned on them in his interior life and they were inaccessible to him but never for a moment did he doubt that they were there out of reach they might be but he still possessed them and though he made no effort to unlock the door he believed that the key to them was neither lost nor broken but rusted maybe with unuse still existed within him some day he felt sure the impulse would come to him either from without or within to search for it and he knew precisely where with every prospect of finding he would look for it for he still had the power of letting himself lapse into that trancecondition in which he sank into a depth of sunlit waters and in that mysterious abyss he knew he could find the key to the sealed treasures it was long since he had penetrated there but he knew his way tonight as he lay in his hammock he felt no wish or inclination to sleep but lay with eyes open looking into the sombre dark of the pine above his head where the stars twinkled at the edge of the needles of the foliage the gale that had raged that afternoon had blown itself out not a breath of breeze sighed in the pine and of the fierceness of those uproarious hours there was nothing left but the everdiminishing thunder of the waves three hundred feet below from horizon to zenith the sky was bare and kirtled with stars and to the east over the hills across the bay the dovecolour that precedes the rising of the moon was soaking through the heavens a faint odour from the thicket of tobaccoplants that grew at the foot of his hammock were spreading through the air ineffably fragrant and the dew brought with it the smell of damp and fruitful earth archie lay quite still content to rest without sleep he was sure that he would go to sleep soon imperceptibly to himself and he waited quite tranquilly for the soft tide to engulf him letting his memory hover now and then over his adventures of the afternoon but always bringing it back to the halfhour he had sat with helena close to where he now lay he had as sleep approached the vague sense of sinking into some quiet depth but his mind was too tranquilly disposed to do more than register this impression and then quite suddenly without the transition state of drowsiness he went fast asleep he had noticed just before that the moon had risen he slept long and dreamlessly and then began to dream with extraordinary vividness he dreamed that he had not gone to sleep at all but still lay in his hammock in the shade of the pine while the garden outside was full of the white blaze of the moonlight and ebony clearcut shadows the thunder of the surf had quite died away the tobaccoplants still gave out their odour and the stars a little quenched by the moon had faded in the boughs of the pine and then he perceived but with no sense of strangeness that there was something new in the garden for close to the door into the house was standing a white marble statue this brought his legs over the side of his hammock and he got up to go and look at it and then remembered so he thought all about it it was the statue of helena which she had told him was a gift from her to him and it did not seem at all unnatural that it should have been brought out and put in the garden but as he had not seen it yet he walked now across to it and found an admirable and lovely figure it was clad in a long greek chiton low at the throat and reaching nearly to her feet which were sandalled one hand was advanced to him with a beckoning gesture the other with its exquisite arm bare to the shoulder hung by her side the statue was lifesize for as it stood on its low marble plinth the face was just on a level with his exquisite in its fidelity and its beauty was that small head on its slender neck and it endorsed the message of her beckoning hand the lips uncurled in a halfsmile mysteriously invited him the body too was a little inclined forward towards him next moment surely she would step down from her pedestal and like galatea shake off the semblance of stone and declare herself his standing there entranced and strangely excited archie drank in the amazing loveliness of the figure white and flawless without speck or stain the snow of the parian quarries gleamed in the moonlight and then he saw that just where the neck flowed with the strength and tenderness of a river into the shoulders there was a small dark spot and taking a step nearer he put out his hand to flick it away but it did not come away it was as if some little excrescence had stuck to the marble and making a second attempt he felt that it was soft and that it grew a little longer it moved too it wriggled like the head of a worm and then with a faint feeling of disgust he saw that it was indeed the head of a worm protruding from the marble just as a worm comes up through earth even as he looked there came another such speck near the mouth this also grew and wriggled then came another on the arm which was put forward to welcome him archie stood there transfixed no longer by admiration and wonder but by an evergrowing sense of horror everywhere from face and hair and hand and from the folds of the lovely greek drapery there started out those loathsome reptiles some nightmare of catalepsy invaded him he could not move he could not call out he could not turn away his eyes but he had to watch until where lately this masterpiece of lovely limbs had stood there was a column as high as himself of wriggling corruption bred apparently from within then horror adding itself to horror this portent of decay began to move slowly towards him still he could not move but at last when it was not more than a foot or two from him he found his voice and could scream for help he could just hear himself shouting but no help came already he could feel the touch of those horrible things and with a supreme effort he managed to move his head away from that myriad loathsome touch and lo he was seated upright in his hammock and the moon was low in the west and over the eastern hills was the light that preceded day his face streamed with the agony of the nightmare he sat still a little while drinking in reassurance from the miracle of the tranquil dawn and wondering at the suddenness with which he had gone to sleep so that his disquieting dream had seemed the uninterrupted continuation of his consciousness and as his fright faded there faded also the memory of what his dream had been there had been something about a statue something about worms something connected with helena even as he thought about it it continued to recede from him and before he dozed off again the whole thing had slipped out of his memory and when an hour later he got up to accompany the travellers on their early start as far as the station there was nothing whatever left of it he knew only that he had awoke in a state of inexplicable terror arising from some dream which had vanished from his memory like a mist at dawn the three left behind adjusted themselves as friends can do to their narrowed circle and moved sensibly closer to each other they all had their tasks to sweeten the enjoyment of their leisure for to jessie fell the marthacares of the house which she transacted by the aid of an italian dictionary with the cook assunta to harry travers now a junior don at cambridge the preparation of a course of history lectures next term to archie the incessant practice in the endless and elusive art of writing prose the love of expressing what he loved in words was no less than a passion with him and it is almost needless to add that the sea was his inspiring theme he certainly had the prime essential of devotion both to his subject and to the technique of his art and these little essays called idylls of the sea promised if ever he could persuade himself to finish them to be a really exquisite piece of work they were the simplest sketches of fishers and ships and the like but to satisfy him the sea had to sound in every line of them even as it sounded in the ears of those about whom he wrote just now he was trying to recapture all that had made the ecstasy to him of that risky voyage homewards across the bay a few days before and to fire his words with that thrill which he never quite despaired of communicating as a rule their day arranged itself very regularly early breakfast was succeeded by a couple of hours of task and a couple more were spent in bathing no affair of hurried undressing of chilly immersion and a huddling on of clothes but of long baskings on the shore and a milelong ploughing for archie at least out into the bay or along the coast and round beyond the furthest promontory much though he liked the companionship of the others he was never sorry when first jessie and then harry turned shorewards again for the companionship of the sea was closest to him when he was alone he would burrow his way through it on the sidestroke buried in the foam of his progress and when exhausted and breathless turn on to his back to be cradled and rocked by it secure in its enveloping presence even as in the days of childhood he would lie happy and serene in the knowledge that blessington was close by him or he would dive deep and see through the fallen day the dazzle of the sun of the surface far above him and then swim up again and after the greenness and the paleness below find a red and glowing firmament but best of all was it to swim out very far from land and then just exist with arms and legs spread wide encompassed and surrounded by mere sea he did not want to think about anything at all or to belabour his brain with strivings to cast into words the seasense that would come afterwards when with gnawed pencil and erased sentences he sat in the garden but he only opened himself out to it and drank it in through eye and ear and skin and widespread limbs and all this even when physically he most realized this seasense was but a symbol and the more vivid the physical consciousness of the sea became the dimmer it also became in the light of what it stood for for even as the sea eternally incorruptible received into itself without stain all that the putrefying land with its ordure and sewers poured into it so round human life with its sores and its decay there lay an immense and eternal incorruption which purified all life as it passed into it and turned it into something pellucid and immortal dying would be like that dying was no more than being poured into this jubilant ocean and becoming part of its clean exuberant life but archie had no intention of dying just yet and indeed these metaphysical speculations only reached him like the sound of chimes blown across the water while far clearer was harrys voice calling from the beach archie its after twelve and thereupon archie would turn on his chest and swim back to land with a frill of foam encircling his sunburnt throat and a wake of bubbles following the strokes of his strong legs thereafter he would cast himself onto the beach with a straw hat tipped over his eyes and his suntanned legs and arms spread starfish fashion and lie there drinking in the sun while harry and jessie reviled him for causing lunch for which they hungered to be again half an hour behind the scheduled time and archie lighting a cigarette turned on his elbow and called them greedy hogs for thinking about lunch when it was possible to lie in the sun and swim in the sea then as likely as not he would himself be aware of a celestial appetite and step into a pair of flannel trousers and a seastained shirt and in turn revile their tardiness in climbing the olived terraces that lay between them and the castello they lunched in the garden in a strip of shade outside the house and thereafter without any pretence at all about the matter harry and jessie went to their rooms for an honest italian siesta with no excuse of lying on beds and reading but with the avowed object of lying on beds and sleeping but this two hours swimming and basking and communion with the sea instead of making archie sleepy gave him his most productive hours of work and wideeyed and eager he would sit with jotted notes and scribblingpaper round him read over the last few pages of his current story and correct and erase and rewrite with an unquenchable optimism there would be moments of despair moments of wrestling with a recalcitrant sentence when he walked about in the blaze of the sun and bit his pencil till his teeth cracked through into the lead moments of triumph when the impalpable sensation he wished to record seemed to surrender itself to the embrace of verbs and adjectives up till teatime when the others shuffled or so he termed it out of the house after their slumbers he tasted the glories and the travail of creation or it might be the pangs of fruitless labour but he knew at any rate the joys of ecstatic mental activity on one such day some weeks after his mother and helena had gone back to england he felt himself fit to burst with all that he had stored within him ready for expression as they drank their coffee he had employed himself in sharpening a couple of pencils for the work of transcription into ink came later in the day so as not to interrupt by any physical intrusion the flow of all he knew was ready to be crystallized into words sometimes the least distraction broke some kind of thread when he was in communication with the sea it may be added that no one was ever less pompous about his aspirations today harry observed the sharpening of the pencils and commented so a masterpiece is signalled archie he said archie blew the leaddust from his finger quite right old boy he said lord im full of great thoughts do go to bed and then ill begin jessie joined in archie do let me hold your pencils for you she said like dora in david copperfield i shall feel as if i was doing something archie laughed you would be he remarked you would be making an uncommon nuisance of yourself you are polite no im not im rude im being rude on purpose i want you to be offended and go away i want harry to go away too i want you both to lie on your beds and snore like hogs i was thinking of getting a book and reading out here said jessie i feel its unsociable to leave you alone when youve finished being funny remarked archie you may go to bed you may get down at once say your grace and get down you too master harry oh harry do you remember how you used to come to tea in the nursery and blessington made us behave properly till tea was over then did you behave improperly asked jessie i dont think we did really once we went into the shrubbery and changed clothes at least i put on yours but you couldnt put on mine because they were too small thats what browning calls times revenges i couldnt put on yours now could i the italian authorities would prosecute me for indecency lord what a little fellow you are harry time for a little fellow to go to bed oh dont rag i never said you werent strong yes jessie youre strong too and its like a girl to pull my hair ah do shut up archie had reasonable cause for complaint jessie had suddenly come behind him and taken a great handful of touzled hair into her grasp so that archies head was held immovable while harry tickled his ribs you can do nothing with your arms if your head is held quite still presently the wicked ceased from troubling and archie was left alone but after jessie had gone to her room she stood still a moment before making herself comfortable for her nap and then she laid across her nose and mouth the outspread hand that had grasped archies hair in her fingers there remained some faint odour of warm seasalt and as by a separate memory of their own there remained in them the sense of their closing over that brown bright springy handful chapter vi archie thought no more either of his tickled ribs or his outraged hair when his friends had definitely removed themselves and with a sigh of delight he took up a sharpened pencil and a block of scribbling paper he had grasped something he thought this morning that must instantly be committed to words before he even read over his last page or two for his hand starved and itched to be writing there was an odd trembling in his fingers and his conscious brain was full of what he wanted to say but when he put his pencil on to the block and concentrated his mind on that liquid message of the sea that had reached him today he found that his hand had nothing to write his brain was full of what he wanted to write but his hand disowned the controlling impulse again and once again he cast the thought in his brain into reasonable language but there his hand still stayed as if some signal was against it simply it would not proceed archie had known similar obstacles before though they had never been so strong as this probably the thought was not yet clarified enough and for that the usual remedy was a stroll about the garden a look at the sea from the parapetted wall he tried this returning again with a conviction that now he would be able to give words to the impression that was so strong in his conscious brain and as he took up his pencil again again his hand seemed to be yearning to write there was that corallipped anemone at the edge of the water there was a shoal of little fishes which as they turned became a sheet of dazzling silver all that was ready for the hand that twitched in expectancy but again his hand would have nothing to say to that the brainsignal showed itself to an uncomprehending instrument suddenly and with distaste archie perceived what was happening and divorcing from his mind the message that his brain was tingling to convey he let his mere hand untroubled by a fighting consciousness do what it chose it was no longer in his own control something somebody else possessed it but it was with conscious reluctance that he resigned this mechanism to the controlling agent who was not himself he watched with absolute detachment the words that came on his paper in a firm upright handwriting quite unlike his own archie you have had a warning his hand wrote now you must manage for yourself i shall watch but i maynt do more you have got to do your best and your highest thats the root of probation but i am always your most loving brother when you were a child i could reach you then followed some meaningless scribbles but its martin the pencil gave a great dash across the paper and instantly archie knew that his hand had returned to its normal allegiance at once the seathoughts that had occupied him seethed and roared in his brain and his hand was straining to put them down he tore off the involuntary message from his block and laying it aside plunged with all the force of his conscious self into this ecstasy of conveying with black marks on white paper all that had obsessed him this morning as he swam out to sea and lay between sun and water the happiest of earthly animals and the nearest to the key of the symbol then after a halfhour of pure interpretation that was finished too and he lay back in his chair and picked up the martinmessage again it seemed a nonsensical affair when he so regarded it what was his warning after all what did that mean he had had no warning of any sort but it was strange that after all those years of silence martin should come to guide him again though at the selfsame time he told him not to look for further guidance archie put the paper with its wellremembered upright handwriting back on the table again lay back in his long chair drowsy and fatigued after his spell of fiery writing almost at once sleep began to invade him the outline of the stonepine etched against the sky grew blurred as his eyelids fluttered and closed and then without pause or transition he saw a white statue standing close to him on the neck of which there wriggled the tail of a worm protruding from the fair white surface and instantly his forgotten dream leaped into his mind with a pang of horror that was what his dream had been there had been a statue standing just there white in the moonlight and even as he worshipped and adored it with love and boundless admiration those foul symbols of decay had wreathed about it next moment he plucked himself from his dozing and there was no statue there at all but the far more comfortable figure of jessie standing in its place with laughter in her eye oh thats what you do archie she said when you pretend to come out into the garden to work and despise harry and me for sleeping archie jumped up from his chair and brandished in her face the pages of his consciously written manuscript the leaf on which the message from martin was written still lay apart from those on the table i may have closed my eyes for one second he said but ive written all that since lunch oh its got the sea in it jessie i really believe theres the sea there ill read it you this evening if youll apologize for saying that i go to sleep instead of writing she picked up the other leaf yes i apologize she said though you were asleep when i came out but i want to hear what youve written so i apologize for having thought so and theres this other page as well archie took it from her that doesnt belong he said that he paused a moment do you remember what i told you about the messages i used to have from martin when i was a child he asked jessie nodded yes and they have ceased altogether for years havent they she said quickly until today just now half an hour ago i had another but i cant make anything out of it he tells me that ive had a warning i dont know what it means jessie felt all the habitual contempt of the thoroughly normal and healthy mind for anything akin to psychical experiences all ghosts in her view were to be classed under the headings of rats or lobstersalad all such things as tabletappings and the doings of mediums under the heading of trickery but knowing what she did of archies childish experiences she could not put them down as trickery and so was unable exactly to despise them as fraudulent for that very reason she rather feared them they made her feel uncomfortable she glanced at the paper he held out to her but without taking it oh archie i distrust all that she said i was really very glad when you told me that for all these years you had had no communication from him please dont have any more he laughed they had talked about this before but you dont understand he said it has nothing to do with my wanting or not it just comes this afternoon i couldnt help writing any more thanthan one can help sneezing you can if you rub your nose the wrong way said jessie flippantly no amount of rubbing my nose either the right way or the wrong way would have the slightest effect said archie the thing is imperative if martin wants me to write i must write but he says here that hes not going to guide me i must look after myself im sorry for that im not said jessie quickly theres something strange and uncanny about it im not sure that i think its right even she paused a moment archie do you really believe that it is the spirit of martin that makes you write she said are you sure he interrupted her i know what you mean he said its what the roman catholics teach that any communication of the sort given that it is genuine and not some mere mediumistic trick is not less than converse with some evil being impersonating masquerading as the spirit from whom the communication apparently comes do you mean that jessie frowned fingering the edge of the table yes i suppose i do she said i think the whole thing is dangerous i dont think its a thing to meddle with but i dont meddle with it said archie it meddles with me besides did you ever hear of such an unwarranted assumption mightnt i almost as well say that a letter which reaches me from my mother doesnt really come from her but from some evil creature impersonating her it seems simpler to suppose that it comes from her that her signature is genuine just as i believe martins to be do you really think that when i was a poor little consumptive chap at grives i was really possessed by an evil spirit isnt that rather too horrible an imagining a nice state the next world must be in if that sort of thing is allowed i dont for a moment think it is can you reconcile with the idea of supreme love governing and creating all life the notion that there behind the scenes there are evil and awful beings who can get leave to communicate with a child as i was pretending to be the spirit of the brother i never knew does it sound likely jessie paused a moment again she hated the subject she hated the idea of archies being concerned in these dim avenues to the unseen she had for herself a perfectly unreasoning and childlike faith that there was this world and the next world and that god reigned supreme over both but somehow it offended this instinctive attitude that the next world and those who had gone there should be mixed up with this world they were not dead she did not think they had ceased to exist but they had done with this world and it was something like a profanity to meddle with them but then archie had not meddled as he most truly said they seemed to have meddled with him their meddling had stopped altogether for a dozen years and here on this halfsheet of paper was the evidence that something of the sort had begun again i thought you had dropped all interest in it she said i thought it was all finished like a childish fairystory like the abracadabra legend cousin marion told me about oh theres tea shall we have tea pasqualino had spread their table underneath the stonepine and she hailed this as a possible dismissal of the whole affair she did not want to talk any more about it and if below her silence there should lurk a fear she preferred to cover it up not examine it archie got up certainly let us have tea he said perhaps your mind will be clearer after tea im not going to quit the question jessie the historian is at his histories and we shall be alone you and i and i want to talk it out something has happened you see this afternoon martinor somebodyhas written again you were quite right to imagine that for me the whole thing was finished had become an abracadabramyth as you said as far as normal life goes i thought it had too but i always knew that it might come back and it has come back without my asking for it though ithesays hes going to leave me alone but after all he says youve got to do your best and your highest now i ask you as a reasonable female does that look like a message from a devil no its martin all right bless him but lets have tea they moved across into the shadow of the pine where the table sparkled with the specks of stray sunshine that filtered through the boughs and jessie sane and normal held on to those evidences of the kindly ordinary human life as an anchor to prevent her drifting out into perilous seas but to archie no seas were perilous they might engulf his body and drown him and as it seemed to him they might engulf his spirit but they were not perilous in his view they were just the sea the great encompassing presence archie you are so odd she said knowing that he meant to have the subject talked out and that his will dominated hers you spend the day bathing and sailing and writing you eat and you sleep and then suddenly you spring a surprise upon me and show me a letter you have had from martin which is you the surprise or the archie that i know archies mouth was extraordinarily full of rusk and cherryjam he politely disposed of them before replying but theyre both me he said of course we have all two existences dual personality she asked dual fiddlesticks what i mean is that in everybody there is the conscious self and the subconscious self but they do not make a dual personality but one personality most peopleyou for instance or harry or my mothertransact everything through the conscious personality for all practical purposes your subconscious self doesnt exist but in some and im one of themthe subconscious self is accessible i can reach it if i want i can make it act it is the essential life which we all of us contain and as such it is that part of ourselves with which the essential life of those who have quitted this unessential life can communicate martin doesnt communicate with that part of me which directs and controls my conversation with you he speaks to my subconscious self and by some rather unusual arrangement my subconscious life can speak to my conscious life and convey what he says to my hand or as once happened when at grives i heard him call me to my ear i am a medium in fact though that would usually suggest something charlatanish i can bring my subconscious life to the surface sometimes as when martin speaks to it it comes to the surface of its own accord with strong compulsion over my conscious self he paused a moment its all very odd he said until this afternoon my subconscious self had lain quite quiet for years now suddenly it asserts itself and produces that page of writing because martin talked to it and told it to make my hand write what other explanation is there unless indeed you imagine that i have merely perpetrated a silly hoax but i swear to you that something outside myself made me write baldly stated it was martin who spoke to my subconscious self and my subconscious self said to my conscious self take a pencil and write i know that is so once again jessie had to anchor herself against this current running out to sea there was archie sitting opposite her large and brown and hungry talking of things which were altogether fantastic unless they were dangerous and somehow they were not either fantastic or dangerous to him they were as ordinary as the cherryjam which he was so profusely eating she had suddenly come on a great undiscovered tract of country dubious and full of dangers i dislike it all she said im too ordinary i suppose mymy subconscious self doesnt act you would say but what proof is there that there is such a thing as the subconscious self why should i suppose that there is anything of the sort i have no reason to suppose it it is all nonsense archie laughed my dear jessie he said you are arguing not with me but with yourself you have an uneasy conviction that i am right not a bit she said i want a proof archie rubbed his hand over his head i wonder how i can give it you most easily he said of course there are lots of ways though it is quite a long time since i have practised any of them he thought for a moment well heres one he said the subconscious selfto talk more nonsense as you sayis practically unlimited by the material laws of the world it is a sort of xray a sort of wireless i can set my subconscious self to work and i will to prove its existence to you his voice sank a little and jessie saw that his eyes were fixed on a bright speck of sunlight that gleamed on the tablecloth a sudden ridiculous terror seized her dont archie she said its such nonsense it isnt nonsense said he quietly and you mustnt be such a baby theres nothing to be frightened at as he spoke he took his eyes off the bright speck at which he had been staring and looked at her with his blue dancing glance what are you going to do she said whatever you like let me look at that bright spot there while you sit quiet for two minutes and ill tell you anything you choose think of something anything will do and ill tell you what youre thinking about oh just thoughtreading said she just thoughtreading but what is thoughtreading if you can remember what you thought about when you went up to your bedroom to sleep after lunch today for instance ill tell you that or there is harry writing his history lecture for next term at this moment ill tell you the words he is writing at least i think i shall be able to but im out of practice i have not cultivated the particular mood for years but i had it when i was a child and i expect i can get back into it jessie felt an extreme curiosity about this she had even as archie had said an uneasy conviction that he was right and for her peace of mind she longed to have that conviction shattered in her reasonable self she did not believe that archie could possibly tell her what harry was writing but behind that reasonable self sat something unreasonable which wanted to be convinced that this was all nonsense but you wont have a fit or anything will you she asked no pour boiling tea over me if i do and i shall come to myself but what are you going to do im going to look at something bright that spot of sun on the tablecloth will do then i shall just submerge like a submarine and tell you what harry is writing at this moment if that is the test you select what fun it all is i havent done it as i said for ever so long oh take a bit of paper and write down what i say i dont suppose i shall be able to remember it again his voice sank as he fixed his eyes on the bright spot he had indicated and jessie watching him pencil and paper in hand saw an extraordinary change come over his face for a few seconds it got troubled and his eyes stared painfully while his breath came quickly in and out of his nostrils then he grew quite quiet again his mouth smiled and he spoke very slowly as if the words were dictated by a writer it is hopeless to try to comprehend in the whole he said the splendour of that unique age we can only think of it in fragments one afternoon there was a new play by sophocles another day pericles made the funeral oration for the fallen on another the great propylaea to the acropolis were finished socrates talked in the marketplace or supped with alcibiades in the space of a few years all those things happened and as yet more than twenty centuries have failed to grasp their full significance and in this my last lecture to you archie rubbed his eyes and sat up he has finished for the present he said there was a stir in the room just above them where they sat in the garden and harry looked out any tea left he said archie looked up hullo harry he said i thought you were going to finish your lecture and not appear till dinner i was but i think ill finish it up tomorrow bring it down and read us as far as youve got said archie jessie wont mind all right it got a little purplish at the end and thats why i stopped i hate purples he moved away from the window and archie spoke to jessie did i say anything he asked yes ive got it all down archie jumped up now youll see he said you wont sauce me again inin the wicious pride of your youth as mr venus remarked im sure i got through that time it was the knowledge that he had indeed got through that jessie took up to bed with her that night word for word harry had read out at the end of his lecture precisely the sentences that archie in that queer dreamy state had dictated to her just before harry had looked out of the window and asked if there was any tea left there was no room for doubt even as archie had said some piece of his mind had been able to divine exactly what harry was writing at that moment in his conscious state he could not know what that was but according to his own account certain people of whom he was one were able to direct not only their conscious selves but also the subconscious self that lay below it so he asserted was practically unfettered by material laws it could perceive what was happening at a distance at a spot invisible to it and it could penetrate as by some xray process into other minds for its free action in his case at any rate the conscious self had to be obliterated by looking at that bright spot on the tablecloth he had been able to put it to sleep to hypnotize it thus allowing the subconscious self to pass the portals where normally the conscious self kept guard and to do its errand so far there was nothing to disquiet her or make her uncomfortable it was as she had said just thoughtreading an example of a purely natural law which however dimly understood was fully admitted by scientific investigators no one except the most hidebound of pedants questioned the existence of the subconscious self and if here was an example of an abnormal development of it still there was nothing to fight shy of she had asked for a proof of its powers and undeniably she had got it but archie had gone far beyond that in his exposition of the powers of the subconscious self and it was this which caused her a very vivid disquiet through the subconscious self in those who had the gift of releasing it of allowing its activities could come so he believed communications from the individual consciousnesses which had passed out of the material world even as the subconscious self could get into touch with the thoughts of living people as she had seen for herself that afternoon so also could it get into touch with the thoughts of the dead it was thus so archie announced that when he was a mere child and knew nothing whatever of conscious and subconscious selves martin the brother whom he had never heard of used his hand to write with as if it was his own and with it wrote in the handwriting which had been his jessie fully believed in the survival of personality to her the socalled dead had but passed on to a further and higher plane of existence but there was to her something inexplicably repugnant in the notion that they could come back and speak or write to those who still lived on this plane of existence jessie lingered late by her window overlooking the bay trying to disentangle and lay bare the roots of her repugnance it was late below in the garden she could perceive the grey lines of archies hammock swung between the acacia and the pine and archie lying there like a chrysalis he was just like that she thought most of the world were only caterpillars eating their way through the allotted span of their years but archie was a stage more advanced than anybody she had ever known this world and the next were one to him not by any spiritual insight but from that instinctive conviction that there was really no difference between the living and the socalled dead it was not by any enlightenment through any stress of prayer and aspiration that he had arrived at that he had been gifted with it as a child he was a medium who by some special gift could talk to a brother who had died long years ago with just the same naturalness as he talked to her if he died tonight he would find nothing strange about it he would but burst his chrysalis hang for a moment weak and fluttering and then expand his wings but to most people death was an awful affair they were caterpillars they had to learn the intermediate stage which he was already familiar with and yet the fact that he was a stage more advanced coupled with it a sort of helplessness for him there he lay in his cocoon any evil thing might attack him jessie shook herself mind and body she was being fantastic in her fears and her misgivings and with set purpose she forced herself to drink in be penetrated by the assured serenity of the material world that lay spread before her above wheeled the stars in the silent sky and on the silent sea shone the constellations from the fishingboats the trees stood motionless in the holy summerhushed night beneath while though all seemed to sleep the great renewing forces of the world were ripening the olives and enriching the twisted buds that would flower in fresh harvest of azure on the morning glory when the sun warmed them there was nothing to disturb her she could let her soul lie open to the night and think out the cause for her disquietude she hated the idea of commerce between the living and the dead there was the root of it the strangeness of the idea made it seem unnatural yet where if she examined it more closely was the unnaturalness why should not loving souls who had passed that tiny rivulet called death into the fuller life beyond be allowed to call from the other side to those they loved was there not something exquisite something supremely tender in the thought that martin who had been but little more than a child when he died in that swiss chalet should tell archie about the cache he had made under the pinetree it was a childish communication it brought no message of consolation or encouragement but it was just what martin had he been alive on this side of death might have told archie besides who knew that he did not give that as a test as a proof of his identity for surely nothing could have been devised so convincing and if god willed that the dead should be able under certain circumstances to speak from the sunlit beyond to those who still moved among material shadows who was she jessie to question so wonderful an ordinance and if he could speak like that to a young and innocent child why should he not continue to speak to his brother when he grew up she looked elsewhere for the grounds of her repugnance and for a moment thought she had found them for she had once been to a seance at the house of a professional medium and that afternoon still was vivid and degrading in her memory they had all sat round a table in a darkened room while the medium went into trance and instantly ridiculous knockings and melodies from a musicalbox began to resound in the gloom these were supposed to be played by spirits called durward and felisy who for some absolutely unconjecturable reason liked spending the afternoon in these puerile idiocies meantime the medium breathed heavily which was the only evidence that he was in trance at all and after a while said heres the dear cardinal in a husky voice and his niece who sat next him informed the circle that this was cardinal newman who like durward and felisy could find nothing better to do on the other side than attend these awful sittings for he always came when you paid your guinea to the medium and sat in the dark to encourage him they lifted up their voices at the suggestion of the mediums niece and sang lead kindly light which gratified him so much that he joined in singing the second verse and sang his own hymn to the tune given in hymns ancient and modern then when the hymn was over he made some moral reflections and blessed them in latin then there came materializations the head and shoulders of durward appeared in the middle of the table he was dressed in white and had a large black beard and round his ear the wire with which the beard was attached to his face was clearly visible during this the circle was warned to keep their hands touching all round the table for if any one made a break the consequences to the medium might be very serious since the spirit had built itself up from material derived from the medium and the electric fluid contributed by the sitters so if the electric fluid was withdrawn the material would not be able to get back into the medium who would completely collapse and possibly die though whether durward would thereupon again become a visible and permanent dweller on this planet was not explained by this time jessie had been so convinced of the wicked and profane fraudulence of all these proceedings that she furtively withdrew one of her hands and thus cut off the electric fluid altogether but durward didnt mind a bit but continued to tell them about the joys of paradise which according to his account must have been like the crystal palace erected in the middle of the botanical gardens and when he had regaled them enough he withdrew in the direction where the medium sat took off his beard and became felisy with a veil and an alto voice surely all this was enough to make one despair and contemn the whole idea of intercourse with spirits but jessie suddenly became aware of a basic illogicality in her position it was not intercourse with spirits she despised but those despicable swindlers who with the aid of false beards and musicalboxes pretended that they could materialize and cause communication with spirits she did not deride the memory of that afternoon because the spirits of cardinal newman and durward and felisy had moved among them but because they hadnt it was no use accounting for her repugnance towards genuine intercourse with spirits by her repugnance towards quacks and charlatans the whole history of spiritualism teemed with these undesirable gentry and these faked phenomena but they had no more connection with archie and his communications from his brother than had a forged banknote with the credit of the bank of england she found she did believe that the knowledge say of the cache beneath the pinetree came to archie from other than normal human sources it was known to no living being in the world so far as she could tell and if she looked for an explanation she must search for it in the supposition that the knowledge came to him from a living intelligence beyond the veil she intensely disliked being forced to that conclusion and now she knew why it was for the reason she had suggested to him this afternoon these things came from those regions those conditions of existence into which people passed when they died but in those regions there existed not only the souls of the dead who lived in an environment and under conditions at which we could not ever so faintly conjecture but other spirits some good some evil every good impulse that came into the hearts of men came from over there so too did every evil impulse that would blight if it could the garden of god and who knew whether the man who by that strange faculty which archie possessed of opening the doors of his subliminal self through which as he averred these messages came might not open them to other and evil things if possession by an evil spirit was a psychical possibility and certainly it was not more fantastically strange than such phenomena as archie could produce would it not be thus and in no other way that the evil possession would enter yet in childhood archie had in ignorance and in white defencelessness opened more than once the door of his soul and no harm surely had come to him was she being unreasonable full of fear where no fear was twittering with groundless and superstitious fancies there was yet another side to the question if the spirits of the dead could indeed return and speak of what they knew was it not worth while running some risk on the chance of the wonders they might tell of the existence which now was theirs whatever else might be of interest in human life supreme over all was any hint or fragment of information about the timeless and everlasting day that lay beyond the dawnings and settings of the sun nay more if to any one was given this wonderful gift by means of which voices could reach him from beyond the veil was it not his duty to use this endowment for the enlightenment and consolation of those who mourned and who sat in darkness god would never have bestowed so spiritual a gift on any if he did not mean it to be used the christian faith taught that the dead were alive in a wider sense than ever they had been on earth why then should it be forbidden to those who had this amazing gift to speak with them to learn about their life the roman church had fulminated its anathemas on galileo a thing scarcely credible to a more enlightened age it was more than possible that its pronouncements against this intercourse with the dead was but one instance the more of a similar cowardice and narrowness who could doubt that a man of science three hundred years ago would have been burned as a dabbler in diabolism and witchcraft if he had exhibited a manifestation of wireless telegraphy or an xray photograph but nowadays there was not a living being who did not rank such as the discoveries of a natural law the sorcery of one age was the science of the next jessie propounded this to herself and her reason could not find a flaw in it but something that sat behind her reasonsuperstition it might be or instinct or spiritual perceptionrefused to accept the conclusion like a child afraid of the dark it trembled and hung back and no amount of logical assurance from its nurse no amount of demonstration that the room when dark contained only the familiar things which the light made manifest could reassure it it didnt like the dark nothing could persuade it that danger did not lurk in blackness well it was no use going over all the ground again she knew it thoroughly now reason made no headway against instinct or instinct against reason and she swept the matter from her mind and tried to calm a certain intimate agitation that trembled there by letting her eyes pour into her soul the superb serenity of the italian night the moon had risen and spread across the bay a silver path to the edge of the world and in the sky the wheeling innumerable worlds kept sentinel over the earth never had she looked on a stillness more peaceful and more steadfast not a breeze stirred in the cypresses but in the thickets of ilex below the love that moved the sun and the other stars thrilled in the hearts of innumerable nightingales that love permeated everywhere the world was soaked in its peace and just then over the hills to the north there flickered a flash of lightning from some storm very far away long afterwards and scarcely audible came a muffled murmur of thunder jessie came downstairs next morning before either of the two young men were astir and indeed on going into the garden she found archie still serenely slumbering in his hammock in spite of the sun that filtered through the pinetree on to his brown face and curly head but perhaps some intangible shaft from her pierced down into the gulfs of sleep for immediately he sat up flushed with slumber like a child but fresh and brighteyed from his night in the open air hullo jess he said you down already i suppose id better get up is it shocking for a young lady to see a young gentlemans bare feet and his pyjamas if so you must shut your eyes now youre going to see them dont scream i shall said jessie you always wear patent leather boots and a furcoat when we bathe yes that is so but bear it for once lord what a morning he threw off his blanket and dangled his legs over the side of the hammock and instantly lit a cigarette archie why do you smoke before breakfast she asked because it makes me feel so jolly dizzy ah you cant guess how good a cigarette tastes when you have had nothing but your tongue and your teeth in your mouth for eight or nine hours hullo heres the post english papers who cares for what happens in england no letters for me two for harry and one for you goodbye i shant wash much because i shall bathe all the morning jessies letter proved to be from helena and its contents instantly absorbed her whole attention colonel vautier her father and lady tintagels first cousin had gone out to egypt over some government irrigation work and instead of coming back in june would be detained out there till september in consequence lady tintagel hoped that the two girls would live with her instead of going back to their fathers house till his return helenas comment on this was enthusiastic and also very characteristic darling jessie she said after the statement of this proposal i do hope youll say yes cousin marion encloses a note for you so youll see how much she wants us to and uncle jackive begun to call him uncle jack though he isnt an uncle at allgave quite a pleased sort of grunt when it was mentioned which means that he approves so dont be independent and say you would sooner go back to oakland crescent because ive simply set my heart on stopping here its horrible at home in the summer with the sun blazing into those little tiny rooms and the smell of greens flooding the house and it really would be a kindness to cousin marion she says so herself as youll find when you read her note and besides theres another reason which i know you can guess in fact i think its our duty to come and when duty takes the form of anything so pleasant as this there really is not the slightest reason for neglecting it and as im the youngest i feel that you should do as i want besides its the greatest fun here there are no end of dances and parties and dinners and there are horses to ride and motorcars im having the loveliest tune so it will be very selfish of you if you want to go home but i know you will say yes a charming enclosure from lady tintagel accompanied this i so much hope that you and helena will stop with us you must think of it as a great kindness to me for it will be the utmost comfort to me now that both my girls are married to have you two with me for the rest of the season i spoke to archie about it while we were at silorno so ask him whether he approves or not i hope all goes well with you is archie quite black yet from bathing send me a line as soon as you have thought it over helena is having the greatest success in town every one thinks her charming and admires her enormously jessie read this over as she waited for archie to rejoin her at breakfast there was every reason for accepting so cordial an invitation and it would give pleasure to helena to cousin marion and apparently also to archie she knew she would have to consent there was no cause that could be spoken about which she could possibly adduce for refusing a week ago that cause did not exist but now she wondered how she could bear to see helena and archie in the close companionship which this would imply and watch his feeling for her expanding from the bud into the flower if she had thought that helena loved him it would all be different but she felt certain that helena did not there for her was the poignancy of it in a manner that she could not explain jessie knew that she knew the tokens by which love betrays its existence she barely yet twentytwo had somewhere stored in her soul the language of love which it speaks even when it thinks it is dumbtalking in its sleep it may be she had seen in the last week of helenas sojourn here that archie talked to her like that there was neither speech nor language he said nothing of which the words betrayed his dawning passion but his love spoke in his silence even as the rosy clouds high above the earth herald the dawn it was her own knowledge that enlightened her she too knew the silent language and knew that archie conversed in it though no word came when he talked to helena something kindled behind his eye some secret alertness possessed him but there was the defencelessness and the blindness of love for when helena answered him she but pretended to talk the same tongue and jessie knowing it knew that she spoke a mere paltry gibberish it sounded the same or it looked the same but it was nonsense it was not authentic yet archie never talked in the secret tongue to jessie and in consequence she had never answered him in it today it seemed her native tongue when she talked to him and all she said must needs be translated out of that into the language of those who were friends dear friends but no more than friends all this was instantaneous she seemed to read it between the lines of helenas letter she recalled too between the lines the tokens that she knew archie would look at harry as they sat at dinner then at his mother then at her in order that in due time he might look at helena and when he spoke to any of them they never got more than one ear and an inattentive mind from him the other ear and the attention were always with helena helena knew that quite well no woman or girl could fail to know it and by way of response she had made this scythian retreat to england no doubt that was clever of her but in jessies opinion clever people are found out even sooner than stupid ones the only inexplicable folk are the wise and wisdom has very little to do with cleverness wisdom is perhaps the cleverness of the soul that looks down with pity on the manoeuvres of the mind archie made his absurd entry he had a dressinggown on perhaps some sort of abbreviated bathingdress and canvasshoes i didnt dress he said for wheres the use of dressing if you are going to undress again almost immediately arent you going to work this morning asked jessie no this one day as mr wordsworth said well give to idleness im going to bathe all the morning instead of half the morning i want a holiday i think im overworked whats happening in that foolish england if youve read the papers i havent said she suddenly his face changed he began to talk the secret language which jessie understood and helena counterfeited and what other news he asked you had a letter from somebody jessie pretended not to understand what she knew so well yes i did have a letter she said determined that archie should be more direct than this from helena or mother he said carelessly i havent heard from either of them except that telegram to say they had got home safely he was talking the secret language still the very carelessness of his tone betrayed it i heard from them both she said the letter was from helena and there was an enclosure from cousin marion archie said nothing in answer to this but it seemed to the girl that his silence was just as eloquent in the language without words eventually he remarked that harry was very late and jessie knew that he had beaten her he always did just because he had nothing with regard to her at stake archie i want to talk to you about what they have written to me she said talk away said archie i say what good little fishes jessie was not proposing to yield like that if he in the code of the secret language professed an indifference to what he was longing to hear she would be indifferent too to archies intense irritation she continued to talk about little fishes in a tone of great interest till harrys entrance she agreed they were very good probably they were fresh sardines caught last night by the fishers or were they and she could not remember the italian name of the other little fish which were so like sardines archies serene brow clouded and he but grunted a greeting to harry and next moment her heart smote her she knew how easily archie could put the sun out for her without meaning to do it but she had out of a sort of piqued femininity intentionally done the same for him she felt as if she had spoiled a childs pleasure he was so like a child but lovers were made of childstuff he got up almost immediately and full of a tender penitence she followed him one behind the other they went out into the garden where archie in a superb unconsciousness of her presence became instantly absorbed in the despised english papers archie she said he rustled with his paper oh erwhat he answered i wanted to talk to you about helenas letter she said only you would talk about sardines put that paper down i cant talk through the paper she noticed that he kept his finger on a paragraph and she would have betted her last shilling that he had no idea what that paragraph was about and though a moment before she had been penitent now she stiffened herself and determined that he should meet her more gracefully than that im sorry im interrupting you she said ill tell you some other time archie suddenly threw the paper into the air oh arent we behaving like idiots he said at heart i am and so are you really but ill confess im just longing to know what helena writes about but arent you an idiot too i shall like it enormously if you say you are i am an idiot too said the girl and cousin marion wants helena and me to live with her till father comes home she told me to ask you if you approved he leaned forward to her ah do jessie he said i hope you will i cant see why you shouldnt can you she looked straight into the eager blue eyes that were so close to hers for her there was a wealth of frankness and friendliness but the light in them was not for her and she knew it helena wants to she said does that mean that you dont he asked im sorry if that is so she got up no it doesnt mean that a bit she said its delightful of you and cousin marion to want us of course well come archie rose too thats perfectly ripping of you he said we shall be a jolly party we four quite suddenly a pause fell very awkwardly very constrainedly you see my father doesnt appear much he said at length thats what i meant he is very often in the country andwell we dont see him much archie soon took himself off to the sea armed with paper and pencils for with four hours in front of him there would be much basking to be done between his bathes already another of those seasketches was beginning to take shape in his mind and he found that there was no hour so fruitful in inspiration as when after a swim he returned to this empty sandy beach and lay spread out to the sun to be dried and browned and made eager for another dip so today after the first swim he lay for a while on his back with his arms across his face to shield his eyes from the glare and opened his brain so to speak to let the seathoughts invade it they came swarming in at his invitation and presently he turned over and propped himself on his elbow and began to catch them and pin them to his paper the rim of the sea with its weedfringed rocks its diaper of moving light in the shallow water the shoals of little fishes almost invisible one moment the next as they turned becoming a shield of silver flakes were all ready to be hammered into sentences and yet the hammer paused somehow at the back of his mind was a topic that inhibited his hand or would not allow the connection between hand and brain to be made and he thought he knew what this was for only this morning he had heard that helena was to be an inmate of their house in london yet it did not seem to be that which was preventing him and he wondered whether it was the thought of his father and his habitual intoxication which was always like a black background at home and which just for a moment had popped out into his conversation with jessie that hindered him but that again did not seem a sufficient cause for his inability to start the mechanism which translated thought into language and then he became aware that his fingers itched and ached to write with a compelling force which he knew well and yet only yesterday martin had said that he should not come to him again but the quality of the force seemed unmistakable and presently he yielded to that which he really had not the power to resist and wrote as his hand bade him write there were but a few sentences scribbled and then his pencil as usually happened when the message was complete gave a dash he had no notion what he had written and when it was finished he read it through archie i have come through this once more it said to repeat that you have been warned but i cant get through againmartin so here again was this inexplicable mention of a warning and archies conscious mind was blank with regard to any such warning but the repetition of it did not long occupy him for immediately he found that the inhibition between his brain and his hand was gone and sentence after sentence of his seasketch flowed through his fingers by degrees but not till a couple of his pages were full did the inspiration exhaust itself and then he lay back on the sand again full of the ecstasy that always accompanies the completion of a piece of work that has been done as the creator meant to do it bad or good it has fulfilled his intention his brain brooded over that for a little and then slipped back to the incident that had preceded it he could make nothing at all of it and determining to dismiss it from his mind and speak of it to nobody he tore up the sheet that contained the message buried the fragments in the sand and lay back again roasting himself in the sun soon that delectable warmth would increase on his bare limbs till they cried out for the cool embraces of the sea again and he would fling himself into it but just for a little longer he would stew and stupefy himself in the sun and with halfclosed eyes watch the vibration of the hot air over the beach and listen to the hiss of the ripples except for them the morning was extremely quiet the sun poured down over his outspread limbs the sea waited for him and as he lay there and dozed the memory of his evil dream went across his brain like a flash and vanished again already the italian days were beginning to draw to their sunny end they were numbered and could be easily counted both archie and jessie counted them when they woke in the morning and in the evening both said to themselves another day gone but their reflections on this diminishing tale and the colour of their emotions were absolutely opposed for while they both intensely enjoyed these italian hours jessie counted them with the grudging sense of a schoolboy who enumerates the remaining days of his holiday but to archie they were the days of termtime which still though enjoyable must be got through before the holidays began never before had he contemplated a stay in town with eagerness but now as he thought of her who would be living with them he had never been so expectantly enamoured of london at the close of their last day the divine serenity of june weather was troubled and as evening drew on the clouds which for a few hours past had been weaving wisps and streamers over the sky grew to a thick curtain that stretched from horizon to horizon it was of opaque grey but here and there in it were lines and patches of much darker texture as if it had been rent and had been darned again with a blacker thread instead of the coolness which succeeded sunset the heat clear no longer but impure like the air of a closed room got ever sultrier and for the refreshment of the evening breeze from the sea there was exchanged a stifling stagnation all life had gone out of the atmosphere it was as if some immense othello was smothering the world the air was heavy and charged with electricity but as yet no remote winking of lightning nor rumble of thunder showed that there was relief coming they had dined out in the garden where the candles burned unwaveringly in the stillness and afterwards had strolled to the far angle of the supporting wall of the fortress where if anywhere they might find some hint of movement in this intolerable calm but no breath visited them even there and the very bamboos that grew at the corner of the gardenbed were as motionless as if they had been made of lead archie mopped his streaming forehead if it interests anybody he remarked i may say that i am going to die i cant bear it any longer i think i shall die in about half an hour jessie fanned herself that did not do a particle of good it only seemed to make her hotter as when you stir the water in a hot bath but she tried to interest herself in archies approaching decease and are we to take your corpse back to england tomorrow she asked just as you like i shall have no more use for it lord and i havent finished packing yet fancy having to pack in this heat you neednt surely if youre going to die i must my immortal manuscript would be lost in the general confusion caused by my death or shall i go to bed it cant be hotter in my hammock than here yes i shall get into my pyjamas go to bed and do my packing in the morning he trailed off into the house and presently appeared again attired for bed and strolled across to them well ill wish you a goodnight he said but i very much doubt whether youll get it you neednt do the same to me for i know i shant and your wishes would be hollow he moved away again towards the stonepine where his hammock was hung a pale tall ghost of a figure against the blackness then quite suddenly some panic impulse seized jessie the result perhaps of her overstrung nerves and the overcharged atmosphere and she sprang up not knowing why wait a moment archie she cried dont gosomething is going to happen even as she spoke the whole world seemed enveloped in fire and the core of the fire a whitehot line plunged downwards into the stonepine which was rent from top to bottom absolute blackness filled with the deafening roar of the thunder and deluging rain succeeded and they rushed towards the shelter of the house for a moment they all three stood there recovering their balance from that tremendous crash and convulsion then archie with his soaked silk clinging close to his shoulders and legs turned to jessie i wonder why you called out to me he said what made you do it you saved my life i expect jessie laughed little as she was given to hysteria that laugh was halfway towards uncontrollable tears why i didnt want you to die in half an hour she said lightly but she remembered that moment when it came for her to save archies life indeed some inexplicable signal from love had flashed upon her that night and should flash upon her again chapter vii helena was having breakfast by the open window of her bedroom in her cousins house it was not yet nine in the morning and though she had been dancing till three oclock she had already had her bath and was feeling as fresh as if she had had eight instead of hardly more than four hours in bed outside the square was still empty of passengers and the pale primrosecoloured sunshine of a london june shone on a wet roadway and rainrefreshed trees for a shower had fallen not long ago and through the open window there came in the delicious smell of damp earth but she gave little heed to that or to the breakfast she was eating with so admirable an appetite for her brain cool and alert in this early hour was very busy over her own concerns soon she would have to go down to cousin marion and see if she could be of any use to her for it was quite worth while doing jobs for cousin marion as she always paid kindnesses back with a royal generosity and she must get some flowers to give a welcoming air to archies room who with jessie was expected back today that also would not be a waste of the time she might have spent more directly on herself she would get some for jessie too for she had the character of unselfish thoughtfulness to keep up it would be unnecessary to pay for them for she could get them at the shop where cousin marion dealed helena had enjoyed the most entrancing fortnight during which time she had occasionally thought of silorno and had oftener talked of it to cousin marion for she had that valuable social gift of appearing to talk with keen attention of one thing while she was thinking about something quite different she could easily interject dear archie it will be nice to have him back or darling jessie wrote me such a delicious letter she is enjoying herself and if cousin marion expressed a wish to see the letter it was equally easy to say that she had torn it up meantime her brain would be busy with recollections of the day before as they bore on her plans for the day to come they might go off on to tangents for brief spaces but her wellordered and singlypurposed mind was never long in recalling them to their main topic helena had made something of a sensation during these last weeks she was not beautiful but she was quite enchantingly pretty and her mind had the qualities which might rightly be supposed to underlie that delicious face and inform those slim graceful limbs nothing seemed to mar her goodnature and her superb gift of enjoying herself it was worth while being agreeable to everybody and if her lot happened for an hour or two a day to be cast with elderly bores she was indefatigable in her attention to them at the time and in telling their friends afterwards how immensely she had enjoyed talking to them it paid to do that sort of thing provided that it was done with a gaiety that made it appear genuine and spontaneous if your appreciation came bubbling out of you no one suspected you of design and she seemed the most designless delicious girl in london for it is next to impossible to see through an object that dazzles you to crown all these gifts she had the intensest power of enjoying herself and there is not another key that unlocks so many doors in this whirl and millrace of entertainment which characterized the last gay summer that london would see for long there was no time to make friends but only to take the scalps of enthusiastic acquaintances that perhaps was lucky for her but helena as she finished her breakfast recalled her mind from these shining experiences except in so far as they bore on the theme that insistently occupied her there was no doubt especially after that quiet talk in the paved garden outside the ballroom last night that bertie harlow was dazzled according to plan heaven only knew when he had last been to a ball for he was close on forty helena had naturally looked him up in a peerage since she liked to know about her friends and she felt pretty certain that he had danced with no one but her you could perhaps hardly call his share of the performance dancing he had stepped a measure and twice trodden on her toe but after all it did not matter whether your husband danced or not since naturally when those relations had been arrived at he would not dance with you many women no doubt when they were married would think it an advantage that their husbands did not dance since then they would not dance with anybody else but it was not in helenas nature prospectively to grudge him such amusements should he desire them when once she had got him but she had to get him first and to do that she had to keep him dazzled he must not get accustomed to her helena had a very strong belief in the desirability of simplifying life this did not in the least imply that she thought there was anything attractive in the simple life her simplification amounted to this that she formulated exactly what she wanted and then without deflection of aim did the very best with her efficient armoury of weapons to get it while the second clause in the simplification of life was to find out what irritated or bored you and with all your power eliminate it from your existence if you could not get what you wanted without getting something that bored you it was merely necessary to ascertain how the balance between these conflicting interests lay as practically applied to the case in hand she was aware that lord harlow bored her though not badly and that his nose irritated her that she would almost certainly get used to while on the other side of the scale were quantities of things she liked she liked immense wealth position and the liberty she would undoubtedly enjoy if she married this amiable man whom so many had tried to capture that in itself was an incentive to her pride and without being a snob she saw no objection to being a marchioness but here the simplification ended and a complication intruded itself it was not so long ago that she had sat under the stonepine with archie and seen his face glow in the darkness as he drew on his cigarette in point of attractiveness there was naturally no comparison between her cousin and this amiable middleaged man but owing to the impossibility of even the most limited polyandry it was clearly no use to think of marrying them both and all that was left was to choose between them supposing as she most sincerely did that it was or soon would be for her to choose certainly she was not in love with archie if she took as an example of that the ridiculous symptoms exhibited by daisy hollinger who by some strange freak was in love with lord harlow helena had behaved very wisely over that for she had instantly seen the advantage of becoming great friends in her sense of the word with poor daisy who poured out to her a farrago of amorous imbecility and helena was sure that she was not in love with archie like that anything so insane seemed incomprehensible to her and was but archie was a dearshe had quite wished he would kiss her that night of course in a cousinly fashion which she would have scorned to be offended with whereas she did not in the least look forward to the moment when lord harlow would kiss her apart from that the simplification of life came in again and against archie there were certain items which it would be imprudent to disregard his father was a drunkard and archie himself had been consumptive as a child consumption ran in families for archies brother had died of it and so perhaps did drunkenness though she did archie the justice of trying and failing to remember that she had ever seen him drink wine at all these were serious objections in a husband there was another perhaps not less serious she knew from cousin marion that uncle jack had lately lost a great deal of money there was even the question of shutting up or letting the london house next winter of course if she married archie they could not spend the winter down at lacebury or live with poor uncle jack but london as wife of an impoverished son would be very different from london as the wife of a very wealthy man who so to speak was nobodys son finally there were certain stories that cousin marion had told her about queer messages and communications that had come to archie while he was still a child from his dead brother that seemed to helenas practical mind pure nonsense and yet she had been pleased to hear that since he was but young in his teens these rather uncomfortable phenomena had ceased she felt that she did not believe in them but though they had no real existence she disliked the thought of them and though it was so long since there had been any repetition of them they might though they were all nonsense crop up again she had no belief in ghosts but she would not willingly have slept in a haunted room the dead were dead whereas she was very much alive well it was time to dress and go down to cousin marion this long frank meditation for she was always frank with herself which perhaps was the reason that she had so little of that commodity to spare for other people had helped considerably to clear her mind and provoke simplification and like a good housewife who will permit no waste of what can possibly be used she thought she would have a very useful function for archie to perform when he arrived that evening she found lady tintagel busy with her mornings post there was a quantity of invitations most of which owing to press of others had to be declined and helena having marked each of those with an accept or refuse laid them aside to answer there was one where the russian dancers were to perform which she very much regretted having to say no to since that evening was already filled and wondered if by any contrivance it would be possible to manage it a glance at lady tintagels engagement book showed her that the prohibiting acceptance was for a dinner and concert at lady awcocks where all that was stately and victorian spent evenings of unparalleled dreariness helena had already produced the most favourable impression on lady awcock by listening to her practically endless dissertations on political society forty years ago and she thought she could manage it and shall i enter all the invitation you accept in your engagementbook cousin marion she asked yes my dear will you thats really all i have for you this morning what will you do with yourself helena gathered up cards and engagementbook i think i shall stop at home she said you often do want something more you know and i hate not being here to do it for you nothing of the sort theres the motor for you if you want to go and see anybody helena considered oh i should like to do one thing she said it wont take long may i get some flowers for archies room and jessies flowers do look so cool and refreshing when youve been a day and a night in the train of course you may it was nice of you to think of that but then you do think of rather nice things for other people oh shut up cousin marion laughed the girl helena retired to the table in the window with her materials and proceeded to execute a very neat and simple piece of work the entries in lady tintagels engagementbook were only made in pencil and she erased the inconvenient lady awcocks name from the evening some fortnight ahead and wrote in its place that of the giver of the russian party to whom instead of a refusal she sent a line in her cousins name of grateful acceptance then she wrote a charming little letter of penitence to lady awcock abasing herself and at the same time pitying herself she had done the stupidest thing for she had accepted lady awcocks invitation on an evening when they were already engaged the letter proceeded i cant tell you how disappointed i am dear lady awcock for i was so looking forward to another talk with you and to hear more of those interesting things you told me but perhaps if i have not disgusted you beyond forgiveness you would ask me again some day and would you be wonderfully kind and not tell lady tintagel what a stupid thing i have done for she lets me keep her engagementbook for her and if she knew i am afraid she would never trust me again this last touch thoroughly pleased helena it was confiding and childlike for the rest she relied on cousin marion not happening to remember that they had once accepted an invitation to lady awcocks and even if she did have some impression of it her engagementbook with no such entry appearing in it would show her that her memory had played her false but probably cousin marion would remember nothing whatever about it indeed in the multiplicity of engagement it seemed to helena that the risk she ran was negligible helena found time to go to victoria to meet the travellers that afternoon and to reflect as she waited for the boattrain to come in that she in her cool pink blouse and her skirt of poiret stuff would certainly present a very refreshing contrast to poor jessie in dishevelled and dusty travellingclothes she did not in the least want jessie to look bedraggled except in so far as she herself would gain by the contrast for she was goodnatured enough not to want any one to be at a disadvantage as long as that did not add to her own advantage jessie was a dreadfully bad sailor too but it was quite enough that she should have travelled for a night and a day without hoping that she had had a bad crossing helena merely wanted to appear fresh and brilliant herself at length the train came in and though she quite distinctly saw archie step out she continued searching for him with her eyes in the crowd until he made his way up to her ah my dear she said how lovely to see you and dont be cross with me for coming to meet you if it bores you to be met at the station but i did want to welcome you and wheres jessie there she is jessie darling what fun archie did not look as if he was at all bored to be met at the station thats perfectly ripping of you he said i am glad you came weve been baked and boiled all the way from silorno and the crossing i thought it was always calm in the summer archie dont allude to it said jessie helena took her sisters arm darling jessie i am so sorry she said archies a wretch for mentioning it now you go straight to the motor and sit there quietly archie and i will see to your luggage if archie as is probable drew the contrast he was intended to draw between the sisters helena on her side drew another between him and lord harlow there he stood looking eagerly at her as they waited the emergence of their trunks face and neck and hands so tanned by the sun that every one else looked ill and anaemic by him he was tall and lithe and slender with the quick movements of some wild animal and in his brown face his blue eyes shone like transparent turquoises he seemed an incarnation of sun and sea and wholesome virility and as the thought of the rather heavy kalmuck face of lord harlow and staid aspect suitable to his forty years she almost wondered whether in her estimate made this morning she had allowed enough for personal charm but there had been other factors as well and who knew whether below this engaging exterior there were not planted the seeds of tragic outcome but it was certainly pleasant to reflect that his exuberance of young manhood would she made no doubt be all hers if she made up her mind to want it in any case was there another girl in london who had so attractive a second string to her bow archie had on the appearance of one of their pieces of luggage insinuated himself into the crowd and helena was left outside when a sight odd to see at a station attracted her attention beyond the platform lay empty and out of some porters shed there there bounded a big tabby cat with a mouse in its mouth its tail switched its eyes gleamed with the joy of the successful hunter but it did not prepare to eat the mouse immediately it trotted a little farther off lay down and depositing its prey dabbed at it softly with velvet paws and sheathed claws it even let it run a few inches away from it and then gently shepherded it back again once it let it seem to escape altogether gave it a start of at least a couple of yards while it watched it with quivering shoulders and then playfully bounded in the air and reminded it that it was not its own master then there came a dismal little squeak as from a slatepencil the poor mouses troubles were over and a pleased cat blinked in the sun and licked its lips helena followed this gruesome little drama with an interest that surprised and even rather shocked her she was altogether on the side of the cat the cat according to its lights was not being cruel it was merely doing the natural thing with a mouse it happened to like teasing its prey letting it think that it had escaped sheathing the claws that had caught it and playing with it there was nothing horrible about it the cat was doing as nature intended it to do she was rather sorry for the mouse but that is what came of being a mouse and there was archie triumphant with a porter and his rescued luggage archie had a way with officials he smiled at them in a confident friendly way and they always did what he wanted and never searched his traps there was a dance somewhere that night but helena letting the fact be reluctantly dragged out of her that there was such a thing only said how nice it would be to go to bed early are you tired dear asked lady tintagel helena made a little deprecating face the face of the prettiest little martyr in the cause of truth ever beheld no i cant exactly say i am she said i thinki think i was speaking on behalf of archie and jessie but im not tired either said he lets go to somebodys dance i cant dance an atom but helena shall teach me theres nothing like practice in public what dance is it by the way oh thats all right said she its your uncle and aunt toby but archie im sure youre tired but im not i tell you its whether you want to go lady tintagel struck in if you all go on being so unselfish she said you will never settle anything try to be selfish for one moment helena it wont hurt do you want to go enormously said she with a sign of resignation and you archie dying for it lets call a taxi and you jessie i should hate it said jessie very confidently the matter of course was settled on those lines and helena was duly credited with having wanted to go enormously but with having done her utmost to efface herself for the sake of others this was precisely the end she had in view all along and now having had the dance so to speak forced on her she was quite free to enjoy herself she had produced precisely the impression she wanted on archie and his mother and though it was likely that jessie with her long familiarity with such manoeuvres was not equally unenlightened she knew by corresponding familiarity jessies loyalty she gave a little butterfly kiss to cousin marion and a murmur of delighted thanks and went to her sister to finish up this very complete little picture darling jessie she said go to bed soon and sleep well i shall tiptoe in in the morning and if youre still asleep i shall tell them not to wake you till you ring may i do that cousin marion jessie understood all this perfectly well and her mouth had that curve in it that might or might not be a smile goodnight she said have a nice dance and teach archie well to speak of luck is often nothing more than another mode of expressing the success that usually attends foresight chance favours the wise calculation helena last night had dropped the most casual hint to lord harlow that she was probably going to this dance tonight but she was satisfied that he had been attending and was not unprepared to see him there even if she had not been able to come she suspected that he would do so and her absence would have been delightfully explained to him afterwards but there he was not dancing but standing about near the door of the ballroom and quite obviously interested in arrivals undoubtedly he saw the brilliant entry of herself and archie but she contrived to put a few of the crowd between herself and him as she passed near him and for the present gave him no more than a glance and a smile a downdropt eye and then one glance again and passed with archie into the ballroom there an ordinary oldfashioned waltz was in progress and not one of those anaemic strollings about which were becoming popular and she slid off with her radiant partner on to a floor not overfull she had a moments misgiving when she remembered that archie had said he couldnt dance for it would vex her to appear in the clutch of a bungler but after all archie could hardly be awkward if he tried immediately all her fears vanished for they had hardly gone up the short side of the room before she knew that if any one was the bungler it was she she might have guessed from seeing him walk and move that he could dance what she could not have guessed was that anybody could dance like this they floated they glided it was the floor surely that moved under them it was the wind of that swinging voluptuous tune that wafted them on as in some clear eddy of sunlit water but my dear you said you couldnt dance she exclaimed oh this sort of thing said he i meant the steppings and crawlings of the new style helena was too content to talk her whole being glowed with the satisfaction of this flowing movement the floor got ever emptier lines of expectant foxtrotters and bunnyhuggers stood round the wall but none of them objected to watching for a little longer the entrancing couple who now had the floor almost to themselves couple after couple dropped off and stood looking and to helenas gleaming eyes they passed in streaks of black and white and manycoloured hues as she and archie moved ever more freely and largely over the untenanted space she could just see the faces of friends as she passed and knew that lord harlow had come in and was standing by the door there was no question of luck in that he was but doing what she knew he was obliged to do then the web of sound that poured out of the gallery grew more brightly coloured as it quickened to its close and still archie and she moved without effort as if they were part of it and of each other and then the whole fabric of that divine dream of melody and motion was shattered for the dance was over archie had not spoken either since he intimated that he had alluded to steppings and crawlings and now he paused for a moment in the middle of the room breathing just a little quickly and bewildered as with some dazzling light ever since he had put his arm round the girl and taken her hand in his he had had that sense of sinking into sunlit waters where he arrived at his true and naked self now he had swum up again and he was clothed in black coat and white shirt and helena was standing a step apart from him and every one else at the edge of the room was very far away instantly a mingling of wild consternation and triumph seized him oh helena were we doing that all by ourselves he said how frightful lets get out of it but wasnt it divine may we do it again soon or will they have nothing but crawlings it appeared that crawlings were to be the next item and archie noticed that in the crowd that now came about them again a particular man had his eye on them and was unmistakably burrowing towards them yes archie of course we will said the girl go and see your aunt and ask if we may have another waltz ever so soon oh heres lord harlow i want to introduce you this was done and lord harlow turned to helena again i feel as if i had been present at some bacchic festival he said in a very precise voice but you should have vineleaves in your hair and eryour partner a tunic and a thyrsus i feel myself as prosaic as a bradshaw but may i be your bradshaw helena looked from one to the other if she had had a tail she would certainly have been switching it ah do she said a bradshaw is quite indispensable archie go and get a thyrsuswill a poker do lord harlowand persuade mrs morris to have another waltz before long now that the sheer animal exhilaration of that adorable waltz which quite precluded talking was over it seemed perfectly suitable as she plodded along the weary way of the foxtrot to talk again and in answer to lord harlow who had not caught archies name she said yes lord davidstow surely i told you about him she knew that she had purposely not done so he is lady tintagels son with whom i am staying lord harlow quietly assimilated this as he turned slowly round and does he do other things as well as he dances he asked i think he does said she though i never really thought about it when people are such dears as archie one doesnt consider what they do they just are he certainly is he appears very much alive yes hes madly alive she gave him a swift glance and guessing she had gone far enough on that tack she put about i think its possible to be too much alive she said its like a hotwater bottle that is too hot it burns you but you cant help being carried off your feet by iti dont mean the hotwater bottle he paused a moment for the purpose of phrasing i must weight you with a bradshaw he said that will keep you to earth we cant spare you helena laughed you say things too neatly she said what a delicious notion what have you done all day i have waited for this evening and i hope it doesnt disappoint you now that it has come she said it is up to my highest expectations just now said he suddenly it flashed into helenas mind that this was the temperature of his wooing he was engaged in that now those neat and proper sentences turned as on a lathe were the expression of it they and the mild pleased glances that he gave her and yet discreet and veiled as it all was she divined that according to his nature and his years it was love that inspired it she found it quite easy to adjust herself to that level and if his kiss when the time came for that was of the same respectful and finished quality she could deal with that too but she wondered how archie would make love it was necessary to foxtrot a little longer and while trotting trot also conversationally and with intention she let herself press a little more against his arm oh i am glad of that she said lightly it is such a dreadful pity when people are disappointed but i think i would sooner anticipate something nice and fail to get it than not anticipate at all can you imagine not looking forward to the delicious things you want do you want very much he asked yes everything and i want it not only for myself but for everybody she made the mental note that he was very shy for he had nothing in response to this except that his shirt creaked but that suited her very well she did not want him to follow this up just yet meantime the sedate marchings and retreats and occasional revolution of the foxtrot went decorously on the room was very full and when there was nowhere to march to they stopped where they were and marked time and rocked a little to and fro then perhaps a narrow lane opened in front of them and they waddled down it brushing shoulders against the hedges she had seen archie go to mrs morris after which he had appeared for a moment in the gallery where the band was and now he was back again standing near the door and watching her she gave him little glances from time to time elevated her eyebrows as if in deprecation of this unexhilarating performance or smiled at him guessing that he had arranged for another waltz at last the end came the foxtrotters ceased to clutch each other and walked away with about as much terpsichorean fervour as they had been dancing with dull though the last twenty minutes had been from that standpoint helena felt quite satisfied with it while motionor perhaps emotionhad made her partner hot he gently wiped his forehead with a very fine cambric handkerchief perfectly delicious he said i should have liked that to go on for ever and how long shall i have to wait before it begins again archie had sidled through the crowd up to them helena were going to have another waltz at once he cried dont let us waste any of it she laid her hand on his arm we she said are you quite certain may i say we also asked lord harlow she turned towards him but her hand still rested on archie and he felt the slight pressure from her fingertips oh i was only teasing my cousin she said i had promised him another waltz but later may i borrow my bradshaw again the band struck up setting her atingle for the repetition of what had gone before oh archie come on she cried au revoir bradshaw alert for movement with the heady tune of the waltz already mounting into them like wine they stepped off on to the floor it was like stepping on to some moving platform it and the tune without any conscious effort of their own seemed to carry them away but archie had one question to ask before he abandoned himself bradshaw he said i thought you told me his name was harlow she gave a little bubble of laughter oh that was only a joke she said he told me that you and i were like a bacchic festival and he felt as prosy as a bradshaw in consequence but what does it matter to him what we are like asked he well it was a compliment he meant it nicely said she dont let us talk it rather spoils it helena reviewed those manoeuvres when she got home that night and she congratulated herself on the neatness and efficiency of her dispositions she felt sure that she had stirred up a livelier ferment in lord harlow and had also managed to inspire him with a vague distrust and jealousy of her intimacy with archie she suspected that he was a little sluggish in his emotions and this would serve admirably as a stimulant she quite realized that she had not yet brought him up to the point of proposing to her for his inured bachelor habits would want a good deal of breaking but it was clear to her that she had made a crack in them and that the judicious use of archie might be profitably used to widen that crack under the influence merely of her charms he might hold together for a long time yet and she wanted him if she could have it entirely her own way to propose to her about the end of the season the effect of archie constantly with her would be cumulative it was not a wedge that would cause him to fly into splinters forthwith it would just widen the crack prevent it closing again and then widen it a little more and meanwhile it was extremely pleasant always to have this wedge in her hand to hammer from time to time as it suited her main plan and at others to stroke and play with she was not in love with archie but it made her purr to see that he was certainly falling in love with her to dab him with sheathed claws to wish that he had those material advantages which had made her choose the elder man it clearly served her purpose to use him and the using of him gave her pleasure but the pleasure was secondaryit was the assistance he gave her in breaking up lord harlow that was of primary importance archie brought all his gaiety and charm to bear on his lovemaking falling in love did not appear to him at this stage anything but the most exhilarating almost hilarious experience the flirtation that helena seemed to be having with lord harlow amused him enormously not for a moment did he believe that helena meant anything lord harlow was not the only man on whom helena exercised the perfectly legitimate attraction of her extreme prettiness and her enthusiastic childlike enjoyment oh every one is so kind and so awfully nice she said to him one day as they returned from an early morning ride i love them all by the handful including the bradshaw asked he yes certainly including the bradshaw dont you like him he likes you so much archie considered this i dont know if i like him or not he said i dont think i ever thought about it he doesnt matter but you matter awfully to him did you know that you are the most outrageous flirt helena archie how horrid of you said she just because i like people and to a certain extent they like me why should i be cross and unpleasant to people as if it was wicked to like them well if youll give me long odds i will bet you that the bradshaw asks you toto be his abc before the end of the season said archie my dear what nonsense said she with a sudden thrill of pleasure what can have put that into your head i can see it thats the way a man like the bradshaw looks at a girl when hishis affections are engaged he looks as if a very dear aunt was dead he has amour triste that certainly hit off a type of gaze to which helena felt that she had been subjected and she laughed well ill give you five to one in halfcrowns she said dont some day i shall have twelve and sixpence they turned and cantered back along the soft track the dew of night had not yet vanished from the grass and the geometric looking planeleaves the rhododendrons and the flowerbeds were still varnished with moisture and early though it was riders and footpassengers were plentiful probably the day would be hot for the heat haze purplishbrown in the distance was beginning to form in the air softly veiling the further view presently they dropped again into a walkingpace and helena whose mind had been busy on archies description of a certain sort of lovelorn look spoke of a subject suggested by it how do you think jessie is she asked thats exactly what my mother asked me last night said he shes rather silent and preoccupied isnt she that struck me said the girl i thought perhaps she wasnt very well but she told me there was nothing the matter darling jessie is so reserved she never tells me anything certainly she looks well do you think she has anything on her mind i dont see what she could have but its odd that it has struck all of us helena sighed and shook her head with a pretty unreproachful air i sometimes wish that jessie would make more of a friend of me she said i try so hard to get close to her but all the time i feel she is keeping me at arms length it would be lovely to have a sister who would admit me to her own own self but i always have to tap so to speak at jessies door and she so often says she wont open it was she always like that asked archie seeing that helenas eyes were dim and bright yes but lately i think it has been worse i wish jessie would let me in however i am always waiting and i think jessie knows that it is no use pressing for confidence is it one can only wait this picture so simply and pathetically conveyed by helena of herself waiting a little dimeyed for jessie to admit her was very convincing and archie wondered at the contrast between the two sisters the one so childlike in her confidence that all the world was her friend the other holding herself rather detached rather aloof without that welcoming charm of manner that surely was the expression of an adorable mind it was not wholly the light of his dawning love that invested the sketch with such tender colouring for there was a great finish and consistency in helenas presentation of herself which might have deceived the most neutral and heartwhole of observers such was the first impression then suddenly some instinct that lay below the surface surged up in rebellion against it and washed the tender colouring out it told him that the impression was a false one that jessie so far from being callous and selfcentred as was the suggestion conveyed by helenas words was of faithful and golden heart and then looking idly over the crowd that was growing thick on the broad gravel walk he suddenly caught sight of jessie herself looking at them she was some little distance behind the rails that separated the ride from the path and she instantly looked away spoke to a girl who was with her and strolled on but archie felt quite sure that she had seen them he turned to helena surely that is jessie he said to her pointing with his whip helena had seen her also and she smiled rather sadly rather wistfully yes she said but she doesnt want us archie and at that the instinct which had spoken to him so emphatically a moment before sank out of hearing again and the colour returned to helenas deft little sketch chapter viii it was four oclock on an afternoon of midjuly and the westering sun had begun to blaze into the drawingroom windows of colonel vautiers house in oakland crescent it was pleasant enough there in the winter for the room being small was easily heated but in the summer with even greater ease it grew ovenlike and helena sitting by the open window for the sake of any air that might possibly wander into the dusty crescent was obliged to pull down the blinds she had tried sitting in her fathers study but that had an infection of stray cigarsmoke about it which she did not want to catch and the diningroom and her own bedroom since they faced the same way as the drawingroom presented no counterattractions so reluctantly she was compelled to sit here while jessie with a book in her hand sat at the other end of the room jessie had a slight attack of hayfever and from time to time indulged in a fit of sneezing it seemed to helena that she was being very inconsiderate it was always possible to stifle a sneeze but jessie never thought about other people helena by way of waiting patiently at jessies door according to the tender image she had fashioned for archies benefit had just expressed this opinion slightly veiled and she was pleased to see that at this moment jessie left the room a sound of sneezing from outside indicated that at last her sister had grasped how exceedingly unpleasant her hayfever was for other people then there came the sound of ascending steps and she guessed that jessie had gone to her bedroom the floors were wretchedly thin and illconstructed you could from any room in the house hear movements from any other room especially since colonel vautier and jessie had such solid resounding steps when they went anywhere left to herself helena cleared her decks and enumerated her cause of complaint against providence who ought to have been so kind to an innocent loving little soul in the first place her father had finished his irrigation business in egypt unexpectedly soon and instead of arriving in london not before september had come two months earlier than the most pessimistic daughter could have expected the news of his approaching arrival had provoked a perfect conspiracy against helenas comfort and her plans for every one including cousin marion who had been so insistent on the girls staying with her till he got home had taken it for granted that they would at once rejoin him surely it would have been sufficient for jessie to go and she did jessie the justice of allowing that she was perfectly ready to do so leaving helena to help cousin marion in the answering of her letters in the morning for some halfhour in the entertaining of her numerous guests and in accompanying her to any of those pleasant gaieties which swarmed about that desirable house but instead cousin marion had been quite unaware to all appearance of the hints helena had subtly suggested and archie had been equally uncomprehending when she had said this house seems so much more like my home than any other he had certainly glowed with pleasure but had not thought it was meant to have any application with regard to her going back to oakland crescent no one had taken her hints it had occurred to nobody how suitable it was that jessie should go to look after her father and helena remain to look after her cousin but since her hints were not taken helena like the excellent tactician she was had retreated in preference to standing her ground and suffering defeat she had to retreat and she retreated with exactly the proper mixture of regret at leaving grosvenor square and of joy at her fathers premature return and when his taxi cab drew up palpitating at the door it was she who ran down the three concrete steps from the frontdoor and across the awful little dusty yard called the front garden with its cinder path that circulated round one laurelbush and flung herself into his arms and helped the parlourmaid to carry in his bag while jessie waited in the narrow entrance that reeked of the ascending fumes of dinner for the parlourmaid as usual had left open the door at the head of the kitchen stairs there was a grudge against providence even deeper than this unnecessary transplanting of herself to oakland crescent when she might so comfortably have flourished in grosvenor square archie had dined with them two nights ago before taking her on to a dance and in the interval that followed dinner when her father and archie remained downstairs she had a painful scene with jessie jessie according to helenas public version had misunderstood her in the cruellest manner but she knew that her real complaint here was not that her sister had cruelly misunderstood her but had in fact cruelly understood her which was more intolerable than any misunderstanding could have been she could have borne a misunderstanding very patiently but to be understood was of the nature of an exposure of a kind scarcely decent and impossible to forget it had begun so stupidly so innocuously she had but left a few orchids on her dressingtable and jessie who naturally was not going to the dance but was remaining at home to keep her father company most kindly offered to get them for her she came down again so ominously silent that helena had asked her what the trouble was and it appeared that jessie had seen on the dressingtable the card of lord harlow with a safetypin attached to it yes darling why not helena had said he sent me those lovely orchidsthank you so much for getting them he is going to be there tonight and as he sent expressly for them from harlow naturally i shall wear them it would be rude not to dont you think jessie did not reply and helena repeated her question for answer jessie had said in that soft rich voice which was the only thing that helena envied her you revolt me helena became quite cool and collected she might represent herself as being tearful and pathetic at the thought of jessies unkindness but that attitude was useless with jessie alone and she never adopted it oh may i ask why i revolt you she asked certainly although you know already archie is in love with you helena adopted the phrases of affection she did so simply to irritate her sister darling how delicious you are she said but maynt i wear a flower from tom dick or harry for that reason i dont grant the reason for a moment but even if i did what then besides archie hasnt given me any flowers and one must have flowers at a dance but jessie refused to be irritated helenas speech seemed to have exactly the opposite effect on her she became gentle and apologetic im sorry i said that you revolted me she said it was thoughtless and stupid but o helena you are so thoughtless too do forgive me for questioning you butbut are you intending to marry lord harlow if he asks you if so do make it clear to archie before things get worse that you have no thought of him you like him dont you you might save his suffering this was the understanding not the misunderstanding that was so cruel but helena was quite capable of being cruel too she smelled her orchids and pinned them into her gown simultaneously she heard feet on the stairs and archies resonant laugh she got up i might almost think you were jealous of archies affection for me darling she said in her most suave tones before the door opened she saw jessies face flame with colour and laughed to herself at the defencelessness of love next moment archie launched himself into the room hullo what fine orchids he said who sent you them helena i bet you the bradshaw did what a thing it is to have opulent admirers i wish i had got some but since that evening now nearly a week ago jessie had not spoken to helena except when mere manners in the presence of other people required it that was a tiresome uncomfortable situation in a big house it would not have mattered much for they could easily have sat in different rooms but here it made an awkwardness in the narrow existence but helena had the consolation of knowing that she had not merely knocked at jessies door but had battered it in the secret chamber stood open to her and the shrine in it was revealed before unpitying eyes here then were two grievances against the world that might have taxed the patience of job and certainly supertaxed the patience of helena on the top of these ossa on pelion was perched an anxiety that had begun seriously to trouble her for already it was the middle of july and lord harlow had as yet said nothing which suggested that he was going to propose to her she knew that she charmed and captivated him who had never looked seriously at a girl twice nor at poor daisy once but he was undeniably a long time making up his mind and helena though accustomed to repose the greatest confidence in herself did not feel sure that she would prove equal to defeating the longstanding habit of celibacy even the continuous use of archie in the capacity of a wedge seemed to make no impression and she was beginning to be desperately afraid that the wedge would turn in her hand and ask her to marry him before lord harlow succumbed this would be a very awkward situation most inauspicious developments might follow for it would be tragic if she accepted archie and lord harlow proposed immediately afterwards while if she refused archie it would be a crown of tragedy if lord harlow did not propose at all she had determined in fact if archie proposed first to ask him to wait for his answer a little breeze was stirring now and helena pulled up the blind to let it and the sun enter together rather than endure this stifling stagnancy any longer and gazed with the profoundest disgust at the mean outlook the house stood in the centre of a small curve of threestoried buildings in front was its little square of cindery walk with the one laurel in the middle and a row of iron palings with a gate that would not shut which separated it from the road on the other side of that was a small demilune of a garden which gave the place the title of crescent and beyond that a straight row of houses all exactly alike a milkman was going his rounds with alto cries and slovenly cooks and parlourmaids came out of area gates with milkjugs in their hands a lean and mournful cat with dirty dishevelled fur as unlike as possible to the sleek smart mouser she had seen at the station sat on a gatepost blinking in the sun and every now and then uttering a faint protest against existence generally helena could have found it in her heart to mew in answer the hot afternoon wore itself away and presently the parlourmaid came in to lay a table for tea this entailed a great many comingsin and a great many goingsout and she usually left the door open so that there oozed its way up the stairs a mixed smell of cigars and incipient cooking the cigar smell came from the little back room adjoining the diningroom where colonel vautier with tropical habits spent the hour after tiffin it seemed that he could not say lunch in dozings and smokings meantime the parlourmaid came in and out now with a large brass teatray to place on the table now with plates and cups and saucers to put on it she breathed strongly through her nose and wore a white apron with white braces over her sloping shoulders from outside during these trying moments there came the sound of a motorhorn and immediately afterwards the soft crunch of gravel below a motors wheels from where she sat helena could look out of the window and from her torpid discontent she leaped with a bound into a state of alert expectancy she hazarded so to speak all the small change she had in her pocket for a moment she put her slim fingers in front of her eyes and thought intensely then she spoke to the parlourmaid take a tray of tea to colonel vautier in his study she said and say that i have got a headache and told you to bring his tea to him there tell miss jessiehelena paused a momenttell her that a friend of mine has come to see me and that i want to talk to him privately here thats all now open the door and say that i am in helena rushed to the lookingglass above the fireplace and disarranged her hair a little she took a book at random out of the shelves and sat down with it she heard a little stir in the hall below and had a moment of agony in thinking that her fathers door had opened then the stairs creaked under ascending footsteps and her visitor was announced who she said as the parlourmaid spoke his name and then he entered she rose from her chair with a smile that was almost incredulous but how lovely of you she said i am delighted what a business you must have had to find your way to our dear little slum her hopes rose high he looked like a man who had made up his mind he was clearly nervous but it was the nervousness of a man who has definitely sat down in the dentists chair and has resolved to get rid of that aching he sat down in the chair helena indicated and looked round the room it really was rather pretty helena had the knack of projecting her graceful self into any room she much used archie had sent a hamper of roses only this morning slum he said i should like to live in this slum helena looked at him gravely well there is a spare room she said which we can let you you wont mind a gurgling cistern next door will you but wasnt it lovely daddy came home a whole month earlier than i had expected so i flew back here to be with him cousin marion wanted me to stop with her and let jessie come back it was sweet of her to want me but how could i remain when daddy was here tea she gave him his cup and continued her careful prattle so of course i flew here she said sometimes i rather wish that a fairyprince would descend and pick up the house and put it somewhere where there werent quite so many barrelorgans but one gets accustomed to everything i think daddy and jessie must be out they planned going out together i know and i havent seen either of them since lunch they are such dears they are so much to each other sometimes i should get a little bit jealous of each of them if i allowed myself to ah do have one of those little cakes they are made in the house you probably smelled them as you came upstairs how lucky i asked the cook to make some today sometimes she is cross and wont but today she was kind did she have a brainwave do you think and know that you were coming he ate one of the little cakes which really came from the pastrycooks just round the corner and while his mouth was full helena proceeded with her talented conversation she was working at full horsepower she wanted to dazzle without intermission i daresay all the people who were so friendly will find their way here in time she said but will you pity me just in a superficial way sometimes during august darling daddy has so much to do at the colonial office or the irrigation office or whatever it is that he will have to be here all august but he wont keep you in london asked he helena laughed certainly he wont for i shall keep myself she said i shall try to persuade jessie to go down to lacebury with cousin marion and i think i shall succeed and where will you be up in scotland i suppose he put down the end of the cigarette which helena had given him he was less likely if he was smoking to smell the faint odour of cigar that had mounted the stairs but as a matter of fact he would not have noticed the smell of burned feathers just then he turned to her quickly i shall bewherever you will permit me to be he said but wherever that is maynt we be together i want never to be away from you any more i want nothing else in the world but that helena raised dewy eyes to him do you mean she began do you mean yes and i want your answer that is yes too she said she had an almost irresistible desire to burst into peals of laughter but it was not so difficult to transform that into an aspect of radiant happiness he kissed her and she could feel his hands laid on her shoulders trembling and out of sheer gratitude she found herself able to respond quite passably for the innate respectability of passion touched her he had paid her the sincerest compliment that a man can pay a girl in expressing his desire to have her always with him to be the father of her children to renounce such freedom as had been his and to take in exchange for it a devoted slavery and since it was exactly that which she had set her purpose to accomplish it was no wonder that she was content but as soon as he had left her without translating into the sphere of practical arrangements the when and how of their mutual pledge helena after one tiptoe dance round the drawingroom sat down again and was instantly immersed in those considerations he would have liked to dine with them that night but archie was coming and so before he called again next morning it was necessary to indulge in careful thought so as to produce a spontaneous suggestion next day on her face she wore the happiness of childlike smiles and throughout her meditations that never faded occasionally it was as if the sun was withdrawn behind some fleece of a summer cloud but if there had been a machine for the registration of her internal sunshine there would scarcely have been a break in the record of serene hours archie occupied her first she was sorry for archie because the blow that this would be to him glanced back on to her she had long ago made up her mind not to marry him if she could succeed in the quest now accomplished but she regretted that now she would never see his eyes glow as he blurted outshe knew he would blurt it out and probably kiss her with that light rough eagerness which was so characteristic of himthe tale of his love not so many weeks ago at silorno she had determined to marry him but that was before the wider horizon opened to her if he had proposed to her then she would certainly have accepted him but she felt though so much finer a future had now dawned on her a sort of grudge against him for not having done so that made the thought of telling him not unpleasant to her there was an excitement in the thought of seeing his blank facewould it be blank she thought sowhen he heard her news perhaps the sight of how much it hurt him would hurt her also but that pain would somehow enfold a rapture for it would be clear how much he wanted her but why had he not kissed her when they sat on that last evening in the dark garden at silorno all might have been different then never till this afternoon had a man kissed her and that kiss had struck her as being a little prim and proper archie would not and could not have been prim he would have been quick and impulsive there would have been something romantic about it for with him she could have supplied that gleam of romance herself there had been fleecy clouds during this part of her meditation and they gathered again ever so light as she thought of cousin marion and jessie everybody was so clever nowadays and she was afraid that cousin marion had seen that archie was in love with her even as jessie had done it would be tiresome if they behaved censoriously about it and replied frigidly to congratulations and made cold faces at the wedding but she thought she could get round cousin marion who from experience she knew was very easily convinced but jessie was more clearsighted and then with a sense of refreshment she remembered how jessie had betrayed herself not so many days ago thereat the sun came out quite serenely again and remained out when she thought of her father he loved shooting and helena determined that he should enjoy quantities of shooting he loved all sorts of the nice things that money made so easily procurable comfort and good cigars and riding and bathrooms attached to bedrooms certainly there should be a delicious room for him in all her houses she would name it daddys room the filial sentimentality of this quite overcame her and she murmured darling daddy and felt just as if she had sacrificed herself for him and made this marriage in order to secure him a comfortable old age bertie and he would get on excellently together they could talk about tigershooting and temples and exotic affairsfor bertie was a great traveller and if he wanted to travel again she had no intention of being an apronstringing wife marriage became a sacrilege rather than a sacrament if it was an affair of watchdogs on the leash ready to follow up trails and again she softly applauded the nobility of her sentiments there was a faint stir and rattle of crockery in the room below which implied that the parlourmaid was removing her fathers tea helena knew all the noises of the house down to the gurgling sound of toothcleaning that came from her fathers bedroom which showed that he was nearly dressed and now correctly interpreting the chink of plate and teacup she was certain of finding him in his study with his aftertea cigar very likely jessie had gone there too for she often took the evening paper in to her father and read him the news and helena hoped that this was the case today she could let jessie know the event of the afternoon with less embarrassment if there was somebody else present she could tell her father about it much more easily than she could tell jessie alone she would sit close to him and whisper and hide her head her sense of drama would make it all quite simple she fastened one of the creamcoloured roses that archie had brought her into the front of her dress and went down to her fathers room it was a stale little apartment dry and brown and smoked like a kippered herring furnished chiefly with books and files and decorated with the produce of oriental bazaars spears and shells and things suggestive of mummies he was in a big basket chair close to the window and in the windowseat as she had hoped sat jessie with the evening paper helena had not forgotten that she had sent a message to him that she had a headache and to jessie that a friend had come to see her with a wish for a private conversation she made these little plans quickly perhaps but always coolly and remembered them afterwards sometimes a little delicate adjustment was necessary but she seldom got caught out darling daddy she said may i pay you a little visit or are you and jessie engrossed in something i shant understand no come in dear said he hows the headache she hovered for a moment like some bright bird and then perched herself on the arm of his chair between him and her sister its quite gone ever so many thanks she said i think i must have had a little snooze just before tea which took it away and then as i told jessie somebody came here especially to have a little talk to me daddy how delicious your cigar smells and who was you visitor he asked lord harlow said she very softly and paused jessie had put down her paper and helena could feel that she was listening in tense expectation she did not look round but firmly laid her hand on jessies clasping it the other she tucked into her fathers arm and leaned her head against his shoulder daddy i had a long talk to him she said and he is coming here again tomorrow morning at least he did the talking and i only spoke when he had said what he had come to say oh my dear i am so happy so awfully awfully happy helena felt that she had done that quite beautifully if she had thought about it for ever so long she could not have improved on it a few boisterous ejaculations from her father followed and finding that jessie had disengaged her hand she completed the circle round her fathers arm then presently she rose with smiling and suffused face just kissed him and left the room well im sure thats the best bit of news ive heard for a long time he said certainly he is a good deal older than she but theres no harm in that i was twenty years older than your mother jessie and what do you think of it all i think helena will be very happy said jessie so do i and im sure she deserves to be if shes as kind and loving to her husband as she has been to her father we shant hear any complaints dear me what a bit of news he was silent a moment how we old folk get out of touch with young people he said if i had been told to guess who it was who would ask helena to be his wife i should have said it was archie didnt you think that archie was very fond of her mixed with jessies misery for archies sake and with her bitter contempt for her sister was a pity for helena as deep as the sea that she could be what she was she could wear the roses archie had sent her and not be burned alive by them i never though that helena really cared for him she said quietly no well you were more clearsighted than i but i fancy marion thought so too hes dining with us tonight isnt he or will helena put him off and are we to say anything to him about it i expect helena will tell us what she wishes said jessie he laughed no doubt she will shewhats the phraseshe pulls the strings in this piece doesnt she bless me its after six oclock we might go across the bridge and have a stoll in battersea park i expect helena will like to be left alone yes what is it the parlourmaid had come in with the request that colonel vautier would go to see helena for a minute now or some time before dinner accordingly he went upstairs in high good humour stumbling on the carpetrods oh daddy how sweet of you to come to me at once she said archies dining here tonight and i think i will tell him my news myself hes such a dear it would hurt him to hear it from anybody else colonel vautier felt that he had perhaps not been so wrong after all yes my dear that is kind and thoughtful of you he said so ill tell him as soon as he gets here said she will you and jessie be very kind and let me have two minutes with him helenas eyes wandered away a minute and returned rather dewy to her fathers face perhaps you would tell jessie for me she said she opened her eyes very wide in a sort of childlike bewilderment i wonder why jessie is so cold to me she said i must have vexed her somehow without meaning it i feel sad about it she did not say one word when i told you and her my news she did not kiss me jessie is never very demonstrative said her father intending to speak to jessie about this no perhaps thats all thank you ever so much daddy she watched them going out together and thought what a pity it was that some people were so frank as to say that others revolted them even though they apologized afterwards it never paid to be coarse and rude like that helena according to her plan was in the drawingroom among his roses when archie arrived it was delicious of you to send them she said and ive gotsomething for you hurrah said archie what is it she had put a half sovereign and a halfcrown on the corner of the mantelpiece and handed it to him a tip he said no a bet i am poor but honest he looked at the money twelve and six he said when did you bet me twelveandsix helena came a step closer to him even in the middle of london there was something of seawind and open spaces about archie oh you stupid boy she said how many halfcrowns is that suddenly archie remembered the wager he had made with her one morning in the park that lord harlow would propose to her before the end of the season he pocketed the money with a shout of laughter ha i knew i should win he said but it wasnt nice of me to laugh i take back the laugh poor old bradshaw did he mind much helena looked at him still standing close to him smiling and in silence she really found him most attractive at that moment and she wondered with how changed a face he would presently look at her yes he proposed to me this afternoon she said still smiling and still looking at him well poor old bradshaw said archie once more but he did not say it with quite the same confidence she laid her hand that soft hand with sheathed claws on his arm archie arent you going to wish me happiness she asked the lines of his laughter still lingered on his handsome mouth but now they were merely stamped there and meant nothing wish you happiness he rapped out in a hard snappish voice yes isnt it usual between friends do you mean youve accepted him he asked yes my dear havent i told you is it a joke he asked shall i laugh helena moved a little away from him and rang the bell archie looked so strange she had expected something far more moving and dramatic than this wooden immobility tell colonel vautier and miss jessie that lord davidstow has come she said to the parlourmaid archie said nothing till the door had closed again he felt that he was made of wood that everything was made of wood he and helena and the roses he had sent and the persian rug on which he stood and when he spoke it was as if a machine in his mouth said the words which had nothing whatever to do with him i congratulate you he said i hope you will be very happy colonel vautier entered he had been to the cellar to get out a bottle of champagne in which to drink the health of helena and the man she had chosen good evening my dear archie he said i know helena has told you her news archie shook hands and then his eyes went back to helena again she had never looked more entrancingly pretty but she was made of wood and then jessie came in they were all there and dinner was ready and down they went in this wooden world everything went on in precisely the same way as it had done when people were made of flesh and blood some cunning mechanical contrivance enabled them to talk and smile and eat food tasted the same and so did the champagne in which presently they drank helenas health it was the same prickly bubbly stuff with a little sting in it that he so seldom drank but it unfroze the surface of the stricture that bound him as when the first stir of a thawing wind moistens the surface of ice he began to feel again to be conscious that somewhere within him was a deep well of the waters of pain but anything was better than that cataleptic insensibility which was like being unconscious and all the time knowing that he was unconscious they were not going out that night and after dinner they sat down to a rubber of bridge in which as usual helena took archie as a partner because she always insisted that she could form some idea of the principles on which he played whereas the other two but wandered in a starless and cimmerian gloom when mated with him but helena claimed that her spiritual affinity with archie enabled her to perceive that when he declared hearts he wished her to understand that he hadnt got any and that she would do well to declare something different bridge properly understood archie had enunciated once is a form of poker you must bewilder and terrify your adversary and then the fun begins and you get fined what added to the hilarity was the concentrated seriousness which jessie and her partner brought to bear on the game and the misers greed and avaricious eye with which jessie was popularly supposed to see her score mounting all these jokes these squibs of lighthearted nonsense were there tonight but there was nothing behind them it was as if they were spoken from habit a frigid rehearsal of some pithless drama was going on they were tinsel flowers stuck into arid and seedless ground and sprang no longer from the warm earth the sense of wooden unreality soon began to close in again on archie with that utter absence of feeling which was so far more terrible than any feeling could be that soulless insensitiveness as of a live consciousness that knew it was dead and he rose from the table after helena had delivered him from the consequence of some outrageous declaration and went across to a sidetable where were placed syphons and spirits but now instead of pouring himself out a glass of sodawater he half filled his tumbler with whisky and but added a cream of bubble on the top of it immediately almost his sense of touch with life returned there stole back into himself and the figures of colonel vautier and jessie the perception of their several identities and into helena the love with which he had endowed her but that and all that it implied was better than feeling nothing at all he knew too that when jessie spoke to him or looked at him her voice and her eyes held for him a supreme and infinite sympathy he could not reach it but he knew it was there perhaps when he got used to those new conditions of nightmare existence he could make it accessible get into touch with it at present he scarcely wanted it he wanted nothing so long as this perception of life still ran in his brain except helena he thought that she rather pitied him too but it was not her pity he wanted for it was she who had brought her pity on himself they played two or three rubbers jessies miserly greed was assuaged by precisely the sum that archie had won from helena and colonel vautier after seeing him out went back to his study to indulge himself in the cigar which was not permitted in the drawingroom and the two sisters were left there helenas brain had long been busy beneath the habitual jests of their game over her future relations with jessie and she had come to the conclusion that the sooner they talked the matter out the better she found that it affected her comfort to be practically not on speaking terms with her sister and since she had no shrinking from what might be a painful interview for others she had made up her mind to ascertain exactly how jessie meant to behave to her in the few weeks for which they would be in close daily and hourly contact for lord harlow had expressed his mind very clearly about an early date for their wedding and helena entirely agreed with him jessie on her part could scarcely manage to think about her sister at all with archie in front of her all evening she had barely been conscious of anything but his bitter and miserable disillusionment his awakening from the dream that had become so real to him she was still seated at the cardtable and with that need for trivial employment which so often accompanies emotional crises she was building a house with the cards they had been using devoting apparently her whole faculties to its breathless construction the strong beautiful hands which archie had never noticed hovered over it alighting with their building materials putting each card delicately and firmly in place and her grave face watched the ascending stories as if babylon the great was rising again for the marvel of mankind then helena sat down by her and leaning her arm on the table caused a vibration that demolished babylon from garret to cellar oh jessie im so sorry she said and she was the fall of an ingenious cardhouse was the sort of thing that provoked her pity jessie swept the cards together and seemed about to get up it doesnt matter she said it is bedtime isnt it helena put her head wistfully on one side arent you being horribly unkind to me she said she did not suppose it was much use playing on the pathetic stop that made as a general rule so insincere a bleating in her sisters ears but it was worth trying i dont think there is any use in talking helena she said if i am unkind if i cant bear what you have done it is because i simply cant help it helena fingered the debris of the cardhouse with those more delicate fingers that could caress and claw so exquisitely essentially she cared not one atom what jessie thought of her but she wanted not to be uncomfortable for the next few weeks ah that is it she added you are satisfied to hate and detest me because you cant help it that seems to you a final and unanswerable excuse but nobody else may do anything because she cant help it but you could have helped what you have done said jessie you made archie think you cared for him you let him fall in love with you on that assumption he let himself fall in love with me said helena that was not my fault besides she was silent a moment weaving delicate spiderthreads in her mind she really wanted to propitiate jessie just now otherwise she would certainly have reminded her that she anyhow had allowed herself to fall in love with archie though she would not say that that was archies fault it would have been amusing to suggest that but it did not seem to tend towards reconciliation she bent her graceful head a little lower over the fallen cardhouse it had collapsed with tragic suddenness even as archie had collapsed besides she went on it was open to archie to propose to me he did not we were several weeks together at silorno and then i came to london and met bertie was it my fault that i fell in love with him i think you are horribly unkind to me jessie came a step nearer are you in love with him she asked if you tell me you are in love with him do you think i should marry him if i was not asked helena looking the picture of limpid childlike innocence jessie made no reply she could not say that she believed helena was in love with him though she was assuredly going to marry him she could not tell a lie of that essential kind merely the words would not come if i have wronged you in any way helena she said at length i am most sincerely sorry for it i ask your forgiveness unconditionally helena rose wreathed in tender smiles and liquid eyes darling you have my forgiveness with all my heart she said and may i ask you one thing will you try to feel a little more kindly towards me if you only knew how your unkindness hurts me but jessie lying awake that night striving with all the sincerity that permeated her from skin to marrow to make the effort that helena had asked of her made no headway at all she utterly distrusted and disbelieved her and somewhere lying beneath the darkness of the windless night was archie for whose happiness she would have given her hearts last blood but all of it would not help him one atom while he in the perverse dispensations of destiny wanted only what he could not get helenas love he could not get it because it did not exist she did not love the faculty had been denied her suddenly she felt frightened about archie he had sunk somewhere out of reach this evening a lid had shut down on him once or twice it had seemed to lift for a moment and she remembered what made it lift book iii chapter ix late one afternoon about a week after archie was sitting with his old nurse blessington in the room that had once been his daynursery he had left london the day after helena had so honourably paid him the five halfcrowns he had won from her and since then he had been living here alone with his father this evening his mother and jessie were coming down from town his mother to remain here till she went up to london again for helenas wedding which had been fixed for the end of the first week in august while jessie was but coming for a long weekend helena remained in town where she was very busy shopping and unpacking the lovely presents which lord harlow sent or brought to her morning noon and night they were really delightful presents and the material of them was large precious stones exquisitely set archie had long made it a habit when he was at home to pay a visit to his old nurse before he went to dress for dinner she had become housekeeper after the fledging of the family and now halfway through the decade of her seventies did little more when archie was away than sit whitehaired and stately with her sewing or her knitting and feel that she was very busy but when archie came home she would burst into violent activities and constitute herself his nurse again to whom he was always master archie and quite a little boy still it mattered not one rap to her that he had his own valet none other indeed than william who in days gone by had fished him out of the lake and received a gold watch and chain for the rescue for blessington was always in and out of his room taking coats and trousers away to have buttons more securely adjusted and loading her workbasket with piles of his socks and underclothing in which her eyes still needlesharp for all her seventyfive years had detected holes that required darning this habit of hers sometimes drove william nearly mad for blessington would take away all archies washing when it came back from the laundry in order to inspect it thoroughly and when his distracted valet wanted clean clothes and applied to her for them she would often entirely forget that she had taken them and firmly deny the appropriation then william would craftily manage to get her to open her cupboard door and lo there was all archies clean linen and blessington would exclaim eh i must have taken it and it went out of my head or she would abstract his sponge from the bathroom in order to put a stitch into it and archie sitting in his bath would find nothing to wash himself with but blessington was a sacred and a beloved institution and as long as she was happy which she most undoubtedly was when archie was there to look after and inconvenience no one minded these magpieannexations of portable property of all hours in the day blessington loved best this evening visit of archies when he sat among the tokens of his childhood the playtable which now scarcely reached up to his knees the little armchair with its bar of wood strung through the arms so as to imprison and guard the sitter the box of oakbricks with which he used to build houses of amazing architecture the depleted regiments of leadsoldiers which still stood on the mantelshelf her great delight was to recall to him the days of his childhood his naughtiness the scrapes he got into the whole patchwork of memories that retained still such lively and beloved colouring and for him too during this last week there had been in these talks a way of escape from this nightmare of his present experience it was he himself after all who had put the coals on his mothers hearthrug had fished for pike with william had attended in rapturous trepidation the advents of abracadabra these days seemed much further off from him than they did from her for a bitter impassable water lay between them and him while for her they had only receded a little further into the placid and sunny distance of her days but when he talked them over with her he could recapture a dreamlike illusion of getting back into a life of which the most alarming feature was the presence of his father over everything else there hung enchantment he was sitting now in blessingtons rockingchair having tried without success to squeeze himself into the imprisoning seat of his childhood and she was recalling the awful episode of the burnt rug eh whatever possessed you to go and do it she said i cant understand to this day master archie im speaking of when you set fire to your mammas rug tell me about that said archie well it was on an afternoon when you had a cold and your mamma had allowed you to sit in her room while she went out driving and what must you do but empty all the fire from the hearth on to her rug you nearly got a whipping for that from your papa archie remembered that moment quite well and how he had stood in his fathers study frightened but defiant and refusing to say he was sorry when he was not then his mother had come in and had pointed to a bottle on the table and told his father that he ought to learn his lesson first before he gave archie one that had puzzled him at the time though it was clear enough now his father still had that lesson to learn and archie during this last week had begun to understand a little why his father had not yet learned it if learning it implied the giving up of all that battles stood for he recalled himself with a jerk he wanted to get back into the enchanted land which blessingtons reminiscences outlined for him yes that hearthrug he said that was a bad business wasnt it blessington what do you think put it into my head to empty the fire on to it bless the boy i dont know said blessington it was just mischief yes but whats mischief asked archie blessington was a simple and direct theologian well i shouldnt wonder if its doing what sapum wants you to do said she sapum being her equivalent for the archenemy i shouldnt wonder either said archie but its rather beastly of sapum to take possession of a very small boy with a bad cold in the head eh he takes possession of us all if we let him observed blessington but that was the naughtiest thing you ever did dear i wouldnt lay it up to you now was i good as a rule asked he yes master archie for a boy you were said blessington boys are more trouble than girls as is natural and proper but doesnt sapum enter into girls too asked he with another thought in his mind yes to be sure but not so violentlike and when after that you were took ill and we all went out toeh whats the name of that place in switzerlandi must say you were wonderfully good it was as if some angel took possession of you not one of sapums flibertigibbits you were no trouble at all and see how quick you got well archie rocked himself backwards and forwards for a minute in silence i wish i could remember martin he said at length tell me something about martin eh dear lamb said she couldnt he be naughty too when the fit took him but then he got ill and manys the time when ive longed for him to be naughty again and he hadnt the spirit for it he didnt want to die and right up to the end he thought hed get better you papa never loved any one like he loved him and nobody could help loving him he was like a april morning dearsunshine one minute and squalls the next and there was months master archie when we thought you would follow him blessington grew a little tearful with the sweet easy tears of oldage over this and archie changed the subject and abracadabra now he asked what evenings those birthdays evenings were werent they i wish abracadabra came still bringing all we wanted what would you choose blessington blessington beamed again eh i know what id choose she said id choose a nice young lady to come here and you and she take a fancy to each other dear thats what id choose isnt there some nice young lady master archie archie stopped his rocking for a moment and a bitter word was on the end of his tongue then he smiled back at his nurses radiant face im going to marry you blessington he said when youre old enough dont you go flirting with anybody else now blessington gave a little cackle of soft toothless laughter well i never she said who ever heard such a thing well youve heard of it now said he blessington i believe theres somebody else after you i say did you ever have any lovers once upon a time blessington looked solemn again well there was your papas gamekeeper once she said who made a silly of himself as if id got nothing better to do than go and marry him i didnt suffer any of his nonsense and theres the sound of the motor thatll be your mamma and miss jessie coming theres a nice young lady now do you like her better than miss helena asked archie blessington nodded her head very emphatically not that i say she isnt a nice young lady too she said mysteriously whats the matter with her then asked archie blessington looked the incarnation of discretion i say nothing she said but theres some as are artful and some as are not now my dear you must go and see your mamma or shell be wondering where you are im with my young woman said archie there get along with you said blessington eh master archie i love a talk over old times with you archie went reluctantly away to greet his mother and jessie for these talks with blessington had become to him a sort of oasis in this weary wilderness of scorching sand through which he had to travel all day and for many hours of the night she was the comforter of the troubles of his earliest childhood it was she who had always been by him if some nightmare snatched him from sleep or if the dark developed terrors and that habit of calling on her for aid established among the mists of dawning consciousness he found still alive as an instinct when there came on him now the maturer woes of love and manhood throughout his school life and his three years at cambridge he had never quite let go of blessingtons hand which had been the first to direct and sustain his tottering attempts at locomotion now too she was the only member of his immediate circle who did not know of his trouble and it was an unutterable relief to feel that he was not being pitied and sympathized with by somebody for though there is nothing in the world better than sympathy and pity no sufferer smarting from a recent wound wants to live exclusively in such surroundings pity and sympathy though they heal yet touch the wound and he never got over the impression when he was with his mother for instance that his wound was being dressed jessie did not force that on him so much yet with her he was always being reminded of the fact that she was helenas sister but with blessington he could go back into the sunlight of the past talk with her and another occupation temporary he told himself to tide him over those days enabled him to get away to some extent from himself he met his mother in the hall and instantly those anxious eyes of love which for all his affection for her he found irritating were on him she was at his wound again taking off the bandages seeing how it was getting on and how are you darling she said looking at him with the tenderness that got on his nerves archie kissed her i am quite well thanks he said i have just been having a talk with blessington my dear how she would like that said lady tintagel with eager cordiality that was thoughtful of you archie jerked himself away from her though his mother said nothing direct he felt that pity filled her mind he was in its presence and longed to get away from it all the time another distinct piece of his mind wanted to hear about helena but he could not ask any question about her how are you archie said jessie quietly archies exasperation suddenly flared up i have just told my mother i am very well he said i am still very well thank you jessie laughed she managed better than lady tintagel in that case come and have a game of golfcroquet with me she said theres time before we need dress isnt there i do want some air so badly after town archie glanced at the clock he usually went to his fathers study about this time when they celebrated the approaching advent of dinner with a cocktail or two that was the beginning of the tolerable part of the day there was plenty of wine at dinner and afterwards a succession of whiskies and sodas and to be alive became quite a bearable condition again on that first evening when helena had told him her news and paid her halfcrowns he had found that alcohol broke down his sense of being stunned of being made of wood now he drank for another reason by drink he got rid of the misery of normal consciousness and emerged into some sort of life again it stimulated his brain he could by its means escape for a little from that one perpetual thought of helena that went round in his head like a stick in a backwater and get into the current again sometimes he would go to his room taking a whisky and soda with him and wrestle with the seasketches he had so enthusiastically worked at at silorno by degrees the liquid in his glass ebbed and his pile of cigaretteends mounted and he would go back for fresh supplies but while these hours lasted he lived and what tomorrow should bring he did not in the least care he could escape for a few hours now and that was sufficient also when he went to bed he could sleep heavily and dreamlessly there was still time for a game with jessie before going in to his father jessie would take longer to dress for dinner than he and there would be a few minutes to spare after she went upstairs but even as they were strolling across the lawn to get the croquetballs from their box she a little ahead of him as he nursed a match for his cigarette he looked up and there in front of him might have been helena the two were of the same height and build they moved like each other it was jessie of course but just for a second while his match burned up in the hollow of his hand it was not she at all he threw the match away get the balls out will you he said ive left my cigarettecase in my fathers room he ran back to the house and went in through the garden door of his fathers study lord tintagel was sitting in the big leather armchair with his feet up on another and a glass beside him just come for a cocktail father said archie hullo theyre not here yet it doesnt matter ill take a glass of whisky and soda by all means take what you like said the other drowsily you mothers come hasnt she yes mother and jessie said archie pouring himself out some whisky the sodawater was nearly exhausted but the dregs of it gurgled pleasantly over the spirit he drank it in a couple of gulps what are you going to do now asked his father only have a game with jessie all right call in here when its time to go up and dress therell be a cocktail for you then infernal lazy fellows the servants are not to bring them in earlier chuck me over the evening paper will you the evening remission from deadness and dulness and misery had begun for archie he played his game with jessie drank his cocktail and by the end of dinner had risen to such naturalness of good spirits again that his mother commended herself for the wisdom of her plan that he should leave london and seek a change of mind in a change of scene he had done some writing since he had been here he seemed pleased with the way it was going and she talked hopefully to jessie when they held a rather protracted sitting in the drawingroom before the two men joined them perhaps they had both overrated the strength of archies attachment certainly tonight he did not appear like a boy who had so lately suffered an overwhelming disappointment in his affections and blessington says he has been just as delightful and affectionate to her as usual said lady tintagel he goes and talks to her every evening as he always did i think you must have been wrong dear jessie when you thought he was so mortally hurt jessie did not reply at once she felt sure that she with the insight of that love which is more comprehending than any mothers love was somehow right about that point it was not the mere lapse of a week that had restored archie besides blessington did not know about his troubles she could easily conjecture what a relief he might find in that she knew that she would feel the same in his place she could understand how much easier it was to behave normally with those who did not know than with those who did yet archies father knew and all through dinner she had seen how friendly and intimate the two had become archie used to be constrained and awkward with his father while his father used to be rather contemptuous of him but this evening there had been none of that on either side and now they lingered together a long time over their talk and their cigarettes it was as if some bond of sympathy was springing up between them but she shrank from admitting the explanation to herself it might be that a man who had been so bitterly disappointed about a girl found something in another man that suited his mood women would remind him of a woman there was a shout of laughter in the hall outside and archie came in followed by his father he did not communicate the grounds for his merriment but looking a little flushed very handsome and very content sat down on the sofa by his mother well mother darling he said instantly her love yearned forth to him my dear it is good to hear you laugh she said what have you and your father been talking about the sense of being watched the love that irritated did not trouble archie now the sunny hours would stretch unclouded until he fell into bed he laughed again looking across to his father i say father he said shall i tell her or would she think it not quite just as you like said lord tintagel the door into the garden already ajar swung gently open admitting a breath of cool nightair into the room it stirred in jessies hair as it passed her and moved across to archie making the flowers in a vase near him vibrate and for just that moment some impulse from the untainted tranquillity stirred in his soul and his overheated stimulated brain drank it thirstily in his own laughter and the subject of his laughter the whole contents of the last hour or two seemed stale and stuffy the air of them was thick with the fumes of wine with the fancies and images that it evoked smokewreaths that hung heavy in the atmosphere swirling and turning like dancers and melting into other shapes but for that moment when the nightair came in from the crystalclear dusk outside that liquid tabernacle of sapphire in the holy night where stars sang together and nightingales burned the hot fumes dispersed and he drew in long tranquillizing breaths this physical impression had too its psychical counterpart for even as the air that stirred in jessies hair brought a coolness and a refreshment to him so from the girl herself there seemed to stream into it a current of something wholesome and human and unfevered unvexed by desire and untouched by bitterness its rather hot in here he said will you come for a stroll jessie they went out together the heavens were full of stars and a slip of a moon was near to its setting over the beds below the windows there hovered the fainter fragrance of sleeping flowers that stood with hanging heads and leaves that glimmered with the falling dew beyond lay the dimmed mirror of the lake and beside it rose the dark mass of the wood in which the nightingales were singing the scene seemed prepared for some human loveduet when lovers fancy that nature is arranging her most sensuous effects for their benefit though in reality she is but pursuing the path ordained for her by the wheeling seasons and predicted by barometers and apparatus that is concerned only with heat and movements of the moon and of lovers there was one of each pair absent as the two walked quietly towards the wood of the nightingales for jessie there was no eager mate and for archie none two hungry souls both longing both unsatisfied went forth on that twilit pilgrimage spring still stirred in them and there burned above them the everlasting choir of the stars but that helped in no way had they been lovers an autumn squall or a winter snowstorm would have served their purpose just as well archie chattered for a little while comparing the moon to a clipped fingernail the dimmed mirror of the lake to a frozen rink in switzerland with all the hollowness of superficial talk when the tongue speaks from habit which is as lightly rooted as the seed on stony ground heartwhole he had often chattered like that and jessie had sunned herself and responded to those silly things but now she knew as well as he that the babble was no more than blown seafoam it made her heart ache that he should talk it to her for though she made no claim on his love it was miserable that he could not recognize how true a friend it was who was by his side in this songhaunted darkness she knewnone betterthat he had no love to give her but her love that was so disciplined to go hungry without crying out starved for a word from him that should fly the flag of friendship noblest of all ensigns that are not of royal emblazonment they had come to the edge of the lake and a moorhen steered its waterlogged flight across the surface and then archies foolish chatter died and he was silent as he watched the rayed ripple of water the wash died away in the reeds and chuckled on the bank and at last he spoke why did helena treat me like that he said it wasnt fair on me why did she encourage me she might so easily have shown me that she didnt care she knew dont tell me she didnt know do answer me didnt she know all the time that we were in town together she knew and she let me go on she was waiting to see if she could catch the bradshaw if she couldnt perhaps she would have taken me was it so you ought to know youre her sister his voice had risen from the first reproach of his speech to a fury of indignation did she love me or didnt she he cried do tell me if you know his passion had found combustible material in her she flamed with it helena doesnt love anybody she said oh archie poor helena poor helena said he why poor surely its far more comfortable to love nobody oh dont remind me of that stupid rot about it being better to have loved and lost anyhow a worse thing is to have loved and not found thats what has happened to me and she made me think i had found she meant to make me think that damned well she succeeded too and if youre right about her not loving anybody do you mean that she doesnt love the bradshaw archie had closed a grip on her arm now she shook his hand off though loving to have it there i cant answer you that she said and i oughtnt to have said that helena loves nobody i withdraw that entirely the saying of it you mean said he you dont withdraw your belief in it i dont know the truth of it what i said was only my opinion and i withdraw it i oughtnt to have said it but you keep your opinion asked he you shouldnt ask me that i have withdrawn what i said please accept that in this high noon of stars she could see his face very clearly it was not angry any longer it was just empty as if there was no one there behind the eyes and the mouth it was a face empty swept and garnished ready for any occupant who might take possession the sweet clean water of his nature must have run out on to desert sands the cistern of the body into which it had so swiftly and boyishly bubbled all these years was empty just for one second that impression lasted inscrutably frightening her with some nightmare touch archie she cried are you there is it you she heard a dreary little laugh for answer oh i suppose so he said i answer to my name dont i she longed with a force of passion quite new to her to be able to reach him in some way to let her love be coined into the commoner metal of friendship if only that could get to him and give him the sense that he had something in his pocket worth having even though it was not gold she would have gleefully melted all her love into a currency that could have enriched him for he did not want her love and she had no other use for it except to help him in some way and as if to answer her yearning he took her arm again not angrily now but with the quiet pressure of a man with a sympathetic friend youre a good pal jessie he said im awfully grateful to you you wont play me false with your friendship will you no my dear said she stumbling a little on the words imim not like that the more you count on me the better i shall be pleased im stupid at saying things but oh archie if a friend is any use to you youve got one and let me say just once how sorry i am for all this miserable business thanks jessie said he they had turned back towards the house and jessie unconscious of anything else except archie saw that they were already half across the lawn that lay dripping with dew her thin satin shoes were soaked and the hem of her dress trailed on the grass but she regarded that no more than she would have regarded it had she been walking in the dark with her lover then archie spoke againthere was no more emotion in his voice than if he had been speaking through a telephone do keep on trying to be friends with me jessie he said im nothing at all just now im dead but will you watch by the corpse it likes to know you are there theres no complaint if you go away but when sometimes you have nothing to do you might just sit with it archie dear dont talk such nonsense she said i daresay it is nonsense but it seems to me sense i dont feel as if i was anybody i can imagine what a house feels like that has been happily lived in for years when the family goes away and leaves it empty theres a board up to let unfurnished and the windows get dirty and the knocker and doorhandle which were so well rubbed and polished get dull there used to be curtains in the windows and in the evening passersby in the street could see chinks of light from within and perhaps hear sounds of laughter but now there are no curtains and the pictures have gone from the walls leaving oblong marks where they used to hang and the spirit of the house stares mournfully out thinking of the days when there was laughter and love within its walls havent you ever seen a house like that theyre common enough she pressed the hand that lay loose in the crook of her elbow oh archie you give me such a heartache she said well i wont again but if you think me wanting in affection to mother or you or anybody just remember that im an empty house for the present i daresay somebody will take me again jessie felt that this was a truer archie than he who had stopped so long in the diningroom and come in afterwards with a shout of laughter over something that he would not recount but by now their stroll had taken them close to the long grey front of the house and for the present archie had no more to say and was evidently meaning to go indoors again upstairs all was dark but below the five windows of the drawingroom uncurtained and open cast oblongs of light on to the gravel and next to them the two windows of lord tintagels study were lit even as they stepped from the grass on to the walk and their footsteps became audible again his figure silhouetted against the light appeared there and the windowsash rattled as he opened it wider is that you archie he called come in and see me before you go upstairs all right father said he were just coming in jessie heard a fresh vigour in his quickened voice and in the light from the windows she could see that his face was alert again and it was with a sense of certainty that she guessed what had given him this sudden animation perhaps it was only the knowledge of his fathers habits that informed her perhaps it was a brainwave passing from him to her that told her that inside his fathers room were the things for which he craved the cool hiss of bubbling water on to the ice that swam in the spirits youre not going to sit up long are you she said oh i dont know my father and i often have a talk in the evening and sometimes i do some writing before i go to bed its quite a good time for writing when every one has gone to bed and the house is quiet you always used to say at silorno that you wrote best in the morning yes but that was at silorno where i could lie on the beach and go for a swim at intervals lord what jolly days they were its a pity they are all dead they went through the french window into the drawingroom and found that lady tintagel had already gone upstairs archie stood by jessie shifting from one foot to the other in evident impatience at her lingering well youll be wanting to go to bed he said i daresay youll go in and have a talk with my mother and do you know my fathers waiting for me i think ill join him i shall soon come upstairs i expect i feel rather like writing tonight im glad youre going on with that she said thats something left isnt it the house isnt quite empty archie he laughed no i can trace my name in the dust on the windowpanes he said but ill go to my father goodnight jessie lord tintagel rather unusually was deep in the evening paper when archie entered archie noticed with some surprise that his glass still stood untouched on the tray rather nasty news he said not looking up give me my drink archie theres a good fellow plenty of ice and not much soda and whats the news asked archie well it looks as if there might really be trouble brewing servia has appealed to russia against the austrian ultimatum i wonder if germany can really be at the bottom of it all and the city takes a gloomy view of it all russian securities are heavily down does that affect you asked archie bringing him his drink yes ive got a big account open in them i wonder if i had better sell of course there wont be war were always having these scares and they always come to nothing but if dealers are anxious prices may fall a good bit yet and i should find it difficult to pay my differences archie poured himself out his first tumbler he held it in his hand a moment not tasting it now that he had got it delay when the delay was voluntary would but add deliciousness to the moment when his mouth and throat would feel that cold sting i dont understand he said watching the bubbles stream up from the sides and bottom of his glass his father threw down the paper its as simple as heads and tails he said ive bought a quantity of russian mining shares without paying for them in the hope that they will go up if they do i shall sell at the higher price and pocket the difference but if they go down i shall have to pay the difference at the next account if the shares are each worth l now and at the next account are only standing at l i shall have to pay l on each share if i like i can telegraph to my broker to sell now while theyre at l i shall have a loss because i bought them at l but i shall no longer be running any risks but its thirsty work talking just fill my glass again but then if the scare dies down again i suppose your shares will go up said archie his father laughed sound business head youve got archie he said youve got the hang of it its just heads and tails never you speculate its a rotten business ive got into the habit now but i recommend you not to take to it its easy enough to take to it but its the devil to break it same with other things make a habit of virtue and youll never go to the deuce he watched archie a moment who with head thrown back and young strong throat throbbing as he swallowed was reaping the rewards of his delay in drinking and when with brightened eyes he put his glass down he stood there like some modern incarnation of dionysus his face pure greek from the lowgrowing brown curls to the straight nose and the short round chin with a cloak over his shoulders in exchange for his dressclothes with sandals for his patent leather shoes and a winecup for his tall glass he might have stepped straight from some templefrieze and his father wondered how any girl in her senses could have chosen the precise pedantic man whom she was soon going to marry when archie was but waiting as she must have known for his moment he poor fellow was often a very dreary and dispirited boy all day but in the evening he came to himself again and was what he used to be and yet though it seemed to lord tintagel a cruel thing to wish to deprive him of the few hours of the joy of living that were his during the day he was smitten with the easy and vague remorse of a man only halfsober to see the effect that alcohol had on archie who all his life till now had scarcely tasted it but he remembered when he himself had been at that stage he remembered also his father giving him just such a warning as he now proposed to give archie he wished he had taken notice of it and he hoped that archie would that evening thirty years ago he recalled now with extreme distinctness the scene had taken place in this very room and his father already halftipsy as his habit was had warned him of the dangers of drink and he remembered how laughable and grotesque such a warning had seemed coming from lips that had lost all precision of utterance but he told himself that he was not going to commit any such absurdity he was perfectly sober indeed it seemed very likely that it had never entered archies head to think of him as a drunkard sometimes he stumbled a little going upstairs at night sometimes he had an impression that his pronunciation was not quite distinct but he never became incapable as he could remember his father becoming and being carried off to bed by two perspiring footmen he put down his second glass without tasting it theres something i want to speak to you about archie he said and you mustnt be vexed with me because im only doing what i believe to be my duty you wont be vexed will you archie looked at him in surprise no i dont suppose i shall father he said what is it his father got up and stood by his chair quite steadily for he leaned back against the high chimneypiece well i want to you be careful about that stuff he said pointing to the bottle thats one of the habits i was speaking about which they say is so easy to keep clear of but so hard to break you drink rather freely you know whereas a few months ago you never touched wine or spirits its an awful snareyou may get badly entangled in it before you know you are caught at all archie kept his lucid eyes fixed on his fathers and not a tremor of his beautiful mouth betrayed his inward laughter his derisive merriment at this solemn adjuration delivered by a man who spoke very carefully for fear of his words all running into each other like the impress of ink on blottingpaper it really was ludicrously funny and the immortal mr stiggins came into his mind i hope you dont think a whisky and soda after dinner is dangerous father he said you usually have one yourself you know he moved across to the table as he spoke and handed his father the drink he had mixed for him but a few moments before lord tintagel quite missing the irony of the act began sipping it as he talked no of course not my dear boy he said im not a faddist who thinks theres a microbe of delirium tremens in every glass of wine butthough you may never have heard ityour grandfather was a man who habitually took too much and its strange how that sort of failing runs in families archies mouth broadened into a smile skipping a generation now and then he said gravely his father turned sharply on him eh what he asked he looked hard at archie for a momentas hard that is as his rather wandering power of focus allowed himand suddenly beheld himself with archies eyes even as thirty years ago he had beheld his father when he spoke to him on precisely the same theme he put down his glass and a wave of shame as he saw himself as archie saw him went over him i know this doesnt come very well from me archie he said its ridiculous isnt it but i meant well he looked at the boy with a pathetic deprecating glance if i make an effort will you make one too he asked ive gone far along that road and i should be sorry to see you following me i should indeed just now i know youre unhappy and a bottle of wine makes things more tolerable doesnt it archie in his empty exasperated heart felt a sort of pity for his father which was based on scorn something inside lord tintagel was probably serious and sincere and yet it was what he had drunk that stimulated his scruples for archie he was in a mellow kindly moralizing stage in his cups that archie had often noticed before certainly he himself did not want to become like that but he felt that he was not within measurable distance of the need of making any resolution on the subject so far was he from needing the exercise of his will just at present even as his father had said he was unhappy and his unhappiness melted in the sunshine of drink he did not care for it in itself he but took it so he told himself like medicine because his mind was ailing well let us talk about it tomorrow he said well make some rule shall we father and dont imagine for a moment that i am vexed with you but i shall go upstairs now i think ive got some writing i want to do he hesitated a moment ill just take a nightcap with me he said goodnight father goodnight my dear boy god bless you well have a talk tomorrow archie took the glass he had filled out into the hall and waited there a moment and the pity faded from his mind leaving only contempt it was just the maudlin mood that had prompted his father to be so ridiculous and talk about resolutions certainly resolutions would do him no harm and the keeping of them would undoubtedly do him good for instead of the firm masterful man whom archie had known as the rather prodigious denizen of that formidable room there sat there now a weak entangled creature archie could hardly believe that in years not so long past he had been afraid of his father now his whole force that dominating intangible quality had vanished occasionally he still flew into fits of anger that alarmed nobody but that was all that was left of his power archie sat for a few minutes on the halltable instead of going upstairs for he meant with a certain object in view to go back to his fathers room on some trivial errand and as he waited the big clock ticked him back into boyhood there was the fireplace by which abracadabra sat on the last of her appearances there the screen behind which as he had subsequently ascertained william had hidden with a trumpet and the servants dinnerbell there the sidedoor into the gardens through which pleasingly excited he had hurried with the box for coffin of the dead bird which the cat had killed a hundred memories crowded about him and not one save where blessington was concerned held any romance or tenderness for him they were as meaningless as pictures taken out from the empty house and leaning against the railings in the street in the house itself his bitter lonely spirit there was nothing left but the places where once they hung he went back to his fathers room crossing the hall with light foot and turning the handle of the door with swiftness and silence there was his father by the table filling his glass again it was just that which archie wished to verify i only came back for a book he said goodnight again chapter x archie went straight up to his room his brimming glass was difficult to carry quite steadily and he reduced its contents halfway upstairs william had orders always to put whisky and soda in his room in case he wanted to sit up and write but sometimes william forgot or at any rate did not obey and archie wondered if the man did it on purpose with perhaps the same excellent intentions as those which flowered so decorously in his fathers mind but tonight all was as it should be and as it was very hot archie undressed and put on his pyjamas before settling down to work writing the absorbing joy of creation the delicate etching of sentences that bit into the plate still possessed him when he had taken the requisite evening dose but tonight though he had got his material ready his hand could not accomplish the fashioning of it and he got up and walked with bare feet once or twice up and down the room wondering why he could not link up his thoughts to his power of expression he was nearly at the end of one of those seastories which he had begun at silorno and he knew exactly what he meant to say the braincentre that dictated was charged and sufficiently stimulated and yet he could get nothing on to paper that was worth putting there though he was ready to write and wanted to write he had not drunk too much and made himself fuddled he had not drunk too little and left the bitter weeds of daily consciousness uncovered like rocks at low tide he sat and thought wrote and impatiently erased again and at last put down his pen perhaps even this the only living interest that just now existed for him was being taken from him also and was following down the channel which had emptied itself into helena she had taken from him everything else that meant life it would be like her consistency to take that also and leave him nude and empty it was not that she wanted the gift which shein his vague excited thoughtseemed to be robbing him of it was only that she and the memory of how she had treated him was a vampire to his blood she had sucked him empty drained him dry of happiness of joy of life of human interests more than that his love the best thing which he had to give her and for which she had no use she now seemed to have treated with some devilish alchemy so that it turned bitter hate like some oozy scum rose from the depths of it and covered its crystal with poisonous growth this would never do the rocks at low tide had become uncovered and while he slipped and stumbled among them bruising himself at every step with the thought of helena he could never get that abstraction and detachment which he knew were the necessary conditions of his writing and all power of achieving that seemed taken from him he felt himself an impotent atom unable to order the workings of his own brain defenceless against any thoughts that might assault him the house was perfectly quiet the stillness of the midsummer night had flowed into its open windows and drowned it deep in that profound tranquillity that was yet tense with the energy of the spinning world and the farflung orbits of the myriad stars the moon had long since sunk but the galaxy of uncounted worlds flared on their courses driven onwards by the inexhaustible eternity of creative forces that ran through the stars even as it ran through the humblest herb that put forth its unnoticed blossom on the wayside but archie in this bitter stagnation that paralysed him seemed to himself to have no part in life all that current of energy that bubbled through the world with its impulses of good and evil love and hate seemed to have been cut off from him he neither loved nor hated any more there was the nightmare of this death in life at any price and under whatever inspiration he longed to be in the current again tonight even drink had failed him he had walked across to the window and came back to his chair at the table where was spread the sheet of paper covered with the scrawlings and erasures which were all the last two hours had to show and at this precise moment as he looked at them in a dull despair and idea flashed across the blank field of his brain perhaps there might still be some spark of life of individuality latent without him which he could reach by that surrender of his conscious self which had been familiar to him in his childhood there just in front of him below his shaded lamp lay his cigarettecase with one bright point of light on it and lying back in his chair with halfclosed eyes he gazed at this in order to produce that hypnotic condition in which the subconscious self comes to the surface almost at once the mysterious spell began to act across the field of his vision there began to pass waves of light and shadow moving upwards with a regular motion while through them like a buoy moored in a rough sea there remained steadfast that bright speck on his cigarettecase now for a moment submerged in a wave of shadow but appearing again upwards and upwards moved the waves and then it seemed that it was they which were stationary while he himself was sinking down through them as through crystalclear waters looking up at the sunny surface which rose ever higher and more remote above him as he sank into this dim delicious world the sensation of being alive again and in touch with living intelligences grew momently more vivid it was the very seat and hearth of life that in him before had been cold and numbed now though surface perceptions were gradually withdrawn his essential being tingled with the rapture of returning vitality once or twice during this descent his ears through which there poured the roar of rushing waters had been startled as by some surface perception of the sound of loud rappings somewhere in the room but they had not disturbed his steadfast gaze at the point of light and once again he had heard a voice faintly familiar near him that said i am coming but he was far too intent on his progress to let the interruption break in upon it and indeed those sounds seemed to be less an interruption than a confirmation to his surfacesenses of what was happening to him and then he knew as he sank down to rest at last on the bottom of that unsounded sea who it was who was filling him with the sense of life again for echoing not only in his ears but somewhere in his soul he heard the same voice which he now clearly recognized and which had spoken to him years ago at grives say archie i am here archie was conscious on two separate planes of consciousness all round him and high above him were the gleams and aqueous shadows of the subconscious world but here and there those seemed to be pierced and through them as through rents of mist he had glimpses of the material plane he could see for instance part of the sheet of paper in front of him and he could see the far corner of his table and by it very faint and unfocusable part of it in the mists of the subconscious world part in the harder outlines of reality there was standing the figure of a young man how it was dressed he could not see or did not care to notice but when for a moment the mist cleared off its face he recognized the strong likeness to himself even as he had recognized the likeness to himself in the photograph which he had found in the cache but here was no photograph instead mysteriously translated into outlines and features visible to mortal eyes was the semblance of martin himself it wavered and flickered like the blown flame of a candle but it was there standing at the corner of his table and as it spoke he saw the mouth move and the throat throb i have managed to come back archie he said because you were in such trouble and because you didnt understand the warning you had do you understand now the whole explanation flashed on him the dream he said the white statue of helena and the worms surely it was odd you didnt understand you only loved the white statue you loathed what came out of it just as you loathe what has come out of the white statue since archie leaned forward peering into the mist that at this moment quite enveloped the figure but i love her too martin he cried i long for her out of the mist came the unseen voice you long for what she looks like it said you hate what she is that may be but the whole thing makes me utterly miserable table and figure the white paper and the tray with syphon and whisky became suddenly visible you must learn not to be miserable said that compassionate mouth be very patient archie you think you are stumbling through absolute darkness but in reality you are flooded with light i cant see the darkness which you feel is so impenetrable i only see you walking towards the ineffable radiance always moving towards it occupy yourself and try to grow indifferent to that part of helena which you hate cling to love always just cling to love never hate some time you may get to love what you hated the voice sank lower the power is failing it said i am losing touch with you oh dont go said archie martin stop with me talk to me i want to say so much to you he reached out his hand and for a moment out of the sunlit mists that had gathered again he felt perfectly clearly the touch of fingers that pressed his but they died away into nothing as he clasped them and the voice faded to the faintest whisper i will come again dear archie it said it is easiest at night the lines of shadow and light that undulated before his eyes grew thinner and more transparent and he could see the drawnback windowcurtains and the black square of the night through them the bright point at which he had been looking withdrew on to the surface of his cigarettecase and slowly the whole room emerged into its normal appearance archie became suddenly conscious of a profound physical fatigue and leaving all thought and reflection till tomorrow put out his light and stepped into bed but instead of the empty desolation that had made a wilderness round him waters of healing had broken out in his soul and the desert blossomed archie slept that night the clean outdoor sleep which he had been used to at silorno and woke next morning not with the crapulous drowsiness that now usually accompanied his wakings but with the alert refreshment that slumber in the open air gave him he sprang into full possession of his faculties and complete memory of what he had experienced the night before he was quite aware that any scientific interpreter science being best defined as the habit of denying what passes the limits of materialistic explanation would have said that tired with the effort to write he had fallen asleep over his table and dreamed but he knew better than that the experience with its audible and visible phenomena was not a dream nor did it ever so faintly resemble one a dream at best was a fantastic unreality what he had experienced at his writingtable last night was based upon the firm foundations of reality itself it was no hashup of his own conscious or subconscious reflections no extract distilled from his own mind it came from without and entered into him and unlike most of the communications that purported to reach the minds of sensitives from the world that lay beyond the perception of their normal senses there was guidance and help in it often if not invariably these messages from beyond were trivial and nugatory it was a just criticism to say that the senders of them did not appear possessed of much worth the trouble of sending but martins visit had not been concerned with trifles like that he had sympathized as a brother might with archies trouble he had explained so that archie could not longer doubt the manner of the warning he had received before but not understood he had spoken of archie as being wrapped according to his own sensations in impenetrable darkness though to one who looked from beyond he was ever moving towards the ineffable radiance it was the same discarnate intelligence that when he was a child had conveyed to him the knowledge of that cache under the pinetree which was unknown to any living being as men count living and that could not have been conveyed to him through any telepathic channel except one that had its source and spring not in this world and now from the same source had come this message from one who saw through the gross darkness of archies emptiness and bitter heart and had promised to be with him again archie had no doubt whatever as he got up with an alertness that had not been his for weeks of the genuineness of the communication it linked on with martins previous visits and the glimpses he had received of the materialized form of his visitor confirmed exactly the recognition years before of the photograph he had found in the cache which martin had told him of and the power in whose hands were all things had compassionated his trouble and had allowed in pity for his need the gateless barrier to be again unbarred and a spirit individual and recognized to pass to and fro between him and the realms of the light invisible it was just when his soul despaired that this happened when he felt himself denuded of all that he had loved empty and cast out from life itself just in that hour had martin been permitted to come back to him he found his mother and jessie at breakfast when he went down his father as usual had not appeared and again as last night when he came out of the diningroom after a prolonged sitting he felt kindly and affectionate but this was not from the sottish satisfaction of wine the light came from that subtle window in his soul from which once more the shutters had been thrown back the moment jessie saw him she felt the quality of that change he was like the archie of silorno again good morning mother darling he said kissing her good morning jessie how bright and early we all are and has everybody slept as serenely as i you didnt sleep very long archie did you asked the girl whose room was next his i heard you hammering at something after i had gone to bed and i awoke once and heard you talking to somebody archie at the sidetable helping himself to sausage paused a moment he made up his mind that for the present anyhow he preferred that jessie should not know about the return of martin perhaps he would tell her quietly when alone hammering he said yes there was a despatchcase and i couldnt find the key so i whacked it open about talkingyes i was writing last night and i believe i read it aloud to myself before i went to bed i never know what a thing is like unless i read it aloud oh do read it aloud to me said the girl when its in order it wasnt quite in order when i read it over but i was sleepy and went to bed jessie said no more but for some reason this account left her unsatisfied the hammering had not sounded quite like the forcing of the lock of a despatchcase it had been like sharp blows on wood and for a moment she had thought that archie was tapping loudly on the door that separated their rooms it had stopped and began again a little later as for the talking it had sounded precisely like two voices one undeniably archies the other low and indistinct archie changed the subject the moment he had given this explanation and made some very surprising observations helena is married on the th of august isnt she he asked i must get her a wedding present and i shall come to her wedding that will convey my good wishes in the usual manner wont it i want to assure her of them both of the women looked at him in the intensest surprise to lady tintagel he had never mentioned helenas name since the day she had accepted lord harlow while to jessie only last night he had loaded her with the bitterest reproaches and had spoken of the abject despair and emptiness which had come upon him in consequence of what she had done and he looked at each of them in turn with that vivid brilliant glance which had been so characteristic of him yes i make a public recantation he said it suddenly dawned on me last night that i have been behaving just about as stupidly as a man can behave ive said nothing to you mother but jessie knows i want her to try to forget what for instance i said to her last night i can do better than that and at any rate i propose to try all the time that i havent been mad with resentment ive been dead well i hereupon announce the resurrection of archibald thats all ive got to say on the subject at that moment swift as an arrows flight and certain as an intuition there came to jessie the odd idea that it was not archie who was speaking at all it might be his lips and tongue that fashioned the audible syllables but it was not he in the sense that it had been he down by the lake last night savage and bitter as he had been there he was authentic now all that he said despite the absolute naturalness of his manner seemed to ring false she could not account for this impression in the least it was not the suddenness of the change in his attitude though that surprised her it was some remoter quality which her brain could not analyse something more intimate to herself than her brain had perceived it and mere thought mere reason were blind to it archie did not accompany his mother and jessie to church that morning but waited for lord tintagels appearance and the discussion of the good resolutions which were to be so beneficial to each of them he sat in his fathers study and having to wait some time before he made a shaky and disastrous entrance thought over in connection with the events of last night what he himself had said that morning at breakfast that surely was the gist of martins message to him he must try to grow indifferent to that part of helena which he hated he must learn not to be miserable to grasp the fact that the darkness in which he seemed to walk appeared to martin no darkness at all but a flood of light from the ineffable radiance it was in the glow of that revelation that he had spoken at breakfast trusting in the truth of it and yet as he sat now waiting for his father he knew he did not feel the truth of it but in obedience to martin that was how he had to behave he must behave like thatthis was what martin meantuntil he felt the soul within him grow up like some cellarsown plant into the light hopefully and bravely had he announced his intention but now when in cooler mood he scrutinized it he began to feel how tremendous was the task set him how firmly rooted was that passionate resentment which must be alchemized into love it had been truemartin saw that so wellthat it was the white statue the fair form he had loved and loved still with no less ardour than before that it seemed according to his interpretation archie must keep it was the other that must be transformed but it would have been an easier task he thought to let his love slide into indifference then raise his hate to the same level but that was not the kings road the royal banners did not flame along such meansouled ways as these he must cling to such love for helena as he had and transform the hate but first and foremost cling to the love it was thus that he stated to himself the message that martin seemed to have brought him last night and stated thus it was a spiritual aspiration of high endeavour and it did not occur to him how stated ever so little differently and yet following the lines of the communication it assumed a diabolical aspect the love which he had for helena was a carnal love that sprang from desire for her enchanting prettiness that love he was to cling to not sacrifice an iota of it the hate that he felt for her arising from her falseness her encouragement of him for just so long as she was uncertain whether she could capture a man who was nothing to her but whose position and wealth she coveted archie was to transform into indifference he was to get over it but though it was hate it had a spiritual quality for it was hatred of what was mean and base whereas his love for her had no spiritual quality it was no more than lust and to that under the name of love he was to cling here then was another interpretation of the words he had heard last night and according to it it would have been fitter to attribute the message to some intelligence far other than the innocent soul of the brother who had so mysteriously communicated with him in childlike ways but that interpretation and here was the subtlety of it never entered archies head at all a message of apparent consolation and hope had come to him when he was feeling the full blast of his bitterness the wind that blew from the empty desert of his heart and his stagnant brain he had called for help from the everlasting and unseen cosmos that encompasses the little blind halfworld of material existence and from it somewhere from it a light had shone into his dark soul no mere flicker or so it seemed this morning like that spurious sunshine which he and his father basked in together but rays from a more potent luminary till now archie with the ordinary impulse of a disappointed man had tried to banish from his mind with certain exterior aids the picture of the face and the form that he loved but now he not only need not but he must not do that any longer he had to cling to love and while he waited for his father he kept recalling certain poignant moments in the growth of helenas bewitchment of him one was the night when they sat together for the last time in the dark garden at silorno and he wondered whether the suggestion of a cousinly kiss would disturb her what had kept him back was the knowledge that it would not be quite a cousinly kiss on his part then there was the moment when he had caught sight of her on the platform at charing cross she had come to meet his train on his arrival from abroad best of all perhaps for there his passion had most been fed with the fuel of her touch had been the dance at his aunts that same night when the rhythm of the waltz and the melodious command of the music had welded their two young bodies into one it was not he and she who had danced it was just one perfect and complete individual here on this quiet sunday morning the thought of that made him tingle and throb it was that sort of memory which martin told him he must keep alive it was his resentment his anger that must die not that helena had chosen somebody else but he must long for her still lord tintagel appeared unusually white and shaky and as lunchtime was approaching he rang for the apparatus of cocktails i sat up late last night archie he said bothering myself over those russian shares its really of you and your mother i am thinking it wont be long before all the mines in russia will matter nothing to me for a few feet of earth will be all i shall require but before i went to bed i came to the conclusion that i was wrong to worry i think the scare will soon pass and the shares recover indeed i think the wisest thing would be not to sell and cut my loss but to buy more at the lower price i shall telegraph to my broker tomorrow but i got into no end of a perplexity about it and i feel all to bits this morning he mixed himself a cocktail with a shaking hand and shuffled back to his chair help yourself archie he said let me see we were going to have a talk about something this morning what was it that worry about my russians has put everything out of my head once again as last night it struck archie as immensely comical that this whitefaced shaky man who was his father should be pulling himself together with a strong cocktail in order to discuss the virtues of temperance and make the necessary resolutions whereby to acquire them he felt neither pity nor sympathy with him nor yet disgust it was only the humour of the situation the farcical absurdity of it that appealed to him we were going to make good resolutions not to drink quite so much he said lord tintagel finished his cocktail and put the glass down to be sure that was it he said its time we took ourselves in hand your grandfather gave me a warning and i wish to god i had taken it but well help each othereh archie that will make it easier for both of us i dont care a toss whether i take alcohol or not said archie as you remarked last night father i hardly touched it till a month ago lord tintagel laughed but youve shown remarkable aptitude for it since he said you found no difficulty at all in getting the hang of the thing faintly like a lost echo there entered into archies mind the inherent horror of such an interview between father and son but it was drowned by the inward laughter with which the scene inspired him and his spirit whatever it was that watched the play looked on as from some curtained box where unseen it could giggle at unseemliness at some uncensored farce last night the same thing had amused him but then he was in that contented oblivion of his troubles which alcohol lent him whereas now it was morning and the time when he was least likely to take any but the most bitter and savage view of a situation but all morning he had been possessed by the sunny lightness of heart with which martins communication of last night had inspired him he must be patient disperse and blow away by the great winds of love the hatred and intolerance that had been obscuring his soul and surely it was not only for helena that he must feel that nobler impulse all that touched his daily life must be treated with the same manly tenderness nothing must shock him nothing must irritate him for such emotions were narrow and limited incompatible with the oceanic quality of love all this seemed directly inspired by martin who had brought him the first ray of true illumination and yet while he sunned himself in the light there was something that apparently belonged to his bitter his disappointed self that cried out for recognition insisting that these dreams of love and tolerance were of a fibre infinitely coarser than its own rebellious attitude it strove and cried and the smooth edification of martins voice silenced it again the suggested compact between father and son soon framed itself into a treaty there was to be nothing faddish or unreasonable about it wine should circulate in its accustomed manner at dinner but here once and for all was the end of trays brought to lord tintagels study a glass or two of claret should be allowed at lunch but the cocktails and the whiskies in the evening were to be closed from henceforth and the arrangement entered into appeared to be of a quality that sacrificed the desire of each for the sake of the other or so at least it passed in their minds archie stifled the snigger of his inward laughter and thought how clear was his duty to save his father even at this late day from falling wholly into the pit he had digged while to his father the compact represented itself as an effort to save archie from the path he had begun to tread but even as they agreed on their abstemious proceedings there occurred to the minds of both of them a vague luminous thought like the flash of summer lightning far away which might move nearer once again archie was seized with the ironic mockery that all the time had quaked like a quicksand below his seriousness i havent had my cocktail yet father he said ill drink success to our scheme youve had yours you know our plan dates from now when ive had mine after thatno more his fathers eyes followed him as he mixed the gin and vermouth well upon my word archie he said you ought to ask me to have a drink with you archie somehow clung to the fact that his father had had a cocktail and that he had not have another by all means he said and ill have two but do be fair father and once again the horrible sordidness of these proceedings struck as it seemed his worse self that part of himself that had all those weeks been uninspired by martin martin was all love and tolerance he gave no directions on such infinitesimal subjects as cocktails or whiskies he outside the material plane was concerned only with the motive the spiritual aspiration with love and all its ineffable indulgences jessie was leaving for town early next morning and once again as twentyfour hours ago she and archie strolled out after dinner into the dusk but tonight his father and he had followed the two ladies almost immediately into the drawingroom and the two younger folk had left their elders playing a game of piquet together that was quite unlike the usual procedure after dinner for lord tintagel generally dozed for a little in his chair and then retired to his study but tonight he showed no inclination either to doze or to go away and it was by his suggestion that the cardtable had been brought out he seemed to jessie rather restless and irritable and had said that it was impossible to play cards with chattering going on that had been the immediate cause of her stroll with archie the remark had been addressed very pointedly to archie and also very rudely but archie checking his hot word in reply almost without an effort had apologized for the distraction quietly and sufficiently awfully sorry father he had said i didnt mean to disturb you come out for a stroll jessie so there they were in the dusk again and again archie took jessies arm fathers rather jumpy tonight he said but i think he wanted to get rid of us he may wish to talk to my mother so it was best to leave them wasnt it jessies heart swelled she knew from last night all that archie was suffering but the whole day he had been like thisgentle considerate infinitely sensitive to others incapable of taking offence yes much best she said you know archie you do behave nicely he knew what she meant he knew how easy it would have been to make some provocative rejoinder to his father but simply he had not wanted to martin and martins counsel was still like sunlight within him oh bosh he said the gentle answer is so much easier than any other i should have had to pump up indignation but he was rather rude wasnt he isnt it lucky that one doesnt feel like that archie drew in a long breath of the vigorous nightair to himself it seemed that he drew in a long breath of the inspiration that had come to him last night jessie im going to save father he said we had an awfully nice talk this morning and it was so pathetic he has been a heavy drinker for years you know his father was so before him so one mustnt think it is his fault any more than it was my fault that i had consumption when i was little it isnt a vice its a disease well ive made a compact with him i found that he had got it into his headgod knows howthat ii know youll laughwas beginning to take to that beastly muck too so i saw my opportunity hes fond of me you know he really is and it had seriously occurred to him that i was getting the habit so i took advantage of that i said i wouldnt have any more whiskies and cocktails if he wouldnt we made a bargain about it without swagger it was rather a good piece of work dont you think jessie knew exactly what she honestly felt and what she honestly felt she could not possibly say for though it was a good bargain on archies part the virtue of it would affect not only lord tintagel but archie himself but the knowledge of this added to the sincerity of her reply oh archie she said that was brilliant of you do youdo you think your father will keep to it he cant help it said archie triumphantly im going to be down here except when i go up to town for helenas wedding and im always in and out of his room i should know if he doesnt keep to it he paused thinking out further checks on his father theres william too he said williams devoted to me simply as far as i can tell because he saved my life when i was a tiny kid if i ask william to tell me whether my father gets drinks through him quietly when im not there im sure he will let me know how would that be jessie had an uncomfortable moment the idea of getting a servant to report to archie on his fathers proceedings was as repugnant to her as she thought it must be to archie possibly his main motive that of taking care of his father was so dominant in him that he did not pause to consider the legitimacy of any means but somehow it was very unlike archie to have conceived so backstairs an idea oh i wouldnt quite do that she said you wouldnt either archie i dont see why not the cure is more important than the means jessie suddenly felt a sort of bewilderment it could scarcely have been archie who said that according to her knowledge of archie but surely thats impossible she said what would you feel if you found your father had been setting william to spy and report on you archies voice suddenly rose oh what nonsense he said you speak as if i was going to break my bargain with my father i never heard such nonsense once again the sense of bewilderment came over jessie that wasnt like archie i dont imply anything of the kind she said but i do feel that its impossible for you to get william to have an eye on your father and report to you and im almost certain that you really agree with me archie considered this and then laughed i suppose i do he said but the ardour of the newly born missionary was hot within me are missionaries born or made by the way anyhow im a missionary now nobody could have guessed that i was going to be a missionary their stroll tonight was only up and down the broad gravel walk in front of the windows it was very hot and all the drawingroom windows were open so also were those of lord tintagels study and the windowed door that led into the garden as they passed this archie saw a footman bring in a tray on which were set the usual evening liquids and he guessed that his father had forgotten or had omitted to say that the syphon and some ice was all that would be needed he thought for a moment intently and swiftly jessie theyve brought in that beastly whisky again he said i must tell them to take it away my father mustnt see it just go down opposite the drawingroom windows will you and make sure my father is still playing cards while i take the bottle away make me a sign archie waited outside till this was given and then went into his fathers room the man had gone away and he took up the whiskybottle with the intention of putting it back in the diningroom but even as his fingers closed on it without warning his desire for drink swooped down on him like the coming of a summer storm he half filled a glass with the spirit poured sodawater on the top and gulped it down that was what he wanted and then with a swift cunning he rinsed out the glass with sodawater drank that also and filling it half up again with water put it on the table by the chair where he usually sat then there was the bottle to dispose of and he went out into the hall to take it to the diningroom but even as he crossed the foot of the stairs another notion irresistibly possessed him and up he went three steps at a time and concealed it behind some clothes in his chest of drawers he had discovered an excellent reason for doing that for if he left it in the diningroom his father might find it there it was much safer in his room then tingling and content and feeling that martin would approve indeed it seemed that he had prompted this missionary enterprise he rejoined jessie again his eyes sparkling his mouth gay and quivering ive done it he said i thought at first of taking the bottle to the diningroom but my father might have found it there what did you do with it asked jessie archie took no time to consider i rang the bell and told james to take it away again to the pantry he said that was clever of you archie i know that theyre still playing cards arent they lets have one more turn then jessie i wish you werent going away tomorrow i must i promised my father to get back and helena wants me oh well that settles it said archie helena must have all she wants that is part of helena isnt it for a moment jessie thought that he was speaking with the bitterest irony but immediately afterwards she withdrew that for it struck her that archie was in some inexplicable way perfectly sincere there was the unmistakable ring of truth in his voice he meant what he said and as if to endorse that he went on we all do what helena wants you i the bradshaw all of us she wants to be loved isnt that it and to want to be loved is a royal command all proper people must obey i have been a rebel you know andoh jessie how awfully ashamed i am i let myself hate helena i encouraged myself to hate her but ive returned to my allegiance thank god she turned an enquiring face to him archie dear she said i am so thankful that you are so changed youre utterly different from what you have been last night you were bitter and terrible you made my heart ache but all today youve been absolutely your old self again and its so immense and so sudden cant you tell me at all what caused it i should love to know if you feel like telling me he took her arm again ill tell you one thing he said you did me a lot of good last night when you made me realize your friendship that helped i do believe that helped jessie could not quite accept this though it warmed her heart that archie thought of that but you always knew my friendship she said i know i did but i appreciated it most when i felt absolutely empty theres something more than that though he paused ah do tell me said jessie he could not make up his mind on the instant for he knew jessies repugnance to the whole idea of those supernatural communications but he felt warm and alert and expansive besides her friendship which he truly valued yearned for his confidence which is the meat and drink of friendship sometimes it was necessary to deceive your friends it had been necessary for him to deceive her about the disposal of the whiskybottle but though she might not approve he could at least tell her what had made sunshine all day for him and what was making it now its this he said martin came to me last night i talked to him i saw him it has put me right he has made me see things quite differently he told me to be patient to cling to love always to let my hate be turned into love i cant express to you at all what a difference that made to me i felt he knew he could see as he said that the darkness in which i thought i walked was not darkness at all i know you have no sympathy with his coming to me it seems to you either nonsense or something very dangerous but i know you have sympathy with the result of it suddenly his explanation of the voices she had heard last night occurred to him when you told me this morning that you had heard talking in my room he said i did not mean to tell you about martin and so i invented somethingoh yes that i had been reading aloud what i had written to account for it it wasnt true but i had to tell some fib and did you really hear conversation going on thats awfully interesting i thought i did said she and there was knocking or hammering did you invent something about that too oh yes said archie but i dont really know what the knocking was as i was going off into trance i heard loud knocking of some sort but i didnt let it disturb the oncoming of the trance it deepened and then martin came and i talked with him and saw him oh archie how do you know it was he she cried wildly enough hardly knowing what she meant but speaking from the dictate of some nightmare that screamed and struggled in her mind why of course it was he said archie i recognized him superficially that is to say from my knowledge of my own face just as i recognized the photograph in the cache at grives from its likeness to me but i know it was he in some far more essential and inward manner it was martin will he come again asked the girl i hope so many times indeed he promised to i needed him he got permission to come to me in my need is he not ministering to it havent you seen the immense change in me undeniably she had seen that and for a moment a little pang of human disappointment came over her im afraid then the knowledge of my friendship hasnt had much to do with it she said jessie dont think i undervalue that said archie speaking quite frankly and sincerely i thank you for it tremendously i love to know it is there i may count on it always maynt i they still stood a moment under the starswarming sky sundered by the night from all other presences i neednt assure you of that she said and archie i may be utterly wrong in what i feel about martins communications to you who knows what conditions exist for the souls of those we have loved and whom we neither of us believe have died with the decay of the perishable body but my dear do be careful if in some miraculous way you have been given access which is denied to almost all mankind do use it only in truth and love and reverence youre frightened about it said archie i know i am if martin can come to you why should not other spirits other spirits intelligences terrible and devilish might deceive you into thinking that they were he you remember at silorno he said he couldnt come again i know but i wasnt in sore need then said he they had again come opposite lord tintagels study and even as they passed archie saw him with his finger on the bell instantly he guessed that he was ringing to know why the whisky had not been brought the footman would come and say that he had brought it archie felt an exhilarated acuteness of brain the situation had only to be put before him for him to see the answer to it in his presence remembering the contract of the morning his father could not ask for the whisky come in and say goodnight to my father jess he said they entered together and immediately afterwards the footman came in from the halldoor lord tintagel looked at him then back at archie who was watching its nothing james he said i rang for something but it doesnt matter the man left the room and immediately afterwards jessie said goodnight and went also archie turned to his father with a broad kindly smile father i believe im a great thoughtreader he said i believe i can tell you what you rang for his fathers grim face relaxed you young devil he said archie laughed ive guessed right then he said you surely dont want to drink success to our contract again but i dont know why james didnt bring the whisky as usual said he ii forgot to tell him not to but i didnt said archie i see well a bargains a bargain only now there doesnt seem to be any particular reason for not going to bed archie yawned rather elaborately and went to the table where earlier in the evening he had put down his glass half filled with soda he drank it sniffing to see if there was any taint of spirit about it but he had rinsed it thoroughly i came in during my stroll with jessie and took some soda he said not a bad drink but i think it makes one sleepy i shall go to bed too jessie left early next morning expecting to be gone before anybody else made an appearance but just as she got into the motor archie rosy and suffused with sleep like a child that has lain still and grown all night came flying downstairs in dressinggown and pyjamas had to come down and say goodbye jessie he said do come back come down for next sunday and well go up together for helenas wedding promise jessie looked at that morning face which glowed with the exuberance of boyish health and happiness she herself had slept very badly dozing for a little and then being awakened by the sound of talking next door and of peremptory resounding tappings and here was archie radiant and fresh and revitalized and her love glowed at the thought that he wanted her even though it was but friendship that he sought and friendship that he had to offer yes archie i should love to come she said thats ripping i say shall i drive with you to the station just as i am why shouldnt i pyjamas and dressinggown are perfectly decent if william will fetch me my slippers which i seem to have forgotten unless he lends me his boots your baths ready my lord said william with a broad grin well perhaps ill have it then goodbye jess come early on saturday chapter xi archie was lying on the turf in front of the enclosed bathingplace where the stream debouched into the lake there was a good stretch of deep water free from weeds and for the last halfhour he had been swimming and diving in it now with hair drying back into its crisp curls under the hot sun he lay on the short warm turf with his chin supported on his hands in an ecstasy of animal content at this edge of the water the bank was made firm and solid with wooden boarding that went down into deep water but across the estuary of the stream broadening out into the lake the shallow margin was fringed with bulrushes and loosestrife a strip of lowlying meadow land behind was pink with campion and raggedrobin and starred with meadowsweet the scent of which mingled with the undefinable cool smell of running water a bed of gravel made the bottom of the stream and through the sunlit water the pebbles gleamed like topazes through some liquid veil never before had archie been so permeated with the sense of the amazing loveliness of the world and of the ineffable joy of living and of being part of it he had wrestled with the swiftness of the stream as it narrowed had clung to rocks and treeroots below the surface letting the current comb over and around and almost through him then letting go of his anchorage had been floated down into the lake again with arms and legs outspread and now lying closepressed to the turf with wet chest and dripping shoulders he seemed to be part of the triumph of the summer and of the immortal youth of the world surely there was no further heaven than this possible namely to be young and to desire and to have desire gratified and whet the appetite for more there was no clearer duty in the day than to be bathed in the bliss of life to suck out the last drop of sweetness from the world which had been created for the joy of men and the glory of god there was no such thing as evil evil was but the label attached by the sourminded to the impulses and acts for which they had not sufficient vitality and it was martin who had taught him all this archie had come back home this morning after a day and a couple of nights in town he had bought helena her wedding present he had taken his completed manuscript to his publishers he had dined and danced and supped and filled the hours of day and night with the extravagant excesses in which up till now he had never indulged some innate fastidiousness or morality had led him to look on the looser pleasures of youth with disdain or disgust now he smiled indulgently at himself for his narrow priggishness how utterly wrong he had been to think that such things stained or soiled a boy they had but caused him to realize himself and intensified existence for him they were the exercise of the faculties and possibilities with which god had endowed him and which were not meant to rust in disuse it was right for him richly to enjoy as martin had said it was a crime against love and life to starve on a meatless diet above all he had seen helena again had confessed and recanted the bitterness he had felt towards her and she had forgiven him and welcomed him back with blessings on the falling out that all the more endears as the prim little poem said archie laughed quietly to himself and said aloud when we fall out with those we love and kiss again with tears but there werent many tears he added he understood helena now she wanted so sensibly to make herself quite comfortable for this journey through life if marquises with millions desired her to go shares with them naturally she consented but to do that was not the least the same as taking vows and going into a nunnery it was the nunnery that she was coming out of of course just for the present archie understood he would not see her for she and the bradshaw were going a yachting tour in the norwegian fjords but they would be back again before the end of september so much and no more had her voice told him but her eyes said much more intimate things though naturally she did not express them and when he asked if he might kiss her that cousinly kiss which she had wanted at silorno her lips agreed with what her eyes said she had never been so adorably pretty and she had never been so demurely clever she had said nothing which a girl who was to become another mans wife in a few days should not say and yet archie felt that he understood perfectly all the things she did not say most brilliant perhaps of all was her warning i shall tell the bradshaw that i allowed you to kiss me she cried but im not frightened he is such a dear gone then were all archies troubles and bitternesses on this point he had love to cling to and he scarcely felt jealous of the bradshaw for if things had been the other way about and helena had been engaged to him would she have allowed the bradshaw to kiss her he knew very well that she would not archie turned over on to his back and lay with arms and legs spread out to the sun warming himself as with the memory of that expedition to london but he had not in the least wished to postpone his return since the joy of life lay so largely in its contrasts and after thirtysix hours of that fiery furnace there had come a temporary satiety and he wanted to lie and sleep like a gorged tiger soon he would awake and be hungry again but it was part of the joy of life to be satisfied and doze and stretch out tranquil limbs and lying there his ribs began to twitch again into laughter as he thought of the contract he had made with his father last sunday archie had entered into it with the view of encouraging and helping his father to rid himself of the chain that was riveted so closely round him and he was delighted to do it if his father derived support for his abstinence in the thought that he was helping archie but archie need not abstain so long as his father thought he was doing so and only just now he had filled with water and sunk in the weeds several empty bottles that he had brought out in his towels from his bedroom he knew perfectly well that he was in no danger of becoming a slave to the habit it had served him as medicine to mitigate his misery with regard to helena and now that that was quite removed it helped him to get into communication with martin of that he felt convinced once or twice he had tried to do so without drinking and had failed but alcohol seemed to drug the surfaceconsciousness and clear the way of access and it was for that he used it now it was more that it cleared the access than that it drugged him for he found that it produced not the least effect in the way of making his head hazy or his movements wavering it only seemed to sweep clean those mysterious channels through which communication came the power of communicating he could not possibly give up all happiness and joy of life sprang from it therefore he could not possibly give up that which facilitated it but he performed the purpose of the contract by keeping his indulgences secret from his father and once again archies ribs with their smoothly swelling muscles under his brown skin throbbed with amusement as he pictured his fathers heroic struggle with himself occasionally archie had doubts whether that struggle was quite consistently successful for once or twice lord tintagel had shown signs of evening content and serenity followed by morning shakiness which indicated that he had made some temporary armistice archie thought that perhaps he would lay some trap for his father or make some quiet detective investigations to satisfy himself on this point but beyond doubt his father was putting up quite a good fight on behalf of a nonexistent cause his will was to abstain and if occasionally he failed it was unchristian to judge failure hardly besides archie only conjectured that sometimes his fathers resolution was unequal to the strain imposed on it he did not know all this week archies sense of comradeship and brotherliness with martin had marvellously increased there was nothing priggish or puritanical about martin nor anything nambypamby that suggested wings and halos and hymns he was intensely human and sympathized completely with the fact of archies being a glorious young animal bursting with exuberant health that seemed quite clear for when this morning sometime about four oclock archie had gently let himself into the house in grosvenor square a little ashamed and weary and went up to his bedroom he became instantly aware that martin was waiting for him there was no need for him to light his electric lamps for dawn was already breaking and drawing his curtains apart he threw off his clothes so as to let the delicious chill of morning refresh his skin and sat down for a moment in front of his dressingtable and looked fixedly at a bright point of light on the bevel of his lookingglass almost immediately the waves of light and shadow began to pass before his eyes and the room was full of vivid peremptory tappings then he was aware that there appeared in the reflected image of himself a strange luminous focus over his left breast and a little wisp of mist like a puff of escaping steam began to come from it this grew and collected in wavering masses of weaving lines formless at first but then arranging themselves into definite shapes and he saw with a thrill of excitement and wonder that out of them there was being built up the image of martin which had issued out of himself soon it was complete and archie in the glass beheld martins face leaning lovingly over his shoulder and martins arm bare like his own and warm and solid to the touch was thrown round his neck archie ive been with you all night he said i love to see you and feel you realize yourself throw yourself into life live to the uttermost and have no thought for the morrow there is nothing in the world but love and joy cling to them press close to them lose yourself in them martins smile was compassionate no longer it was a sunbeam of radiant happiness and that happiness so it seemed to archie had its source in sympathy with and love for him dont ever think you are yielding to base impulses he went on provided only you are happy happiness is the seal and witness of what is right for you it is the mark of gods approval evil is always painful and repugnant that is the seal and witness of it the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace and arent you more at peace more full of joy now that you have resolved to put hate out of your heart isnt it sweeter to kiss helena than to curse her suddenly like the stroke of a black wing there passed through archie an impulse of sheer abhorrence all that martin said sounded divinely comforting and uplifting but did there not lurk in it the whole gospel of satanism and as that thought crossed his mind he saw an expression of the tenderest reproach dim for a moment the brightness of his brothers eyes and the mouth drooped but you are tired now said he and your trust in me is a little weakened sleep well it is dawn already the apparition faded or rather it appeared to be withdrawn again into himself and emerging from the light trance archie was conscious only of an overpowering but delicious fatigue the fatigue of utter satisfaction he had had a glorious thirtysix hours and as martin said he was tired and martin approved he slept the deep recuperative sleep of youth for four or five hours and awoke hungry and eager and cleareyed he left town immediately after breakfast motored himself down home with william holding on to the side of the car as he slowed round corners and came straight out to his beloved bathingplace it was bliss to be alive he had not seen jessie during his short raid on london for really there had not been a moment to spare besides jessie was coming down next day for the weekend but she knew he had been in town for helena said she had seen him and with her usual acuteness had told her sister that archie was deliciously his old self again and that they were the greatest friends that to jessies very sensible judgment and to the intuition her love gave her was the most inexplicable of developments only a week ago there was no reproach bitter enough for archies opinion on helenas conduct to him no angry taunt of misery sufficient for her vilification and then in a moment the whole of that bitterness had been dried up the marah had been sweetened more than that the normal joy of life had returned in full flood to him and the cause of all this was in his account the fact that the spirit of martin had shown him the true light that archie possessed that mysterious and in her view dangerous gift of mediumistic perception she did not doubt for there was no questioning those weird manifestations of occult power which she knew had occurred in his childhood and she felt now that she ought only to stand in an awed wonder and thankfulness that this supernormal perception of his had in a moment worked in him what could be called no less than a miracle but though she ought to feel that she knew that she felt nothing of the kind and as she travelled down next day to lacebury she set herself to analyse the causes of her mistrust they were simple enough first of all there was her rooted antipathy to the whole notion of spiritcommunication instinctively it shocked her and seemed opposed to all religious faith beyond that there were but a couple of the most insignificant matters that appeared to her possibly connected with her mistrust the one that archie had made a false swift invention to account for the noises she had heard coming from his room the other that he had proposed to get william to spy on his father with a view to ascertaining whether he was keeping his part of their bargain she knew they were both tiny incidents but the spirit that prompted them was in both cases utterly unlike archie she could not imagine archie making such an invention or such a suggestion from what she knew of him it was outside him to do so and if it was the influenceto call it no more than thatof martin which prompted these things if it was the same direction as that which had taken away all his bitterness towards helena what sort of influence was that finally could it be right that the boy whom helena had so cruelly led on only to disappoint should on the eve of her marriage suddenly become close friends with her again there certainly he obeyed the precept of that which had spoken with him and had promised to communicate again and she could not but think it a dangerous if not a diabolical counsel but she tried to reserve her judgment in a few minutes now she would see archie again and could note what change for good or ill this week had brought very likely she had been disquieting herself in vain making wounds out of pinpricks and mountains out of molehills archie had come to meet her and as the train slowed down into the station she saw him out of the carriage window but he did not see her for his eyes were intent on a very horrible sight there were two tipsy women violently quarrelling and just as the train got in they flew at each other scratching and striking the encounter lasted not more than a few seconds for a couple of porters ran in and separated them but jessie had seen archies face alight with glee and amusement as they were separated he frowned and shrugged his shoulders and seemed to remonstrate with the man who had stopped their fighting at that instant he saw her get out of her compartment and ran to meet her his face quite changed but the moment before it had not been archies face at all it had been the face of some beautiful and devilish creature alert with evil excitement hullo jessie there you are he said its ripping to see you look at those two viragos there they flew at each other like wild beasts it was a horrible sight he turned a sideways eye on her cunning and watchful which utterly belied the frankness of his speech and her heart sank and a vague nameless terror seized her as once again she found herself thinking that this was not archie who so gaily took her bag for her and ever and again looked back to where a small crowd had collected round the two women they had a few minutes to wait while her luggage was brought out and once more he sauntered back into the station leaving her in the car from outside she could hear hoarse screams and long after her trunk had been put into the car she watched the door for archies exit first one and then the other of the women were brought out to be taken to the policestation and at last he emerged sorry to keep you waiting jessie he said but my mother wanted some magazine from the bookstall now if you arent nervous well make up for lost time the road lay straight and empty before them opening out like torn linen as they raced along it some way ahead there were a couple of cottages by the roadside and as they came near them there wandered out into the road an old and lame collie instantly archies face changed into a mask of impatient malignancy archie take care said jessie theres a dog on the road well thats the dogs lookout said he what right has a mangy brute like that to stop us he made no attempt whatever to slow down but just at the last moment he caused the car to swerve violently and they missed the dog by a hairsbreadth and he turned on her a face from which all impatience and anger had vanished and from it looked out archies soul in agonized struggle i couldnt i couldnt he said i didnt touch it jessie its all right i thought you must run over it said she why didnt you slow down archie that glimpse of the agonized soul utterly vanished again people have got no business to keep a decrepit old beast like that he said i expect the kindest thing i could do would be to turn round and put it out of its misery never mind ill do it some other day jessie clung to her glimpse of the other archie no you wont she said youll risk your life and mine too not to hurt it he laughed one cant tell what one will do he said i hated and loathed that dog but i couldnt run over it when it came to hope i didnt give you an awful shaking jessie after lunch archie proposed a campaign against a certain great pike which he had seen and while he went to his room to change his clothes jessie paid a visit to blessington the old lady was delighted to see her and dusted a perfectly speckless chair for her and its jolly for you isnt it blessington having archie here so long said jessie blessington made no answer for a moment i make no complaints she said and i daresay master archie is very busy why what do you mean asked the girl blessingtons wrinkled old face began to work and she looked piteously at jessie its a week since master archie set foot in my room she said why does he never come to see me now miss jessie and when i meet him about the house hes never got a word to give me me who has looked after him and loved him since he was born at this moment archies step was heard outside and he came in oh blessington i wish you wouldnt go meddling with my things he said roughly william tells me you took some flannels of mine away to mend or put a button on where are they blessington got up without a word and went to her cupboard here they are my lord she said i have mended them well please dont carry my clothes away again come on jessie ill be ready in a moment blessingtons hands came together with a trembling movement as archie twitched the flannel coat away from her but he did not even look at her and went out of her room banging the door blessington sat down again and began to cry quietly there now you see miss jessie she said and thats my own master archie for a minute or so jessie sat with her trying vainly to comfort her and shocked beyond expression at archies brutal callousness to his old nurse and then the door opened again and archie looked in once again all his anger and impatience had died out of his face his real soul looked from his eyes as from a prisonhouse and his voice shook as he spoke go away please jessie and leave me with blessington for a minute he said and then he came across the room to her and knelt down by her and took her withered old hand in his and stroked it and kissed it so much jessie saw before she closed the door behind her blessington my old darling said archie i cant think why i have been so beastly to you it wasnt me thats all i can tell you i always love you can you forgive me blessingtons loyal devotion rose triumphant eh i know how busy youve been master archie she said and i know what a thoughtless body i am with your things but id like you to be angry with me fifty times if youll only come back to me at the end there prayadont kiss my hand dear it isnt right for you to do that wheres your darling face then said archie if you dont give me a kiss this minute i shall know youve been flirting with fathers keeper again blessington gave a little squeal of laughter eh and him dead this twenty years she said and you know my dear that whatever you did and asked me to give you a kiss afterwards give it you i would because nothing you could do would stop my loving you blessingtons love helenas love which was real two things so utterly different could not both be love and for him too which love was real his love for blessington all ashed over save for the little spark that somehow lived below the cold cinders or his love for helena that blazed and scintillated suddenly the thought of that glowed within him and it seemed dreadful to kiss this withered cheek and yet the dim old eyes had never wavered in their loyalty and love for his worthless corrupted self and shall we have a talk this evening again before dinner he asked eh that would be nice if youre not too busy said she all right then but i must run along now jessies waiting thatll never do to keep her waiting said blessington and if youre going on the lake master archie pray be careful and dont fall in lady tintagel with jessie and archie were going up to town on monday to attend helenas wedding the day after and all through the hours of that weekend there was piling up ever higher and more menacingly the storm that so soon was to burst upon europe in tempest of shot and shell before they left on monday afternoon war was already declared between russia and germany between germany and france the territory of belgium was violated by the barbarian hordes who issued from the central empires and belgium had appealed to england to uphold the treaty which germany had torn up to light the fires or war but as in so many english homes in these days the inevitable still seemed the incredible and though from time to time they discussed the situation life went on its normal course indeed there was nothing else to be done whether england was going to war or not dinnertime came round as usual of them all it was on lord tintagel that the suspense and anxiety beat most strongly and that because the panic on the stock exchanges of europe threatened him with losses that might bring him within reach of ruin but lady tintagel still clung to a baseless hope less substantial than a mirage in the desert that diplomacy would still avert disaster archie went about the customary diversions of life with more than usual enjoyment and absorption while for jessie there loomed in the immediate foreground a dread and a horror which though it concerned not warring millions but just one individual engrossed her entire soul it was as if she saw him whom she loved with all the strength of her deep and loyal heart in danger of drowning not in material waters that could but kill the body and set free the soul but in some awful flooding evil which threatened to submerge and swallow the very source and spiritual life of him and all the time he swam and splashed about in those waters below which lay hell itself with the same joyful gaiety as he used to churn his way out to sea at silorno as by some hideous irony the love of deep waters far from shore that all his life had possessed him so that his physical self was at the zenith of its capacity for enjoyment when the profound gulfs were below him and the land far off so now evil essential and primeval evil had beckoned his soul out over unplumbed depths that seemed to him bright with celestial sunshine not yet was he doomed to sink there though she guessed as in a nightmare in what deadly peril he stood for now and again some inkling of that which menaced him reached his true self and he turned back with shuddering and contrition from some evil prompting all the time this betrayed itself to jessie in things that might so reasonably have been called mere trifles an impatient impetuous boy as archie undoubtedly was might so naturally have lost his temper with a decrepit old dog which strayed on to the path of his flying car and made him say that it would be the kindest thing to run over it that same boy might so naturally have felt an unedifying curiosity in two drunken women fighting together or have reasonably been annoyed when in a hurry to change his clothes he found that his old nurse had taken them away indeed it was the strength of his own reaction against such impulses that showed how alien he knew them to be to his real self but her own feeling about them was the final test for she knew it was based on the infallible intuition of her love for him it was impossible that that should be mistaken and it told her that it was not archie at all who had committed these acts which might be trifling in themselves but like wisps of cloud in the sky showed which way the great winds were blowing and on the top of these was something which jessie could not conceive of as being a trifle namely archies complete reconciliation with her sister she could not believe that it was a noble impulse which prompted that and extinguished his bitter resentment against her as easily as a candle is blown out he was right to be bitter against her and the love with which he seemed inspired again was not love at all but he believed that this desire was love and according to his account it was the spirit of martin which had taught him that and opened his blinded eyes it was martin then who possessed him and that to jessie was the most incredible of all it was not and it could not be martin she sat by her open window that sunday night wishing that she could think that some madness had fallen upon her which caused her to conceive such inconceivable things archies laugh still sounded in her ears gay and boyish as she had heard it but two minutes before she came up to bed and she shuddered at the cause of it once again she and archie had strolled out after dinner and on passing the windows of his fathers study their steps noiseless on the grass archie had laid his hand on her arm with a gesture to command silence and had tiptoed with her across the gravel to his fathers windows lord tintagel was inside and even as they looked he took a bottle out of which he had been pouring something and locked it up in a cupboard archie turned a face beaming with merriment on her come in he whispered to say goodnight leave it all to me it will be huge fun he waited a moment and began talking loudly to her on some indifferent subject for a few seconds the he said come and say goodnight to my father jessie and they entered together lord tintagel was seated in his chair by this time there was just one empty glass on the tray with a syphon and no sign of a second one archie began walking up and down the room his eyes looking swiftly and stealthily in every direction jessie and i have just come in to say goodnight he said were all going up to town tomorrow wont you really come father ive already said i wont said lord tintagel sharply archie suddenly saw what he had been looking for hullo heres a funny thing he said heres a glass on the floor he picked it up smelled it and burst into a peal of laughter father its too bad of you he said there have i been keeping our bargain while you he broke off laughing again no ill confess he said because im so pleased at having found you out ive been having some quiet drinks up in my bedroom while youve been doing the same down here what did you do with your bottles i put mine in the lake i say that is funny isnt it but its rather unsociable lets follow germanys example and call our treaty waste paper and archie had laughed over that miserable sordid exposure just as lightheartedly as he had laughed over the jolly innocent humours at silorno and sick at heart jessie had left the two together with the bottle which there was no need to conceal any more she sat long at her window in a miserable state of horror and fear and agitation now trying to persuade herself that she was taking these things too heavilyhelena had always told her she took things heavilynow letting her fears issue in terrible cohort and looking them in the face it was her powerlessness to help that most tortured her her fate of having to stand and watch while archie pushed out ever farther with delight and joy on to the perilous seas but now there was to her a reality about it all which she had never wholly felt before often she had told herself that she was imagining perils but tonight in the darkness and the quiet she felt herself face to face with the grim deadly facts spiritual and ghostly enemies were about and next moment she had slid on to her knees no words came she tried just to open her heart to that light that surely shone through the evil that swarmed about her something ever so faint glimmered there and presently she rose again with her soul fixed on that little spark shining within her in any case she must make every effort to help instead of succumbing to her sense of powerlessness at that moment she heard light swift footsteps on the stairs and instantly her mind was made up and she came out into the broad passage just as archie was opposite her door his face was eager and alert there was no trace of intoxication there hullo jessie he said smiling not gone to bed yet she had to be wise mere helpless prayer would avail nothing if she did not exert herself and make use of her wits and her love no i didnt feel sleepy she said you dont look sleepy either are you going to bed no not yet said archie jessie came a step closer to him oh archie are you going to talk to martin she asked maynt i come i should so love to for i know all that martin means to you you know i did hear him talking to you before it would be lovely if i could hear you talking together so that i knew what he said archie looked at her well i dont know why not he said but you must promise not to interrupt perhaps youll neither hear nor see anything but i dont see why you shouldnt try its just a seance come along jessie he led the way into his bedroom and shut the door i shall really rather like you to be here he said im glad you suggested it for now and then i go into very deep trance and then i cant remember what exactly has happened i only know that there has been round me an atmosphereto call it thatin which i glow and expand sometimes i rather think i struggle and groan you mustnt mind that its only the protest of my material earthly self come on lets begin i long for martin to come jessie felt her dread and horror of the occult surge up in her and it required all her resolution to remain here but the call of her love was imperative if she was to be permitted to help archie at all she must learn what it was that possessed him and find means to combat it she had to know first what it was penetrate so far as her love had power into the source of it diagnose it if she was to help in curing what are you going to do she said its very simple youll soon see sit down jessie he went to the window and drew aside the curtains he put on the table in front of where he was to sit the silver top of some toiletbottle and then went to the door and turned out all the electric lights at the switchboard the moonlight outside without shining directly into the room made the objects in it clearly though duskily visible and jessie where she sat with her back to the light could see archies face and outline when her eyes got accustomed to the dimness quite distinctly he sat close to her at the end of the writingtable and just in front of him glimmered the stopper from the toiletbottle now im going to look at that till i go off into trance he said watch what happens very closely for i may go into deep trance and promise me not to move till i come round again i daresay you will neither hear nor see anything but i dont know for some few minutes as far as the girl could judge they sat in silence once or twice archie shifted his position slightly and she heard his shirtfront creak a little as he breathed quietly and normally outside a little wind stirred and the tassel of the blind tapped against the sill then there came a change his breathing grew louder as if he panted for air and now and again he moaned and she saw his head drop forward this moaning sound was horrible to hear and but for her promise and the insistent urging of her love she must have got up and roused him his breath whistled between his lips as he took it in and his face seemed to be shining with some dew of anguish and his arms twisted and writhed as if struggling against some overmastering force then suddenly all sign of struggle ceased he sat bent forward but perfectly still and from the table in front of him came three loud peremptory raps as of splitting wood from the dusk of the room came others which she could not localize archie raised his head and instead of leaning over the table sank back in his chair his arms hanging limp by his side he began to whisper to himself and soon jessie caught the words martin are you here he kept repeating martin are you here martin martin there was more light in the room now it came from a pale greyish efflorescence of illumination globular in shape that lay apparently over his left breast it made its immediate neighbourhood quite bright she could see the stud in his shirt with absolute distinctness out of it there came a little wisp of mist that floated up like a stream of smoke above his shoulders in the air there independently of this there was forming another mistlike substance and the stream that came away from archie seemed to join this it began to take shape it spread upwards and downwards into the semblance of a column its edges losing themselves in the dark lines began to be interwoven within it it was as if something was forming inside it like a chicken in an egg it lost its vagueness of outline plaiting and weaving itself together there appeared an arm bare to the shoulder above that she could see a neck and slowly above the neck there grew a smiling splendid face there seemed to be a grey robe cast about the body from which the bare arm protruded but much of this was vague jessie felt as if some awful paralysis of terror lay over her spirit the whole room cool and fresh with the nightair passing through the open window reeked to her spiritual sense with evil and unnameable corruption over her conscious superficial self the mechanism that directed her limbs and worked in her brain she had complete control for archies sake she was learning about this hellish visitor who came to him but within her soul cried out in a horror of uttermost darkness then her will took hold of that too whatever god permitted must be faced for the sake of love just then archie spoke in an odd muffled voice im going very deep he said but martin youve made me so happy all day youve hardly left me at all youre getting to be part of me arent you lets talk about helena i say she is a devil isnt she jessie had not known that anything could be so horrible as the smiling face that the apparition bent on him but youve ceased hating her it said you love her dont you always cling to love i know i adore her i believe she loves me too he laughed and licked his lips and his voice sank so that jessie could catch no word of what he said but he spoke for a long time laughing occasionally and making horrible little movements with his arms as if he clasped something now and then he would perhaps ask a question for in the same inaudible manner the apparition answered him laughing sometimes in response once or twice in that devilish colloquy she caught a word or two of hideous and carnal import and her sickened love nearly withered within her but because love is immortal and cannot perish though all the blasts of hell rage against it it still stood firm though scorched and beaten upon if she let it die she felt that she would be no better than that visible incarnation of evil that smiled and bent over archie presently that devilish whispering ceased and she saw that the apparition was beginning to lose its clearness of outline slowly it began to disintegrate into the weavings of mist out of which it came and archie said goodbye martin but not for long some of these streamers seemed to disperse in the air others like an eddying waterspout seemed to draw back into that focus of light which lay over archies breast then that too began to fade and in the stillness and quiet she again heard the creaking of his shirt as he lay back in his chair with closed eyes then the struggles and moanings the writhings of his arms began again and again subsided and he lay quite still outside the nightwind stirred and dropped then archie spoke in a tired husky voice hullo jessie he said its all over by jove it was ripping but i went awfully deep i can remember nothing after martin came what did he say jessie got up i heard hardly anything she said he spoke in whispers and so did you did you see him asked archie yes quite clearly but i think ill go to bed now you look very tired he had got up and turned on the electric light and stood by the door rubbing his eyes yes i am tired he said but im divinely happy tell me tomorrow whatever you can remember goodnight jess you are a good sort he detained her hand for a moment were cousins jess he said and youre an awfully good friend wont you give me a kiss for one second she shrank from him in nameless horror the next she put it all from her for her shrinking no angel of the lord but a weak cowardly impulse stood full in the path of love and while it was there she could not reach archie why of course she said kissing him goodnight archie sleep well she went to her room and turned on all the lights she felt as if she had been assisting at some unclean orgy she felt tainted and defiled by the very presence of that white evil thing that had stood close to her and whispered and laughed with archie as yet she had but looked on it what lay in front of her was to grapple with it and tear it out of the tabernacle which it had begun to inhabit as far as she could understand the situation it was not wholly in possession as yet for part of it when it materialized seemed to form itself in the air and part only to ooze out of its victim through what adventures and combats her way should take her she could form no conception but what she had gained tonight which was worth a hundred times the sickness and horror of her soul was the certain knowledge that some spirit of discarnate evil was making its home in her beloved it had usurped the guise of martin it masqueraded as martin archie thought it was martin she remembered how just a week ago he had told her that he was like an empty house denuded of the spirit that dwelt there a living corpse by which he asked her to sit sometimes at the time that had seemed to her just the figure by which he expressed the desolation of his heart now it revealed itself as a true and literal statement and there had begun to enter into him as tenant of the uninhabited rooms the horror that she had seen jessie fell on her knees by her bedside and opened her heart to the infinite love it was through its aid alone that she would be able to accomplish the rescue for which she was willing to give her life and soul chapter xii archie was walking back to the house in grosvenor square from oakland crescent on the afternoon of helenas wedding owing to the acute suspense of the european situation the plans of the newly married couple had been changed and instead of setting off at once in the yacht for a month in the norwegian fjords they had gone to a house of lord harlows in surrey to await developments in the crisis or some kind of settlement it was still uncertain whether england would be drawn into the war though opinion generally regarded that as inevitable and in this case no doubt lord harlow an exguardsman would rejoin his regiment archies mother after the departure of the bridal couple had also left town for lacebury taking with her jessie and colonel vautier for a few days visit but archie had decided to stop another night in london there had been the usual crowds and chatterings and excitement the front pew kept for a princess the signing of names in the vestry the red carpets and weddingmarches and the whole ceremony had filled archie with the greatest amusement but the subsequent proceedings had not amused him so much and helenas departure looking prettier than ever with her husband had annoyed and exasperated him he did not like to think of them together and though only a couple of nights ago he and martin had found good cause for whispers and laughter over this it was not so diverting when it actually occurred as it had promised to be part of that midnight seance which he could not at first remember had found its way into his conscious mind and he knew that had been talked about and had ascertained with considerable relief that jessie had not been able to hear it but now there was a savage bitterness in his mind about it helena seemed to have played him false again she ought to have refused to marry the bradshaw at the last moment and it was an ineffectual balm to know she did not care for him perhaps as jessie had once said though withdrawing it afterwards she cared for nobody but now archie believed that she cared for him it maddened him to think that she was the bradshaws abc and in those circumstances he had judged it better to remain in town for the night and distract his mind and soothe his longings with the amusement and aids to forgetfulness which london was so ready to offer to a young man who was looking for adventures but london proved disappointing it did not seem to be thinking of its amusements at all archie called to see a friend who last week had shown himself an eager and admirable companion but found him today disinclined for another night of similar diversion for he could neither think nor talk about anything else than the imminence of war archie felt himself quite incapable of taking any active interest in that it weighted nothing in the balance compared with the stern duty of seeking enjoyment and forgetting about helena what if england did go to war with germany certainly he hoped she would not she had made no more than a friendly understanding with her alliesindeed they were not even allies they were but welldisposed nationsbut even if she did what then there was an english fleet was there not which cost an immense amount of money to render invincible but it was invincible why then should he bother about it since he was not a sailor it was further supposed that germany had an invincible army and there you were and if england had no army at all to speak of it was quite clear she could no more fight germany on land than germany could fight her by sea so what on earth prevented a little dinner at a restaurant and an hour at a musichall and a little supper somewhere and anything that turned up something always turned up and was usually amusing for an hour or two but his friend thought otherwise and kept diving out into the street to get some fresh edition of an evening paper hot from the press and crammed with fresh inventions and archie left this insane patriot in disgust at his excitement over so detached an affair as a european war he tried a second friend with no better success there was a certain excuse for him as he was a subaltern in the guards but for the first friend there was none as he was only in an office in the city there were still four or five hours to get through before it would be reasonable to think about dinner after which even if he started alone the hours would take care of themselves very pleasantly but he had to fill the interval somehow there were some proofs of his book waiting for him at home and hoping to get interested in this firstborn public child of his brain he sat down with a view to correcting them but he found himself reading the pages as if there was nothing intelligible printed on them true if he forced himself to attend he could see that grammatical sentences succeeded each other but they conveyed no further impression there was a lot about the sea but why on earth had he taken the trouble to write it he could remember writing it he could call up an image of himself sitting in the garden at silorno eagerly writing conscientiously erasing walking up and down in the attempt to frame a phrase that should exactly reproduce some mood of his mind but what had inspired those strivings and despairs and exultations here was the record of them and it seemed now to be about nothing the rain in the night had washed the white soil into the rim of the sea and it was clouded like absinthe he could well remember the search for and the finding of that particular simile he and harry had been into genoa a week before and out of curiosity had ordered absinthe at a cafe the drink qua drink was mildly unpleasant resembling aniseed but it had been worth while having it merely to have got that perfectly fitting simile the effect too had been rather remarkable it produced a sort of heady lightness and sense of wellbeing colours seemed strangely vivid and intensified and archie got up from his meaningless proofs it was absinthe that would help him to fill up those dull hours till dinnertime and he remembered having seen in some little french restaurant in soho the stuff he wanted very likely you could get it anywhere but he wanted it from that particular place for there had come in one evening when he dined there a most melancholylooking person who had ordered it and sat and sipped somehow the mans face had made an impression on him so unhappy was it he remembered also his face half an hour afterwards when he began his dinner and no serener more contented countenance could have been imagined so he must have his absinthe from that restaurant clearly they had a very good brand of it there as he drove out alone that evening to dine he heard the newsvenders shouting out the english ultimatum to germany and saw the placards in the streets the shouting sounded wonderfully musical and below the roar of the street traffic was a muffled harmony as of pealing bells the drab colours of london were shot with prismatic hues never had the streets appeared so beautiful there was even beauty in the fact of the outbreak of war for england was going to war for the sake of liberty which was a fine a noble adventure and how lovely the english girls and boys were who crowded the pavements they were like beds of exquisite flowers for himself he was going back to dine at the french restaurant in soho for that would be in the nature of supporting our new allies afterwards there were the streets and the musichalls and all the mysteries of the short summer night then dawn would break rosecoloured dawn with her finger on her lips and sweet silent mouth a little ashamed of her sister night but sympathetic at heart dawn was always a little prudish a little quakerish the days of a divine august went by and the line of german invasion swept forward like a tide that knows no ebb over all belgium and northeast france the british expeditionary force started and was swept back like the flotsam on the seashore the call came for the raising of an army and east and west north and south the recruiting offices were like choked waterways and still the flood of men in whose hearts the fact of england had awoke poured in hospitals were gorged with the returning wounded women by the hundred and by the thousand volunteered as nurses and went to hospitals to be trained the whole of comfortable england intent hitherto on its sports its leisure its general superiority to the rest of the world suddenly became aware that an immense and vital danger threatened it a chorus of objurgation arose from the brazenthroated press each organ striving to shout the loudest at the unpreparedness of the country and much valuable energy was spent in headlines and recriminations there was a shortage of guns a shortage of ammunition a shortage of everything which constitutes the sinews of war the only thing of which there was not a shortage was of those who threw aside all other considerations such as income and secure living and life itself and gave themselves to assist in what manner they could the cause for which england had gone to war to archie this all seemed a very hysterical and uncomfortable attack of nerves in several ways it affected him personally for william than whom there was no more reliable servant was among the first to leave his wellpaid situation and present himself at a recruiting office archie hated that there would be the nuisance of getting a new servant who did not know where precisely he ought to put archies toothpowder and how to arrange his clothes william had announced the fact too in the suddenest of manners he brought it out as he brought in archies morning tea and if you can spare me at once my lord he said i had better go on saturday archie felt peculiarly devilish that morning it rained and the absinthe that should have arrived last night had not come i think its very inconsiderate of you william he said but i suppose you expect to get on well and draw higher pay than you get here so i shall have to raise your wages all right ill give you a pound a month more and dont let me hear any more about it he knew perfectly well that this was not williams reason but it amused him to suggest it he wanted to see how william would take it the fact that he knew that the man was devoted to him made the point william busied himself with razors and toothbrushes replying nothing cant you hear what i say asked archie pouring himself out his tea william faced round yes master archie he said i heard but i knew you didnt mean that you know how ive served you and worked for you all these years you would scorn to think that of me i should say archie had noticed the master archie instead of my lord both william and blessington often forgot that he was my lord and it always used to please him that to the sense of love he was still a young boy and in spite of his irritation and peevish morning temper it touched some part of him that still loved below the corruption that was spreading over him like some junglegrowing lichen but he had to force his way through that to reply you must do as you think right william he said william had finished the arrangements of his dressing and stood for a moment by his bedside with archies evening clothes bundled on to his arm yes master archie he said and youll be joining up too before long wont you i should dearly love to be your soldierservant sir if you could manage it all archies illhumour returned at that unfortunate suggestion perhaps you had better not be impertinent he said thatll do williams face fell i had no thought of impertinence my lord he said i only thought i told you that would do said archie three days afterwards william left he came to say goodbye to archie who did not look up from the paper he was reading archie was suffering inconvenience from his departure and this was the best way of making william feel it but when the door had shut again and william was gone he felt a sudden horror of the thing that seemed to be himself and he ran out and called william back all these days he had not had a word or kindly gesture for him goodbye william he said i wish you all good luck ive treated you like a beast these last days and im awfully sorry youre the best fellow a man could have and you must try to forget the horrid way ive behaved william stood with his hand in archies for a moment youre always my master archie sir he said well there was an end of william before he had got back to his paper again archie wondered what had possessed him to throw a kind word to a dog like that who had left him at three days notice to join this ridiculous military conspiracy william did not care how much he inconvenienced archie who had always treated him more like a subordinate friend than a servant he had helped william in a hundred ways had given him old clothes had constantly asked after his mother had left his letters about for william to read if he chose it seemed rank treachery others were treacherous too his mother for instance was immediately going up to town to take charge of the house in grosvenor square which was to be turned into a hospital for wounded officers she was to become a sort of housekeeper so archie figured it and merely superintend domestic arrangements she would have nothing to do with the nursing and the surgery which had a certain fascination he could picture a sort of pleasure in seeing a mans leg cut off or in standing by while doctors pulled bandages off festering wounds to feel well and strong while others were suffering had an intelligible interest to witness decay and corruption and pain was a point that appealed to him now but lady tintagel was going to do nothing of the sort she was just going to be a housekeeper it was very selfish of her archie would certainly want from time to time to go up to town and spend a night or two there and now he would have to go to a hotel or a club instead of profiting by the spacious privacy of his fathers house charity begins at home and his mother had started charity on most extraneous lines jessie had followed this lead the lead of socalled trumps as archie framed a private phrase she would start by being not even a housekeeper but a sort of kitchenmaid at the same hospital she had an insane desire to work to do something that cost her something instead of engaging a kitchenmaid and paying her wages to go to some hospital or other there was a craze for personal service instead of getting other people to do work for you if you felt work had to be done people wanted to do their bit to employ an odious expression which was beginning to obtain currency the nation was going to be mobilized hand and heart had to serve some vague national idea occasionally as on the night when war was declared archie saw an aesthetic beauty in the notion of upholding rights and liberties but he had not then reckoned with the fact that personal inconvenience might result from that quixotic revolution quixotism was fine in theory but it was a dream not to be encouraged in waking hours when far more important and realizable commodities like whisky and absinthe engaged the true attention but whoever else was treacherous his father at least was loyal and showed no sign of becoming a butler or a footman to correspond with his wife and jessie occasionally some grave report concerning the german advance through belgium used to reach his brain and he would walk up and down his room in the evening with a martial tread and a glance at a sword that hung above his writingtable and wish he was younger and able to have a go at those invading locusts but invariably this mood which was always short was succeeded by another not bellicose but domestic this damned war is going to break up homelife in england he would say and ive no doubt that was what the germans aimed at and theyre succeeding too look at this house theres you mother going to leave us and theres helenas husband expecting every day to be sent to france and theres jessie leaving her father to wash up dishes whats going to become of our english homes if that goes onfor mark you they are the root of our national life its digging up the trees roots to break up english homes you and i archie are the only ones who are staunch to our homes pass me that bottle will you may i help myself on the way said archie yes of course my dear boy i say it was a funny state of things when you and i used to have our evening drinks alone instead of enjoying them and chatting over them together your man william too hes gone and enlisted hasnt he the old bulwarks of england are going fast the homes are being broken up and the very servants come and go as they choose an establishment was an establishment in the old days it all stood and fell together if you see what i mean but i wish i was young enough to have a go at the boches im thinking of going archie would say merely in order to enjoy his fathers reply well in my opinion youll be doing a very wrong thing then said lord tintagel i hope you wont seriously think of that i tell you your duty is here with your poor old father when im gone you may do what you please and i daresay you wont have very long to wait but while im here i hope youll remember that they say in church honour thy father and thy mother you cant go behind the commandments or the psalms whichever it is but these sessions in lord tintagels room of an evening with the liquid in the decanter sinking steadily like a well in time of drought were becoming rather tedious to archie since his discovery of absinthe they had even become rather gross and he congratulated himself on having seen the sordidness of mere swilling that sort of thing was only fit for coarse rough tastes it seemed to him to lack all delicacy and aesthetic value and he often left his father who congratulated him on his abstemiousness after no more than a friendly glass of good fellowship and went upstairs to his room to enjoy subtler and more refined sensations indeed his chief interest in that halfhour or so in his fathers room was derived from the sight of his fathers heavy potations the struggle of his maundering thoughts to emerge into language much as a tilted halfmoon struggles to pierce the flying clouds on some tempestuous night the sight of his fathers deterioration and gradual wreck somehow fascinated him there was decay and corruption there and those no longer aroused in him that horror with which in dream he had observed the emergence of the writhing worms from the white statue of helena such things were no longer disgusting and repulsive they claimed kinship with something in his soul that was very potent once martin had alluded to that vision as a warning and he had not taken that warning in consequence of which he had passed an utterly miserable month after helenas rejection of him now values had altogether changed decay no longer revolted him but with a hypocrisy that had become characteristic of him he told himself that the sight of his fathers nightly intoxication was a lesson to himself he must observe that degrading spectacle and learn from it what the result of too much whisky was and then he retired to his bedroom to think it over as he sipped the clouded aroma of his absinthe jessie came down for another weekend before she took her kitchenmaid situation and brought the news that a fresh draft of lord harlows regiment was ordered to the front and that he would leave for france within the next day or two archie felt a wild desire to laugh to skip to show his intense appreciation of these tidings but he remembered that jessie was not his confidante to that extent and checked his exuberant inclination poor helena he said with an accent of great sincerity she must be brokenhearted why theyve only been married a fortnight if as much it was excellently said and jessie felt she would have shown herself an infidel with regard to the general decency of the human race if she had not accepted those words with the sincerity with which they surely must have been uttered she resolutely put away from her all those misgivings that had assailed her when first she knew of archies changed attitude towards her sister you have been a brick about helena she said i want to tell you that your forgiveness of the way she treated you seems to me beyond all praise oh nonsense said he lightly besides it was so dreadfully uncomfortable being always angry and miserable martin showed me that but about helena how is she bearing it it was now jessies turn to be obliged to cloak her meaning very calmly and bravely she said she would said archie enthusiastically one always felt there was a steel will behind all helenas gentleness what will she do do you think would she perhaps like to come down here there isnt much to offer her but then london in august doesnt offer much either suddenly all jessies mistrust stirred and erected itself she could not believe that this scheme which would throw helena and archie completely together could be made with the apparent innocence with which it was put forward how was it possible that archie who so few weeks ago was in such depths of misery and bitterness could honourably suggest so dangerous a plan it could not be archie who suggested it it came from that smiling white presence which she had seen in his room not many nights ago and it was just that which she could not say to him its nice of you to think of that she said not a bit it would be nice for me not nice of me and besides he added with an amazing cynicism it would be my way of doing my bit which everybody is talking about if i could make things cheerfuller for pretty women like poor helena whose husband has gone out to fight the moment he had said it he was sorry but for the moment he had forgotten he was speaking to jessie the sentence had come out of his mouth as if he was but talking to himself also it introduced the suggestion of his own forbearance to enlist there was a rather awkward silence and he felt irritated with jessie for not changing the subject which he had so incautiously brought forward but that was like her she had no tact in such matters refusing to be insincere when insincerity was so simple a matter his irritation grew on him and at the same time he wanted to know what jessie thought of his remaining inertly here while all his contemporaries were enlisting why he wanted to know he did not define the motive perhaps belonged to the time when jessie had been so good a friend and perhaps he knew that she was so still or do you think that i ought to behave like william and serve my country he asked jessie sat with eyes downcast for a moment then she raised them and looked him in the face with all her affection and sincerity alight in them do you really want to know what i think archie she asked certainly i do well i cant understand your not doing it she said at the same time i think it is a matter about which you must decide for yourself the sincerity of his manner equalled hers he never spoke with more apparent frankness shall i tell you why i dont he said its this do you remember one night our finding that my father was breaking the contract he made with me about drinking do you remember how sordid and horrible the discovery was jessie remembered quite well how archie had laughed at it i remember the evening she said well weve renewed our contract said he and im the only person in the world who can keep my father to it if i left him he would drink himself to death where then do you think my duty lies jessie isnt it clearly for me to save my father can there be a more obvious duty than that do you think i have a very delightful life down here all alone with him wouldnt it be vastly easier for me to join my friends and go out alongside of them i know my conduct lays me open to misconception but i must be thickskinned over that but i hope you wont misjudge me besides my father has said that he forbids me to go of course i could leave him he doesnt lock me up but i cant see how i should be right in leaving him im the one anchor he has left he paused a moment thinking over with that stupendous swiftness of brain that was the result of martins inspiration all he had said and remembered his light cynicism with regard to his bit i know i rather shocked you just now he said when i spoke of its being my bit to console pretty women whose husbands had gone out but sometimes one has to be flippant to conceal ones real thoughts on a serious subject for i did not foresee then that we should talk it out so theres the end of that jest so that had been a jest not to be taken seriously but it was a grimmer affair for jessie not to be able to take seriously archies seriousness for a moment the frankness of his manner had convinced her but very soon her conviction collapsed like a house of cards as he went on speaking the horribleness of the discovery of his fathers drinking for instance when what she remembered was archies laughter if he could say that what credence could possibly be placed in the picture he had drawn of himself as his fathers last hope or what in the image of himself as one who must silently bear cruel misconception she could believe none of it yet it was not the archie whom she loved with all the sweetness and strength of her nature who spoke but the thing that was possessing him and filling his soul from the reservoir of some immense abyss of pure evil she felt sure she did not misjudge him true and infinitely tragic was her comprehension it is entirely for you to decide archie she said i think i fully appreciate the worth of your reasons indeed she knew not what else to say though the bitter doubleness of her words cut her to the heart but if she could help archie at all she must at all costs retain such confidence as he gave her must not give him the chance of quarrelling with her to her great relief he seemed to accept the literal value of her words and took her arm and this time she felt in her soul that there was sincerity in his speech you are a good friend jessie he said dont give me up will you i couldnt she said quietly they were strolling together by the edge of the lake in the hour of sunset and jessie though sick at heart and tortured by the weight of her forebodings and the tempest of fire and blood which had burst on europe yet tried to open her heart to the sweet spell of the tranquil evening somewhere behind the cloud of evil which had so suddenly taken shape in that host of barbarians who already had overrun belgium and which no less was invading the spirit of the boy she loved with the uttermost fibre of her being there shone the eternal serenity of omnipotent mercy but he dealt through human means it was through those who had left love and home and ease behind them to perish in france that that torrent would be stayed and through her though in ways she could not conjecture would come the delivery of her beloved and in the roseflecked sky the leafy towers of the elms the bosom of the lake that power also dwelt no less than in the hearts that yearned for its presence and its manifestation as in a glass darkly she beheld its reflection which nothing could ever shatter of that she must never lose sight nor cease to keep her inward eye fixed on the gleam which some day would signal to her about a week later archie was spending a delectable morning at the bathingplace never had there been so superb an imitation of italian weather in england as this year and day after day went by in unclouded brightness and strong fresh heat in those delightful conditions it had been perfectly easy for him to take his mind completely away from the war and the misconceptions which he was possibly suffering under he gave every morning but the briefest glance to the paper for there was a tiresome uniformity about the news and a monotonous regularity about the daily map which marked the progress of the german line across northeast france he gave hardly more thought to helena who seemed to think it more appropriate to stay in london with her father just for the present but had written the most characteristic of letters saying how sweet archies sympathy was to her and how acute her anxiety concerning her husband certainly at the moment this was the right attitude to take and archie really did not much care whether she was here with him or not for he had found his way into the paradise that forms the portico of the palace where the absinthedrinker dwells and not yet had he penetrated into the halls of hell that lie beyond his pleasure in the fact of being alive in the colours of morning and evening in the touch of cool waters in the whispering of wind among the firs were quickened to an inconceivable degree it was impossible to want anything except the privilege of enjoying this amazing thrill of existence and with it there had returned to him the need of expressing himself in writing a new aspect of the world had been revealed to him and without struggle but with an evenflowing pen he set himself to record it in veiled phrases and descriptions through which as in chinks of light seen at the edges of drawn blinds there came hints and suggestions of the fresh world that had dawned on him where before it was the clear stainlessness of the sea the purifying breath of great winds that had been his theme now instead the satyr crouched in the bushes the snake lay coiled in the heather it was from the slime and mud and from among blind crawling things that the waterlily sprang and where before the enchantment of life moved him he felt now only the call of putrefaction and decay the lethal side of the created world had become exquisite in his eyes and the beauty of it was derived from its everlasting corruption not from the eternal upspringing of life lust not love was the force that kept it young and renewed it so that the harvest of its decay should never ceased to be reaped his mind had become a mirror that distorted into grotesque and evil shapes every image of beauty that was reflected in it and rejoiced in them it seemed to him that all nature as well as all human motive was based upon this exquisite secret that he had discovered but it would never do to state it with what he considered the bald realism of those ludicrous seapieces he had written at silorno he must wrap his message up in a sort of mystic subtlety so that only those who had implanted in them the true instinct should be able to fill their souls with the perfume of his flowers others might guess and wonder and be puzzled and perhaps see so far as to put down his book with disgust that was still half incredulous but only the initiated would be able to grasp wholly the message that lurked in his hints and allusions his style underneath this new inspiration had developed into an instrument of marvellous beauty and often when he had written a page or two he would read it out aloud to himself in wonder at that exquisite diction and all the time he felt that he was reading aloud to martin and that martin had dictated to him he was employed thus on this particular morning down at the bathingplace he had already had a long swim and without dressing lay down on the short turf and got out his writingpad when his new servant who had taken williams place came down with a telegram for him he was a very goodlooking boy quick in movement and swift to smile and already archie wondered how he could have regretted the departure of plain middleaged william only last evening archie idly glancing through a fieldglass had seen the boy far off in the meadow beyond the lake in company with an extremely pretty housemaid whom he had often noticed about the passages the two had sat there some time talking and then archie saw the boy look quickly round and kiss her he liked that immensely that was the way youth should behave he almost hoped that it was thomas who had taken from his table one of those new tenshilling notes that he had missed he mustnt do it too often for that would be a bore but archie liked to think the boy had taken it and perhaps converted it into a decoration for the pretty housemaid anyhow thomas with his handsome face and his kissings in the meadow and his possible pilferings was an attractive boy and clearly developing along the right lines the boy hesitated a moment seeing archie dripping and naked i beg your pardon my lord he said but there came a telegram for you and i thought i had better bring it down certainly but why beg my pardon said archie dont be prudish i daresay youve got arms and legs as well as me havent you thomas grinned with that odd shy look that archie had noticed before yes my lord he said then what is there to be ashamed of archie opened the telegram and read it and suddenly bit his lip to prevent his laughing is there an answer my lord asked the boy i brought a form down in case well done yes there is an answer archie hesitated a moment before directing the form to helena then he wrote deepest sympathy with the terrible news command me in all ways your devoted archie send that at once will you he said when the boy had gone archie read the telegram again which was from jessie and told him that lord harlow had been killed at the front then he smothered his face in his bent elbow and lay shaking with laughter chapter xiii on a september morning some fortnight later archie was waiting in the drawingroom at oakland crescent for helenas entry he had seen her twice since her husbands death and it struck him now that she always kept him waiting when she asked him to come and see her and ascribed to that the very probable motive that she expected thereby to increase his eagerness for her coming certainly he wanted her to come because he was much interested and amused in the conventional little comedy she was playing and he looked forward to the third act on which the curtain would presently ring up in the interval he sat very serenely smiling to himself and tickling the end of his nose with three white feathers that he had received in the street today that always diverted him extremely a rude young woman would come up she was invariably square and plain and had a knobby face like a chest of drawers and say arent you ashimed not to be serving your country youre a coward you are and then she would give him a white feather he had quite a collection of them now there were nine already which he carefully kept in his studbox and these three all in one day were a splendid haul he had to occupy his mind very pleasantly the remembrance of his previous interviews with helena which formed the two existing acts of the comedy in the first she had come in looking deliciously pretty in her deep mourning and with her head a little on one side had held out both her hands to him they had stood with hands clasped for quite a long time and then archie kissed her because he was rather tired of holding her hands and because he enjoyed kissing anything so pretty that had caused a break and they sat down side by side and helena made some queer movements in her throat which seemed to archie to be designed to convey the impression that she was repressing her emotion but they did not quite fulfil their design they looked rather as if they were due to the desire to pump up rather than keep down then helena gave a long sigh oh archie she said i am utterly brokenhearted it was so sudden so terribly sudden i shall never get over it think we had been married only a fortnight and next day i got a letter from him after i knew he was dead such a sweet little letter so cheerful and so loving archie expected something of this sort its conventionality its utter insincerity amused him enormously and wanting more of it he said just the proper sort of thing to encourage her to give it him oh my dear he said but how you will love and cherish that letter i dont suppose you were once out of his thoughts all the time he was in france she shook her head i am sure of it she said ah what a privilege to have been loved as i was loved by such a noble manly heart i must always think of that mustnt i archie took her hand again the touch of those soft cool fingers gave him pleasure so too did the answering pressure of them yes indeed he said and you must remember too that its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all she repeated the quotation in a dreamy meditative voice yes that is so true it does me good to think of that she said and i mustnt think of him as dead really he is just as living as ever he was he was so fond of you too we often spoke of you and his quaint quiet humour that was the general note of the first act it had been short for the conversation suitable to it was necessarily limited the second showed a great advance in scope and variety of topics also the tempo was quite changed instead of its being largo it was at least andante con moto this time after again keeping him waiting she had entered with a smile what a comfort you are archie she said i have been looking forward to seeing you again somehow you understand me which nobody else does i feel all the time that neither darling jessie whenever i see her which isnt often for she is so busy nor daddy quite understand me i mean to be brave and not lose courage not lose gaiety even and i thinki think that they both misjudge me they expect me to be utterly broken so i was at first as you know so well but i tried to take to heart what you said and force myself not to despair i feel i oughtnt to do that i must take the burden of life up again with a smile her hand lay open on her knee as she said this she turned it over towards him making an invitation that seemed unconscious he slipped his long brown fingers into that rosy palm she was astonishingly like a girl he met a night or two ago i must get over this awful feeling of loneliness she said and you are helping me so deliciously to do so daddy is busy all day i scarcely see him jessie is busy also i think she enjoys washing up knives and forks and plates for soldiers though of course that doesnt make it any less sweet of her to do it but anyhow she hasnt got much time for me i wishno i suppose its wrong to wish that well confess then said archie smiling at her yes dear fatherconfessor though i ought to say boyconfessor for you look so young well ill confess to you iim sure you wont be shocked with me i wish jessie cared for me a little more she is my sister after all but i daresay its my fault i havent got the key to her heart and with jessie and daddy so full of other affairs i do feel lonely but when you are here i dont i dont know what i should have done without you archie i think i might have killed myself this was glorious archie gave a splendid shudder dont talk like that he said in a tone of affectionate command you dont know how it hurts ah im sorry it was selfish of me do you forgive me you know i do said he she had brought into the room with her a long envelope and rather absently she took out from it an enclosure of papers i got this today from the lawyers she said its about my darlings will i think i wonder if you would help me to understand it i am so stupid at figures she slid a little closer to him leaning her hand on his shoulder and looking over him as he read the document required as a matter of fact very little exercise of intelligence the house in surrey where they had spent the week of the honeymoon was hers and so was a very decent income of l a year left to her without any condition whatever for her life it was hers absolutely the disposition of the rest of his fortune depended on whether she had a child the details of that were not given his lawyer only informed her what was hers she hid her face on the hand that rested on archies shoulder oh archie i can never go back to that house she said at least not for a long time it would be tearing open the old wound again yes i understand that said he with another pressure of his fingers and thinking of the l a year without conditions he had a wild temptation to console her further by quoting let us grieve not only find strength in what remains behind but he refrained though apparently there was no limit to helenas insincerity there might be some in her acceptance of the insincerity of others oh you do understand me so well she said and archie i want to ask a horribly selfish thing of you but i cant help it i am all alone now except for you you wont go out to the war will you i dont think i could bear it if you did it was quite easy for him to promise that but an allusion to the misconception he might incur made his acquiescence sound difficult and noble since then up to the day when he was now expecting her entry for the third act he had thought over the whole situation with the imaginative vision which absinthe inspired he had not the slightest doubt in his mind that helena according to her capacity for loving was in love with him and that she thought he was still in love with her but when he considered it all he found he had no longer the slightest intention of marrying her even though she had l a year for life without conditions attached plenty of money was no doubt a preventive of discomfort in this life and he felt it was fine of him not to be attracted by so ignoble a bait but no amount of money would really compensate for the inseparable companionship of helena with her foolishness her apparent inability to understand that her insincerities so far from being convincing and beautiful were no more than the most puerile and transparent counterfeits certainly she aroused the ardour of his senses but how long would that last and even while it lasted how could it compare with his ardour for his absinthecoloured dreams and the ecstasy of his communion with the spirit that had made its home in him she would interrupt all that and as a companion she could not compare with his father she would always be wanting to be caressed and made much of and admired and taken care of it would soon become most horribly tedious there was a further reason against marrying her which was as potent as any he would forfeit his revenge on her if he did that once dim ages ago it seemed and on another plane of existence he had loved her and she knowing it had fed his devotion with smiles and glances and at the end had chosen him whose body now decayed in some graveyard of north france already probably desecrated by the onswarming germans now it was archies turn already he was sure she expected to marry him and she would learn that he had not the least intention of doing so that delightful situation might easily be arrived at in the third act for which he was waiting now this time she came with flowers in her hand and presently as they sat side by side on the sofa talking she put one into his buttonhole instantly he interrupted himself in what he was saying and kissed it she gave him that long glance which he had once thought meant so much it had not meant much then from her point of view but it meant a good deal more now but to archie it had passed from being a gleam of wonder to a farthing dip oh you foolish boy she said he almost thought he heard martin laugh i dont see anything foolish about it he said at least if its foolish ive always been foolish her lips moved though not to speak they just gathered themselves together and a little tremor went down the arm that rested against his he was perfectly certain of both those signals and next moment he had folded her to him and she lay less than unresisting in his arms then she gently thrust him from her ah how wrong of me she said and yet perhaps its not wrong the dear bradshaw would always want me to be happy perhaps he even thought of this when he left me so free for this time archie i shant come to you emptyhanded but of course we mustnt think of all that for many months yet archie flushed and merryeyed looked at her with boyish surprise think of what he said ah you force me to say it do you of our marriage he was adorable in her eyes just then she could hardly realize that so few months ago she had definitely put him from her his warm smooth face his crisp curling hair the youthful roughness and ardour of his embrace inflamed and ravished her he looked at her still inquiringly a moment then threw back his head and laughed oh youre delicious he said but marriage what do you mean a cousinly kiss a little sympathy a few dear little surrenders of each of us to the other thats all i intended well i must be off goodbye next moment still choking with laughter he was downstairs and out into the street he could not resist looking up at the window and waving a gay hand towards it something within him that seemed the very essence of his being shouted and sang with glee the house in grosvenor square where his mother had become housekeeper and jessie kitchenmaid had at present in it only a few wounded officers from france and during these two or three days in town archie could still occupy his own bedroom while his servant slept in the dressingroom adjoining he was out very late that night for the completeness of his revenge on helena ran like a feeding fire through his veins and both nourished and burned him dawn had already broken when he let himself in and went very quietly upstairs not intending to go to bed till he had had an interview with martin all night he had felt as if martin was bursting to come forth again he was already intensely present even though archie had not yet sunk his conscious self and opened the door of mystic communication that controlling spirit foamed and simmered within him he could all but break open the door himself and project himself without invitation he was still just confined but only just it seemed that at any minute he might assert himself but archie with the gourmand instinct that delays an actual fulfilment teasing itself while it knows the fulfilment is assured lingered over his undressing and planned to make himself cool and comfortable in his pyjamas before he abandoned the fortress of his normal self he brushed his teeth he sponged face and neck with cold water he arranged his chair in the window and put on the table by his bed the moonstone stud on which he would focus his eyes and stretched himself long and luxuriously till he heard his shoulder joints crack martin seemed in a great hurry to come tonight but martin must just wait till he was ready and then all of a sudden he heard a tremendous noise of rapping he knew that martin had come and an awful terror seized his soul for martin had come without being called at that precise moment his servant next door started up wide awake with some loud sound in his ears that seemed to come from archies bedroom he tapped at his door but getting no answer went in he found archie lying on the floor curled up together like some twisted root of a tree foaming at the mouth he ran downstairs to get help and brought up one of the nurses who was on duty she instantly telephoned for a doctor and woke lady tintagel all that day archie lay in this strange seizure apparently quite unconscious sometimes a paroxysm would take hold of him and he lay with staring eyes and teeth that ground against each other and limbs that curled into fantastic shapes in the intervals he remained still stiff and rigid his eyes for the most part shut breathing quickly as if he had been running then once again the panic and the agony would grip him and with eyes wide with terror and foaming mouth he struggled and fought against the thing that mastered him but each paroxysm left him weaker and it was clear that he would not be able to stand many more of these attacks yet no one could wish them prolonged it would but be merciful if the end came soon and spared him further suffering towards sunset that day jessie was sitting by him with orders to call the nurse next door if he showed signs of the restlessness which preceded the return of a seizure she knew that humanly speaking he was dying but her faith never faltered that he might still be saved and that through her and her love salvation might come to him medical science was of no avail it could not combat the spiritual foe that had taken him prisoner that rescue had to be made through spiritual means and the twoedged sword by which alone his captor could be vanquished was the brightshining weapon of love and prayer it was in her hand now as she watched and waited he lay quite still breathing quickly and with a shallow inspiration but there were no signs of the restlessness for which she had to look out but presently she observed that his eyes were no longer closed but were open and looking steadily at the brass knob at the foot of his bed on which a sunbeam entering through a chink at the side of the drawn windowblind made a focus of light and all at once she guessed that he was looking at this with purpose and her soul sword in hand crouched ready to spring then from the bed came archies voice martin it said there was a dead silence and she saw forming in the air a little in front of him a nucleus of mist it gathered volume from a little jet as of steam that appeared to come from archie himself thicker and thicker it grew strange lines began to interlace themselves within it and these took form the dimness of its outline grew firm and distinct the shape stood detached and clear and bending over archie with a smile triumphant and cruel stood the semblance she had seen once before at midnight in archies room he was no longer looking at the knob at the foot of his bed but with eyes wide open and blank with some nameless terror he gazed at the apparition jessie rose and stood opposite it on the other side of his bed her twoedged sword was drawn now and its bright blade gleamed in the darkness of the evil that flooded the room and then it seemed that that incarnation of it that stood beside archies bed was aware for it turned and looked her full in the face bringing to bear on her the utmost of its hellish potency for one moment against that awful assault her soul cried out in panic it had not dreamed that from all the crimes with which the world had withered and bled there could be distilled a tincture so poisonous and then her love rallied her scattered courage and she stood firm again nothing in the world but love and prayer could prevail but nothing if once she could fully realize that could prevail against them in her hand as in the hand of all who are foes to evil was the irresistible weapon could she but use its power to the full she stood as she knew in the face of the deadliest peril by which any living thing into which the breath of god has passed can be confronted there is no soul so strong that evil can cease to be a menace for it and here facing her was the power that had already perverted all that archie held of goodness and humanity there it stood one victim already its helpless prisoner and it lusted for more and the wordless struggle as old as evil itself began she would not give ground her soul laid itself open and let the light invisible shine on it in this struggle there were no strivings or wrestlings she had but to stay quiet and in just that achievement of quietness the struggle lay once for a moment all hell swirled and exulted round her for her love for archie let itself contemplate the human and material aspect of him the next she put all that away from her and again stood with his soul so to speak in her uplifted hands offering it to god in the very stormcentre of this evil which shrieked and raged round her there must be and there was a space where the peace that passeth understanding dwelt in serene calm the storm might shift and envelope her again in its bellowings but again and yet again she had to regain the centre where no blast of it could penetrate how long this lasted she could not tell her body was quite conscious of its ordinary perceptions the blind tapped on the window and there came from outside the stir of distant traffic but she did not take her gaze from those awful eyes that sometimes smiled sometimes blazed with hate steadily and firmly she looked at them and through them for behind them as behind the cloud was the sunlight of god and then there came a change it seemed that the power she fought was weakening its eyes shifted they no longer looked undeviatingly at her but glanced round for a moment as if they looked for some way of escape they would come back to her again with fresh assault of smiles or hate but each time they seemed less potent more than once they left her face altogether for a while and were directed on archie as if seeking the refuge there that they knew but with a wordless command that they were forced to obey she summoned them back to her again making the spirit that directed them turn the strength of its fury on her she gave it no rest fixing it on herself by the strength of love and prayer the eyes began to grow dim the outline of the form began to waver the interlacing lines out of which it was woven began to unravel again and it grew shapeless but it was not being absorbed into archie there were no streams of mist between him and it as when it had first taken substance already through it she could see the wall behind it and it grew ever fainter and thinner there was nothing left of it now and for the first time since the struggle began she looked at archie he was lying quite still with eyes closed again and then she saw that by her side was standing another presence it was identical in form and shape with that which had vanished and it bent on archie so amazing a look of love that her soul spent and sick with struggle felt itself uplifted and refreshed again and for one moment it looked at her and it was as if archie himself was looking at her and then it was there no longer she hardly knew whether her physical eyes had seen it externally or whether it had been some spiritvision conveyed to them from within there came a sound from next door and the nurse who was there ready to be summoned entered has he been quite quiet she asked and without waiting for an answer she went to the bed she looked at archie a moment then felt his elbows and knees finding them pliant again instead of being stiff and rigid and listened to his quiet breathing but there has come an extraordinary change she said the seizure has passed and yet hes alive she beamed at jessie well you are a good nurse she said but i think ill just fetch the doctor she went out of the room and archie who had lain quite motionless with closed eyes suddenly stirred and looked at the girl why jessie he said she came close to the bed yes whats happened said he ive had some awful nightmare and then you broke it up hasnt martin been here too yes archie i think so she said he lay in silence a moment have you saved me again jessie he said you did once before atat silorno when the lightning struck the pine she could find no answer for him not a word could she speak he held out his hand to her jessie he said notable new novels s net each by sir h rider

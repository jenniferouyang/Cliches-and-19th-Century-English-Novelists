benson author of dodo limitations with six illustrations london new york g p putnams sons entered at stationers hall dedication dear toby it is fitting and i hope you will not feel it otherwise that your name should appear on the forefront of this little book for you know best how much good humour went to the making of it and how when it was read piecemeal as it was written to you your native politeness which i cannot admire too much more than once prompted you to laugh advt you will remember too when i first mentioned the idea of it to you that with some solemnity we procured a large sheet of foolscap paper and a blue pencil and then and there set ourselves to put down all the remarkable and stirring events which happened to us in those four years we spent together at cambridge how we failed egregiously to recollect anything remarkable or stirring pardon me we remembered one stirring event but decided not to treat the world to it which had come within our personal experience and thereupon cast or as you said speired about for any remarkable and stirring incident which had happened not alas to us but to anybody else soever here again i may recall to you that we drew blank and our sheet of paper was still virgin white our blue pencil as sharp as ever and the book no nearer conception than before then it was that the uncomfortable conviction dawned on us gradually illuminating our minds as some cloudy rain slanted morning grows clear to half wakened eyes that in the majority of cases remarkable and stirring events do not befall the undergraduate and that if the book was to be made at all it must be made of homely and i hope wholesome ingredients a cricket ball a canoe a football a tripos a don a croquet mallet a few undergraduates a greek play some work and so forth for it seemed to us that the superficial enquirer and you i vow are even more superficially minded than i finds that these things are common to the experience of most men but that when you begin to deal in spiritualities heroes century making captains of eleven chess blues and higher aspirations you desert the normal plane for the super normal where people like you and me have no business to intrude so that now it is complete you will find therein neither births deaths nor marriages and though the babe himself may have waxed a little out of proportion to our original scheme he ought for instance never to have played rugby for his university as savouring too much of the hero i have retained for him to the end that futility of mind and girt him about with that flippant atmosphere in which the truly heroic chokes and stifles about the other characters i have no such confessions to make they have successfully steered clear of all distinctions bodily or mental i have even omitted to state ealings place in the tripos and for this reason he ought to have done better than the babe but the babe got a second and this leaves only one class where ealings name would reasonably appear and i altogether refuse to let him take a first good bye for the present but you will be home for leave will you not in a month believe me my dear toby ever your sincere friend e f

introduce the time has come the showman said to look at many things at deans and tea and men and babes at cambridge and at kings light blue lyrics and i maintain said reggie flourishing the britannia metal teapot in order it is supposed to lend a spurious emphasis to the banalit of his sentiment that its better to have played and lost than never the teapot one of those in which the handle is invariably the hottest part had just been filled up with boiling water and a clear and fervid amber stream flew bounteously out of its spout on to the bare knees of one of those who had played and lost thereupon a confused noise arose and reggies sentence has never been finished after a short but violent interlude the confused noise ceased by tacit consent as suddenly as it had begun ealing helped reggie to pick up the broken fragments that remained and the latter had to drink his tea out of a pint glass to think that a mere game of football should lead to such disastrous consequences he remarked why does tea out of a glass taste like hot gregory powder i never drank hot gregory powder what does it taste like why like tea out of a glass said reggie brilliantly reggie if you want to rag again youve only got to say so ealing threw into a corner the napkin with which he had been drying his knees and stocking after the tea deluge and as he had finished took out a pipe and proceeded to fill it that pig of a half back caught me a frightful hack on the shin he said well you kicked him in the stomach later on said reggie consolingly thats always something to fall back on besides he did it by accident and it certainly looked as if you did it on purpose of course it may only have been sheer clumsiness dry up you didnt funk as much as usual this afternoon i tried to but i never had time and i can funk as quickly as any man in england jack its time for you to say something jack marsden was the only one of the three who looked in the least like a gentleman at that moment ealing and reggie were both in change they both wore villainously muddy flannel knickerbockers short enough to disclose villainously muddy knees old blazers and strong useful football boots with bars jack who had taken no part in the confused noise was sitting in a low chair reading alice in wonderland and eating cake in the manner of a man who does not think about dinner i wasnt asleep he remarked i heard every word you fellows were saying dormouse explained ealing dormouse it is give me some more tea reggie i call it so jolly sociable to read a book when you come to tea remarked reggie so do i thanks and another piece of cake footballs a beastly game said ealing especially when one is beaten here we are out of the cup ties in the first round and what one is to do now i dont know i cant think why people ever play football i shall work said ealing have you seen the list of the subjects for the mays i think it must be meant for a joke they have set all the classical authors i ever heard of and nearly all i havent ever heard of i want a clean cup quoted jack you want a clean began reggie slowly in a tone of virulent condemnation but being unable to finish his sentence in an adequately insulting manner he left jacks deficiencies to the imagination he wants a clean pipe remarked ealing it sounds like a kettle boiling jack shut up his book and yawned you fellows are beastly funny he said im going back to trinity to work for why i am dining with the babe to night the babe has got markedly madder and several years younger since last term said ealing and he was neither sane nor old to begin with tell him so with my love or i dare say reggie and i will come round later do it is november the fifth the babe observes all feasts whether civil or ecclesiastical he says it would be a thousand pities to let these curious old customs lapse into disuse i wish the babe wouldnt use such beautiful language said ealing he only does it in his less lucid intervals good bye ill tell him youre coming round about ten jack picked up his hat and stick and went off to his rooms in trinity where till half past seven he drifted helplessly about like a ship wrecked mariner to whom no sail breaks the limitless horizon in thucydidess graphic account of the peloponnesian war to jack however it appeared that its chief characteristic was its length rather than its interest a criticism the truth of which is rendered more and more probable every year by an enormous mass of perfectly independent unbiassed critics but being a short and stout young man by no means infirm of purpose he regarded that merely as a reason the more for beginning at once reggie bristow and ealing sat on for an hour or so by the fire they were old friends and so they did not need to talk much reggie was a year the younger of the two and he was now half way through his first term at kings they had been at eton five years together where they had both extracted a good deal of amusement out of life and perhaps a little profit they were both exceedingly healthy to judge by the superficial standards of examinations rather stupid and in the opinion of those who knew them on a much more important matter very liveable with furthermore they both played games rather well and as was right neither of them ever troubled his head about abstract questions of any sort or kind living was pleasant and they proceeded to live reggie had been performing this precarious feat with admirable steadiness for just nineteen years nature had gifted him with a pleasant face and a healthy appetite had enabled him to show it to eminent advantage on the top of a tall body he preferred talking to working cricket to football and lying in bed to signing in at am in the morning he smoked a good many pipes every day and blew smoke rings creditably he played the piano a little but his friends did not encourage him to take the necessary practice whereby he might play it any better he was in fact perfectly normal which is always the best thing to be its a great bore our being beaten he said after a long pause during which he had succeeded in blowing one smoke ring through another we were the best side really of course we were although we are blessed with a goal keeper who hides behind the goal posts until a man has had his shot he stopped rather a hot one to day purely by accident he peeped out from the goal post too soon and it struck him in the stomach i hate being beaten by pemmer though i shouldnt have minded if wed lost to trinity the ground was in a filthy state too one couldnt get off reggie sighed ive got to write to my father to morrow he said and tell him my impressions of cambridge it will be a little difficult because i havent got any of course you havent only people in books have impressions describe the match to day im afraid it wouldnt interest him well describe kings chapel i might do that perhaps hes forgotten what it is like oh yes and i might describe some of the dons im expected to be very earnest you know and the worst of it is i dont know how do you suppose one will ever become a responsible being asked ealing no never said reggie emphatically i grow sillier and sillier every day well you cant get much sillier reggie shook his head you wait a year or two he said i dont suppose you can form the slightest impression of how foolish i can be if i like what are you going to do when you go down the lord knows said reggie i was considered remarkably bright for my age at one time long ago ages ago i dont suppose ive been considered bright for the last six years oh by the way theyve put me into the pitt how very imprudent of them yes there was a young man in the pitt well thats all its me you know ealing got up and stretched slowly and luxuriously i must go and change i believe one oughtnt to sit in wet things but if one does it frequently enough it doesnt seem to hurt one and the same remark applies to muffins i shall try sitting in a muffin said reggie thoughtfully i never thought of it before do are you going into hall to night yes unless you ask me to dinner i have no intention whatever of doing that said ealing then well both go into hall i propose to drink champagne out of a silver mug to make up for the tea out of a glass not what i wish but what i want as the babe said the other day when he ordered six pairs of silk pyjamas oh the babe has his points said reggie reggies rooms looked out on to a small court bounded on two sides by the new college buildings on one by that pellucid river from which as wordsworth might have said cambridge has borrowed its name and on the other by four or five big elm trees beyond these lay the back lawn growing a little rank just now with autumn rains and above that the main buildings of the college and the chapel which is quite worth describing even to the length of four sides of that smaller size of note paper which is found so eminently convenient a basis for the purpose of writing letters to relations his two rooms were on the third floor opening the one into the other and like all college rooms were very thoughtfully supplied with an outer door which could only be opened from the inside and by means of which the laborious student can shut himself off from sight and sound of the busy world around during reggies short stay at cambridge it had as far as he knew only been used once and on that occasion a playful friend mistaking its real use had shut him out having previously ascertained that he had lost the key this feat has at least the merit of simplicity and it appears to lose none of its fascination however constantly repeated inside they were furnished with a small bookcase occupied by dbutant looking classical books several low chairs which may best be described as rather groggy and had been taken on from the previous owner at a high valuation a piano of a harsh and astringent quality of tone but plenty of it several high chairs and two tables the smaller of these reggie preferred to call his working table the only explanation of which seemed to lie in the fact that somebody often sat on the edge of it when the chairs were full two or three school groups and a couple of engravings hung on the walls and the chimney piece was littered with things which reminded one of the delightfully vague word remnants and consisted of candlesticks pipes old letters loose matches an ash tray a clock which for the last month had been under the delusion that it was always ten minutes to four an invitation to play in the freshmans football match and another to see the dean at five minutes to seven a watch and watch chain sixpence a lawn tennis ball a small wooden doll in hideous nakedness no explanation forthcoming a pen and a cigarette it was a cold evening and reggie wandered in and out of his bedroom in a state of betwixt and between now clad only in a bath towel later on in a pair of trousers and socks in the fulness of time completely clothed it still wanted five or ten minutes to seven and he stood in front of the fire warming himself till hall time feeling in that deliciously half tired half lazy mood which is the inimitable result of violent exercise he rummaged aimlessly in the dbris on the mantel piece and suffering the deserved fate of idle hands found the deans note about which he had genuinely forgotten he gave vent to a resigned little sound about half way between a sigh and a swear took up his gown and left the room ii in fellows buildings king nine twa do you play them so whaes that a calling i dinna ken and i do not know whaes that a calling sae sweet on the border and one clear call for me tennyson those fellows of colleges who live in college are for obvious reasons debarred from the matrimonial state and should inspire greater respect in reflective minds than almost any other class of persons in this naughty world for the most part they combine the morality of married men with the innocence of ideal bachelors their lives are for nine months or so of the year lived in the sequestered shades of pious and ancient foundations unspotted by the world those who have relations fill their places in the domestic circle where their absence has no doubt rendered them doubly dear at christmas and easter or join those who have not and pass their long vacation on the lower slopes of the alps or at quiet little sea side places some of them visit cathedrals during their unoccupied months some the lakes few or none london or if london chiefly the reading room at the british museum but there are exceptions to the most desirable rules and even among fellows of colleges there are a few who are reported to know a thing or two on saturday night it often happened that fellows of kings asked their colleagues from other colleges to dine with them after dinner they sat in the combination room for an hour or so or they would break up into parties which spent the evening at one or other of the fellows rooms and indulged in the mild dissipation of whist at three penny points which they seemed to find strangely exhilarating one such party adjourned directly after dinner to the room of the dean mr collins who two hours before had remonstrated with reggie for not attending a larger percentage of early chapels or their equivalent to undergraduates he was scholastic and austere but among his own contemporaries he not infrequently relaxed into positive playfulness mr stewart a history tutor from trinity was one of his guests to night and mr longridge a dean of the same college another about mr longridge all that need be said at present is that in body he was insignificant and in mind incoherent but mr stewart was a more conspicuous person both bodily and mentally he was in fact one of the exceptions to the general run of his class and he was credited by report at least with knowing not only a thing or two but lots of things just now his long languid form attired altogether elegantly was spread over a considerable area of arm chair his feet rested on the fender and he was holding forth on certain subjects of the day about which he was perfectly qualified to speak the man with the incoherent mind was sitting near him listening with ill concealed impatience to his sonorous periods and getting in a word edgewise occasionally mr collins was busy attending to the wants of his guests and two of his friends from the same college were sitting together on the sofa resigned but replete the luxury of modern times mr stewart was saying is disgusting chartreuse please simply disgusting what business have men to clothe their floors in fabrics from persia their walls in other fabrics from cairo and algiers or stamped leather and paintings by turner and reynolds and and orchardson their lamp shades in lace and liberty fabrics lace and liberty sounds like a party catch word and leave their minds naked and unashamed i myself aim at a studious simplicity thank you i have brought my own cigarettes wont you have one they are straight from constantinople a studious simplicity i live at cambridge while my natural sphere is london and paris i get up at seven while nature bids me stay in bed till ten i mr longridge could not bear it any longer he sprang out of his chair as a cuckoo flies out of a cuckoo clock on the stroke of the hour and adjusted his spectacles well take the case of a man who say lived at oxford supposing or well take another case mr stewart took advantage of a momentary pause to continue yes of course very interesting he said a delightful town oxford a shadow of the romance of medivalism still lingers about its grey streets which is quite absent from the new red brick buildings of st johns college cambridge i remember walking there one morning with dear george meredith and your mention of oxford recalled to me what he said poor dear fellow he is the most lucid of men but as soon as he puts pen to paper he is like an elephant that is lost in a jungle and goes trumpeting and trampling along through wreaths and tangled festoons of an exotic style lord granchester was staying there at the time sir reginald bristow he was then i had the pleasure of speaking to his son just before hall remarked mr stewart in professional accents reggie is dear reggie up here how delightful i remember him six or seven years ago he was like one of raphaels angels what was it that george meredith said asked the incoherent man all in one word one of raphaels angels pursued mr stewart taking not the slightest notice a face like an opening flower the flower has a stem six feet high now remarked mr collins dear reggie and and is he as fascinating as ever mr collins laughed i have not known him long so i cannot say how fascinating he is capable of being and as a rule deans and undergraduates dont put out their full power of fascination in dealing with each other but whose fault is that said mr stewart in a slow unctuous voice surely we ought to be brothers dear elder brothers to the undergraduates i remember mr collins who was obviously sceptical about george merediths remark and hoped that stewart was going back to it brightened up and interrogated yes in an intelligent manner i remember said mr stewart still sublimely oblivious i remember that i myself used always to make friends dear friends of the undergraduates when i was dean if one of them did not attend chapel often enough as often that is as our odious regulations require i used to ask him to call for me on his way and we used to go to chapel together one had a rich lovely tenor voice i i forget his name and i think he is dead mr longridge laughed monosyllabically but unkindly it was very pleasant very pleasant indeed but to be dean brings one into the wrong relation with undergraduates said mr stewart and talking of music i had a charming time at bayreuth last year we had parsifal and tannhuser and the meistersingers tannhuser is the most wonderful creation like all of us but more successfully than most wagner welds into one harmonious whole the ugliness of sin and the beauty of holiness mr longridge there is no other word bridled the beauty of holiness continued mr stewart chewing and masticating his words so as to get the full flavour out of them a human soul capable of anything venusberg and rome are alike interludes to him he goes on his sublimely humorous way from venusberg to elizabeth from elizabeth to venusberg and neither produces any lasting effect and how supremely natural the end is he has left an almond rod at rome and because one of the pilgrims one of a dowdy crew of middle class pilgrims shows him an almond rod in blossom he rushes to the conclusion that it is his how illogical but how natural and he who has never had the courage of his opinions either at venusberg or rome is struck of a heap as they say in suburban places by the flowering almond rod and instantly gives up the ghost maskelyne and cooke could produce a bundle of flowering almond rods in half the time we pay five shillings to see them all tannhuser paid his life to see one he died of joy at the sight of that flowering almond rod and after all it was only artificial flowers twined round a stick well of course if you choose to look at it in that way ejaculated mr longridge my dear longridge said mr stewart very slowly there is only one way to look at things only one way not at all though you might very fairly say that there was only one man to look at in one way quot homines tot sententi dear old longridge said stewart with unctuous affection you might just as well say continued mr longridge that because there are people who are colour blind we none of us know green from red there was perhaps nothing in the world which mr longridge enjoyed so heartily as what he called a good sharp argument this usually consisted in his putting forward a great quantity of indefensible and irrelevant propositions himself and then proceeding to show how indefensible they were their irrelevancy needed no demonstration he was a man of mixed mind dear old longridge repeated stewart some people have the misfortune to be born colour blind and no doubt in the next world they will be extraordinarily keen sighted but until we have finished with this world and i have not we can leave colour blind people altogether out of the question can we not in fact i dont know how they found their way in some things are green others red and if you call them by their wrong names even your own friends must allow that you are no judge of colour mr longridge who was very near sighted seemed disposed to take this personally but because i differ from you in toto i may say that is no proof that i am colour blind you might just as well say well to take another instance to take another instance said mr stewart because you are sleepy that is no reason why i should go to bed in fact i will have just a glass more of chartreuse what a lovely colour it is a decadent abnormal colour the colour of a spoiled piece of soul fabric yes quite delicious i spent a fortnight once in the monastery at fcamp full of dear delightful ascetic monks i think they all put boiled peas in their shoes during the day which must be horribly squashy but they all drink chartreuse after dinner so they end happily dear impossible charles kingsley used always to abuse monks i suppose because he was tinged with asceticism himself but i fancy there is no real objection to their marrying monks marry nuns i think how delightful to receive an invitation card monk and nun stewart the two other fellows of kings had subsided into the background altogether and were discussing the chances of their various pupils in the next tripos they had both refused chartreuse and took their coffee in a mixture of half and half with hot milk the integral calculus on one side balanced an exceptional skill at greek iambics on the other and they prattled on politely and innocently it must be conceded that they felt but little interest in what they were talking about but their interest on all subjects was diminutive and bird like they pecked and hopped away but he showed me a copy of iambics the other day said one with two final cretics in it mr stewart caught the last words what an epigram that ought to make he said smiling broadly and benignly the insidious and final cretic i see him as a lean spare man with a cast in his eye its merely a false foot in greek iambics they are talking of said longridge breathlessly and a false foot continued stewart cunningly concealed by patent leather boots thank you longridge the picture is complete and i have a victor hugo class in my room at half past ten we are reading les misrables a a prose epic i must literally be going i should like to see a figurative going said mr longridge spitefully mr stewart turned on him with mild forbearance you can say you must be going and then stop he said good night good night a most pleasant evening there were now only four of them so at their hosts proposal they settled down to whist mr longridge enquired eagerly whether it was to be long whist or short whist but as no one had ever heard of either it is to be presumed that they played medium and it is certain they played mediocre whist mr longridge during the first deal demonstrated quite conclusively that whist markers could be used either for whist or backgammon or bzique always supposing you knew how to multiply by ten or with somewhat less ease for registering the votes in the present election this latter however appeared as far as it was possible to follow him to imply a knowledge of how to multiply by thirteen and divide by twenty nine a feat which all his hearers with the exception of the mathematician were hopelessly incapable of performing this however was no detraction whatever from the abstract value of such a discovery longridge was partner to mr campbell one of the hitherto silent guests and collins to currey who was cursed with the final cretic pupil and herein lay the sting of the affair for longridges studies in whist had got as far as the call for trumps while his partners knowledge was confined to a complete acquaintance with the ordinal value of individual cards collins however was a sound player and the only one present excepting longridge who knew what a call for trumps meant longridge consequently stripped his hand naked as it were for the sole benefit of his adversary the rest were as teiresias struck blind by the sight of five trumps unveiled with his habitual acumen the dean of trinity perceived this during the second rubber and without communicating his discovery as he was strongly tempted to do played the higher of two cards instead of the lower so persistently in the first round in order to deceive his adversary on the right that before the game was three deals old he had irrevocably revoked holding the knave and nine of clubs he played the higher of the two on to the queen third hand and deceived by his own acuteness supposed he had no more and trumped the second round whereby his adversaries went out a treble reggie and ealing meantime had spent a charming evening reggie had been pressed not to play the piano after hall and instead they had played billiards till just before ten and then gone round to malcolm street to come down to dessert at the babes dinner party as it was guy fawkess day their course so to speak was mapped out for them beyond possibility of error and reggie had the prospect of being exactly six shillings and eight pence poorer than he otherwise would have been at about on monday morning iii the babe o bitter world where one who longs to be recorded unforgiven bewitched and wild is called a child fit to be seen in any heaven hotchpotch verses the babe was a cynical old gentleman of twenty years of age who played the banjo charmingly in his less genial moments he spoke querulously of the monotony of the services of the church of england and of the hopeless respectability of m zola his particular forte was dinner parties for six skirt dancing and acting and the performances of the duties of half back at rugby football his dinner parties were selected with the utmost carelessness his usual plan being to ask the first five people he met provided he did not know them too intimately with a wig of fair hair hardly any rouge and an ingnue dress he was the image of vesta collins and that graceful young lady might have practised before him as before a mirror but far the most remarkable point about the babe considering his outward appearance and other tastes was his brilliance as a rugby football player he was extraordinarily quick with the ball his passing was like a beautiful dream and he dodged as was universally known like the devil it was a sight for sore eyes to see the seraphic smooth faced babe waltzing gaily about among rough bearded barbarians pretending to pass and doing nothing of the kind dropping neatly out of what looked like the middle of the scrimmage or flickering about in a crowd which seemed to be unable to touch him with a finger last night the babe had been completely in his element his dinner party consisted of a rowing blue a man who had been sent down from oxford a dean who was to preach the university sermon next day and was the babes uncle jack marsden a gentleman from corpus who had a very rosy chance so said his friends of representing cambridge against oxford at chess and himself later on reggie and ealing had come in who with the help of the rowing man broke both his sofas the gentleman from oxford had insisted to the obvious discomfort of the dean on talking to him about predestination a subject of which the dean seemed to know nothing whatever the chess man had played bzique with jack and the babe had presided over them all with infantine cynicism a little later on when the dean had gone away he had danced a skirt dance in a sheet and a night gown and they ended up the evening by what the babe called a set piece from his window consisting of a catherine wheel and four roman candles not counting the rocket which exploded backwards through the babes chandelier narrowly missing the head of the man from corpus whose chance of getting his chess blue would if it had hit have been totally extinguished in order to lend verisimilitude to the proceedings reggie had gone into the street and called oh h h h at intervals and as he had left his cap and gown in the babes room he was very promptly and properly proctorised the babe breakfasted next morning at the civilised hour of ten and observed with a faint smile that the rocket stick was deeply imbedded in the ceiling and he ate his eggs and bacon with a serene sense of the successful incongruity of his little party the night before the gentleman from oxford who was staying with him had not yet appeared but the babe waited for no man when he was hungry the furniture of his rooms was as various and as diverse as his accomplishments several of mr aubrey beardsleys illustrations from the yellow book clustering round a large photograph of botticellis primavera which the babe had never seen hung above one of the broken sofas and in his bookcase several numbers of the yellow book which the babe declared bitterly had turned grey in a single night since the former artist had ceased to draw for it were ranged side by side with butlers analogies mr sponges sporting tour and miss marie corellis barabbas it is however only fair to the babe to say that bishop butlers volume had been part of the set piece for his littlego and that he referred to miss corelli as the arch humourist of english literature a pair of dumb bells each weighing fifty six pounds stood by the fireplace but these the babe had never been known to use in order to further his muscular development he only rolled them over the floor with the patient look of one who had the destinies of the world on his shoulders whenever the lodger below played the piano it may be remarked that the two were not on speaking terms and herein said the babe when he explained the use of the dumb bells the evening before herein lies half the bitterness of human life he was pressed to explain further but only replied sadly so near and yet so far and showed how it was possible to imitate the experience of a sea sick passenger on the channel by means of that simple and i may add delicious fruit the common orange it was a most realistic and spirited performance and all that the dean could do was to ejaculate feebly do stop babe between his spasms of laughter the babe had finished his breakfast which he ate with a good appetite heartily before the gentleman from oxford appeared and proceeded to skim the sunday times when he did appear he looked a little disconsolately at the breakfast table and lifting up a dish cover found some cold bacon at which he blanched visibly and demanded soda water what did you eat for breakfast babe he asked the babe looked up apologetically im afraid i ate all the eggs and the bacon must be cold by now he said but ill send for some more no thanks wheres the tea the babe rang the bell itll be here in a moment i drank cocoa leamington finished his soda water and sat down there is no end to your greatness cocoa great scot my tongue is the colour of mortar im so sorry i feel quite well thanks will you have some enos fruit salts i know my landladys got some because she offered me them the other day when i had a cold heres your tea do you ever read the pink un its funny without being prudish leamington poured out some tea dont read babe its unsociable talk to me while i eat the babe put down the current copy of the sunday times and laid himself out to be pleasant there are some people coming to lunch at two he said i rather think i asked reggie poor reggie he got dropped on in a minute by the proggins oh yes and so is stewart do you know stewart hes a don at trinity and is supposed to be wicked i wish someone would suppose me to be wicked but im beginning to be afraid they never will you must lose your look of injured innocence or rather cultivate the injury at the expense of the innocence grow a moustache no one looks battered and world weary without a moustache i cant i bought some allens hair restorer the other day but it only smarted i wonder if they made a mistake and gave me allens antifat you dont look as if they had said leamington at least it doesnt look as if it had had much effect wouldnt it take not a bit said the babe i applied it night and morning to my upper lip and it only smelt and smarted i suppose you cant restore a thing that has never existed i think i shall be a clergyman because all clergymen cut their moustaches off and to do that you must have one i see but isnt that rather elaborate no means are elaborate if you desire the end enough said the babe sententiously i shall marry too because married people are bald and im sure i dont wonder so are babies not in the same way and dont be personal i cant think of any other means of losing the appearance of innocence suggest some youve been rusticated why dont you ive tried that and its no use but you dont know what i was going to say objected leamington i know i dont but ive tried it said the wicked babe ive even read the yellow book through from cover to cover and as you see framed the pictures by aubrey beardsley the yellow book is said to add twenty years per volume to any ones life not at all it has left me precisely where it found me whereas according to that as ive read five volumes i ought to be lets see five times twenty plus twenty a hundred and twenty i dont look it you know its no use your telling me i do because i dont i have no illusions whatever about the matter i wasnt going to tell you anything of the kind said leamington but you should take yourself more seriously i believe that is very aging the babe opened his eyes in the wildest astonishment why i take myself like gospels and epistles he said the fault is that no one else takes me seriously you would hardly believe he continued with some warmth that the other night i was proctorised and that when the proctor saw who i was hes a trinity man he said oh its only you go home at once babe it is perfectly disheartening i offered to let him search me to see whether i had such a thing as a cap or a gown concealed anywhere about me and the bull dogs grinned how can i be a devil of a fellow if im treated like that i should have thought a rugby blue could have insisted on being treated properly no thats all part of the joke shrieked the infuriated babe its supposed to add a relish to the silly pointless joke of treating me like a child and calling me babe ive never been called anything but babe since i can remember and when i try to be proctorised the very bull dogs come about me making mouths at me rough luck try it on again its a pure waste of time said the babe disconsolately i might go out for a drive with all the bed makers of this college in a tandem and no one would take the slightest notice of me besides i can never make a tandem go straight the leader always turns round and winks at me it knows perfectly well that im only the babe bless its heart i edited a perfectly scandalous magazine here last term you know every day during the may week it simply teemed with scurrilous suggestiveness it insulted directly every one with whom i was acquainted and many people with whom i was not it compared the vice chancellor to an old toothbrush and drew a trenchant parallel between the proctors and the town drainage it suggested that the antechapel of kings should be turned into a shooting gallery and the side chapels into billiard rooms it proposed that i should be appointed master of magdalen i forget why at this moment it contained the results of a plbiscite as to who should be vice chancellor for the next year and the under porter of kings got in easily with jack marsden as a bad second it proposed the substitution of dominoes and hopscotch i havent the least idea what hopscotch is but it sounds to me simply obscene for the inter university contests at cricket and rowing and that magazine said the babe dramatically rising from his chair and addressing primavera that magazine was welcomed welcomed madam by all classes the innocent lambs whose reputation i ought to have ruined came bleating after me and said how they had enjoyed it it sold by hundreds when it ought to have been suppressed people thought it funny whereas it was only hopelessly foolish and vulgar though i say it who shouldnt while those few people who had the sense to see how despicable the whole production really was told each other that it was only me me im almost sick of the word i was put in authority in the granta when i ought to have been sent down the vice chancellor asked me to dinner on the very day when i published a most infernal and libellous lampoon about him and i have already told you how the proctors treat me it is enough said the babe in conclusion to make one take the veil i mean the tonsure and dry up the milk of human kindness within one hear hear shouted leamington good old babe the babe glared at him a moment with wide indignant eyes and then went on rather shrilly look at reggie im older than he is at least i think so and any one with a grain of sense would say that i therefore ought to know better and what is excusable in him is not excusable in me but he goes and says oh in the street and he is treated as a dangerous character sent home and will be fined i might say oh till oscar browning got into parliament and do you suppose they would ever consider me a dangerous character not they here the babe laughed in a hollow and scornful manner they would treat me with that infernal familiarity which i so deprecate and say go home babe babe indeed the babes voice broke and he flung himself into his chair after the manner of sarah bernhardt and hissed out misrables comme je les dteste leamington applauded this histrionic effort and feeling a little better after breakfast lit a cigarette the maidservant came to clear breakfast away and as she left the room the babe resumed in the gentle melancholy tones which were natural to him if i thought it would do any good i would go and snatch a kiss from that horrid rat faced girl as she is carrying the tray down stairs but it wouldnt you know it wouldnt do any good at all she wouldnt complain to the landlady or if she did it would only end in my giving her half a crown besides i dont in the least want to kiss her i wouldnt do it if she gave me half a crown i wonder what george moore would do if he were me well ask stewart when he comes to lunch he is intimate with all notable people george moore is notable isnt he i fancy w h smith son boycotted him stewart said the other day that the emperor of germany was one of the nicest emperors he had ever seen thats nothing said leamington theres a don at oxford who has written a book called princes i have persecuted without encouragement the babe laughed a companion volume to stewarts monarchs i have met not that he has written such a book stewart is perfectly charming but he thinks a lot of a prince if he hasnt written monarchs i have met he ought to have we all ought to have done a lot of things we havent done said leamington we had a butler once said the babe who never would say the general confession because he said he hadnt left undone the things he ought to have done and it went against his conscience to say he had he got the sack soon after for leaving the door of the cellar undone and for getting drunk so he was undone himself when i grow up said the babe with less bitterness but returning like a burned moth to the sore subject no charge for mixed metaphors i shall live exclusively in the society of archdeacons perhaps they might think me wicked yet i dont know my uncle whom you met last night thinks im such a good boy and hes a dean i doubt if they would the other day some one sent a telegram to the archdeacon of basingstoke a man of whom he knew nothing except that he was a teetotaller and an anti vivisectionist saying fly at once all is discovered the archdeacon flew and has never been heard of since no one has the slightest idea where he has gone or what he had done you know you wouldnt fly babe if you were sent telegrams like that by the hundred how little you know me said the babe dramatically i should fly like fun dont you see if one flew ones character for wickedness would be established beyond all doubt i might send a telegram to myself telling me to fly then i should fly but leave the telegram lying about in a conspicuous position after a years absence i should return but my character would be gone beyond all hopes of recovery and the world would do me justice at last poor misunderstood babe why dont you go to oxford saying youve been sent down from cambridge what time do we lunch oh about two and its half past twelve already lets go round to the pitt this evening we will go to trinity chapel a little walk is very wholesome after breakfast besides i shall go in a bowler and perhaps we shall meet at proggins i shall insult him if we do iv vs blackheath for he was very fast and he ran and he passed and the sun and the moon and the stars tried to catch him by the tail but they one and all did fail and venus broke her nose gainst mars hotchpotch verses the babe hurt his knee playing against the old leysians and his language was aristophanic and savoured strongly of faint praise also one of the old leysians had grossly insulted him during the course of the game the babe was careering about with the ball behind their touch line attempting to get a try straight behind the goal posts instead of being content with one a reasonable distance off for he was fastidious in these little matters and liked to do things well when he was caught up bodily by one of the opposing team and carried safely out into the field again a roar of appreciative laughter and shouts of good old babe went up from all the field and the babes feelings were hurt he had the satisfaction of dropping a goal a little later on but he asked pathetically could aught atone before time was called he had hurt his knee and as already mentioned he was aristophanic for a few days the next match was against blackheath and the babe had not yet recovered sufficiently to play he had bought an inverness cloak so loud he said that you could scarcely hear yourself speak and a cross eyed bull pup in order to dispel that universal but distressing illusion about his childishness which so vexed his soul and he was going to lunch with reggie and look at the match afterwards bill sykes the bull dog was coming too in order to be seen with the babe by as many people as possible and his master drove to kings gate with his inverness and his bull dog and his seraphic smile in the best of tempers it was necessary to smuggle mr sykes as the babe insisted that strangers should call him through the court without his being seen and the babe hobbled along still being rather lame presenting a curious lopsided appearance which was caused by mr sykes who was tucked away beneath the inverness a confused growling sound issued at intervals from somewhere below his left arm drowning even the loudness of the inverness and the babe murmured encouragement and threats alternately the porter stared suspiciously at this odd figure as it passed but the serenity of the babes smile was as infinite as ever the babes hansom had been told to wait at the back gate of kings but it had apparently found waiting tedious and as there were no others about they had to walk mr sykes however took this opportunity to behave as the babe said like the dog of a real blood and had a delightful turn up with a mongrel gentleman of his acquaintance which did him much credit the game had not yet begun when they reached the corpus ground and both sykes and the babes cloak can hardly have failed to be noticed the babe hobbled about among the two teams who were kicking about before the game began and said it was much pleasanter looking on than playing and that he meant to give it up as it was a game more suited to savages than gentlemen two of the home team resented these remarks and removed him kindly but firmly beyond the touch line he and reggie had secured chairs towards the centre of the ground and it pleased the babe to affect a childlike ignorance of everything connected with the rules and regulations of rugby football and he kept up a flow of fatuous remarks look how they are throwing the ball about why do they do that reggie which side is getting the best of it look at that funny little man with a flag why do they all stop when he holds it up i suppose it must be the captain have they got any try downs yet or do you call them touches oh the balls coming over here i wish theyd take more care it might easily have hit me why dont they have a better one its got all out of shape it isnt a bit round mr sykes wants to play too what a darling bite it then how rough they are why did hargreaves stamp on that man so the effect of hargreaves stamping on that man was that he got the ball and a nice clear run he was playing three quarters on the right and when he got fairly off he was as fast as any man in england his weak point however was starting he could not start full speed as the babe did being heavy and a trifle clumsy but he got twenty yards clear now and making the most of it he was well off before the blackheath team realised what was happening the babes fatuities died away as hargreaves started and he stood silent a moment it was clear that there was a good opening to hand barring accidents the game was close to the university twenty five on the far side of the ground and the blackheath three quarters were for the moment much too close to the scrimmage it was impossible to get through even with the most finished passing on that side and hargreaves ran right across parallel to the goal disregarding the possibility of being collared in the centre of the ground opposite to the home goal but trusting to his own speed the outside blackheath three quarters came racing along running slightly back in order to tackle him as he turned but in a few moments it was clear that he was outpaced hargreaves ran clear round him as a yacht clears the buoy with a few yards to spare oh well run shouted the babe dont pass get in yourself hargreaves and the blackheath back were now close to each other about the level of the blackheath twenty five and nearly in the middle of the ground the varsity centre three quarters had run straight up the ground while hargreaves ran round and was now in a position to be passed to again but two blackheath three quarters were close to him then by a fatal error hargreaves wavered a moment instead of again trusting to his pace got tackled and in that moment of slack speed his own centre three quarters got in front of him he passed wildly and forward an appeal a whistle a flag and a free kick damn said the babe in a loud angry voice the game flickered about between the two twenty fives for the next ten minutes going fast and loose with a good deal of dribbling on the part of the forwards and a corresponding amount of self immolation on the part of the halves who hurled themselves recklessly on the ball in the face of the fastest rushes and seemed to the unaccustomed eye to be feverishly courting a swift and muddy death hargreaves made a few futile attempts to run through and failed egregiously half time was called shortly afterwards neither team having scored the babe hobbled out into the field to make himself unpleasant to his side mr sykes followed wheezing pathetically and the babes inverness cloak came in for renewed comments and reproof they are weak on the outside said the sage babe to hargreaves and a great man like you can run round as easy as perdition you ought to stand much wider and if you think you can get through the centre you are wrong stoddard could stop fifty of you good bye the blackheath team had come to the same conclusion as the babe and they kept the game tight they had quite realised that the varsity three quarters on the left was weak and that hargreaves on the right was abominably fast in consequence they did their best to screw the scrimmage round to hargreaves side so as to hamper him by not leaving him room to get off time after time his half fed him persistently and time after time he was unable to get round between the touch line and the forwards meantime the blackheath pack which were heavier and rather better together than cambridge were working their way slowly and steadily down the ground keeping the ball close and comfortable among them hargreaves again and again following the babes advice stood right away on the left of the scrimmage when it approached the right touch line but his vis vis as regularly stood close to him and embraced him affectionately but roughly as soon as the ball got to him and before he had time to pass but for the next quarter the game was very tight and with the exception of a couple of free kicks given for offside play among the blackheath forwards the ball rarely left the scrimmage even these were returned by the back into touch and the forwards settled down on the ball again like swarming bees the babe meantime had been insolent to the referee who was an old friend and also an old hand he had gone so far as to leave the game to take care of itself for a moment to tell the babe candidly and in a loud clear voice that he should be severely treated afterwards adding as a further insult of course we all know its only you the babe was furious but impotent the glory of the ulster and the bull pup was entirely neutralised but he soon forgot these insolences there were only ten minutes left and neither side had scored more than minor points to the unprofessional eye it seemed likely that they might go on playing for hours like this without either side scoring the blackheath forwards gained ground very slowly but this was made up for with tiresome monotony by the quick punting of the university halves whenever they got the chance the three quarters stood and shivered and the university back declared bitterly and audibly that he might as well have stopped at home but the professional babe knew better if once the ball came fairly out the three quarters would have a look in and for himself he placed his money on hargreaves and in defiance of law order and decorum he shouted his advice to the half who was playing substitute for him dont punt he shouted but pass the half at that moment was busy punting and the babe repeated his advice two minutes afterwards the half took it as an exceptional opportunity presented itself and passed to his centre three quarters and the babe stood on his chair centre ran a short way and passed to the left who passed back to centre and centre to right it was as pretty a piece of passing as one would wish to see on a winters day this was the moment for which the babe was waiting the field was broken up and hargreaves had the ball he ran they all ran he ran fastest there is nothing like simple language for epical events he got a try which was not converted into a goal but as no other points were scored cambridge won the match by one point to nil the babe and mr sykes went back to take their tea with reggie and ealing who had been playing the eton game joined them the babe ate three muffins with a rapt air and mr sykes drank his tea out of the slop basin like a christian he took cream and three lumps of sugar his idea of how to eat muffins was a little sketchy but otherwise be behaved charmingly but as the babe said to put pieces of half masticated muffin on the carpet while you drink your tea is a thing seldom if ever done in the best houses ealing himself eschewed muffin on the ground of its being bad training and the babe who held peculiar views on training proceeded to express them one does every thing best he said when one is most content personally i am most content when i have eaten a large lunch nobody could play rugger in the morning why simply because no one is in a good temper in the morning except those under vitalised people who are never in a bad one and who also never play games of course after a very large lunch one cannot run quite so fast but one is serene and serenity has much more to do with winning a match than pace yes another cup of tea please now hargreaves is most content when he has had a little bread and marmalade and water every one to his taste i hate water except when its a hot bath water is meant not to drink but to heat and wash in babe do you mean to say you have hot baths in the morning invariably when the weather is cold and a cigarette whatever the weather is i am no charles kingsley though i used to collect butterflies when i was a child but when you became a babe you put away childish things suggested ealing a malignant light beamed from the babes eye i ask you do babes have bull pups i know one who has i daresay hes an exception though when i was at a private school remarked the babe severely and a chap said a thing like that we used to call him a funny ass reggie shouted good old babe has the referee caught you yet he belongs to this college and he may be in any minute in fact i asked him to come to tea i dont know why he hasnt if you want me to go say so said the babe not a bit of it it was only for your sake i suggested it smoke the babe was limping about the room and came upon a set of chessmen i want to play chess he said chess is the most delightful game if you treat it as a game of pure chance you ought to move your queen into the middle of the board and then see what happens to reduce it to the level of a sum in advanced mathematics is a scandal and an outrage to calculate the effect of a move takes away all the excitement you may always calculate it wrong in that case it becomes a nuisance reggie will you play no ealing i cant i dont know the moves nor do i we should be about equal supposing you set two heathen chinese to play chess which would win is it a riddle the babe sank down again in his chair i dont know he said if it is i give up by the way what are you two chaps doing to morrow stop in bed till ten said reggie it being the day of rest chapel breakfast lunch pitt tea pitt sunday club do you belong to that i thought it was semi clerical yes we are all lay readers i went once said the babe we ate what is described as a cold collation then we all sat round and somebody made jokes and we all laughed i made jokes too but nobody sat round me there was a delightful decorous gaiety about the proceedings i think we sang hymns afterwards or else we looked at photographs of cathedrals i forget which hymns and photographs are so much alike o lord what do you mean asked reggie they are both like sunday evening and things which are like the same thing are like one another at eleven we parted the wicked old babe doesnt care for simple pleasures said ealing oh he knows a thing or two its always absurd for a lot of people to meet like that continued the babe the whole point of dining clubs ought to be to have a lot of members with utterly different tastes then you see they cant all talk about their tastes they cant all sit round and do one thing and consequently they all talk rot which is the only rational form of conversation if there is one thing i detest more than another it is cliques individually i love most of the members of the sunday club collectively i cannot even like them and the same thing applies to the athenum then why do you belong in order to go to chapel in a pink and white tie and also because i love the members individually i must go wheres bill come along under my ulster good bye you people v the work club for men must work kingsley reggie and ealing were working together they had formed a work club consisting only of themselves and it was to meet for the first time this morning in order to ensure the success of the first meeting they had had a heavy breakfast at a quarter to nine because as reggie said brain work is more exhausting than anything else after which they had played a little snob cricket in the archway between the two halves of fellows buildings in order to clear the brain until their names were taken by the porter and entered in the report book so they adjourned to the bridge for a little to finish their pipes and about a quarter to eleven sat down one at each side of reggies larger table with a box of cigarettes and a tobacco jar between them reggies alarum clock which had been induced to go two copies of professor jebbs dipus tyrannus at which they were both working one small liddell scott and a translation of the play as edited in mr bohns helpful series of classical authors in case professor jebb proved too free in his translation for the difficulties as reggie acutely observed of rendering greek both literally and elegantly cannot be over stated indeed it is to be feared that some of our best english scholars sacrifice literal rendering to the latter so ealing threw a sofa cushion at his head and the alarum clock was knocked over on the floor and instantly went off the noise was terrific and they had to stifle it in a college gown and put it in the gyp cupboard then they began for ten minutes or so there was silence and then ealing in an abstracted voice asked for the liddell scott and reggie not to be behind hand underlined one of professor jebbs notes with a purple indelible pencil the point was blunt and he tried to make it sharper by the aid of a dinner knife this only resulted in a gradual shortening of the pencil also the point became slightly notchier ealing finding it impossible to go on while this was being done had been watching the proceeding at first with deep interest which passed into a state of wild unreasonable impatience how clumsy you are he said at length here pass it to me fancy not being able to sharpen a pencil there is as every one knows only one individual in the world who can sharpen pencils and that is oneself the same remark applies to poking fires so reggie replied airily oh never mind old chap get on with your work i can do it beautifully but the pencil got rapidly shorter and in order to prove to his own satisfaction that nobody else in the world could do it he passed it over to ealing with the dinner knife his fingers were purple and should have been so indelibly but he hopefully retired into his bedroom to see if it could be washed off it was clear at once to ealing that reggies method was altogether at fault and he rough hewed the pencil again so as to be able to set to work properly then the clock on the mantelpiece which had been set going after the alarum became derelict struck eleven and reggie returned from his bedroom of course that clock is fast said ealing its ten minutes slow why should you think it was fast we must have been working longer than i thought we had breakfast at half past eight and we began working almost immediately after didnt we yes we knocked up a bit in the arch you know only about ten minutes i should say we had set to work well before ten perhaps we did said reggie but i havent got through much yet hows the pencil getting on oh pretty well but you went the wrong way about it at first there wont be much left to write with will there asked reggie looking at it doubtfully it will last you for weeks with proper care said ealing i think i never saw so blunt a knife why havent you got a proper knife reggie got up from the table and strolled across to the window and looked out be quick old chap he said i cant go on till its ready im in the middle of underlining something he saw an acquaintance below and called to him the work clubs started this morning he shouted were getting on beautifully confused sound from below inaudible to ealing yes hes just sharpening my pencil isnt it kind of him he says hes getting on with it pretty well murmur no not very far but im in the middle of a chorus and im reading jebbs notes and marking them murmur oh hours ever since about half past nine or so murmur what murmur yes jebbs not literal enough for me i like to get at the real meaning of oh the sofa cushion flew out of the window and lay on the grass below when reggie turned round ealing was absorbed in his book wheres the pencil asked reggie there isnt any said ealing well i must go and pick that cushion up what a lot of time youve made me waste also go to severss and buy a new pencil i cant work without this is all the thanks i get said ealing bitterly no im awfully obliged to you but it hasnt done me much good you know you see you acted with the best intention which is always fatal wheres my cap i should think you could borrow a pencil said ealing reggie considered a moment with his head on one side i think not it would be better to get one of my own then i shall have one you see come with me the two went down together as the cushion was lying on the grass it was necessary to take shots in turn at reggies open window to avoid going upstairs again this was much more amusing but it took a little longer than the other would have done and the university clock struck half past eleven in a slow regretful manner the successful shot about which an even sixpence was laid was made by ealing and they crossed kings parade to buy a pencil as they got to the lodge they were further gratified by the sight of the babe in the road opposite on a bicycle which he rode exceedingly badly and with a curious swoopy wobbly motion mr sykes trotted along at a distance of some twenty yards off with the air of not belonging to anybody thoroughly ashamed of his master they called to the babe and he being rash enough to try to wave his hand to them ran straight into the curbstone opposite kings gate and dismounted hurriedly stepping into a large puddle his face was flushed with his exertions but as he wrung the water out from the bottom of his trousers he said genially this is dry work though it doesnt look it a small whiskey and soda reggie would not hurt me no doubt you have such a thing in your room what about bill sykes the babe thought for a moment and mopped his forehead but in a few seconds a smile of solution lighted his face william shall be chained to the bicycle he said thus no one will steal the bicycle for fear of william and william will not venture to run away as he wouldnt be seen going about the streets with a bicycle in tow for anything he despises the bicycle i can hardly make him follow come here darling but mr sykes required threats and coaxing from the first so the babe said he was utterly opposed to the idea of the bicycle and had when he thought himself unobserved been seen to bite it maliciously it struck a quarter to twelve the babe was in a peculiarly sociable humour this morning and after a whiskey and soda a cigarette as he remarked would not be amiss and it was not till he had smoked two and been told with brutal plainness that he was not wanted in the least that reggie discovered that he had forgotten to buy his pencil this necessitated his and ealings making another journey to kings parade and the babe who bore no malice whatsoever at being told to go away took an arm of each and insisted in walking across the grass in the hard convincing light of noonday it was now seven minutes past twelve and opposite the fountain they met the provost at the sight of whom the babe assumed his most affable manner and they talked together very pleasantly for a minute or two indeed as he remarked as they went on their way this little meeting should quite take the sting out of the fact that the porter of your colleges has just retired into his hole in the gate with the object no doubt of reporting you both for walking across the grass and as you have already been reported for playing squash this will make twice bill sykes meantime had been the object of much attention on the part of the casual passers by and he was sitting there chattering with impotent rage the centre of a ring of people in the humiliating position of being chained to a bicycle which he despised and detested at the sight of the babe however he forgot for the moment about the bicycle jumped up and tried to run towards him thus it was not unnatural that the bicycle toppled heavily over onto the top of him mr sykes was very angry the bell rang loudly and one handle of the bicycle was bent mr sykes was released and the babe who was not expert at mounting though he said he was the very devil when he got going hopped slowly down kings parade for a hundred yards or so with one foot on the step making ineffectual efforts to get into the saddle there seemed to be no reason to suppose that he would ever succeed but about opposite the north end of the chapel he accomplished this feat and after describing two or three graceful but involuntary swoops to the right and left secured the treadles and settled comfortably down into one of the tram lines at this moment the tram came round the corner by st marys and the bicycle with its precious burden seemed doomed to instant annihilation the babe however got off just in time and consoled himself by swearing at the driver and he disappeared among the traffic of trinity street still hopping its like the white knight riding said ealing look sharp reggie with that beastly pencil its struck a quarter past between one thing and another it was creditable that they were ready to begin work again at half past twelve reggie finished underlining his note the point of which he could not quite understand and so put a query in the margin and ealing went back to the word he was looking out in liddell scott an hour and a quarter before ten minutes later reggie observed that the babe had forgotten his cover coat which was lying on a chair and they debated with some heat whether it had better be taken to him at once eventually they tossed up as to who should do it ealing lost the toss and they both jumped up with alacrity its a beastly nuisance when one has just settled down to work again he said i won remarked reggie and i am going by jove theres that varsity clock striking a quarter to one here lets both go its no use working for a quarter of an hour one cant do anything in a quarter of an hour and i must lunch at one as im playing footer all right of course we work after tea for two hours more as we settled that will make five and one more after hall and six hours steady work a day said reggie cheerfully is as much as is good for any man i begin not to attend after i have worked really worked you know for six hours vi the babes picnic row brothers row the stream runs slow we dont know how to row and the oars stick so light blue lyrics the babe was no waterman and he never pretended to be but this did not prevent his getting up a quiet picnic on the upper river one delightful afternoon towards the end of may there were only to be four of them not counting mr sykes though it was impossible not to count mr sykes the others being reggie ealing and jack marsden marsden who had once when a freshman been coached on the river by an angry man in shorts and had been abandoned as hopeless after his first trial was naturally supposed by the babe to be an accomplished oarsman and to have probed to its depths the nature of boats and oars and stretchers so he was deputed to find a boat which held four people several hampers and a dog and illustration trinity bridge from the backs which was warranted not to shy or bolt and to be quiet with children it was understood that the babe was not going to row or steer his office being merely to provide food for them all and if possible to prevent mr sykes from leaping overboard when they passed the bathing sheds and biting indiscriminately at the bathers whom for some reason of his own he regarded with peculiar but perfectly ineradicable disfavour the babe had taken him up the river only the week before but opposite the town sheds sykes had been unable to restrain himself had jumped off the boat into the water and chased to land a bland and timid shopkeeper to whom the babe owed money so it looked as if it was a put up job the man had regained the steps of the bathing shed only just in time to save himself from being pinned in the calf of the leg the babe and jack were to start from the raft by trinity at three and pick up reggie and ealing opposite kings they were then to row up to byrons pool so called because there is no reason to suppose that byron was not extremely fond of it bathe and have tea and afterwards go a mile or so farther and have dinner the babe who just now was gated at ten confidently hoped to be home at or before that hour on the sole ground that napoleon had once said there was no such word as impossible they paddled quietly up to the mill just above the town and here it was necessary to haul the boat over the bank separating the upper river from the lower the babe who was beautifully dressed in white flannels yellow boots and a straw hat with a new riband courteously declined giving the smallest assistance to the others but watched the operation with interest and apparent approval in consequence of which he was advised by reggie who had got hot and rather dirty with his exertions to drop that infernally patronising attitude here too mr sykes first sniffed the prey for he had caught sight of the bathers at the town sheds across the fields and was trotting quietly off in their direction secretly licking his lips but outwardly pretending that he was merely going for a little airy walk on his own account the babe had to run after him and haul him back for he affected to hear neither whistling nor shouting and on his return he kept smelling suspiciously at the legs of casual passers by as if he rather suspected that they were going to bathe too though the lower river is one of the foulest streams on the face of the earth the upper river is one of the fairest it wanders up between fresh green fields bordered by tall yellow flags loosestrife and creamy meadow sweet all unconscious of the fate that awaits it from vile man below pollarded willows lean over the bank and listen to the wind and here and there a company of white poplars the most distinguished of trees come trooping down to the waters edge the stream itself carpeted with waving weeds strolls along clear and green from the reflection of the trees troops of bleak poise and dart in the shallows or shelter in the subaqueous forests and the babe said he saw a trout a statement to which no importance whatever need be attached looking back across a mile of fields you see the pinnacles of kings rise grey and grave into the sky and in front granchester with its old fashioned garden cradled houses presided over by a church tower on the top of which as a surveyor once remarked there is a plus sign which is useful as a fixed point nestles in a green windless hollow but bill like gallio cared for none of those things he knew perfectly well that they were going to pass the town bathing place very shortly and after half a mile or so more of uninteresting river the university bathing place the babe had taken him up here once when he had bathed himself and though mr sykes realised that he must not bite his master whatever foolish and ungentlemanly thing he chose to do he was very cold and reserved to him afterwards but he meant to behave exactly as he pleased at the town bathing place and a hundred yards before they got there he was standing in the bow of the boat uttering short malignant growls the babe however pulled him back by the tail and muffled him up in four towels and mr sykes rolled about the bottom of the boat and from within the towels came sounds of deep dissatisfaction just as if there were a discontented bull pup in the middle of them beyond the town bathing place stands a detached garden with bright flower beds cut out in a lawn of short green turf here the babe conceived a violent desire to land and have tea which he was not permitted to do and above that runs a stretch of river very properly known as paradise seeing which the babe had a fit of rusticity and said he would go no farther but live evermore under the trees with mr sykes and grow a honey coloured beard he would encamp under the open sky and on fine afternoons would be seen sitting on the river bank dabbling his feet in the water and playing on a rustic pipe made of reeds he would keep a hen and a cow and a bed of strawberries and it should be always a summer afternoon indeed had not a water rat been seen at the moment which compelled him to throw mr sykes overboard to see whether he could catch it which he could not there is no knowing what developments this rustic phase would have undergone so they went slowly on making a small detour up to the granchester mill where the water came hurrying out cool and foamy and where the babe asked an elderly man who was fishing intently on the bank whether he had had any bites which seemed to infuriate him strangely for he was fishing with a fly drifted down again under a big chestnut tree all covered with pyramids of white blossoms and turned up the left arm of the river the water was shallower here and now and then gravelly shoals appeared above the surface they frequently ran aground and made no less than three futile attempts to get round a sharp corner where the stream running swiftly took the nose of the boat into the bank and the babe swore gently at them all and told them to mark the finish and get their hands away a long lane of quiet shallow water leads to the tail of the pool and here the river spreads out into a broad deep basin grey sluice gates flanked with red brick form the head of it and on one side stretches out a green meadow on the other there rises out of an undergrowth of hazel and hemlock a copse of tall trees where the nightingales always omit to sing they ran the boat in at the edge of the copse and reggie lighted the spirit lamp to boil the kettle for tea while the babe tied up mr sykes lest he should forget himself at the sight of four bathers among sensuous pleasures bathing on a hot day stands alone and byrons pool is in the first flight of bathing places there are some who prefer romney weir and say that bathing is nought unless you plunge into a soda water of bubbles some think that the essence of bathing is a mere pickling of the human form in brine and are not happy except in the sea to others the joie de baigner consists of flashing through the air much as m dor has pictured satan falling down from heaven but in byrons pool the reflective or what we may call the garden bather is well off he has clean water deep to the edge a grassy slope shadowed by trees to dry on and a boat to take a header from even mr stevenson a precisian in these matters would allow that the imagination takes a share in such a cleansing and by the time they were dressed the kettle was boiling and fortune smiled on them the babe refused however to stir before he had drunk four cups of tea and in consequence the kettle had to be boiled again besides said he mr sykes hasnt had his second cup it was generally felt that this was more important than the babes fourth cup and reggie filled the kettle the babes pensive he said what is it babe i dont know sometimes i get pensive on fine days or on wet evenings but it doesnt usually last long i think i want to fall in love well its may week next week one is always supposed to fall in love with each others sisters in may week remarked the babe with a fine disregard of grammar but the sisters either die of consumption or else the dean snaps them up and so it doesnt come off besides one so seldom does what one is supposed to do not often byron was supposed to bathe here for instance and you are supposed to be in by ten to night babe napoleon said began the babe dry up why did they gate you for repeated warnings i believe i never asked them to warn me they go and warn me said the babe getting a little shrill and then they go and gate me for it i have been allowed no voice whatever in the matter what did they warn you about oh it was bill and the bicycle between them and the time and the place life is a sad business and mine is a hard lot you are a bad lot suggested jack jack for gods sake dont be funny said ealing i thought the babe wanted a little cheering up i know he likes being called a bad lot he isnt really it is quite true said the babe in a hollow voice i have tried to go to the devil and i cant it is the most tedious process virtue and simplicity are stamped on my face and my nature i am like queen elizabeth i was really cut out to be a milkmaid i dont want to get drunk or to cultivate the lower female the more wine i drink the sleepier i get i have to pinch myself to keep awake and i should be sleeping like a dead pig long before i got the least intoxicated even then if you woke me up i could say the most difficult words like ranjitsinghi without the least incoherence and as for the lower female well i had to wait at the station the other day for half an hour so i thought it was a good opportunity to talk to the barmaid at the refreshment room so i ordered a whiskey and soda and called her miss i did indeed what a wicked babe i did call her miss miss i tell you shouted the babe then i said it was a beautiful day and she said yes dear she called me dear and i submitted i didnt throw the whiskey and soda at her i didnt call for help or give her in charge i determined to go through with it she was a mass of well matured charms and she breathed heavily through her nose round her neck she had a massive silver locket on with pizgah or kibroth hataavah or jehovah nisi upon it decree nisi suggested ealing she looked affectionately at me continued the babe and a cold shudder ran through me she asked me if i would treat her to a glass of port port at a quarter past four in the afternoon i said by all means and she pulled a sort of lever the kind of thing you put a train into a siding with and out came port which she drank then she said smilingly avent seen you for a long time which was quite true as id never set foot in the place before and she wont see me again for an equally long time i waited there ten minutes ten whole ghastly minutes and the words froze on my tongue and the thoughts in my brain for the life of me i could not think of another thing to say she continued to smile at me all the time she smiled for ten minutes without stopping and so we parted the kettle is boiling reggie the babe mixed mr sykess second cup for him and drank his fourth it is no use he said i am irredeemably silly and i have no other characteristic whatever my golden youth is slipping from me in the meantime reggie shouted the babe thinks he is growing old we dont agree with him of course he is old in everything else but not in years babe if youre ready well go on weve got to haul the boat over here the babe jumped up with sudden alacrity all right mr sykes and i will get out we shall only be in the way come on bill no babe said jack you shirked before you shall at least carry the hampers i shall do nothing of the kind said the babe with dignity and on this point he was quite polite but perfectly firm they rowed a mile or so farther up and the babe selected a suitable place for dinner at the edge of a hayfield and under a willow tree and a smile of kind indulgence towards the world in general began to overscore his fruitless regrets of the afternoon it was after eight when they began dinner and the babes commissariat was plentiful and elaborate the only dish that failed to give satisfaction was the toasted cheese with which he insisted they should finish dinner it was made in the tea kettle and when melted poured out through the spout on to biscuits mr sykes and the babe alone attempted to eat it and mr sykes who ate less than the babe was excessively unwell shortly afterwards but for that said the babe drinking chartreuse out of a tea cup i blame the lobster the moon as big as a bandbox was just rising clear of the trees and the babe produced cigars for mine he said is one of those rare generous natures that does unto others what it would not do unto itself it all comes in the catechism i will thank any one for a simple paper cigarette speech said ealing as stewart the babe bowed and began drawling out his words in a low slow musical voice mr sykes and gentlemen he said the may week is upon us and we like the cambridge review are at the end of another year of university life and thought some of us most of us in fact have experienced for two years the widening influence and varied duties which are inseparable from the minds of any of those who embark upon the harvest of university curriculum with any earnestness of purpose or seriousness of aim i think in fact i am right in believing that my friend mr reginald bristow alone to continue a few of my less mixed metaphors has put out only a years space upon the sea of those special features which mark the career and are the hinge of the prospects of those miners after perfectly useless knowledge who seek to increase their general ignorance among the purlieus of alma mater some of us have failed in attaining the objects of our various ambitions and i am happy to say that none of us have really tried to do so we have none of us gone to the devil and he with characteristic exclusiveness has kept aloof from us all cheers we none of us play cricket for the university though i once knew a man who got his extra square at chess he was a dear boy but he is dead now and there is not the slightest fear that anything will prevent us from being unable to fail in obtaining a very respectable place in our triposes yes the may week which occurs in june and lasts a fortnight spoken of i may say sung of in the pages of the junior dean and the fellow of trinity is upon us personally i detest the may week and i am subscribing to the grace testimonial fund simply and solely because i abhor the boat procession but before long our stately chapels and storied urns cheers will echo to the sound of girlish laughter and maternal feet gentlemen i thank you from the bottom of my heart for the very sincere way in which this toast has been received and am happy to declare that the institution is now open and the meeting adjourned sine die going home the babe had to stand in the bows to look out for snags and shoals he carried a lantern in his hand by the light of which he scrutinised with agonised intentness the dark surface of the water just above byrons pool the boat ran into a sunken tree trunk and the babe and his lantern plunged heavily into the water so he dressed himself in the tablecloth and his appearance was inimitable he did not stop in cambridge for the may week vii the babes sapping lo when an oyster succulent and tender leagued with lemon courted by cayenne makes its inevitable sweet surrender delicately dies it knows not why or when could aught atone pathetically asked he he whom ye wot to find that unaware oysters would be indubitably nasty natives or not because july is here st swithin the babe spent june and the first half of july in london he painted his bicycle white with mr aspinalls best enamel and presented a very elegant appearance on it every morning in battersea park the elections were on and his father who represented the conservative interests of a manufacturing town in the north of england was absent from london in the hopes of representing them again but party questions did not interest his son and the babe reflecting that whether the liberals or conservatives governed the country battersea park would still be open to him and his bicycle pursued his calm course on a moderately evenly balanced wheel so the babe had a commodious house in princes gate at his disposal for he was the only child and his mother who was a keener politician even than his father accompanied the latter on his political errands it occurred to him that he might turn an honest penny by letting the whole of the first floor for a week or two after the manner of mr somerset when he found himself in possession of the superfluous mansion but after some consideration he dismissed this as an unworthy and inconvenient economy and telegraphed to reggie to leave cambridge and the may week to take care of themselves and join him reggie had kept his term so he obeyed taking with him several classical books for the babe so he said in his telegram meant to sap the babes sapping was conducted on highly original principles he got up at eight in order he said to get a long morning had a cup of tea and then took his bicycle with him in his mothers victoria to battersea park where he rode till ten and then had breakfast he got back to princes gate about eleven in the victoria which waited for him at the park had a bath and dressed and usually went off to lords where he watched cricket till lunch time from the top of the pavilion and if the match was interesting stopped on till about five he then went to the bath club where he bathed and had tea returning home in time to dress for dinner which he usually took at a friends house the evening was spent at a theatre or a music hall and he finished up if possible at a dance if he had no dance to go to he read the evening paper at a club and went to bed in fact as he explained to reggie who arrived one evening about seven we shall lead a simple and strenuous life even in the midst of this modern babylon the bicycle and the bath club will minister to the needs of the body and our minds will minister to each other we take our dinner to night at home and after dinner it would be rash not to see miss cecilia loftus she can dance like fun i hope you have brought some books for otherwise you will have nothing to do when i am working its time to dress i see my father made four speeches yesterday his energy is perfectly amazing we will send for the evening paper for there are things of overwhelming interest in it i am told apart from politics the programme at the pavilion waned in interest after the performance of miss cecilia loftus and about eleven the babe proposed an adjournment it was a warm clear night and they started back walking along piccadilly instead of taking a hansom the streets were full and characteristically london in other words they were crowded with all sorts and conditions of men and women who eyed one another with suspicious reserve in paris the birds of night look at each other with friendly interest in london with mistrust and enmity the babe was in an expansive mood and like byron he bitterly lamented his own loneliness in the crowd here am i he said a young man of pleasing manner and amiable disposition and i feel like a solitary wayfarer in the desert of sahara when the four men in the new arabian nights left prince florizels smoking divan and plunged into the roaring streets they were engulfed by strange adventures before they had gone a hundred yards the lady of the superfluous mansion annexed one the fair cuban another the man with the chin beard a third what could be more delightful and yet i might walk the streets till the crack of doom and the archangels would have to send me home at the last still adventureless poor babe said reggie but perhaps every one else is in the same plight perhaps they are all longing for you to speak to them i dont think so said the babe they seem to me supremely indifferent as to whether i speak to them or not what are we to do reggie the night is yet young but we are growing old i think a little supper four or five dozen native lobsters as mrs nickleby suggested would not hurt us i hear that there is a most commodious restaurant at the savoy hotel it would be well to be certain on that point we are walking in the wrong direction but we will do so no longer let us take a hansom nothing will happen to us but we will give this wicked world one more chance we will walk back across leicester square it is supposed to be the fountain head of all adventures and the home of all adventurers we will loiter there a few moments what sort of adventures do you want babe asked reggie why thats exactly what i couldnt tell you said the babe the point of an adventure is that it is absolutely unexpected if i could tell you what i wanted it would cease to be unexpected and therefore cease to be an adventure if you know what you are going to do it is no adventure but its no use unexpected things never happen we will take a cab and eat oysters perhaps the oysters will be stale and if so it will be a kind of adventure for they are invariably fresh at the savoy the babe selected a table in the balcony opening out of the restaurant below they could see the long gaslit line of embankment curving gently towards westminster and the river flowing turbidly out with the ebbing tide in the middle distance the bridge of charing cross with one great electric lamp high in the air crossed to the surrey side and every now and then a train shrieked across under the glass arch of the station in the street below there jingled by from time to time a hansom noiseless except for the bell and the sharp cut ring of the horses hoofs a party of shrill voiced americans took a table near them and discussed the relative merits of english and american cars with passionate partisanship there were of course no oysters to be had as it was june and native devilled kidneys had to take their place tired looking waiters flitted noiselessly about and the babes face caught from the kidneys a livelier animation to morrow he said we will go even unto the oval and watch the gentlemen and players it is strange that to play cricket is the most doleful of human pursuits and to watch it one of the most delightful when i grow up i shall keep twenty two men who shall play cricket before me as salome danced before herod they shall play a perpetual match which shall never come to a world without end amen have some more kidneys reggie a few of our small kidneys would not hurt you waiter bring some more kidneys kidneys are not attractive to the eye but the proof of them is in the eating i eat them because they are so comfortable as the psalmist says by the way has sir john lubbock put the eating of kidneys among his pleasures of life i shall write a book called the sorrows of death as a companion volume do and have it set to music by mendelssohn mendelssohn is dead and the kidneys are dead said the profane babe hullo theres stewart he looks like a man out of the yellow book by aubrey beardsley i wish i could look as if aubrey beardsley had drawn me shall i ask him to supper reggie i wonder what hes doing at the savoy but mr stewart had got a cabinet minister in hand just for the present and it was half an hour or so before he joined them even then it took him ten minutes to get through the amiability of cabinet ministers before descending to more sublunary topics but when he descended as the babe said afterwards he came down with a run and talked about music halls and other things he was most sympathetic with the babes misfortune in being unable to stop up for may week and inveighed against the government and management of the university generally it is incredible to me he said perfectly incredible that so much pedantry and narrowness can be compressed into so small a place there is not a single one of my colleagues whom i could call a man of the world i was saying just now to my dear friend abbotsbury who has been very strongly urging me to stand for cambridge in parliament that i am really quite unfit perfectly unfit to represent the university i know nothing whatever about my colleagues and i disapprove of all i know of them take your own case you are of years of discretion my dear babe and if you choose to dress in a tablecloth no one has any right to prevent you they wouldnt have any right to stop you if you chose to dress in two less right in fact im sure you looked charming in a tablecloth why should the dean of your college exercise jurisdiction over your dress he is no prince regent for he dresses himself in a cake hat and a tail coat which is perhaps the least becoming style of dress which can be conceived yet he isnt sent down for it why should he be allowed to make the great court of trinity hideous and you be sent down for for making it beautiful the babe did a skirt dance down malcolm street remarked reggie and it was a windy night well the babe isnt to blame if it is a windy night said mr stewart they had probably been praying for wind in st marys though the only time in my life that i attended a university sermon there was plenty of wind the sermon was preached by a black missionary who i think said he came from iceland which i dont believe he literally swept us away in a hurricane of inconsequent appeal really to assume that the babe is responsible for the wind is almost profanity what a delicious night it quite makes me think of the feasts of tiberius at capri the air is as soft as the air of naples and all the waiters here as at capri are made in germany germany itself i believe is getting gradually depopulated and i m sure i dont wonder yes i am staying here for a day or two there is an expensive simplicity about the savoy which almost lets me forget for the time the pompous cheapness both literal and literary of university towns oxford is no better dons think about croquet and triposes at cambridge and about moderations and lawn tennis at oxford it is six of one and five and a half of the other and the cuisine of the college kitchens is enough to make savarin turn in his grave you order melted butter and they bring forth milk in a crockery dish i thought you were devoted to cambridge said reggie im sure ive heard you say so dear reggie let me ask you never to remember anything i say but it is true that i am devoted to what i consider to be the raison dtre of cambridge that is the undergraduates with their fresh bright lives and their insouciance their costumes of tablecloths and their frank contempt for the class to which i have the misfortune to belong that is why i always go up in the long dons for the time are in eclipse it is like a whole holiday i am going there next week to stop for a month or so i hope you are both coming yes said the babe we are both going up to work i am to go in for a tripos in history instead of a pass i had a short and painful interview with my father about it why are fathers so curt do you suppose i shall get through a tripos remarked mr stewart is a form of self mutilation to go in for a tripos if you are not by nature tripical if i may coin a word and i may tell you that it is to your credit that you are not my dear babe implies a sacrifice of other branches of your nature why cannot fathers be content to let their sons be and not do no one yet has ever been able to tell me of any good thing that comes out of triposes except that it keeps the examiners to their rooms for three weeks afterwards but they come out like pigmies refreshed with small beer and talk about quadratic calculus and deliberative genitives with redoubled vigour the test which triposes apply discovers whether the candidates are possessed of a little knowledge and so are dangerous things if they helped them to realise the beauty of ancient athens or the picturesqueness of the french revolution it would be a different matter and i as i understood longridge to do the other day at a college meeting should advocate having a tripos once a week and twice on sundays but all they do is to instil into the minds of the undergraduates a confused and it may be an incorrect idea that all athenians were as great a bore as thucydides and spoke as bad greek and that there is a grave doubt whether after all marie antoinette died by the guillotine and was not carried off by an attack of acute old age at the age of eighty seven even if it was so and it is far from certain why tell any one about it history rightly considered is a great and wonderful romance and the methods employed at places of education is to render sterile all the germs of romance it contains and condense the residue of facts into the smallest possible compass and mr stanley weyman then proceeds to write reliable blue books about them which his publisher libellously advertises as new novels though they are neither new nor novel one of my colleagues just before the tripos circulated among his pupils a half sheet of paper not very closely printed but that infernal half sheet contained all the procedure of the athenian law courts and if learned by heart quite unintelligently as he recommended would insure full marks on any question that might be set on the subject i had the misfortune to be with him when one of his pupils returned from the examination and he literally danced for joy all over the combination room though he is a stout man when he saw that three questions out of nine could be completely answered from his repulsive little half sheet and the tripos in the face of these revolting details is called a test of a mans ability and goes a long way to win him a fellowship you my dear babe are a man of far more liberal education than that lamentable colleague of mine though i may say in answer to your question that i would only take very long odds if i had to bet on your chance of getting through i got through my last mays remarked the babe in self defence yes but without incriminating myself my dear boy i must remind you that i looked over at least three of your papers and the marks i gave you were more for your capability of acquiring romantic and delightful knowledge and for a certain power of giving plausible and voluminous answers to questions of which it was obvious you knew nothing whatever than the actual knowledge your papers displayed however if you come down to little half sheets of useless and absurd facts no doubt you will be able to get through and it is upon that that i would take only very long odds from what i know of you i do not think you will come down to that i am delighted to hear you are coming up in the long and we will read some charming french memoirs together they are much more amusing and much more picturesque than zolas tedious pictures of the second empire reggie you are classical are you not read mark and learn the phdrus and the symposium the former you should read on the upper river under a plane tree if possible the latter after dining wisely and well in your rooms and you will know more of the essential greek than all mackintyres horrid little half sheets could ever teach you then do you think the tripos is perfectly useless and valueless asked the babe absolutely so and what makes it more ridiculous is that it is not even ornamental most useless things have some beauty or charm about them the tripos alone as far as i know has none i have only done one thing in my life of which i am thoroughly ashamed and that is that i took a first in my tripos mackintyre of course did the same it is the thing in his life he was senior classic i think of which he is most proud however to do him justice i believe that of late years what is called the philatelic society has usurped most of his leisure time no it has nothing to do with telepathy it means loving things that are a long way off and is specialised to apply to collections of postage stamps to me the word denotes distance lends enchantment to the view the babe was continuing to eat strawberries with a pensive air while mr stewart spoke and having finished the dish he looked round plaintively and reggie caught his eye you mustnt eat any more babe he said its after twelve and were going out at eight to morrow and we have to get back to princes gate the babe sighed mr sykes will be waiting up for us he said i suppose we ought to go he will lose his beauty sleep illustration the backs viii a game of croquet oswald speak to me of this game croquet odo it is the game of kings old play so the babe took reggies queen which for the last eight moves had led a dogs life and reggie lost his temper and upset the board intentionally mr sykes who was lying on the hearth rug pretended that the black king was a rat though of course he knew it was not and proceeded to worry it in other words it was just after lunch on monday the th of august they had lunched in hall and a fellow of the college who rejoiced in the name of gingham had asked them to play croquet afterwards in the kings garden at half past two there was no cricket going on and it was too hot to play tennis so they very kindly consented the black king was rescued and the babe tucked mr sykes under his arm and shut him into reggies gyp closet as the sight of a croquet ball always inspired him with a wild chattering rage and they strolled out onto the bridge to wait for gingham who appeared before long accompanied by a colleague from another college of mean appearance who proved also to be of uncertain temper the limes down to the back gate were in full flower and resonant with bees and mr gingham made a very felicitous quotation from the fourth georgic with gay facility beyond the road along the backs lay cool and white beneath the enormous elms and the babe asserted that he heard a nightingale which mr ginghams friend said was quite impossible since it was the end of the first week in august but the babe remarked with a fatuous smile that he had been senior ornithologist and might be supposed to know upon which mr ginghams friend said there was no such thing as an ornithological tripos and the babe replied thats a loring and refused to explain further behind the railings the garden lay deliciously fresh and green long level plains of grass were spread about between the flower beds and the whole place had an air of academic and cultivated repose on one of these stretches of lawn a game of tennis was in progress the performance was not of a very high class but the players seemed to be enjoying themselves each game opened with a regularity which to the ordinary mind would appear monotonous in incessant repetition the first service delivered by all the players was a swift splendid fault served low into the net and this was invariably followed by a slow underhand service always perfectly faultless but probably easy of execution then however a pleasing diversity varied the progress of the rest about sixty per cent of these services were returned in which case the partner of the server who stood close up to the net hit them cruelly out of court and called the score in an angry rasping voice as if it had been contradicted the other forty per cent came to an untimely end in the meshes of the net but the interest of the game to the babe who lagged behind to watch it for a few minutes was that whereas most people who play lawn tennis indifferently are exactly like everybody else these four players seemed to him to be like nobody else one of them was so glaringly obscure that you would scarcely have known he was there if you had not seen him returning the balls the second was more neglected by nature than one would have thought a living man could be and had the sleeves of his shirt buttoned round his wrists the third had a face which resembled only the face of an emaciated man seen in the bowl of a spoon and the features of the fourth were obscured by a hat which resembled a beehive in shape and a frieze coat in texture but on the doctrine of probabilities it seemed likely that did we know all he would have proved to be as remarkable as his fellow sportsmen he whisked about with astonishing rapidity though he was hardly ever in his right place and a handkerchief which dangled out of his trousers pocket reminded the observer of a white badly trimmed tail the babes curiosity to see his face grew unbearable but like the quangle wangle his face was not to be seen once the babe thought he caught sight of a small round open mouth but he could not be sure the name of mr ginghams colleague was jones and he and gingham played the babe and reggie jones began but failed at the second hoop and the babe having passed it croquetted him cheerfully away into a fine big bush about one hundred yards distant he said to jones in his genial way an enemy hath done this but got no reply he then tried to get into position for the third hoop and it is doubtful whether in all the annals of croquet there was ever made so vilely futile a stroke gingham followed and as it was hopeless to mobilise with a ball a hundred yards off took a shot at the babes ball got through the third hoop and secured position for the cage reggie mobilised with the babe and then there was a pause broken by a confused but angry murmur from inside a beautiful laurestinus now in full flower it is almost needless to explain that jones could not find his ball when he did discover it he took it out and made an extraordinarily good attempt to get into position for the second hoop but just hit the wire and lay in a bee line with the opening he lit a cigarette and tried to kick the match with which he had lit it then it was that satan entered into the babes soul and from this point an analysis of joness strokes is worth recording i secured position for the second hoop ii tried to regain position for the second hoop iii wired for the second hoop iv a curious stroke in which the cage was torn up and twisted as if by some convulsion of nature and had to be replaced in position and straightened v hit the babes ball but played out of turn ball replaced and stroke played again no result but left near the further stump vi failed to secure position for the second hoop vii secured position for the second hoop viii a cross country hit from below the willow tree into the same beautiful laurestinus ix captured the babes ball and sent it to the feet of the man with the beehive hat x returned by stages to the second xi hoop xii sent the babe through the cage by accident xiii secured position for the second hoop at this point mr jones gave vent to a most regrettable remark about the babe and his nose swelled a little such a result was excusable for the babes diabolical ingenuity in attacking him had only been equalled by his diabolical luck twice for the ground was not well rolled had his ball come skipping and hopping along and had pounced upon his adversarys like a playful kitten and twice he had cannoned violently off a hoop onto it but about this point his luck had shown signs of failing and he sheltered himself for a few strokes near his partner who together with gingham had been plodding slowly and steadily round the hoops altogether the game had been like air with variations the babe and mr jones taking brilliant firework excursions across the theme but for a little while it seemed as if the cup of the babes iniquities was full and for ten minutes he kept falling into the hand of his adversaries with the most surprising persistence but the end was not yet half an hour later the position was as follows reggie and gingham were rovers the babe had not been through the cage coming back but jones had only the two last hoops to pass and it was joness turn the babe was getting a little excited and the lust for vengeance was on jones he had even gone so far as to advise the babe what to do on one occasion and the babe had answered him shortly in a high tremulous voice the babes ball was in position for the cage and theoretically jones was wired to him but his ball violently and maliciously struck curled in a complicated manner off the cage wires and hit the babes thats a beastly fluke said that gentleman in an excited contralto jones could afford to be generous it did turn it off a little he said pacifically but i think it would have hit it anyhow then you think wrong said the babe outwardly calm the laurestinus quivered jones became a rover and mobilised with his partner but not very close the babe failed to mobilise with reggie gingham shot at his partner and missed reggie mobilised successfully with the babe quem deus vult perdere prius dementat jones ought to have separated them but having hit his partner he tried to put him out failed but left himself and his partner both close to the stump the babe smiled and there was a tea party of four he smiled again a little unkindly he put gingham out and he hit joness ball a moment afterwards a frenzied croquet ball bounded into the net of the tennis players and caused the spoon faced man for the first time that afternoon to serve two consecutive faults then the babe went back to his hoop gingham was of a peaceful disposition but rather timid he had however caught a glimpse of joness face as he walked off to the lawn tennis court and it might reasonably he said afterwards have frightened a bolder man than he so he turned to the babe you know its only a game he said and the babe replied still rather shrilly then watch me play it reggie and the babe between them could easily keep mr joness ball safely off the ground and the babe plodded on till he too was a rover and reggie and he went out in the next two turns a very pleasant game said he smiling jones was ill advised enough to murmur insolent young ass the babe heard and his face turned pink but his smile suffered no diminution a very pleasant game he repeated but only a game ix tea at the pitt dark house by which once more i stand here in the long unlovely street tennyson the babe was leaning out of the window of the rooms he had moved into for the long which looked onto the great court of trinity and in his hands was a simple sheet of foolscap paper rolled up big at one end and small at the other he applied his mouth intermittently to the small end of this really elementary contrivance and in his hands like the sonnet in the hand of milton the thing became a trumpet unlike milton however he was in no way liable to censure for not using it often enough he had been working for nearly two hours that morning and it was only just half past eleven he had got up at eight breakfasted and had really been at it ever since as a rule criticisms on himself did not make the least impression on him but somehow or other mr stewarts unwillingness to take any but the longest odds on the subject of his getting through the tripos had struck root and grown up rankling in his mind he knew quite well that he had as much ability as many undergraduates who tackle that examination successfully and he believed that if he chose he could acquire a sufficient portion of their industry hence the early rising the history books scattered on the table and indirectly the inter mezzo on the foolscap thing however at twelve he was going to his history coach for an hour and he allowed himself twenty minutes relaxation before this he had watched the porter take his name for making a row in court so as the worst he could do was done there was obviously no reason why he should discontinue making a row and it was not till the mouthpiece had got sodden and the sides stuck together that he stopped the history coach the babe confessed was rather a trial he lived in dusty fusty rooms and he himself was by far the dustiest fustiest thing in them during the first lesson the babe had had with him he had employed his hands in cleaning his nails with a button hook which was however better than that he should not clean them at all on another occasion a spider had dropped down from the ceiling onto the top of his head and had walked down his nose and from there had let itself down onto the note book which he was using he was short sighted and finishing the lesson at that moment and being entirely unconscious of the spider had shut it up with a bang in the note book and the spider was a fleshy spider the babe had tried to get mr stewart to coach him but that gentlemans time was too deeply engaged already his own work he said like topmost gargarus took the morning and he imagined that neither he nor the babe would care to meet over history however romantically treated in the afternoon while social calls rendered the evening equally impossible for both of them so the babe went three times a week to mr swotcham of the spider he was a young don but the habits of incessant study had early bent his back bleared his eyes and given him a weak nervous manner he rarely took any exercise and even when he did he only walked a little way along the trumpington road out of his rooms he was like a sheep that had gone astray and coasted down the streets keeping close to the houses as if afraid that should he launch himself into mid pavement he would lose himself irretrievably he was a member of an occult some said obscure club called the apostles the members of which met in each others rooms in a shame faced manner every saturday night though there was really nothing in the least shameful about their proceedings in theory it was supposed that they set the world straight once a week but no doubt they lacked practical ability the babe whose varied acquaintance included several members of this society used to ask them to dinner on saturday night in order to have the pleasure of hearing them excuse themselves at a quarter to ten the excuse offered was always the same im afraid ive got to go round and see a man the babe followed this up by asking who the man was to which the invariable reply was oh only a man i know then the brutal babe throwing the mask aside would say oh youre going to a meeting of the apostles arent you somehow the members seemed rather ashamed of this fact being thus ruthlessly dragged into light and the babe in his may week paper had informed the world that the apostles were the spiritual descendants of the old hell fire club of medmenham abbey and that their deeds grew darker and darker every year for the most part they were radical agnostics and they disestablished the english church about once a month they affected red ties to show that they disapproved of everything swotcham was not only an eminent apostle a sort of peter among them but an eminent historian and the babe had the sense to attend to what he said it is true that this morning he watched with overpowering interest the turning over of the leaves of swotchams note book until the corpse of the fleshy spider was discovered blotching and staining the articles of the magna charta but when swotcham had scratched it off with a j nib his attention wandered no more it was a hopelessly wet and sloppy afternoon the sort of afternoon when everything looks at its worst and cambridge worst of all grey sheets of rain drifted and drizzled over the great court driven fretfully against the window panes by a cold easterly wind which struck the spray of the fountain beyond the basin out sideways onto the path outside the gate the lime trees wept sooty tears and leaves early dead and the asphalt of trinity street looked like the surface of some stagnant dirty river distortedly reflecting the dull faced houses on each side a melancholy gurgle of water streamed into the grating in the centre of the so called whewells court and its more classical name seemed to be divinely apt the air was close cold and infinitely damp and two or three terriers inhumanely left outside the pitt appeared like a realistic rendering of discomfort personified so the judicious babe betook himself to the smoking room of that club which always maintains a uniformity of gloom and comfort whatever the weather is and thought to himself as he settled in a big armchair that until he left the weather could have no further depressing influence he took out of the library the inimitable ravenshoe which he already knew nearly by heart and read with undiminished enjoyment of how napoleon and a colonial bishop whose real name was jones gave testimonials to a corn cutter who had them printed in his advertisement and of how gus and flora were naughty in church later on he proposed to have hot toast with his tea he had not been there long when reggie came in and as the babe was not disposed to talk and merely grunted when he was sat on he got out a new book called gerald eversleys friendship and proceeded to read about the peculiarities which mark the boys at st anselms a short silence goozlemy goozlemy goozlemy quoted the babe look here babe well harry venniker produces from the bottom of his box a quantity of sporting prints and an enormous stags head a royal he called it did you ever see a play box that size no there isnt one my dear there is going to be a collection and i have left my purse on the piano i wish i knew flora silence after all in this life the deepest holiest feelings are inexpressible oh i draw the line somewhere yes if you dont draw the line somewhere murmured the babe where are you to draw the line gerald of course sobs violently on getting into bed the first night at st anselms and harry puts his hand on his shoulder and says hell be his friend for ever then gerald laid his head anew upon the pillow and was at peace good lord this was an incident of which the pale moon throned in heaven was the sole arbitress he says so shouted reggie and it is a study in real life he says that too on the title page in capital letters he says it very loud and plain several times the babe chuckled comfortably and shut up ravenshoe i read it yesterday he said turn on to about page or so i think youll find the passage marked in pencil he has to sing a song in which a swear word comes and when he gets to it he breaks down hides his face in his hands and rushes from the hall reggies eyes grew rounder and rounder so they propose to send him to coventry for a month thats the place my governor is member for remarked the babe and they make bicycles there the little brute aged thirteen babe about as old as you continued reggie reads books of science particularly archology even sermons and books of controversial divinity in the college library if that is real life give me fiction quite a little zola said the babe our new harmless english realist a little later on a churchyard becomes an element in geralds life are churchyards elements in your life reggie yes of course later on again continued the babe he gets in a row for cribbing the author gets hold of such wonderfully new and original situations the evidence against him is overwhelming absolutely overwhelming and the mystery is never cleared up as you read your suspense is only equalled by the suspense of the author he finds it almost unbearable i cant read any more said reggie tell me what happens oh all the regular things harry gets into the eleven and gerald eversley turns into robert elsmere for a time then of course he falls in love with harrys sister who gallops away in consumption and dies so gerald determines to commit suicide and leaves a note for harry saying what he is going to do and just as he is preparing to jump into a lake he has previously thrown his coat with a stone wrapped up in it into the water he feels a hand on his shoulder its harry of course naturally he has found the letter which tells him that the writer will be a corpse when he finds it which is a black lie and goes off just in time to the place where gerald very prudently tells him that the deed will be done so gerald goes to a town in the north of england probably coventry again and wears a locket of purest enamel with the name ethel on it the book ends he is dead now reggie was still turning over the leaves of the book who is mr selby the good young master with a secret sorrow to whom all the boys open their hearts i see that harry lies at deaths door having caught inflammation of the lungs in a football match thats another original situation oh dear yes and old gentlemen cannot meet fifty years after they have left school without saying you remember that catch my dear fellow why did you let that ball go through your legs i would sooner be babe all my life than live to be an old man like that and harry gets the last goal just before time the backs leg flashed ive never seen your legs flash babe no im only a half back that accounts for it lets have tea and then well play a game of pills all right then you can dine in hall with me i cant afford dinner in my room and well work afterwards x royal visitors prince and princess he cried that means will play at being kings and queens hotch potch verses mr stewart as has been indicated before had a weakness and that was an amiable and harmless one his weakness was for the aristocracy compared with this his feeling for royalty which was of the same order but vastly intensified might also be called a total failure of power a sort of mental general paralysis so when one day towards the middle of august the wife of the heir apparent of a certain european country caused a telegram to be sent to him to the effect that her royal highness wished to visit cambridge before leaving the country and would be graciously pleased to take her luncheon with him mr stewart was naturally a proud man he bought a long strip of brilliant red carpet he ordered a lunch from the kitchen that set the mouth of the cook watering and altogether as the babe very profanely and improperly said made as much fuss as if the virgin mary had been expected he also sent printed cards to have the honour of to the vice chancellor the heads of four colleges and their wives and also to another fellow of his college who only a term before had entertained at tea a regular royal queen and had asked him to meet her and remembering that he had once met the prince of wales at a dance in london given by the babes mother he also asked the babe at the last moment however the princess sent a telegram saying that she was going to bring her husband with her which would mean two more places one for him and one for his gentleman in waiting and mr stewart whose table would not hold any more than fifteen conveniently sent a hurried message and apology to the babe saying that all this was very upsetting and unexpected and uncomfortable and inconvenient but that he was sure the babe would see his difficulty he would however be delighted and charmed if the babe would come in afterwards and at least take a cup of coffee and a cigarette for the princess did not mind smoking and indeed once at aix les bains he had seen her etc etc and sun himself in the smile of royalty the babe received this message at half past one he had refused an invitation to lunch at kings on the strength of the previous engagement and he was rather cross it was too late to go to kings now but after a few moments thought his face suddenly cleared and he sent a note to reggie saying that he would come round about half past two adding that he had got an idea which they would work out together he then ordered some lunch from the kitchen which there was little chance of his receiving for some time for all the cooks and kitchen boys who were not engaged in serving up mr stewarts lunch were busy making little excursions into the court where they stood about with trays on their heads to give the impression that they were going to or from some other rooms in order to catch a sight of mr stewarts illustrious guests as they crossed the court however the babe went to the kitchen himself as it did not come and said bitter things to the head cook who was a frenchman and asked him whether he had already forgotten about alsace and lorraine he lunched alone and half way through he nearly choked himself with laughing suddenly apparently at nothing at all and when he had finished he went round to kings he and reggie talked together for about an hour and then went out shopping later in the day mr stewart called on the babe to express his regret at what had happened but his regret was largely tempered with sober and loyal exultation at the success of his party their royal highnesses had been the embodiment of royal graciousness and amiability they had written their names in his birthday book and promised to send their photographs the conversation it appeared had been carried on chiefly in french a language with which mr stewart was perfectly acquainted and which he spoke not only elegantly but what is better intelligibly the princess was the most beautiful and delightful of women the prince the handsomest and most charming of men mr stewart in fact had quite lost his heart to them both and he had promised to look them up when he next happened to be travelling in their country which thought the cynical babe would probably be soon best of all mr medingway the entertainer of queens could not talk french though he was the first arabic scholar in europe a language however in which it was not possible for a mixed company to converse and he had necessarily been quite thrown into the shade the babe received this all with the utmost interest and sympathy he regretted that he had not been able to come in afterwards but he hoped mr stewart could come to breakfast next day at nine mr stewart both could and would and as soon as he had gone the babe danced the pas de quatre twice round the room that evening reggie and the babe went to call on jack marsden who had come up for a week jack was very short barely five feet high but he made up for that by being very stout the babe also got a fine nib and employed half an hour in copying something very carefully onto the back of a plain black edged envelope he was up in good time next morning and he had three letters by the post one of these was black edged and had on the back of the envelope a royal crown and windsor castle he opened them all and left this last face downwards on the table mr stewart came in still in the best of spirits and walked about the room expatiating on the superiority of royal families while the babe made tea it makes a difference said stewart it must make a difference if ones fathers and forefathers have been kings one would have the habit and the right of command i dont know if i ever told you his eye caught sight of the royal crown and windsor castle and he paused a moment i dont know if i ever told you of that very pleasant day i once spent at sandringham yes you told me about it yesterday said the babe brutally i suppose they are all up in scotland now said stewart no the queen is at windsor for a day or two said the babe she goes up early next week will you have a sole thanks not a whole one i asked because i saw you had a letter here from windsor the babe looked up quickly and just changed colour he could do it quite naturally and picked up his letters yes its from my cousin he said shes in waiting just now lady julia yes apparently they are not going straight up the subject dropped but a few minutes later the babe said suddenly and in an absent minded way i dont think shes ever been to cambridge before lady julia again the babe started yes lady julia she is thinking of coming up to to see me on monday is there anything in the papers i only read the morning post said mr stewart there is of course a short account of the princes visit here but i saw nothing else for the next day or two the babe was very busy too busy to do much work he went more than once with reggie and jack to the adc where they looked up several dresses and he had a long interview with the proprieter of the bull he took a slip of paper to the printers with certain elaborate directions and on monday morning there arrived at trinity a bath chair then he went to mr stewart who was his tutor and had a short talk with the result that at a quarter to two mr stewart was pacing agitatedly up and down his room stopping always in front of the window from which he could see the staircase on which were the babes rooms and on which now appeared a long strip of crimson carpet as luck would have it mr medingway selected this time for going to mr stewarts rooms to borrow a book and the two looked out of the window together the trinity clock had just struck two when a smart carriage and pair hired from the bull stopped at the gate and the babes gyp who had been waiting at the porters lodge wheeled the bath chair up to it out of it stepped first the babe next a short stout old lady dressed in black and last a very tall young woman elegantly dressed she was quite as tall as the babe and seemed the type of the english woman of the upper class who plays lawn tennis and rides bicycles the gyp bowed low as he helped the old lady into the chair and the babe hat in hand until the old lady told him to put it on and the tall girl walked one on each side of it the porter who was just going into the lodge stopped dead as they passed and also took off his hat and the bath chair passed down an inclined plane of boards which had been arranged over the steps into the court mr stewart standing with medingway at his bow window saw them enter and in a voice trembling with suppressed excitement said to his companion here they are and though benedictions were not frequent on his lips added god bless her he pressed medingway to stop for lunch and the two sat down together was it in the papers this morning asked the latter mr stewart took the morning post from the sofa it is only announced that the court will leave windsor to day they are expected at balmoral on wednesday not tuesday you see it does not give their movements for to day mr medingway was looking out of the window they have got to the staircase he said and she is getting out are we is anyone going in afterwards i believe not it is to be absolutely quiet and strictly incognito they leave again by the an interesting a unique occasion said medingway yes the babe takes it all so easily i wish i had been able to have him to lunch last week mr medingway smiled and helped himself to a slice of galantine they wouldnt perhaps take a cup of tea before going certainly not said mr stewart who if he was not playing the beau rle to day at any rate had been in the confidence of him who was the babe was most urgent that i should not let it get about indeed i have committed a breach of confidence in telling you of course i know it will go no further meantime the babe having successfully conveyed his party across the court and having taken the precaution of sporting his door was having lunch opposite to him sat jack marsden dressed in a black silk gown on his right reggie attired in the height of fashion he wore a blue dress with very full sleeves and a large picture hat he was taking a long draught of lager beer stewart and medingway both saw he said and they are both at stewarts window now it was complete said the babe solemnly wonderfully complete and the bogus copy of the morning post which i substituted for his was completer still it will also puzzle them to know how you get away for they are sure to wait there on the chance of seeing you again i shouldnt wonder if stewart went to the station and now if youve finished you can change in my bedroom and well go round and get a fourth to play tennis stewart must confess that i have gone one better than either him or medingway xi the rehearsal they had a rustic woodland air after wordsworth ealing had not been up in the long but reggie and the babe spent a week with him early in october before going up to cambridge again they arrived on the last day of september and from morn till eve on the first day the silly pheasants fled before the babes innocuous gun however that gentleman said he liked aiming without any thought of ulterior consequences and that this was the true essence of sport and as reggie and ealing were both good shots it is to be presumed that everyone even including the keeper was fairly contented the october term began as october terms always begin there was as usual a far larger number of freshmen of unique brilliance than had ever been heard of before who were duly asked to coffee with men of other years after hall and these ceremonies were neither more nor less exciting than usual there was the freshman who wore spectacles and didnt play games because he had a weak heart and who when asked from what school he came said giggleswick with almost incredible coolness there was the freshman who had been captain of the eleven in some obscure school and already saw himself captain of the university team there were freshmen who could play all kinds of music the freshman who played the flute and the freshman who played the violin and probably the freshman who could play the sackbut and psaltery the freshman who already seemed to know half the university and the freshman who knew nobody at all the freshman who called his tutor sir and the freshman who very kindly treated him as one man of the world treats another there were the usual trial games of football played under a tropical sun and the usual interminable lists of tubbings put up in the reading room but after a fortnight or so the world in general with all its sorts and conditions of men settled down into its usual routine the freshmen who had all started together diverged into the sets where their particular tastes attracted them some joined musical societies and some were put up and blackballed at a meeting of the old giggleswickians some played in the freshmens matches and some bought college blazers and passed contented and leisurely afternoons in canoes on the backs alan st aubyn published his annual humorous libel on what he playfully called university life and the babe moved from malcolm street into the rooms he had occupied in the long in the great court trinity and mr sykes signalised the occasion by killing the under porters best cat no doubt it was primarily the best cats fault for she had taken an independent and solitary walk on her own account down trinity street and sykes who was waiting at the gate quite quiet and as good as gold for the babe who had gone into his room to put down his cap and gown saw her returning so he killed her of course he had to tell the babe about it and he thought the best plan would be to take the mangled corpse she was not neatly killed to the babes rooms which though he was not allowed in college he happened to know and the first thing the porter saw was mr sykes racing across the grass with his best cat hopelessly defunct dangling from his mouth he followed but sykes got there first and was wagging his stumpy tail with a pleased air as he deposited his burden on the hearth rug when the infuriated porter entered the porter said i that sykes had no business to kill his cat ii that he had if possible even less business in college iii that sykes ought to be poisoned the babe answered i that there was no question of poisoning sykes ii that the death must have taken place outside college for he had seen sykes enter with the corpse in his mouth iii that the cat had no more business in trinity street than sykes had in college so it was six of one and half a dozen of the other iv that sykes should be beaten v that though the cat was not worth it sentiment went for something and there was such a thing as a sovereign so sykes was beaten there and then with a rug strap and the porter had a sovereign and the beaten sykes was granted safe conduct out of college again the babe took a hansom down to the theatre for he was going to rehearse for the greek play and blew tobacco smoke at sykes all the way to show him he was in disgrace he had not much wanted to act for it meant six weeks of rehearsing and learning his part but he had consented to read through the play and see whether the part of clytemnestra in the agamemnon did not recommend itself to him this had of course ended in his undertaking it and he found that though he had dropped greek for two years he did not experience much difficulty in learning his part the theatre where the agamemnon was to be performed was a curiously shabby building resembling an overgrown barn one of the greater barns so said the babe mentioned in a parable a low tunnel resembling the subway in metropolitan underground stations led into it from the street and from the tunnel opened various doors which led into rooms resembling economically constructed kennels one of these humorously called the smoking room presumably because the audience invariably smoked in the passage was rendered additionally alluring by a long low plank like those supplied to third class waiting rooms which ran down the length of it the outer wall in all its unveiled glory of brick and mortar was further decorated by photographs of the compton company in which actors and actresses alike seemed devoured by a futile endeavour to acquire those casts of expression which are associated with persons of genius and sensibility a man was engaged in kindling reluctant footlights when the babe entered and he had time to bestow the minutest attention on the very vivid drop scene which was down before the others appeared it represented a gloomy and nameless marsh in the corner of which was moored a magenta boat into which a young lady in a green bonnet was being assisted by a young gentleman of abhorrent demeanour and odiously familiar manner he wore a straw hat and a blue frock coat and was smoking an enormous cigar over their heads hovered a gigantic bird of prey probably a vulture confident no doubt that the fatal exhalations from the marsh or their own unfitness to live would soon supply him with a delicate supper composed of the remains of this ill attired pair a painted but unexplained venetian mast in popular language a barbers pole stuck out of the bulrushes in the middle distance and behind the sun appeared to have just set in a gory sky over the mountains which stood up brilliantly blue in the background it was a miserably cold morning and clytemnestra sat in a thick ulster with a bull dog on her knees till it was time for her to appear and watched a curiously dressed chorus of argive elders headed by reggie in flannels and a blazer for he had been playing tennis manuvre round a stage director whom a vivid imagination construed into an altar two other stage directors quarrelled with each other in the background till the conductor who was directing the chorus asked them to be quiet thus he secured for himself the hostility of all the stage directors who resented the attack made on their class and who lay in wait to contradict him rudely on the earliest possible occasion the babe meantime had wandered off the stage into the wings in search of a fire and mr sykes left to himself recognised reggie as a friend among the heterogeneous elders and trotted across to him wheezing pathetically the conductor had stopped the chorus in order to point out some mistake the tenors had made and was singing the passage himself in a fruity falsetto voice and reggie who was a bass was patting sykes when the voice of one of the hostile stage directors broke in the rehearsal he said firmly will proceed when the leader of the argive elders has quite finished playing with a bull dog please send the bull dog out of the theatre its clytemnestras said reggie the babe re appeared at this moment wheres bill he asked oh there he is come here darling oh are you waiting for me the conductor laid down his baton settle it among yourselves he said and tell me when you are ready i may remark that i am very busy and that my time is not my own mr sykes meantime was sniffing suspiciously round the heels of the altar and the altar was getting visibly nervous the babe supposing that his entrance had come began reciting his first lines in a loud voice and the stage directors and the conductors made common cause against him if clytemnestra would kindly be quiet said one and take away her horrible dog put in the altar the chorus might proceed shouted the conductor the babe with a look of injured innocence on his face retired to his chair followed reluctantly by sykes who was not satisfied about the altar and the practice went on but the truce between the conductor and the stage directors was only an armed neutrality one of them in particular a bustling little man with a honey coloured moustache and a paderewski head of hair was waiting to fall upon him he was a student of all branches of what stewart would have called delightful and useless knowledge on such subjects he has perhaps a wider and more elaborately specialised information than any man in england he could have told you with the most minute particulars the exact shape of the earrings worn by greek women of the fifth century bc the particular way in which athletes of the fourth century brushed their hair the conformation of the lobe of the ear in female statues of the third century or the proportionate length of the little finger nail to the eye socket in bronzes of the hadrian epoch he could have prescribed you the ingredients which made the red in botticellis tobias lasting through the want of which turners sunsets paled almost as fast as the sunsets themselves he had penetrated into the dens of the forgers at rome which lie in the street which no one can find between the via nazionale and the capitol he had been twice round the world and spoke five dialects of mexican he had looked on the city of mecca and kodaked the interior of the mosque of the seven curses of the prophet he had dived for pearls in the coromandel sea and evaded by a hair breadth the jaws of the blue nosed shark as it rolled over on its back to snap him in two he knew intimately a lineal descendant of adamo di brescia the coiner of the inferno and asserted that in all probability the forefather was a clumsier workman than his son or he would never have been detected and on all these subjects and many others equally abstruse he could give you statistics as dry as the facts themselves were interesting once or twice it is true he had been caught in an apparent error but he had always been able to give a perfectly satisfactory explanation of it afterwards with hardly any time for reflection such qualifications had eminently fitted him for the part of stage manager in a greek play and he certainly added to these immense zeal and industry his name was propert and his college was peterhouse for some minutes he stood grasping his hair with both hands in an incipient frenzy as the chorus proceeded but at last he could stand it no longer and he clapped his hands loudly it is all wrong he said you have not got the spirit of it you do not sound the note of fate those last bars should be a long low wail prophetic of woe and pianissimo pianissimo ma con smorgando tremuloso he patted the air in front of reggie with an eloquent gesture they are marked ff said the leader of the argive elders in good plain english well you must erase your double forte said dr propert the conductor folded his arms and waited till dr propert had retired up o p we will now begin again four bars back at the double forte he remarked yes pianissimo said the doctor turning round the argive elders looked puzzled diplomacy to judge by their speeches was not their strong point are we to do it double forte or pianissimo asked reggie of the conductor i presume that doctor propert has informed professor damien of the alterations he has thought fit to make in the music he remarked bitterly but as doctor propert was already employed in showing agamemnon who was about to enter how to lean against a door in the attitude of a sophoclean adult the sarcasm fell innocuous and the practice proceeded fortissimo without further interruption agamemnon had forgotten his first line and at dr properts suggestion said boble boble boble until he remembered the second or third lines and the chorus grouped themselves round the watchmen and smoked while the altar relieved of its localising duties quarrelled with the other unemployed directors and prompted agamemnon intermittently but as the scene between agamemnon and clytemnestra proceeded and the babe warmed to his work other conversation drooped and died he found it bored him simply to say the part and throughout the rehearsals even when he had to read his part he acted it all but at this stage in rehearsal he knew it by heart and in looking at him one quite forgot his deerstalker cap and long loud ulster the stage directors were reconciled and murmured approbation the conductor ceased talking to the watchmen and the thing began to take shape even the subsequent appearance of mr sykes who sat down in the middle of the stage and smiled at the chorus caused no interruption he fell perfectly flat and no one took the slightest notice of him once only was there an interruption and that was made by the babe himself dr propert was busy hauling a metope on to the stage and letting go of it for a moment it fell resonantly onto its back the babe stopped dead and turned round if you make such a horrible row again while im on he said you may take the part of clytemnestra yourself i shall begin again he added severely at the beginning of my speech the conductor could have embraced the babe on the spot and the other stage managers giggled the babe waited till they had quite finished and then began again thirty four lines back the truth was that all the babes flippancy and foolishness left him when he was acting and only then for acting was the one thing he took quite seriously he ceased to be himself for he threw himself completely into the character he was impersonating he was in fact not an amateur but an actor and these two have nothing whatever to do with one another if a man has dramatic power he may become an actor with training without it he cannot and most amateurs have not got it so the play proceeded with vigour till clytemnestra went off with gisthus and shortly after in a hansom with mr sykes the cold drizzle of the morning had turned to snow and the melting snow in the streets looked like thin coffee ice the babe was playing in a college match that afternoon and the prospect filled him with a mild despair xii a college sunday this gloomy tone he said is far too rife ill demonstrate the loveliness of life hotch potch verses reggie and ealing had moved into a set of rooms in fellows buildings which they shared together the set consisted of three rooms two inner and smaller ones and one large room looking out on to the front court of kings the two smaller rooms they used as bedrooms but as they each had folding eton beds by half past nine or so every morning provided that they got up in reasonable time they were converted for the day into sitting rooms the outer room was furnished more with regard to what furniture they had than what furniture it required thus there were two pianos tuned about a quarter of a tone apart from each other two grandfathers clocks and a most deficient supply of chairs however as reggie said one can always sit on the piano ealings powers of execution on the piano were limited he could play hymn tunes or other compositions where the next chord to the one he was engaged on followed as a corollary from it and anything in the world which went so slowly as to enable him to glance from the music to his hands between each chord however complicated it was provided it did not contain a double sharp which he always played wrong he could also by dint of long practice play father oflynn and the first verse of off to philadelphia in the morning and there seemed to be no reason why with industry he should not be able to acquire the power of playing the other verses in which he considered the chords to be most irregular and unexpected deserting the air at the most crucial points reggie however was far more accomplished he had got past hymn tunes the intermezzo in cavaleria rusticana even the palpitating part was from force of repetition mere childs play to him and he aspired to the slow movements out of beethovens sonatas the hours in which each might practise therefore demanded careful arrangement college regulations forbade the use of the pianos altogether between nine in the morning and two in the afternoon since it was popularly supposed by the authorities who framed this rule and who shall say them nay that all undergraduates worked between these hours and that the sound of a piano would disturb them consequently ealing was allowed to play between eight am and nine am every morning a privilege which he used intermittently during breakfast and by which he drove reggie daily to the verge of insanity and reggie between two pm and three pm ealing again might play between three and five and reggie from five to seven during these hours the temporary captain of the pianos even if he did not wish to play himself might stop the other from playing except with the soft pedal down it had been found impossible to regulate the hours after dinner and they often played simultaneously on their several pianos and produced thereby very curious and interesting effects which sounded wagnerian at a sufficient distance finally the use of the piano was totally prohibited by common consent between two am and eight am the babe like mournful none hither came at noon one sunday morning chapel at kings was at half past ten and that english habit of mind which weds indissolubly together sunday morning and lying in bed was responsible for the fact that on sunday reggie and ealing always breakfasted after chapel but the babe unlike that young lady was in the best of spirits and as ealing and reggie were not yet back from chapel made tea and began breakfast without them they came in a few minutes later both rather cross when there is going to be a sermon said reggie severely taking off his surplice i consider that i have a right to be told morning babe oh have you had a sermon said the babe sweetly who preached the dean he preached for half an hour more than half an hour said ealing totally inaudible of course but lengthy to make up for that pour me out some tea babe if youve had the sense to make it sermons are trying if one hasnt breakfasted said the babe they are sermons in stones when one asks for bread what do you mean i havent the slightest idea i hoped that perhaps one of you would know why should i know what i mean its other peoples business to find out and they for the most part neglect it shamefully shut up babe growled reggie i wish you wouldnt talk when im eating cant you hear yourself eat asked the babe sympathetically wild horses shall not drag me to chapel this afternoon said ealing well go for a walk reggie i daresay at present i cant think of anything but food babe you greedy hog give me some fish and very good fish it is said the babe genially by the way sykes is far from well this morning whats the matter with him he partook too freely of the anchovies of the chitchat last night you will find that in french conversation books i saw him indulging as i thought unwisely said ealing then it was surely imprudent of him to drink moselle cup he wished to drown care but it only gave him a stomach ache stewart impressed him so with the fact that we were all atlases with the burden of the world on our shoulders that he had recourse to the cup and the burden of us all was on stewart yes dont you remember he said that he felt personally responsible for every undergraduate whom he had ever spoken to his idea is that each don ought to have an unlimited influence and that the whole future of england in the next generation lay on each of them particularly himself no wonder his eyelids were a little weary as mr pater says but after you went he took the other side and said that the undergraduates were the raison dtre of the university and that the dons existed only by their sufferance did longridge stop yes he was a little less coherent than usual i know he took the case of a man at oxford who threw stones at the deer in magdalen though what conclusion he drew from it i cant say probably that the deer were really responsible for the undergraduates the babe sighed i have to read a paper next week i think it shall be on some aspects of longridge that is sure to give rise to a discussion if he is there give me a cigarette reggie the babe established himself in a big chair by the fireplace while the others finished breakfast i am going to found a club he said called the scd or society for the cultivation of dons stewart says he will be vice president as he doesnt consider himself a don we are going to call on obscure dons every afternoon and speak to them of the loveliness of life for as stewart says the majority of them have no conception of it their lives are bounded by narrow horizons and the only glimpse they catch of the great world is their bed maker as she carries out their slop pail from their bedrooms they live like the niebelungs in dark holes and eat roots and though they are merely animals they have no animal spirits he says he knew a don once who by a sort of process of spontaneous combustion became a dictionary but all the interesting words the sort of words one looks out in a bible dictionary you know were missing so they used him to light fires with for which he was admirably adapted being very dry and in the manner of king alexander who as stewart asserted became the bung in a wine cork other dons now warm themselves at him stewart was very entertaining last night and rather improper he said that a don juan or two was wanted among the dons by way of compensation and he enlarged on the subject give us his enlargements i cant he enlarged in a way that belongs to the hour after midnight on saturday when you know that when you wake up it will be sunday he was very saturday night he called it working off the arrears of the week and complained that he hadnt heard a mouth filling oath for more than a month he never swears himself but he likes to hear other people do it for he says he is in a morbid terror of the millennium beginning without his knowing it he skipped about in short skirted epigrams and pink tight phrases at least that was his account of his own conversation when we parted oh yes and he said he didnt mind saying these things to me because i was a man of the world he knows your weak points babe said reggie not at all he referred to that as my strong point good old clytemnestra im better now thank you after my breakfast and its the sorrows of death this afternoon i shall go to chapel again reggie lit a pipe and picked out the first few bars on the piano the watchman was a tiresome sort of man to have about he said when they asked him if it was nearly morning he only said though the morning will come the night will come also of course they knew that already and besides it wasnt the question i should have dismissed him on the spot so the soprano has to tell them which he does on the top a mainly when i was a child i could sing the upper upper z said the babe fatuously then my voice broke and the moral is deeper and deeper yet dont rag i apologise ealing finished breakfast last and strolled across to the window its a heavenly morning he said lets go out we neednt go far i will walk no further than the kings field said the babe very well and we can sit outside the pavilion im lunching out at half past one meals do run together so on sunday sunday is really one long attack of confluent mastication said the babe its a pity one cant take them simultaneously though november had already begun the air was deliciously warm and mild and had it not been for the fast yellowing trees one would have guessed it to be may but there was a shouting wind overhead which stripped off the leaves by hundreds and blew the rooks about the sky already the tops of the trees were bare and the nests of last spring swung empty and half ruined high up among the forks of the branches during the last week a good deal of rain had fallen and the cam was swirling down yellow and turbid the willow by the river was already quite bare and its thin feathery branches lashed themselves against the stone coping of the bridge they went through the fellows gardens for reggie by some means had got hold of a key there a few bushes of draggled michaelmas daisies were making pretence that the summer was not quite dead yet but they only succeeded in calling attention to the long desolate beds the grass was growing rank and matted under the autumn rains and little eddies of leaves had drifted up against the wires of the disused croquet hoops but the day itself seemed stolen from off the lap of spring and two thrushes were singing in the bushes after an excellent breakfast of succulent worms we play you to morrow at rugger remarked the babe as they walked across the field and we play on this ground its sticky enough and i shall vex the soul of the half opposite me because i like a sticky ground and he is certain not to in fact said he confidently i purpose to get two tries off my own bat and generally to sit on this royal and ancient foundation the babe has never yet been called modest said ealing if i have i am not aware of it said the babe weve got three blues remarked reggie i am delighted to hear it said the babe you will need them all and you may tell our mutual friend hargreave that if he attempts to collar me round the ancles again i shall make no efforts whatever to avoid kicking him in the face he did it last time we played you and i spoke to him about it more in sorrow than in anger upon which the referee warned you for using sorrowful language he did take that liberty conceded the babe lets sit down outside the pavilion i wish we could kick about the sabbath is made for man and so is sunday and so are footballs but on sunday the pavilion is locked up by man and the footballs put inside it appears so english people take sunday too seriously just as they take everything else except me anyhow stewart says you are a man of the world said ealing he does and who are we to contradict him good lord theres one oclock striking i must go home theres somebody coming to lunch at half past reggie get me a ticket for kings this afternoon will you xiii kings chapel music when soft voices die vibrates in the memory shelley reggie and the babe got into chapel just after the voluntary had begun and slow soft notes came floating drowsily down from the echoes in the roof the chapel and ante chapel were both full and from the door in the dim mellow half darkness a sea of heads stretched up to the black wooden screen through which streamed the light from the chapel itself in the roof one could just see the delicate fan shaped lines of vaulting springing across like lotus leaves from wall to wall and the windows on the south side gleamed with dark rich colour from the sky already turning red with the southwestern setting sun as they went up the ante chapel the babe saw a seat still unoccupied and preferred stopping there to going into the chapel illustration kings college screen and gateway reggies seat was just east of the choir opposite to the window representing christ standing in the garden after the resurrection to the right kneels mary magdalene gaudily dressed just having turned and seeing that he was not as she supposed only the gardener to the left rises a green hill on the top of which below a row of brown ragged rocks stands the empty tomb with the women round it by a quaint but curiously felicitous idea of the artist the figure of christ is holding a spade in his hand as if to give colour to marys mistake his face is divine but graciously human and he waits for the recognition the whole place had an air of tranquil repose of remoteness from worldliness hurry and unprofitable strivings that perhaps has a certain value which is not necessarily diminished because it is impossible to account for it statistically or categorically there is something in spacious grey buildings and perfect gothic architecture shared too by broad grass lawns and studious quiet places and uneventful lives that cannot be altogether left out of the reckoning when one adds up the total value of a university as compared with a modern endowed plan of education or the admirable schemes of university extension and the choir which walked slowly up the aisle into their places though composed of ordinary little boys lay clerks and undergraduates somehow brought themselves into harmony with it on week days the little boys no doubt were entirely human and probably concealed surreptitious sweet stuff in their pockets the lay clerks wore bowler hats and tail coats and belonged to the most unprepossessing class which england produces and the undergraduates were only undergraduates but for the time they were part of a wonderful idea and were performing the office set apart for them by a royal founder the last echo from the roof died away and the service began and though reggie was not conscious of attending very closely to it he was still aware of the good and kindly atmosphere about him an atmosphere which soothed and quieted and drove the thoughts inward he had often felt it before on other winter afternoons in chapel and as far as he knew for he did not consciously think about it it had made no difference to him but as no impression is without its effects we must presume that it had made a difference to him though he had not been aware of it not long before the organ had been repaired and in great part renewed and it was worthy of its surroundings and its appearance golden sheaves of pipes gleamed out between the dark wooden case and on top of the two turrets looking west stood two great angels with brazen trumpets to their mouths and when the tuba speaks one cannot help imagining that it is their trumpets which are sounding to day the lord thundered out of heaven and one could think that the air for a moment grew thick with sound which increased till it shattered the growing darkness splitting it with lightning made audible by the end of the psalms it had grown quite dark outside and the windows showed black between the delicate tracery from the lectern came the story of nebuchadnezzars dream of the watcher and the holy one and afterwards of the holy one who watched alone among the olives in the garden of gethsemane a king not of babylon but of the whole earth who had not where to lay his head the stalls and sub stalls were all full of members of the college in surplices but the black crowd beyond stretched up to the steps of the altar and when the three bars of introduction to the solo began every one stood up mendelssohn so often only correct so often ruined by his fatal prettiness has here struck the right note full and firm even reggie ceased to think of the evasiveness of the watchman and only listened till the repeated call of the minor died away into a long pause before the soprano answered and the choir took up the full chorus outside in the ante chapel though only for a little while the babe ceased from his customary futility of thought and the slow opening of the carved wooden doors in the screen and the drawing of the crimson curtain at the end of service still found him meditative as the choir came out framed in a long shaft of light the organ was played quietly and then paused for a moment while a great pedal note made the air shake and quiver in sensation rather than sound then the full organ burst out with the occasional overture as the congregation from the chapel streamed out after the members of the college the first movement marched and marching marshalled whole armies of sound which stood waiting while the second rippled and laughed and sang with all the breezes of heaven behind it and the third dwelt dreamily on what had gone and thought of what was to come then in the last movement battalion after battalion of major chords from choir and swell and great organ grew and multiplied in all their forces the flutes and piccolos the twelfths and fifteenths as flying squadrons on the wings and the diapasons the lords of sound in the centre an exceeding great army then at the second repeat the tuba woke in the huge house of sounds and the thing was complete a fixed star for ever in the heavens of harmony xiv a variety entertainment in truth i know of noone so adaptable old play that evening the babe dined as a guest with the taf which means twice a fortnight and is a synonym for oaw or once a week and implies a frankly purposeless and purely social club consisting of about a dozen members chiefly undergraduates who dined together every sunday night and spent a pleasant evening of innocent mirth and a little music after dinner one member sang some scotch songs in a baritone voice another played the pilgrims march in tannhuser exceedingly badly omitting the venus motif but repeating the chorus in a palpitating manner in the higher octave to make up for it and two others recalled to their minds the occasional overture which had been played in chapel that afternoon a fifth imitated in the most natural and life like manner the speech and manners of a don of the college three or four read books gloomily in corners being of a more serious turn of mind and the wilder section of the party pressed the babe to give them a little skirt dancing which he very properly refused to do feeling justly enough that it would not be in keeping with the general character of the proceedings later he very unwisely offered to play picquet with anybody a proposition which was received in awkward silence and hurriedly covered with a buzz of conversation another guest however contributed to the harmony of the evening by describing at great length the state of the lower classes in russia germany austria and turkey in asia with realistic and revolting details by degrees the other members of the party left their books and their music and sat round him in enthusiastic silence for so stirring a man so thought the babe there was no excuse and no hope for he was not less than thirty years old and should have known better then he reverted also at length to the vastly superior conditions of our own agricultural labourers and proceeded still monologising by easy transitions to the prospect of an european war on this point his prophecies were most patriotic and went perfectly to the tune of rule britannia and so afforded everyone present the greatest satisfaction when they reflected that they were englishmen metaphorically speaking he slapped them on the back and filled them full of roast beef and racial admiration all his sentiments were worthy of the highest praise and it may only have been the personality of the speaker that inspired the babe with such speechless horror he was just describing the apparatus for shooting torpedoes from submerged tubes on the majestic which in some obscure manner the passport of prince niktivoffski which he happened to have about him had enabled him to inspect and was saying that no other nation had got anything of the kind and that they would blow all other navies of the world into a million of atoms in a moment of time when the breaking point came for the babe and he rose and said good night he had not got more than half way across the court when he heard other sounds of revelry from some rooms on the right belonging as he knew to a don of his acquaintance who was widely and justly famed for his sunday evenings at home and the pleasure seeking babe determined to go in for a few minutes for like the rest of the university he had a standing invitation to come as often as he could he found himself in a luxuriously furnished room quite full of people and of mixed tobacco smoke his host greeted him effusively and gave him to understand that his cup of happiness was now quite full the gathering was meant to be and succeeded in being altogether heterogeneous and though eminently respectable had a curious but unmistakable flavour of ultra bohemianism about it mr swotcham was sitting on the sofa near the fire talking excitedly to two shaggy individuals whom the babe rightly guessed to be members of the club which he had libellously informed the world was the modern representative of the hell fire club of medmenham abbey he smiled benignantly at swotcham and as he turned away caught the words standpoint of determinism he had not the slightest idea what they meant but they sounded bad by the table nibbling biscuits and helping themselves to tea out of a brass russian samovar were standing three little men with little moustaches talking earnestly together whose only characteristic seemed to be entire ineffectiveness further on a highly coloured italian was expressing fervid thoughts in bad english to two young gentlemen who wore their hair in a great frizzled tuft over their foreheads this latter type was familiar to the babe and afforded him almost infinite delight it went to the stalls in the theatre where dressed in norfolk jackets it talked together in dark allusiveness of music hall artistes it might also be seen in the streets in a very short and ragged gown a broken backed cap with the cardboard showing at the edges not the result of age but of fell and evil design smoking pipes it gave the world to understand that it was the very devil of a type but the world with a charity that is rare considered that though odious it was not morally so black as its self depreciation led it to paint itself arundel prints hung on the walls and somehow looked as incongruous there as mrs chant at a music hall for the whole atmosphere was quite extraordinarily secular against the wall stood three or four large bookcases on the top of which were arranged several admirable reproductions of antique bronzes and marbles in one corner on the top of a scagliola pedestal stood the bust of the young augustus in marble and close to him a bronze narcissus leaned and held up a listening finger on each side of the clock on the mantel piece was a nude figure of a youth in bronze and botticellis madonna of the magnificat looked down at them in mild surprise and seemed to be wondering to what sort of a place she had come from a door on the right came the sounds of the slow movement of beethovens sonata pathtique arranged not as the composer mean it to be played but for a cello a violin and a piano the piano was a little ahead but the violin and cello which were running neck to neck caught up to it in the scherzo that followed and they all finished up amid indescribable indifference on the part of all present a dead heat everyone talked loudly during the performance and took not the slightest notice when it was over with the exception of the genial host who patted all three executants on the back and said awfully jolly charlie to the cellist the duty of a good host without doubt is to make everybody talk and certainly the musicians and mr waddilove between them succeeded to admiration the latter was as ubiquitous and as deft as mr maskelynes hands when he is spinning plates now giving a touch to the discussion on the standpoint of determinism now spurring the italian on to fresh deeds of violence towards the queens english now telling the babe how he too in his earlier years once acted clytemnestra with unparalleled success and now persuading charlie to give him another taste of his cello in fact the only group he did not speak to was that of the three earnest biscuit nibblers who had been joined by a fourth and who appeared to be of no consequence whatever as indeed they were not beyond the room where the music was going on lay another smaller one entirely lined with bookcases from floor to ceiling in one corner stood a screen and the babe having the curiosity to peep over it saw behind mr waddiloves bed presided over by a bronze reproduction of the head of sleep from the british museum on the table stood a liqueur decanter containing a pale pink fluid of which the babe took a glass it reminded him vaguely of almonds and orange peel dissolved in cherry blossom scent and mr waddilove entering at the moment told him it was made exclusively on the estate of count zamboletto near taormina in sicily where he himself had often stayed fresh arrivals kept streaming in among them two or three members of the taf who wandered about looking as if they did not know why they had come including the performer of the overture to tannhaser who sat down at the piano without being asked and did it again he appeared to rouse little or no enthusiasm and left immediately afterwards in the music room the president of the union had got hold of mr waddilove for a moment and was discussing the sanitary arrangements of the union with him and particularly whether it was possible to stop the thefts of nail scissors which went on so extensively in the lavatory and which for no explicable reason he was inclined to hold the indians responsible for he thought that perhaps they collected them in order to barter with them among savage tribes when they went home mr waddilove seemed to take but a faint interest in these petty larcenies but humourously suggested that they should employ some lady bicyclists from slaters detective agency to see if they could catch the thieves that failing he suggested that they should try chaining the scissors to the table or to the looking glass after the manner of bibles in old churches close beside them stood the senior wrangler of the last year talking psychical research with the sub organist of trinity an archdeacon who looked like a sheep that had gone very badly astray was turning over the pages of max nordaus degeneration and close to him an undergraduate with eyebrows meeting over his nose and the face of a truculent rabbit was demonstrating the absurdity of the christian faith to two frightened freshmen who seemed willing to agree to anything he might suggest as the babe passed he heard the words so called resurrection and his smile grew a shade more seraphic the babe wandered back to the outer room where the discussion on the standpoint of determinism or some similar subject was still proceeding shrilly mr swotcham for the moment had the ear of the house and he was speaking rapidly and excitedly in a sort of cracked treble voice and apparently endeavouring to tie his fingers into hard knots they had been joined by three more disputants whom the babe conjectured to be in the running for the apostles for the other three evidently regarded them as promising amateurs rather than professionals he made his way across to the window where he saw mr stewart sitting with a somewhat isolated air this is a very interesting sight babe he said and i was looking out for someone to whom i could talk about it i feel a trifle like st anthony in the desert with all sorts of half understood temptations beckoning to me on one side i hear the siren voice of philosophy calling me to leave the world and live in the realms of pure theory on the other side of the table stand three joyous freshmen in the heyday of youth and animal spirits drinking whisky and water and a fourth with a temerity which i envy a curious pink liqueur on the right you may observe two members of the footlights club who are slaves so they tell each other to their divine mistress art to whom they offer sacrificial burlesques twice a year an archdeacon with the face of a medival saint from a painted glass window has just gone through into the next room where he will hear a pupil of mine preaching atheism i heard someone just now allude to the so called resurrection the chances are a thousand to one that that was he said stewart just behind you an italian is singing the joys of the back streets of naples to two tuft haired absurdities who are sighing to see a little life meantime through the open door i can hear our sub organist playing the overture to parsifal he thinks that if he goes on long enough and plays loud enough the conversation will get a little lower he is wrong the louder he plays the louder will everybody talk in fact he is laying up for them all a store of sore throats to morrow morning and our host whose moral digestion most surely resembles that of an ostrich turns from one to another and is appropriate to all there was also a member of the upper house here just now but he did not stop he had mistaken the character of the entertainment and had come in evening clothes like you but unlike you had brought his wife dcollete his entry was pompous his exit precipitous as for you i have long ceased to be surprised at anything you do but do tell me why you are here the babe looked round appreciatively i dont know im sure i came here because i had been dining at the taf in kings ah purely antidotal said mr stewart not consciously and i stopped i suppose because it amused me surely that is a very good reason the best of reasons my dear babe and when it ceases to amuse you you will go away and i will come with you and i came because it was sunday and here one can shake off the impression that it is sunday though i dont know why one should be able to do so with such conspicuous success as one does somehow in my own rooms everything looks different on sunday and in consequence they are hardly habitable i suppose it is the influence of heredity the rooms are accustomed to generations of dons who always wear black coats on sundays and have a cold lunch ah here is the archdeacon i suppose he has been getting his mind out of its sunday clothes too archdeacons are venerable are they not how do you address them your veneration or your venerance your uncle is a dean is he not babe dont you know i think its your veneree said the babe on the analogy of referee look hes talking to the so called resurrection then he is probably learning a thing or two said mr stewart that young man never comes to see me without instructing me on the whole duty of a tutor which appears to be to do what one intolerable undergraduate tells him for he is intolerable neither more nor less i think i have never met a young man who inspired me with a more searching abhorrence the babe looked at his watch i suppose i shall be gated if i dont go back to trinity soon he said it is not unlikely i will come with you i am drunk with impressions and i want a little moral soda water as we walk babe you shall speak to me of rugby football and drop kicks that i hope will restore my equilibrium i understand now why you play football hitherto it has been a mystery to me it must be very calming to the moral nature so tell me what a punt is xv clytemnestrismos thy warrior comes in regal state what words of welcome for him wife the lips of love the heart of hate the bath the net the knife stories of mycen between his own tripos work which he stuck to steadily and grimly and found by mere force of routine less disagreeable than he expected rugby football the storm and stress of social duties as he called them which meant dining out or having people to dinner five nights out of the seven and constant rehearsals for the greek play the babes time was very fully taken up furthermore on mr gladstones principle though otherwise their principles had nothing in common he always slept for eight and a half hours every night and if as often happened he did not go to bed till two the hours of the morning were somewhat curtailed the babe however did not object to this as the morning seemed to him the really disagreeable part of the day there was something crude and raw about the air until lunch time which made itself felt whatever one was doing it was necessary of course to get through the morning in order to arrive at the afternoon but the shorter it was made the better and by breakfasting late and lunching early one could make it very short indeed he worked at the greek play with extraordinary zeal and perseverance the happy band of directors had begun to see that he knew more about acting than all the rest of them put together though one had seen two hundred and thirty seven different french plays mostly improper and the babe was present throughout every rehearsal sitting in the stalls when he was not on the stage himself and making suggestions whenever they occurred to him mr mackay the second stage director had very strong and original ideas on the subject of cassandra whom he made his special care and he had mapped out exceedingly carefully the gestures tones postures and faces she was to make as the prophetic afflatus gradually gained possession over her she was a tall young gentleman with a most lovely girlish face and about as much knowledge of the dramatic art as of the lunar theory but mackay was indefatigable in coaching her she was to point down with both hands outstretched on the word blood she was to roll her eyes and stare at the centre of the fourth row of stalls at the word apollo she was to make a noise in her throat resembling gargling on the second alas she was to stagger on the third and palpitate on the fourth she was to gaze with agonised questioning at the ophicleide when clytemnestra told her she was mad as if to ask whether he too agreed with her and breathe as if she had just come to the surface after a prolonged dive and from that point onwards she was to cast restraint to the winds she was mad let the audience know it mad people were incoherent and throaty what she said was incoherent let her mode of saying it be as throaty as possible she must continually gargle gurgle mule puke croak creak hoop and hawk and if then she didnt bring down the house well the fault was not hers cassandra who at any rate had a good memory and did blindly what she was told to do had just been through her part with faultless accuracy and was a little hoarse after it and no wonder she had screamed croaked gurgled gargled with pitiless precision and on the last word she uttered her voice by an entirely unrehearsed effort had cracked like a banjo string in a hot room mackay thought this particularly effective and when he heard it was unpremeditated urged her to practise it he patted her on the back as she came off and implied that if she acted like that in the performances they would be very helpful to schyluss reputation the other two stage directors it is true had intermittently indulged in unkind laughter during the performance but cassandra had not heard them and if she had she would not have cared at the end of the rehearsal the babe stayed behind for a few moments to see about his dress and passing across the stage again on his way out found the three stage directors like the king the queen and the executioner in alice in wonderland in hot discussion like alice he was instantly appealed to by all three and asked to give his opinion about cassandra do you want me to say exactly what i think he asked by all means said mackay confidently the babe hesitated a moment i havent criticised cassandra at all he said because i understood she was so to speak preserved also she is rather slow and there would hardly be time for her to learn her part in the way i should suggest and it would be a pity to confuse her mind farther but if you ask what i think she only reminds me of a strong young lady battling for reason against the clutches of delirium tremens the stage director who had seen so many french plays smiled i said drunk he said drunk certainly and also i think beset by the black beetle visions said the babe i daresay inspiration by apollo may be like that but i am afraid to an english audience it will suggest d t i thought she was splendid this morning said mackay well ive told you what i think said the babe what do you advise if there is time i should advise her to remodel herself a little not to choke so much she spits at me like a llama you know not to be so inspired there is too much saliva in her madness i think my dear fellow broke in mackay you miss the whole conception of the part she is mad stark staring mad i daresay im wrong said the babe there was an awkward pause broken by mackay who picked up his coat abruptly very well said he take her in hand yourselves i must be going we rehearse again at five i think a moments silence followed and they all looked at each other with the air of detected conspirators will you help us asked dr propert at length of the babe do you mean will i coach cassandra yes the babe hesitated i dont want to interfere he said but certainly there is room for improvement in cassandra and i dont want mackay to think i am meddling with him i would much sooner not i think mackay wishes it said propert only he didnt like saying so the babe shrugged his shoulders i didnt gather that from his manner but if you can assure me of it i will do my best with her dr propert heaved a sigh of relief too many cooks spoil the broth he said magnanimously we have too many stage directors we all of us really want you to manage the whole thing some one will say your part this afternoon i will myself if you will take the rehearsal alone besides the architecture of the palace is all wrong and i have found a fifth century statue with sandals on there is a cast of it in the museum and i must get it copied we have our hands too full so that afternoon dr propert read out clytemnestras part and the two other stage directors sat meekly in corners and busied themselves with sandals and from the centre of the stalls the babe issued his orders while dr propert read his part in a fine sonorous voice and in a modern greek accent which made the iambic lines so said mackay who had made a special study of ancient metres sound like minor galliambics cassandra exhibited mild surprise when the babe stopped her gurgling and when he forbade her to ogle the place where the ophicleide should be she felt like an unanchored ship drifting helplessly about among quicksands so the babe reserved her for private instruction and told agamemnon not to go like agag there was only a fortnight more before the performance and the babe worked like a horse and like hans mller made miracles the casual visitor to his rooms was likely to be confronted with a raging prophetess or a credulous king in front of whom stood the babe showing them how to rage or how to express the extremes of credulity dr propert found enough to do in superintending the stage properties and the second stage director became a sort of benignant elderly mercury to the babe mackay alone held slightly aloof on the night of the first performance there was a thick palpable atmosphere of nerves abroad like a london fog agamemnon kept repeating his first line over and over again and wiping his hands on his himation and tried to remember that whatever he did he must not clear his throat before he began to speak the calm and prosy argive elders put by their prosiness and became peppery dr propert flew about with altar wreaths in his hands which he deposited carefully in safe places and then forgot where he had put them even the placid moon faced cassandra pricked her fingers violently with her fifth century brooch as for the watchman it was a serious matter for doubt whether his shaking knees would ever take him safely down his somewhat ricketty watch tower the babe alone on whom really the whole responsibility as well as the heaviest part rested towered head and shoulders above the nervous fog and was absolutely his own silly self he caught up agamemnon three minutes before the curtain was to rise and tried to induce him to dance a pas de quatre out of the palace and when agamemnon trembled so that there was imminent risk of the sandals coming off let alone dancing danced a pas seul himself he set mr sykes upon the altar and crowned him with roses he said he couldnt remember a word of his part and proposed to act the execution of mary queen of scots instead or send the audience empty away he peeped through the spy hole of the curtain and said the conductor hadnt come which sent dr propert flying round to see what had happened whereas he had been in his place for ten minutes in fact he crowded as he said into five minutes of glorious life the fatuities of years the effect of all this was that the rest of the company were so completely taken up with deploring his behaviour that they quite forgot to be nervous which was precisely the end which the babe had in view the performance rose to the level of excellence and cassandra maintained it but clytemnestra the pens of the critics failed before clytemnestra they couldnt they confessed do her justice she was a creation a revelation an incarnation she was wonderful marvellous stupendous gorgeous inimitable irresistible unapproachable inexplicable she held the mirror up to nature the up to art and the speculum up to drama this was a little involved and dr propert is responsible a shaggy student from heidelberg who represented his university thought she was a woman and heedless of agamemnons doom fell in love with her on the spot and was disposed to take it as a personal insult that the babe was of the sex that nature made him however as marriage was out of the question he wrote an appreciative article in the heidelberg mittheilungen on clytemnestrismos made in germany contrasting it with agamemnonismos with a great deal about the standpoint of the subjective ego in the presence of objective archaism she held the house she entranced the audience she dominated their imaginations she tore away the veil of realism from in front of idealism whatever that may mean she gilded schyluss conception and enriched his execution she was clytemnestra and then they began all over again with variations every night at the fall of the curtain the babe was called back again and again every night the whole house rose at him like one man and the florist outside the theatre must have realised a competence for the rest of his days it had been a rather dull and uneventful term the university wanted something to go mad about and stark staring mad it went if cambridge had not been in a christian country it would have had a babe cult on the spot his photograph taken at the great moment when he came out with murder beaming from every line of his countenance as the cambridge daily news finely observed and slowly wrung his hands free of the blood that dripped from them was in half the shops in the town for the second time a unique distinction he was in authority in the granta and the cambridge review had a long article entirely about him beginning it must surely have occurred to any thoughtful critic night after night the cry of speech what could have been less appropriate than that clytemnestra should make an english speech after a greek play went up from a crowded house and as regularly the babe bowed and smiled and shook his black wigged head and gracefully declined once it was most indecorous and improper he went so far as to whistle to sykes who was always in attendance and made him bark but otherwise the attempt to get a speech from the babe was as unprofitable as trying to get water out of a stone and his performance was the more remarkable in that he did not repeat himself slavishly acting was an instinct with him and each night he acted as his mood prompted him for instance his manner of entry after the murder changed every night once he stood at the palace door quite silent for nearly a couple of minutes until dr propert turned quite pale with the thought that perhaps the prompter might think that he wanted prompting and spoil the moment wiping his hands slowly and smiling a ghastly smile at the chorus once he came out quickly and threw the axe away from him and plunged into his speech once and an audible horror ran round the house as he did it he broke into the silence by a mirthless laugh as he fondled the axe with which he had done the deed like a mother nursing her child in a word he made it clear that schylus was a most excellent dramatist and that he was a most excellent actor xvi after lunch i shall be by the fire suppose browning there were only three weeks more to the end of the term but as soon as the play was over the babe at once settled down again to his social and historical duties with december a hard frost had set in and football for a time was at a standstill but next to football as an after lunch amusement the babe preferred above everything else a warm room a large chair and congenial company with these objects in view he asked reggie and ealing to lunch with him one day and entirely refused to go out afterwards reggie who had a sort of traditional notion that people always went out after lunch or else they were ill was overruled by the babe who sent his gyp out to order muffins for tea and drew his chair close up to the fire illustration kings parade and caius college but its such a jolly day babe said reggie who was only half persuaded the babe looked out of the window and shuddered by that you mean that there is a horrid smell of frost in the air that the sun looks like a copper plate and that by walking very fast and putting on woollen gloves you can get completely warm with the exception of the end of your nose i hate woollen gloves i hate walking fast and i hate the tip of my nose to be cold i avoid all these things by sitting by the fire fuggy brute about my being a brute said the babe there may be two opinions but fuggy as you call it i am i confess it and i glory in it at the same time im no fuggier than you if you had your way you would go a nasty walk in order to get fuggy we both want to be fuggy and i merely adopt the easiest method of becoming so dear reggie you are so very english you love taking the greatest possible trouble to secure your object that is called the sporting instinct personally i am not troubled with a sluggish liver but if i was i should take a pill that would not suit english people at all instead of taking a pill they take exercise purely medicinally and they always adopt the most circuitous ways of taking it what can be a more elaborate method of guarding against a sluggish liver than spending three thousand pounds on building a tennis court which can only be used by two people at a time what do you play rugger for then why because it is the most expeditious way possible of getting exercise you concentrate into an hour the exercise you couldnt get under half a day if you went a walk i have known you get keen about it said reggie was that only because you admired the expedition with which you were getting exercise the babe yawned well change the subject he said ive been asked to your comby on the th i dont know why a college should celebrate the birthday of their founder by making scurrilous rhymes about each other but im quite glad that they should and i have very kindly consented to come thanks awfully said ealing dont mention it but really its a very interesting point as longridge would say you all go to chapel and they sing zadok the priest then you have a big feed in hall and the whole college assembles together and they libel each other in decasyllable couplets luckily theres no rhyme to babe there are heaps said reggie precipitously i think none talking of longridge he is supposed to be perfecting a plan by which as you walk up to your door you tread on a spring and the door flies open he says it is so tiresome to open a door when your hands are full and his hands always are full it sounds very pleasant said reggie has he tried it yet only once that time his door was already open and when he trod on the spring it shut with i believe quite incredible violence and knocked all his books out of his hands besides hurting him very much and breaking his spectacles youd think that would stop him not a bit he merely rose on the stepping stone of his dead self to higher things it only gave him another new idea he is going to have a second spring inside the door which when trodden on will shut it again after you at least thats what he means to do when he is fit to walk about again at present he is incapacitated i went to see him yesterday his nose is in splints i am so glad i havent an ingenious mind i wouldnt be longridges bed maker if i was paid for it bed makers are paid for it said the babe besides as he truly says if you can have a dumb waiter why not have a dumb bed maker made of some stronger material he never said anything of the kind babe said ealing my dear chap he has said lots of things of the kind you force me to contradict you he hardly ever says anything of any other kind babe will you or will you not come out demanded reggie i will not come out im not going to spoil my tea by going for a horrid walk i wish you would listen to reason the babe murmured something inaudible about there being no reason to listen but when pressed confessed that he had been reading the green carnation and it had affected his brains but reggie following as the babe said that blind instinct which makes us englishmen what we are he was taking liberties with the remarks made by his fellow guest at the taf insisted on going out and taking ealing with him though promising to come back for tea and the babe was left to himself he was conscious of feeling a little flat now that the greek play was over and he half wondered to himself what he had done before it began to get through the time for instance to day it was barely half past three he was not going to dine till eight and he had already done as much work as he meant to do he thought bitterly that dr watts had very much overrated satans powers of invention the upshot was that he fell asleep and reggie and ealing returning an hour later found him stewing contentedly in front of the fire the babe was rather cross at being awakened and he said they smelt horribly frosty also he wished the door to be shut and he was very hungry why were they so unkind and what had he done to deserve this but the muffins came before long and the babe recovered his admirable serenity under the cheering influence of most of them and though your muffin he remarked is said to destroy the coats of the stomach no such ill effects will be experienced if the patient takes enough of them my only misgiving is that i have not taken enough and yet i have taken all how much dinner do you suppose you will be able to eat asked reggie who was still gazing incredulously at the empty dish which the babe had put on the table close to him as much as stewart will be kind enough to give me and his board is usually plentifully spread if he asks me to dinner much oftener i shall feel bound in common gratitude to tell him the truth about my royal visitor in the long i wish id had a photograph of the group taken jack really looked too splendid jack has the makings of a comedian about him said reggie but just now hes very serious there is an epidemic of sapping abroad but if it wasnt sapping it would probably be influenza so we cant complain youre touched with it babe and jacks got it badly i went to see him yesterday and he was analysing the second punic war in a large square note book with notes on the wasps at the other end i know and he was quite angry when i ventured to speak disrespectfully of hannibal he called me a funny ass and implied that hannibal was more than a father to him also he has taken to red ink which is one of the worst signs i went into his room in the dark one day last week and upset something it proved to be a stone bottle of red ink rather larger than a ginger beer bottle and quite full also the cork was out and after that there was no further need for the cork it would have been like locking the stable door when the steed was spilt i mean stolen i pointed that out to him for it was surely consoling to know that no more red ink could be spilt in his rooms unless he was rash enough to buy some more in which case so to speak it would have been on his own head which would be worse than on the carpet but he only murmured caius flaminius secundus and asked if i was sitting on his classical dictionary and were you i think it turned out that he was so i called him a sap and went away i hate a sap said reggie with a certain dignity we used to call a sap a groutbags at my private school said ealing why i dont know what else you could call them i was a groutbags once myself the babe yawned i feel rather futile he said i wanted to be amused and you fellows would go for a walk lets play kiss in the slipper or something i hear you played van john till two this morning said reggie the babe stopped in the middle of his yawn yes a little after two i think we played van john and other things i lost six pounds blow the expense do you know feltham of this college no why oh nothing he was there thats all nice chap nothing particular oh yes quite nice i should think but he went away as soon as we shut up playing i hardly know him in fact i never met him before hullo its seven i must go where are you going only to see a man i know as the apostles say are either of you dining with stewart to night yes i am said reggie at eight isnt it yes be punctual because im so hungry xvii a little game whist is slow but baccarat bites baccarat bites and we want to be bit late comes dawn on these winter nights and you need no knowledge to play at it hotch potch verses in all his life for two years and a half at cambridge and he had associated with very many classes there the babe had never come across any man whom he would suspect of being capable of doing that which necessitated his going to see the man he knew on such an errand as this and he concluded rightly that though such people no doubt occurred they were not to be looked for with any chance of finding them at university towns his errand was not a pleasant one and it was far from being an easy one and when he knocked at felthams door a few minutes afterwards he could not have hazarded the vaguest guess as to what manner of exit he would make the babe was unfortunately strongly possessed by the gambling instinct and when the night before a friend of his had come in after hall and proposed whist if they could get a four the babe said that if they were going to play cards they might as well play something more amusing than whist which seemed to him as a peculiarly unexhilarating mode of enjoying oneself and which he regarded as a practical application of unmixed mathematics if broxton would raise two people to play at something more biting than whist the babe would raise two others the babe raised his two without much delay but broxton returned with only one however he said he had met a chap called feltham who he knew played and should he see whether he could come the babe would have played cards with old gooseberry himself if he could not get anyone else so broxton went off to see whether feltham would play found him in and willing and they played van john for a while until the babe began to yawn and complained he had only lost three and six did they know marmara which was indifferently called only a penny chiefly because it dealt with sums usually much larger than that some of them and among these was feltham did know marmara and the others were willing to learn it so the babe assuring them that no previous knowledge was required proceeded to enlighten them everyone placed a small sum say sixpence or its equivalent in counters in the pool and the dealer thereupon dealt three cards face downwards all around and three to himself he then turned up the next card and you had all your premises thus if for instance the card turned up happened to be a four of diamonds each player in turn had to bet before looking at his three cards which lay face downwards on the table whether they contained a diamond higher than the four his stake was only limited by the sum in the pool unless they chose to fix a smaller limit thus with the four turned up it would probably appear to each player that there was a fair chance of his holding a higher card of the same suit and he would in all likelihood stake pretty well as high as he could he would then turn up his cards and if his hand held a diamond higher than the four he would have the pleasure of taking the amount of his stake out of the pool if not the pain of paying into the pool the same sum the game so said the babe was amusing owing to the fact that it was pure hazard and also because the pool mounted up in a way that would seem to the uninitiated simply incredible an example of this occurred at the fifth deal at the beginning of this deal the pool contained four shillings the babe dealt and turned up the two of spades the first player naturally enough went the pool but his hand very curiously contained only diamonds and he paid four shillings into the pool thus raising it to eight even more naturally since the first player had held no spades the second player again staked the pool his hand contained two hearts and a club and the pool became sixteen shillings it would have been midsummer madness in the third player who was broxton not to stake the pool and as it was november and he was perfectly sane he did so his hand revealed three splendid hearts and the pool rose to thirty two shillings the chances were thus enormously in favour of the fourth player clearing the pool and he accordingly staked it but as he held a diamond and two clubs he paid the pool the equivalent of thirty two shillings in mean bone counters belonging to the babe there was nothing left for the fifth player who was feltham to do but to stake the pool which he did his hand oddly enough contained the seven eight and nine of clubs and he remarked quite unreasonably as he paid sixty four shillings into the pool that the cards had not been shuffled thus the babe who had dealt had a pool of sixty four shillings to win or lose he staked the pool but he held one diamond one club and the ace of spades which counted below the two and he wrote an i o u for sixty four shillings as he had not got enough counters and paid it into the pool remarking that this was better than whist at three penny points then the pool in one deal had mounted from four shillings to one hundred and twenty eight shillings and it was obvious that if a similar deal occurred again now there would be a very considerable sum in the pool at the end of it the babe in these matters was like the athenians somewhat superstitious and he said cheerfully that it was a mounting pool and they would have some amusement the pool showed by its subsequent conduct that he was right and at the end of an hour it held about about half of which had been contributed by feltham whose luck had been abominable this as they were playing at present might be won by anybody since there was no limit to the stakes and the babe with the best possible motives since he was the only one present who would not be somewhat embarrassed by the total loss of his contribution to the pool proposed setting a limit of say twenty five shillings to the stake feltham objected strongly and the alteration was vetoed everyone with the exception perhaps of the babe was a little excited and on edge for when two or three are gathered together to gamble they often generate spontaneously between them this is a sober fact a little demon which hovers about and unsettles their nerves feltham especially hardly spoke except to name his stake and sometimes to swear when he lost it and the babe felt that they were all taking it too seriously and quite spoiling his pleasure for himself he liked a little game because it happened to amuse him but the others were behaving as if they cared whether they won money or lost money and this to the babes thinking spoilt the whole thing the point of gambling according to him was not whether you won money or lost money but the moment when it was uncertain whether you were going to win in the abstract or lose in the abstract the view is wholly unreasonable and so is the gambling instinct it was broxtons turn to deal he dealt badly holding the pack from which he dealt nearly a foot above the table so that if any of them happened to be looking at the cards as they were dealt to him the chances were that he would get a glimpse or a hint of what the under one was and once before that evening the babe had demanded a fresh deal because as his cards were dealt him he could not help seeing the corner of a picture card this time however he was handing a cigarette to feltham who sat on his right but as felthams cards were dealt him the babe saw him look up quickly and he himself saw the face of one of them so far at least that he would have been ready to swear it was a picture card in clubs feltham at the moment seemed to him to open his mouth to speak but said nothing and only glanced hurriedly at the babe who did not look at him again during the game the turn up card was the nine of clubs the first two players naturally enough as there were only four cards out of fifty two which could beat the nine staked a nominal stake merely and turned up their cards one of them held the king of clubs and this would have won leaving only three cards in the pack which could win he took a shilling the amount of his stake out of the pool and said he wished he had trusted to his instinct it was felthams turn he staked which was madness his hand contained the queen of clubs and he won very soon after the babe renewed his proposition that they should limit the stakes and this time there was no opposition and as it was already after one they settled to stop as soon as the pool had been emptied the pool seeing them change their tactics also changed its own and instead of mounting continued to sink steadily every now and then it would go up again by a couple of limit stakes but the constant tendency was to sink and in three quarters of an hour it was empty broxton gathered up the cards and counters and feltham and two of the others said good night and left the room but anstruther and the babe sat down and waited the babe helped himself to whisky tore up his own i o us which he had paid for and there was a long awkward silence broxton got up closed the door and came and stood in front of the fire that fellow cheated he said at last i saw him twice did you notice babe i thought he saw the cards which were dealt him once the turn up was a nine of clubs and he staked it struck me as unusual particularly as the king was already out then he cheated twice as jim said answered anstruther i am convinced he saw his cards once before both times when jim was dealing jim you damned fool said the babe why cant you manage to deal properly were all damned fools i think said broxton what business have we got to ask a fellow to play whom we dont know and who probably cant afford it nor can i said anstruther but i dont cheat are we quite sure he did cheat asked the babe personally i am said broxton arent you anstruther good lord yes well whats to be done asked the babe the men who play with him ought to know said anstruther the babe got up and threw his torn up i o us into the fire rot he said we cant possibly be certain and im not going to ask him to play again in order to watch him that seems to me perhaps one degree lower than cheating oneself its our own fault as jim said for asking him my dear babe we cant leave it as it is no i dont want to do that i only meant that we couldnt tell other people what we suspected unless we were certain and not even then and we cant be certain unless we play with him again and that i dont mean to do what do you propose to do then i propose that one of us tells him what we thought we saw and if he denies it the matter ends there at the same time to make it clear to him that three people separately thought they saw him thought they saw him said broxton certainly thought they saw him i daresay he isnt a bad chap i daresay he was playing for far more than he could afford it is even possible he will confess he did cheat and it is quite possible that we are all wrong and that he didnt personally i certainly thought he did but i wouldnt take my oath on it whos to ask him there was a short silence then i will if you like said the babe thanks babe said jim youd do it better than either of us the babe lit a cigarette and finished his whisky im off to bed he said i would sooner have played old maid than that this should have happened of course none of us say a word about it good night you chaps anstruther and broxton sat on for a bit after the babe had gone its a devilish business said the latter at length but im sure the babe will manage it as well as it can be managed the babe isnt half a bad chap said anstruther no i dont think he is in fact i dont think i ever knew a better are you off good night the babe wrote a note to feltham next morning asking him if he would be in at seven that evening and receiving an affirmative answer it thus came about that he tapped at his door at that hour xviii the confession qui saccuse sexcuse from the french the babes supposition that feltham perhaps wasnt a bad chap was perfectly correct at the same time it is perfectly true that he had cheated at cards which quite rightly is one of the few social crimes for which a man is ostracised he had cheated and he knew it and he was thoroughly honestly and unreservedly ashamed of it he did not try to console himself by the fact that he had never done it before and by the knowledge that he would never do it again because he knew that he would fail to find the slightest consolation in that though it was perfectly true the thing was done and it was past mending twice he had seen the cards or at any rate had a suspicion of one of them when they were dealt him without saying anything on one of these occasions what he had seen did not help him for he saw only a card of another suit but once when he had seen the queen of clubs he traded on it and swindled the company of how he had come to do it he did not know he thought the devil must have taken possession of him and he was probably quite right the temptation was the stronger because he had lost as the babe had suggested much more than he could afford and the thing was done almost before he meant to do it he more than half suspected that the babe had noticed it but to do him justice this suspicion weighed very light in his mind compared with the fact that he had cheated next morning the babes note came and his suspicion that the babe had noticed it took definite form it was no manner of use refusing to see him but what he could not make up his mind about was what answer he should give him to confess it would not help him to make reparation and to return as he honestly wanted to do the he had won and besides it did not seem in anticipation particularly an easy thing to do and when the babe knocked at his door he was still as much in the dark as ever as to what if the babes errand was what he suspected he should say to him the babe accepted a cigarette and sat down rather elaborately he had determined not to remark upon the weather or the prospects of an early dissolution or make any foolish attempts to lead up to the subject and after a moment he spoke i am awfully sorry he said to have to say what i am going to in two words it is this three men with whom you were playing last night at marmara thought that once or twice you saw your cards or one of your cards before you staked i am one of them myself and we decided that the only fair and proper thing to do was to ask you whether this was so i am very sorry to have to say this the babe behaved like the gentleman he was and instead of looking at feltham to see whether his face indicated anything kept his eyes steadily away from him feltham stood a moment without answering and if the babe had chosen to look at him he would have seen that he paused because he could not command his voice but the babe did not choose to do so feltham would have given anything that moment to have been able to say it is true but it seemed to him a physical impossibility on the other hand he felt it equally impossible to take the high line to threaten to kick the babe out of the room unless he went in double quick time etc etc to do any of those things which thorough paced swindlers are supposed to do when their honour is quite properly called in question it is a damned lie he said at length quite quietly and without conviction the babe got up at once and stepped across to where feltham was standing then i wish to apologise most sincerely both for myself and the other two fellows he said and if you would like to knock me down you may i shall of course tell them at once we were mistaken and i believe what you say entirely will you shake hands feltham let the babe take his hand and as the latter turned to leave the room sat limply down in the chair from which the babe had got up but the babe had hardly got half way across the room when feltham spoke again the babes utter frankness had suddenly made it impossible for feltham to let him go without telling him but to tell him now was not made easier by having lied about it please wait a minute he said the babes cigarette had gone out and he lit it again over the lamp then he sat down in the window seat and waited outside the grass was sparkling with frost and the clock chimed a quarter past seven simultaneously feltham spoke i have lied to you as well he said what you saw was perfectly true i cheated twice at least i saw one of the cards dealt me twice and said nothing about it once the card happened to be immaterial and once i staked knowing i should win i have told you all the babe was a person of infinite variety and if those who knew him best had seen him now they would hardly have believed it was he he sat down on the arm of the chair where feltham was sitting and to himself cursed the whole pack of cards from ace to king and above all jim broxton then aloud my poor dear fellow he said im devilish sorry for you feltham who had been expecting to hear a few biting remarks or else merely the door slam behind the babe looked up the babe was looking at him quite kindly quite naturally as if he was condoling with him on some misfortune feltham began damn it all then stopped and without a moments warning burst out crying the babe got up went to the door and sported it then he sat down again on the arm of the chair poor chap he said its beastly hard lines and i fully expect its as much our fault as yours you neednt trouble to tell me you never did it before of course you didnt i fully believe that people who would confess that sort of thing dont do that sort of thing twice it was like this perhaps we were playing for far more than you could afford and you didnt mean to do it until somehow it was done money is a devilish contrivance yes it was just like that said feltham as i told you the first time i saw a card it didnt make any difference though of course i ought to have said so but the second time it did and before i knew what i had done i had cheated why dont you call me a swindler and tell me im not fit to associate with gentlemen its gods truth the corners of the babes mouth twitched its not my concern then what would be the good of saying that he paused a moment hoping that feltham would make a certain suggestion and he was not disappointed look here theres the twenty pounds what can i do with it can you help me the babe thought a moment yes give it me ill see that the other fellows get it somehow if youll leave it to my discretion and you know it sounds absurd for a fool like me to give advice but if i were you i shouldnt play cards for money again its no use running ones head into danger if its not rude what is your allowance two hundred and fifty you bally ass yet i dont know its our fault you couldnt tell that the pool would behave in that manner and i know personally i should find it out of the question to say one was playing for more than one could afford some people call it moral cowardice it seems to me a perfectly natural reticence of course i wont play again said feltham why have you been so awfully good to me i havent what else was i to do oh yes and i think i respected you for telling the truth most fellows would have lied like george washington feltham smiled feebly all that remains is this said the babe of course i must tell those other two fellows about it the two i mean with whom i talked but you can trust them absolutely it is impossible that anyone else should ever know about it you dont think oughtnt i to tell them all stammered feltham the babe frowned of course you ought not why the deuce should you about the money it must be divided up between us all six into twenty about three pound ten each rather an awkward sum why six because there were six of us i cant take any your feelings have nothing to do with it remarked the babe the money in the pool of course belongs to everyone you return the others shares of that and keep your own well ill manage it somehow i will make absurd bets seventy to one in shillings that will surprise nobody i often do it good lord its a quarter to eight if youre going into hall youll be very late and so shall i for my dinner i must go oh by the way did you lose much altogether about twenty five pounds is it is it began the babe i mean are you in a hole if so i wish youd let me lend you some money why shouldnt you no are you sure you dont want some its no use receiving unpleasant letters from ones father when theres no need well as you like good night come round and look me up some time im on the next stair case feltham followed him to the door i cant tell you what i feel he said huskily but i am not ungrateful half an hour ago you asked me to shake hands with you will you shake hands with me why surely said the babe xix in the fifties he sailed his little paper boats and when the folk thought scorn of that he spudded up the waiting worm and yearned towards the masters hat hotch potch verses the babe went off to dress for dinner much relieved in mind now that it was over he confessed to himself that he had been quite certain that feltham had cheated but that he should own up to it was fine and the babe who considered himself totally devoid of anything which could possibly be construed into moral courage respected him for it he also registered a vow that never to the crack of doom which cracked three days afterwards would he play unlimited marmara again and told himself that he was not cut out for the sort of thing that he had just been through and that he was glad it was over he went round at once to tell broxton and anstruther what had happened and after that shook the whole illustration clare college and bridge affair from his mind as a puppy shakes itself after being in the water he was naturally late for dinner and mr stewart who knew the value of soup and also the habits of the babe had not waited when he did appear he was of course perfectly unabashed and took the bottom of the table with unassuming grace the psychology of punctuality he remarked is a most interesting study some day i mean to study it and i shall write a little monograph on the subject uniform with those which sherlock holmes wrote on tobacco ash and the tails of cart horses i think there must be a punctuality bacillus something like a death watch always ticking and if there isnt one i shall invent it it doesnt take to me i am too healthy my dear babe said the stewart you have disappointed me i always hoped that you were the one person i have been looking for so long who has never been punctual but you have been punctual to my knowledge twice once on an occasion in the long when was that interrupted the babe i dont believe it on a memorable occasion at lunch in your own rooms the babe caught reggies eye and looked away oh yes and as clytemnestra you always killed agamemnon with ruthless punctuality i was always hoping to hear him scream during the next chorus but one i did the screaming for him said the babe complacently except on the first night he could only scream like an empty syphon there is nothing more tragic or blood curdling than the scream of an empty syphon said stewart it shrieks to you like a banshee of all the whisky and soda you have drunk the only thing that could shriek worse would be an empty whisky bottle and that cant shriek at all if he really could scream like that you robbed him of a chance of greatness by screaming for him although you screamed very well there are syphons and syphons said the babe he screamed like an empty but undervitalised one which had never really been full babe if you talk about undervitalised syphons during fish said reggie you will drive us all mad before the end of dinner going mad said mr stewart is an effort of will i could go mad in a minute if i wished and the babe certainly determined to go mad when he was yet a boy no offence meant babe i can confidently state that during the three years i have known him he has never for a moment seemed to be really sane i was perfectly sane when i settled to go in for the tripos said the babe you never settled to do anything of the kind you think you did and it is one of your wildest delusions secondly i was sane said the babe when i no you werent put in reggie reggie dont be like longridge but you are quite right i wasnt sane then though i thought i was for the moment longridge is better though he still has a large piece of sticking plaster over his nose said mr stewart he came to see me to day he insisted on arguing with me in spite of my expostulations when he talks i always want to cover him up as one covers up a chirping canary i wish you would do it some day with a piece of green baize you know and a hole in it where the handle of the cage comes out he would continue to make confused noises within said reggie he always makes confused noises said mr stewart wearily confused ingenious noises babe tell me if that champagne is drinkable the babe drank off his glass obviously he said but its no use asking me all champagne seems to me delicious i drink millers cheapest for choice a small withered don who was sitting next the babe and had not previously spoken here looked up a nice dry light wine he said the babe started violently and if he had not just emptied his glass of champagne he would certainly have spilled it he explained afterwards that he really had forgotten that anyone was occupying the chair on the right this curious old gentlemen one of the few surviving specimens of this particular type of elderly don had the classical name of moffat and mr stewart at once introduced him to the babe a ceremony which had escaped his memory before and mr moffat who had been shivering on the brink of conversation all dinner decided to plunge in i saw your performance of the agamemnon last week he said i hope you enjoyed it said the babe politely the stage is not what it was in me young days said mr moffat the babe looked interested and waited for further criticisms but the old gentleman returned to his dinner without offering any his face looked as if it was made of cast iron painted with aspinalls buff coloured enamel there was a short silence and mr stewart looking up saw that the babe was fighting like a man against an inward convulsion of laughter his face changed from pink to red and a vein stood out on his usually unwrinkled brow stewart knew that when the babe had a fit of the giggles it was so to speak no laughing matter and he made things worse by asking mr moffat how his sister was at this point the babe left the room with a rapid uneven step and he was heard to plunge violently into the dishes outside stewart had been particularly unfortunate in his choice of a subject because what had started the babe off was the very thought that mr moffats sister was no doubt the original miss moffat and he had been rashly indulging in wild conjectures as to what would happen if he said suddenly i believe your sister doesnt like spiders mr moffat had resumed the subject of the greek play when the babe returned he seemed not to have noticed his ill mannered exit and was finding fault with the chorus particularly with the leader who in the person of reggie was sitting opposite him of this however he had not the slightest idea i call them a dowdy crew he said they were dressed like old baize doors not me idea of a chorus at all but it was all very creditable very creditable indeed and we have to thank me young friend here for a very fine performance of clytemnestra why me sister here the babe gasped for a moment like a drowning man but recovered himself bravely me sister came down next morning at breakfast and said shed hardly been able to sleep a wink hardly a wink for thinking of clytemnestra the babe made a violent effort and checked himself im so sorry he said with his most engaging manner i hope you will apologise to her for me not at all not at all said mr moffat its me own opinion she slept far more than she knew but she was always nervous the babe bit his tongue easily upset a very good pheasant mr stewart a very good pheasant thank ye yes a glass of champagne a glass of wine with you heh heh clytemnestra mr moffat as the babe allowed afterwards was a very pleasant old gentleman when dinner was over and he had settled himself into an arm chair by the fire smoking one of stewarts strongest cigars he told several stories about the old generation of dons whom he had known there was an old fellow of kings he was saying in me undergraduate days who must have been eighty and never a night had he spent out of cambridge since he came up as an undergraduate an infidel old lot he was many a time ive seen him in the evening when the worms were come out on the grass plot hobbling about and trying to kill them with the point of his stick he used to talk to them and make faces at them and say ah damn you you havent got me yet a queer lot they all were not the worms i mean heh heh but the old dons there were two others who had been great mathematicians in their time and they used to spend their evenings together doing what do you think making paper boats sir which they went and sailed on the cam next day they would start them from the kings bridge and sail them down to the willow at the other end of the lawn and such quarrels as they had over which had won one of them one morning his name was jenkinson if im not mistaken an old yorkshireman got so heated over it for he said the other boat had fouled his as if they were racing for a cup that he went for the other man by gad sir he went for him and tried to push him into the river but the other his name was keggs was too quick for him and stepped out of the way and head over ears into the river went jenkinson himself being unable to stop himself sir by reason of the impetus he had got up the river isnt over deep there as you know perhaps two feet deep and he stood up as soon as he could find his feet and bawled out ah misdoot yeve drooned me keggs the babe was delighted do tell me some more he said when mr moffat had finished laughing himself which he did in a silent internal manner ah some of those old fellows did things not quite fit for boys to hear about maxima reverentia eh mr stewart but there was an irishman a fellow of clare too in my time i might tell you about him he used to live in the rooms above the gate he had a quarrel with the master and as often as the master went in and out of the gate egad the old chap would try to spit on his head if the master was out to dinner he would wait up sitting in his window till he came back be it eleven oclock or twelve or later than that at last the master had to put up an umbrella when he walked under the gate of his own college and then the old fellow would shout out come out o that ye ould divil and let me get at ye a disreputable old crew they were ah well its half past ten elevens me bedtime and i must be going good night to you mr stewart and many thanks for your kind hospitality and good night to you sir he said turning to the babe i heard them shout clytemnestra good old clytemnestra after you all down the street and you deserved an ovation sir you richly deserved an ovation and im glad you got it after mr moffats departure they settled down again and stewart remarked youve made a conquest babe but you behaved abominably during dinner i couldnt help it i could think of nothing but miss moffat on the top of that you enquired about his sister i ask you what was i to do you neednt have danced in the dishes outside said reggie i only danced in the soup and wed finished with the soup and theres a soupon of it on my shut up pumps continued the babe may i have some whisky thanks for what im going to receive what a funny undergraduate moffat must have been i believe he was born like that said stewart i know when i came up ten years ago he was just the same thats the best of getting old early you dont change any more thats one for you babe remarked reggie the babe is the imperishable child said stewart you called me a man of the world the other day said the babe in self defence i think not you did really however well pass it over by the way babe you are corrupting the youth of the college two men went into their lodgings last night at ten minutes past two it transpired that they had been playing cards with you well it is true that i was playing cards last night but they could have gone away earlier if they had wished your fascinations were probably too strong said reggie now youre being personal and possibly sarcastic said the babe with dignity i must go to bed i was late last night the night is yet young babe said stewart so am i but if i dont go i shall continue to drink whisky and soda and smoke you are welcome how is the tripos work progressing oh its getting on said the babe hopefully a little at a time you know but often im not one of those people who can work five hours at a stretch i suppose not is it to be a second or a third i believe there are three classes in the tripos said the babe stiffly you have only mentioned two well yes perhaps one of your small cigarettes would not hurt me but i must go at eleven because i am sapping oh isnt that the shop girl on the table there are some awfully good songs in it may i go and get my banjo do i got it expressly for you to sing the babe slept his usual eight and a half hours that night he did not awake till xx the babes minor diversions where three times slipping from the outside edge i bumped the ice into three several stars tennyson the frost continued black and clean and the babe like the polar bear thought it would be nice to practise skating he bought himself a pair of dowler blades with mount charles fittings which he was assured by an enthusiastic friend were the only skates with which it was possible to preserve ones self respect and fondly hoped that self respect was a synonym for balance hitherto his accomplishments in this particular line had been limited to what is popularly known as a little outside edge but reggie who was a first rate skater undertook his education the babe however refused to leave his work altogether alone for he was beginning to be seriously touched with the sapping epidemic and he and reggie used to set off about one taking lunch with them to the skating club of which reggie was a member and of which the babe was not sykes only went with them once and he would not have gone then had it been possible to foresee that he would put skates in the same category as croquet balls and bathers but it was soon clear that he did he made a bee line for the unemployed leg of professor robertson who was conscious of having done the counter rocking turn for the first time in his life without the semblance of a scrape and brought him down like a rabbit shot through the head the babe hurried across to the assistance of the disabled scientist and dragged sykes away but sykes had his principles and as he dared not use threats to the babe he implored almost commanded him not to put on his skates sykes dear you are a little unreasonable said the babe pacifically reggie what are we to do with sykes there was nearly one scientist the less in this naughty world the cab in which they had driven up was still waiting and at reggies suggestion sykes was put inside and driven back to the stable where he slept the babe wobbled industriously about trying to skate large and not deceive himself into thinking that a three was finished as soon as he had made the turn and reggie practised by himself round an orange waiting for a four to be made up until the babe ate it about the third day the babe was hopelessly down with the skating fever which went badly with the sapping epidemic he took his skates round to kings in the evening after skating all day for the sapping epidemic was rapidly fleeing from him like a beautiful dream at the awakening and skated on the fountain he slid about his carpet trying to get his pose right he put his looking glass on the floor and corrected the position of the unemployed foot he traced grapevines with a fork on the tablecloth and loops with wineglasses he dreamed that he covered a pond with alternate brackets and rocking turns and woke up to find it was not true he even watered the pavement outside his rooms in order to get a little piece of ice big enough for a turn with the only result that the bed maker coming in next morning fell heavily over it barking her elbow and breaking the greater part of the china she was carrying which as the babe said was happily not his unfortunately however the porter discovered it as he brought round letters and ruthlessly spread salt thickly over it while the baffled babe looked angrily on from the window snow fell after this and the babe proposed tobogganing down market hill he talked it over with reggie and they quarrelled as to which was the top of the hill and which the bottom for it would never do said the scrupulous babe to be seen tobogganing up hill and on referring the matter to a third person it was decided that the hill was perfectly level so that they were both right and both wrong whichever way you chose to look at the question the kings comby which is an abbreviation for combination and means junior combination room but takes place in quite a different apartment went off satisfactorily the babe secure in the knowledge that there was no rhyme to babe in the english language his other name which i have omitted to mention before was arbuthnot and it would require an excess of ingenuity to find a rhyme even to that made scurrilous allusions most of them quite unfounded about his friends in vile decasyllables and enjoyed himself very much later in the evening he with two of the performers in the original play acted a short skit on the agamemnon in which he parodied himself with the most ruthlessly realistic accuracy and killed agamemnon in a sponging tin with the aid of a landing net and a pair of scissors last of all he disgraced himself by stamping out in the snow in enormous letters the initials of a popular and widely known don of the college with such thoroughness that the grass has never grown since and the initials are to be seen to this day to witness if i lie the proceedings terminated about three in the morning and the babe was left waiting for some minutes outside the porters lodge at trinity while that indignant official got out of bed to open the gate to him the babe ought to have caught a bad cold but with an indefensible miscarriage of justice it was the porter who caught cold and not he and the babe observed cynically when he heard of it that the memory of the dog in the nursery rhyme that bit a man from islington in the leg and then died itself had at last been avenged christmas the babe announced fell early that year and consequently he with several others stayed up till christmas eve when they were allowed to stay no longer he had gone up to town for two days to play in the university rugby match which he had been largely instrumental in winning for the ground was like a buttered ballroom floor a state of things which the babe for some occult reason delighted in and for an hours space he proceeded to slip and slide and gloom and glance in a way that seemed to paralyse his opponents and resulted in cambridge winning by two tries and a dropped goal the dropped goal was the babes doing theoretically it had been impossible for he appeared to drop it out of the middle of a scrimmage but it counted just the same and he had also secured one of the tries the sportsman for december th gives a full account of the match also the babes portrait in which he looks like a cross between a forger and a parricide on returning to cambridge in order to be up to date he and some friends went out carol singing one night visiting the heads of colleges and the houses of the married fellows the babe acted as showman and spoke broad somersetshire which interested a certain philologist who had no suspicion that they were not town people very much the babe declared that his father and grandfather had lived in barnwell all their lives and that he himself had never even attempted to set foot out of cambridgeshire except once on the august bank holiday when he had intended to go to hunstanton but had missed the train at this point however the philologist winked and said mr arbuthnot i believe they collected in all seventeen shillings and eightpence which they settled should be given to a local charity but the babe as he counted the amount over with trembling avaricious fingers looked up with a brilliant smile as he announced the total and exclaimed not a penny of that shall the poor ever see they also got what rudyard kipling calls lashings of beer at several houses and bill sykes who had been coached to carry a small tin into which offerings of money were put by the open handed householder was without a shadow of reason filled with so uncontrollable a fit of rage at the sight of the cook at one of the houses in selwyn gardens who patted him on the head and called him a pretty dear that he dropped the tin mug and nipped her shrewdly in the parts about the ankle reggie parted from the babe at the station the latter going to london and reggie to lincolnshire the babe travelled first because he said sykes refused to go second or third but that intelligent animal poking his nose out from under the seat just as the guard was taking the tickets was ignominiously hauled out and compelled to go in the van which cannot be considered as a class at all xxi a day in the lent term o this drear march month kingsley jack marsden stopped for a moment under the babes window and called illustration musical notation ba abe and the babes face looked out vindictively if you call me like that i shant answer he said youre not in clare so jack went in and found the babe curled up again in a large chair close to the fire working the month was february which is equivalent at cambridge to saying that it was raining cold sleety impossible rain as the exact day of the month was the sixteenth it followed as a corollary that it had been raining for at least sixteen days and as it was leap year it would continue to rain thirteen more well said the babe unencouragingly he had gone to bed early the night before and the consequent length of the morning made him rather cross oh nothing its raining you know the sportsman says that jupiter pluvius is in the ascendant still he sends the snow in summer he sends the frost in may to nip the apple blossoms and spoil our games of play quoted the babe just so and he doesnt neglect to send the rain in february ive just come back from kings reggies in a bad temper almost as bad as you why weather chiefly he says it would be grovelling flattery to call it beastly reggie is given to making truisms said the babe turning over the page jack i wish youd go away i want to work besides youre so devilish cheerful and im not sorry to hear it oh yes and reggie told me to remind you that you are playing tennis with him at twelve hes got the new court the babe brightened up there was an hour less of morning hurrah that will suit me excellently many thanks and please go away good bye stewart confessed that the babe had surprised him most people who knew the babe were never surprised at him because they always expected him to do something unexpected but no one had ever supposed that he would do anything so unexpected as to work steadily every day it would not have been so surprising if he had worked twelve hours a day twice a week but that he should work four hours every day upset all preconceived ideas about him he had done so for a full month and really there seemed no reason now why he should stop he got up before nine and he worked from ten till one at one he would be himself again till six but he would work from six till seven stewart considered this exhibition as a striking imitation by nature of mr r l stevensons jekyll and hyde he had not clearly realised before that the babe had a dual nature just now he considered hyde to be painfully predominant for that the babe should cease being absurd for four hours a day seemed to him a sacrifice of the best possibilities of his nature but the babe like mr gladstone in one thing more threw off all thoughts of such matters except during work hours and having determined to put in an extra hour in the afternoon to make up for tennis in the morning he trotted off through the dripping drizzling rain to the tennis court in the best of spirits he went back to lunch with reggie in kings hall and as contrary to all precedent the rain had stopped they went for a walk afterwards round two or three football grounds to see what was going on and give mr sykes an airing scratch games seemed the order of the day and they took situations on outside wings opposite each other for a few minutes in the game on the kings ground until reggie charged the babe and knocked him down after which they retired dirty but invigorated then they turned into the tennis court again for a while and so by burrells walk across the town bridge and back into trinity street looked in at the shop windows which are perhaps less alluring than any others in the kingdom and admired the preparations for diverting the sewerage of the town from the cam but how said the babe our college boats will be able to row in a perfectly empty river bed is more than i feel fit to tell you theyll keep up the water by shutting the locks said reggie vaguely but no shutting of locks reggie will ever repair the drought caused by the cessation of the drains theres the master of trinity take off your hat he wont see you i really wish sykes wouldnt always smell masters of colleges it makes them nervous they think indirectly that its my fault bill you idiot come here bill having come to the conclusion that there were not sufficient grounds to warrant the masters arrest reluctantly dismissed the case though he would have liked bail and trotted after the babe the latter had just discovered that life was not worth living without a minimum thermometer which he saw in a chemists window and had to go and buy it they passed up to the left of whewells court by the churchyard without a church and into jesus lane in order to deposit sykes again at his stables and then as tea time was approaching turned back towards trinity and for our tea said the babe we will go to the pitt where it may be had cheaply and comfortably and we can read the telegrams which as far as i have observed deal exclusively with steeplechase races and the state of the money market i noticed that money was easier yesterday i am so glad it has been terribly difficult lately but if it is easier no doubt the financial crisis between me and my father which i expect at the end of this term will be more capable of adjustment at present i fear my creditors will find me like moist sugar fourpence the pound do you suppose there are any races going on at newmarket we might drive over i feel as if a little carriage exercise would do me good heres jim jim always knows about races he was born i mean dropped at esher jim is there any racing going on at newmarket why do you look so disgusted its so likely that flat races should be going on now said jim oh well it cant be helped said the babe what nice brown boots youve got have you been out on your gee gee looks rather like it i thought so said the babe were going to have tea do you know reggie jim reggie reggie jim met before said jim ta ta babe ive got a coach at four the babe according to custom weighed and measured himself found as usual that no change had taken place since yesterday put his hat on the head of the bust of pitt whence it clattered on to the floor let the door into the smoking room swing to in reggies face and ordered tea a group of three or four men before the fire were talking about someone called pocohantas who turned out on enquiry to be a horse and the babe expressed himself willing to lay current odds about anything in the world he and reggie strolled back in the dusk and parted at the gate of trinity the babe went to work till hall and after hall played picquet with anstruther whom he fleeced capotting him once and repiquing him twice in an hour and discussed with him the extraordinary dulness of the lent term and the impossibility of making it any livelier its a sort of close time said the babe for things of interest i dont know why it should be so but every day is exactly like every other day and they are all dull i feel eclipsed all the lent term i make a show of gaiety but it is all hollow i suppose really one does depend a good deal on things like cricket and football and fine weather one doesnt know it at the time but one misses them when they are not there youve taken to sapping you oughtnt to mind on the contrary i mind all the more when ive done a mornings work i come out fizzing with being corked up so long and nothing happens to my fizz it loses itself in the empty and infinite air dont be poetical babe for instance continued the babe what am i to do now ive had enough picquet and ive got nothing to say and ive worked enough and i dont want to go to bed all right dont go to bed sit and talk to me but i dont want to talk said the babe volubly theres nothing to talk about ive played tennis ive worked ive taken sykes for a walk and thats all really one must be extraordinarily clever to be able to talk day after day all ones life how does one do it a priori one would expect to have said all the things one has got to say by the time one was twenty and im twenty one yet i am not dumb yet one doesnt talk about things that happen and most people and i am one myself never think at all so they cant talk about what they are thinking about give me some whisky and soda perhaps as mulvaney says it will put a thought into me i hate mulvaney worse than i hate learoyd and that is worse than i hate ortheris as for mrs hawksbee thats another story soda is like a solution of pin points it pricks one all over the mouth i wonder if it would do as well to put ordinary pins into water i shall ask longridge what he thinks about it now hes an exception he does nothing but think you can hear the machinery clicking inside him he thinks about all the ingenious things hes going to do and all the ingenious things nobody else would think of doing they dont come off mostly because the door hits him in the face or the gum wont stick thanks when do you know stewart is beginning to think i shall get through the tripos and he warned me not to work too much he says that i shall by all precedents in such matters get brain fever and consumption and that my sorrowing friends will kneel round my expiring bedside you see what i mean on the morning the tripos lists are announced and shout out above the increasing clamour of my death rattle you are senior historian and that my reform from the wild young spark to the pale emaciated student will all date from one evening last year at the savoy when he said he would only take the longest odds if he had to bet on my getting through and did you give him long odds no i wouldnt have bet against myself even then for the simple reason that one never knows how much one can try until one has tried if you dont believe in yourself nobody will believe in you not that i do believe in myself for a moment any more than i believe in in anybody else you see six months ago i shouldnt have believed it possible that i should work steadily four hours or more a day i think i shall take to spectacles and go for grinds on the grantchester road i believe thats the chic thing to do in sapping circles fancy waking up some morning to find oneself in a sapping circle i wonder what saps think about sap probably oh yes certainly sap either thucydides or binomial theories or is it theorems or aortas babe let us meditate on aortas for a time by all means i wonder what an aorta is yes thanks but only a mouthful as reggie says thats because he has such a big mouth i say i wish i had an object in life it must be so interesting liver said anstruther brutally take a pill what do you want an object in life for oh i dont know it would be something to play about with when one didnt want to talk or see other people i suppose a conscience would do as well i havent either you said ten minutes ago that you didnt want to talk since then i have only been able to get in an occasional word edgewise the babe laughed and finished his whisky yes im very sorry its a great misfortune not to be able to be silent its not my fault i shant take a pill i shall go to bed instead i always used to think that the grave as little as my bed was an independent sentence and meant literally what it said not that it meant much do you ever lie awake no of course not i can understand the difficulty of keeping awake but not of going to sleep i lay awake nearly five minutes last night said the babe and so i thought i was going to be ill but i wasnt at least not at present i suppose people who lie awake think i always fancied they only swore in that case there would be nothing gained im getting silly good night xxii before the tripos and when the bowler sent a ball off which none else would try to score he did not seem to care at all but hit it very high for four hotch potch verses the babe was lying at the bottom of a canadian canoe on his back singing low to his beloved at least he was not exactly singing but swearing gently at sykes who had laid himself down on his stomach and the day was too hot to have bulldogs on ones stomach the babe about an hour ago had landed to see if reggie was in and finding his rooms empty and ungarnished tied his canoe up to the bank to sleep and read a little ravenshoe for an hour but it had slipped its cable and as he had left the paddle on the bank it had required only a few moments reflection to convince him that he was hopelessly and completely at the mercy of the winds and waters like dana the mother of perseus in her wooden chest and that his destiny was no longer in his own hands as then there was nothing whatever to be done he did nothing in serene content he would soon bump against the arches of clare bridge but until that happened there was no step he could possibly take it was just three days before his tripos began and the babe with a wisdom beyond his years was taking three complete holidays he argued that as it already seemed to him that his brain was one turbid mass of undigested facts and dates the best thing he could do was not to swallow more but to let what he had settle down a little for a fortnight before he had been working really hard going over the ground again and for the next three days he meant neither to think nor do anything whatever as he expressed it himself after last sunday morning chapel i am going he said to eat and sleep and do and be simply that which pleases me he was roused by a loud injured voice not far off shouting look ahead sir and he sat up his boat as is the ineradicable habit of canadian canoes had drifted broadside across the river and was fouling the course of an outrigger which was wanting to come up im very sorry shouted the babe but ive lost my paddle hallo feltham is that you its me babe what can i do for you and what do you mean by fouling my waterway where is your paddle the babe looked round oh its up there on the bank by the kings bridge cant i catch hold of the tail of your boat then you might tow me up there all right but dont call it a tail as some rowing man will hear you and have a fit let me get clear are you slacking to day yes and for the next two days my tripos begins on monday and i think that if i do nothing for a day or two i may be able to remember again who the electric sophia was is she important she sounds as if she might be the wife of the man who discovered lightning dont confuse me further said the babe where are you off to oh up the river theres no cricket to day i didnt know that people who played cricket ever rowed they dont for the most part but i dont consider that a reason for not doing so if i wish are you playing for the varsity on monday they have been polite enough to ask me and you have very civilly consented well good bye the babe sat in his canoe for half an hour or more and got through a little ravenshoe and a little meditation the meditation concerned itself chiefly with feltham who as was universally acknowledged was the best of good fellows quiet steady thoroughbred and these things gave the babe some pleasure not ill deserved to think over for feltham had been known primarily as a friend of his and when he was tired of meditating he tied up his canoe again and walked up to the kings field for his college was playing kings and he was certain of finding company whichever side was in it turned out that kings was in that enviable position and of kings reggie and a careful little man in spectacles reggie could not by the most partial of his friends be called a cricketer but the most impartial of his enemies would have had to confess that he often made a great many runs he had a good eye he saw the ball and he helped it to fulfil its destiny by hitting it hard more particularly did he hit balls on the off which ought to be left alone and he always hit them high in the air over long slips head it really did not seem to matter where long slip was placed for he always hit the ball over his head and out of reach straight balls he subjected to a curious but very vigorous mowing process which took them swiftly past the umpires nose a straight yorker invariably got him out if he knew it was a yorker and tried to play it so that when he saw one coming he held his bat perfectly firm and rigid and quenched it but if it did not occur to him that the ball was a yorker he treated it with cheerful contempt and hit it somewhere which surprised no one more than himself it seemed to be the recognised thing that he should be given three lives as at pool and as at pool if he used them up quickly he was frequently allowed to star and have two more a sort of extra square leg specially designed for his undoing had just given him his fourth life when the babe appeared and reggie scored three runs over it the field luckily could be arranged solely with a view to catching him for the careful little man in spectacles only scored singles and those by hitting balls with extreme caution just out of reach of cover point the babe enjoyed watching cricket especially the sort of game that was going on now one bowler was extremely fast the other incredibly slow and reggie hit them both in the air with perfect impartiality and the careful little man played them both with as much precision and delicacy as if he was playing spillikins however a few overs later though his own score was small he did reggie and so indirectly his side a signal service the latter had hit a fast ball almost quite straight up in the air and extremely high and they both started on a forlorn run point and wicket keep both ran to it and the careful little man charged violently in between them exactly at the crucial moment as they were both standing in front of his wickets with the result that out of the midst of chaotic confusion the ball fell innocuously to the ground the careful little man went to the pavilion for a new pair of spectacles after being given not out for obstructing the field which he certainly had been doing and point and wicket keep cursed him and each other and reggie thanked them all this was the last ball of the over so reggie still had the bowling the slow bowler prepared for him a ball with an immeasurable break from the off upon it but reggie very wisely danced gaily out onto the middle of the pitch turned straight round and hit it so severe a blow that the wicket keep in whose direction it was travelling had only just time to get out of the way it narrowly missed reggies own wicket but a miss is as good as four runs when it is hit hard enough and this one was but the service he often did his side and was doing now could not be fairly measured merely by the runs he scored for the demoralising effect he always had on the field was worth fifty extra after a certain number of catches have been missed and a large number of balls hit high in the air just out of reach of a field a side begins unconsciously to think kismet and withal to grow discontented and a side that thinks kismet is lost reggie was out seventh wicket down having made sixty two and as there was only another half hour to the drawing of stumps he left the game and walked down with the babe they were going to dine together and go to the theatre to see a touring mrs tanqueray to the babes great delight the theatrical tuft hair was in great force and between the acts he wandered about in the passage listening rapturously to the fragments of their conversation there was one in particular who had sat next the babe markedly worthy of study his gown was about eighteen inches long and his cap out of which he had carefully abstracted every particle of board drooped gracefully at all its corners he was in dress clothes with a smoking coat not in a norfolk jacket and he wore a large diamond solitaire and a red cummerbund he was evidently a king among his kind and several of them crowded round him as he came out between the acts and admired him they called him johnny and he called them johnny individually and johnnies collectively and the babe listened to them with a seraphic expression of face arfly parful isnt it i say johnny give me a light old redfarns put up a notice about not smoking in the passage i shall rag him about it that gurls pretty good isnt she looks rather nice too youre quite mashed on her old chappie but shes not a patch on mrs pat johnny cant think of anything but mrs pat i say lets go and have a drink all right johnny stands drinks the gurl at the bars an awful clipper johnny will drop his pipe and get her to pick it up for him well come on you johnnies theres only ten minutes keep an eye on johnny the babes eye followed them as they walked off to the bar with rapturous enjoyment arent they heavenly said he to reggie oh i wish i was like that it must be so nice to feel that one is the light and leading of the whole place and really knows what life is i wish i knew what life was i wonder how they get their hair to stick out like that how i have wasted my time i too might have been a johnny by now if id cultivated them reggie do come to the bar i want to gaze and gaze on them but reggie refused he said they made him sick and the babe told him that he regarded things from the wrong standpoint you know said the babe theyve persuaded each other that they are the very devils of fellows they really believe it what a thing it is to have faith they will talk quite fluently to the barmaid i remember so well trying to see whether i could i couldnt i knew i couldnt all the time i have never felt so hopelessly bored in so few minutes they think its wicked and they think that they rag their tutors the poor tutors are men of no perception for they havent the least idea they are being ragged there they all come again their faces shine with deviltry did you hear them talk about mrs pat they meant mrs patrick campbell you know youre no better babe said reggie you used to want people to think you wicked oh but thats quite different you cant say that i was ever the least like a johnny i never had the courage fancy being as brave as they are and oh fancy deliberately sitting down and taking all the stuffing out of your cap in order to be a blood ill take yours out if youll take mine babe theres the bell we must go in again the babe went to see stewart when he went back to trinity the latter thoroughly approved of his holiday you are giving yourself a little space he said in which it may be hoped you will forget or rather assimilate a few of the useless and ugly things which our system of examinations has compelled you to learn a historian is not a person who knows masses of facts and dates but a man who has built a structure upon them the facts are the scaffold which disappears when the house is built and the tripos turns out a quantity of promising young men who can only build scaffolds i wish i was examining there should be no questions with dates in them and they should all begin trace the tendency or indicate in a great many words the influence i wish i felt more certain about my scaffold my dear babe dont vex your soul possess it in peace i would give long odds on your getting through what i did not expect was that you should have taken the distasteful steps that lead to so immaterial a result you got a second in your last mays didnt you do let us talk of something a little more interesting than triposes well i didnt introduce the subject said the babe what have you been doing this evening ive just been to the second mrs tanqueray with reggie an interesting medical case remarked stewart i believe the author consulted an eminent nerve doctor as to how many months living with aubrey tanqueray would drive an excitable female to suicide he thought six but as the author wished her to do it in less he had to introduce other incentives aubrey tanqueray would drive me to madness in a week and to suicide in eight days he handed her toast at the scene at breakfast as if he was giving her a slice of some cardinal virtue with the blessing of the pope spread on it like butter the real motif of the play though the british public havent known it is her growing despair at being wedded to him and the immediate cause is the second mr tanquerays noble forgiveness of her when she was found to have tampered with the letter bag he treated her like a candidate for confirmation instead of boxing her ears and said that the incident only served to draw them closer together or something of the kind apparently if you commit a sufficiently mean action towards a person who really loves you he will be delighted and love you the more for it it sounds a little jesuitical baldly stated who wrote the play pinero wasnt it pinero is obviously the future from pinsum i am a pin the babe laughed i didnt attend to the play much he said there was an undergraduate sitting next me who was more interesting he wore a red cummerbund ah yes murmured mr stewart the kind that talks to the female in tobacconists shops and sits on the counter as it does so its father is usually one of natures gentlemen who has married a perfect lady the two always marry each other and in the next generation the females dress in liberty fabric and the males congregate at the smaller colleges they are on the increase i suppose its an instance of the survival of the filthiest mr stewart rose from his chair and crossed over to the window seat where the babe was sitting what can i do to amuse you babe he said i feel that it is the duty of all your friends to distract your thoughts from all subjects for the next two days shall i play cards with you you shall teach me or shall we talk about the epsom meeting or the adc i suppose you are going to act in the may week why not act hamlet and we will persuade longridge to be ophelia there is something sublimely inconsequent in the way ophelia distributes artificial flowers to the company which reminds me of longridge in his soberer moments i have been very much tried by longridge to night he asked me to help him to sing glees in the roundabout can you imagine longridge and me sitting side by side in the roundabout singing three blind mice i could imagine it so vividly that i didnt go the babe laughed you can give me whisky and soda and then i shall go to bed it is twelve and i must practise being dressed and breakfasted by nine does it require much practice i should think about twenty minutes every morning what is the use of doing a thing you have got to do before you have got to do it it is like cutting yourself with a knife to accustom yourself to a surgical operation there are points of similarity said the babe i shall go to bed now for all that as soon as ive drunk this xxiii the lists list o list shakespeare the babe and reggie were sitting outside the pavilion at fenners watching the university against the gentlemen of england who as the babe said so far from sitting at home at ease were running out to felthams slow bowling and getting caught and stumped with very enjoyable frequency the cricket was a delightful mixture of a fine bowling performance and very hard hitting which to the uneducated spectator is perhaps the most lively of all to watch feltham had in fact from the babes point of view just sent down the ideal over the first ball was hit out of the ground for six the second bowled the hitter round his legs the third ball was hit by the incomer for four and the fourth for four the fifth ball he also attempted to hit as hard as he could to square leg and he was caught at point in the manner of a catch at the wicket the babe tilted his hat over his eyes and gave a happy little sigh reggie the tripos is the secret of life he said if you want to get a real feeling of leisure and independence a feeling that you have been told privately by the archangels to amuse yourself and do nothing whatever else go in for the tripos or rather wait till you come out i suppose that considering my years i have wasted more time than most people and i thought i knew what it felt like but i didnt i had no idea how godlike it is to do nothing to have breakfast and feel that it wont be lunch time for four hours and after that to have the whole afternoon before you when are the lists out oh in about ten days now dont talk about lists tell me how long you worked this morning tell me about the man in your college who works ten hours every day and eleven hours every night tell me of the difficulty of learning by heart the roman emperors or the kings of israel and judah assure me that by knowing the angle of the sun above the horizon and the length of felthams shadow you could find out how tall the umpire is hes about five foot ten said reggie thats like the answers i used to give to the questions about the hands of a watch said the babe they tell you that if the hands of a watch are together at twelve theres no if about it it is never otherwise when will they be together next i always said about five minutes past one it seems absurdly simple ive often noticed them together then and the same remark applies to about ten minutes past two that reminds me added the babe looking at his watch that its twenty five minutes past five the hour hand seems to have gained a little oh i remember said reggie the hour hand gains seven elevenths seven elevenths of what i dont know of the answer i suppose i shouldnt have thought it was five yet but it is and that compels us to decide between tea and cricket we can get tea in the pavilion theres another four you shall give me a hundred to one that the next ball is not a wicket said the babe in pennies and make it fifty done a very audible click and an appeal reggie got up and felt in his pockets i should have been ashamed to get out to a ball like that youll have to pay for tea babe there you are twopence more said the babe not if i went to the stake for it hullo ealing where are you from ealings got a glorious post tripos face too he really deserves to be able to play praise the lord ye heavens adore him but he cant even now composed by mr haydn said ealing and performed by mr ealing it contains a very difficult passage your left hand has to go to the left and your right hand to the right you feel all pulled in two babe the tripos is the noblest of inventions i think i shall go in for a second part i can quite understand how the lower classes get in such boisterous spirits on bank holidays that they change hats with each other id change hats with with a bishop said the babe looking wildly about for suggestions so would i or with longridge he wears a blue cake hat hullo theyre all out come and have tea then said reggie the babe stands tea hang the expense said the babe recklessly when a mans got some tin what can he do better than to give his pals a real blow out ive got four shillings tea for three and bread and butter for two the fortune of the rothschilds sprang from these small economies bread and butter for two will be plenty im sure none of us can be very hungry on so warm a day oh theres a tuft hair drinking out of a tall glass i expect its gin sling what is gin sling in any case you cant say it ten times ging slin i thought you could always say ranjitsinghi babe i can when other people are just unable to sufficient champagne gives me a wonderful lucidity followed by sleepiness theres stewart i didnt know he came to cricket matches stewart was delighted to see them but you babe are not fit for the society of ordinary people he said your extreme cheerfulness since your tripos argues a want of consideration for others what have you been doing ive been looking at cricket and also talking you dont say so i have indeed said the babe what effect does champagne have on you why do you ask these sudden questions said stewart wearily it makes the wings of my soul sprout the principle is the same i ate lobster salad the other day and drank port it did not give me indigestion but acute remorse remorse for having done so no a vague searching remorse for all the foolish things i had done and all the foolish things i meant to do and for being what i was food doesnt affect your body it affects your soul conversely sermons which are supposed to affect your soul make you hungry stewart lit a match thoughtfully against the sleeve of his coat the babe has hit on a great truth he said a curious instance occurred to my knowledge two years ago a strong healthy man read robert elsmere it gave him so severe an attack of dyspepsia that he had to spend the ensuing winter on the riviera and eat pepsine instead of salt for eighteen months then he died the phenomenon is well established poor simpson the fellow of my college as you know broke his leg the other day it was supposed to have happened because he tripped and fell downstairs but he told me himself that he was just leaving his room and that as he walked down stairs he read the first few pages of stephen remarx it was that of course that broke his leg and so he fell down stairs as soon as he tried to put it to the ground the babe is quite right sermons as he told us make him hungry and lobster and port remorseful in the same way high tea if frequently taken will make anyone a non conformist in the same way as incense induces roman catholicism but babe dont tell longridge why not he will want to talk about it to me and then i shall be taken with melancholy madness are you coming up for another year babe i dont know i should like to of course it will depend on my getting through if i do i think a note from my tutor to my father might have a wholesome effect your tutor will do whatever you wish him to said stewart at present he is going back to college i have a hansom waiting because i hate walking do any of you want a lift the others stayed up till stumps were drawn and walked down together the tea no doubt had affected the babes soul in some subtle manner producing acute fatuity the babe spent the remaining ten days in assiduous inaction he sat in canoes he sat on benches watching cricket he ate he slept he appeared at the senate house on the morning when the lists were read out in pumps in pink pyjamas a long great coat and a straw hat reggie who stood next him thought he detected signs of nervousness when the names began to be read but it is probable that he was mistaken for the babe had never before been known to be afflicted with that distressing malady a large number of his more intimate friends were there and an air of suspense was abroad but it was over sooner than any one anticipated for the babe contrary to the expectation of even the most sanguine of them all and that was himself came out first in the second class there was one moments pause of astonishment not unmingled with awe and then a wild disorderly scene of riot and shouting arose in which the babe was seized and taken back to trinity in a triumphal procession which carried him over the grass in the great court wholly disregarding the porters who gibbered helplessly around them until stewart appeared who however instead of instantly stopping it seemed to take sympathetic interest in the proceeding later in the day he wrote a charming letter to the babes father in which he congratulated him on his sons brilliant success alluded to his keen historical instinct and his vivid grasp of events whatever a vivid grasp may be and stated which was undoubtedly true that if certain five men out of the whole university had not happened to go in for the same tripos the same year the babe would infallibly have been senior historian an answer came later to stewart and the babe the latters was short but satisfactory reggie was breakfasting with him when the post came in or rather he was waiting without any excess of patience while the babe whom he had just pulled out of bed explained precisely how it was that he was not dressed yet and urged him not to begin or if he insisted on doing so to play fair at this moment the porter entered with the letter and the babe snatched it from his hand tore it open and executed a pas seul round the room until he stepped on the kettle lid and hurt himself very much the babe ba will be in residence another year he shouted you may eat all the breakfast if you like reggie had a healthy appetite and the babe was rather plaintive about it stewart who had received a letter from the babes father by the same post looked in after breakfast with congratulations i am delighted he said but in a way disappointed and for this reason i was looking forward to your denoement with some interest and i should have found a melancholy pleasure in seeing how you would make your exit from cambridge and what piece of extraordinary folly would have been your last it seems i shall have to wait another year for that oh dont mind me said the babe shrilly say youre sorry im coming up again straight out if you like no on the whole i dont mind waiting another year said stewart the end

ix x chapter i the hottest day of all days in the hottest june of all junes was beginning to abate its burning and the inhabitants of close packed cities and their perspiring congregations cherished the hope that before long some semblance of briskness might return into the ardent streets providence it would appear justly resentful at the long continued complaints that hot summers were altogether a thing of the past had determined to show that something could still be done in that line but this rejoinder humorous at first had long ago ceased to amuse from morning till night for the last six weeks an unveiled sun had shed a terrific ray on to the baked pavements and reverberating house walls but to day had beaten all previous records and a solemn glee pervaded the meteorological offices the reports of which seemed to claim a sort of proprietary credit in the readings of their incredible thermometers under these conditions it was with a sigh of relief that arthur craddock subsided into the corner seat of a first class smoking carriage at paddington finding that it was smoking figuratively speaking in less specialized a sense than that intended by the railway company for it had been standing for an hour or two in the sun outside the station but he had clear notions about the risk of chill even on so hot a day and when the train moved out from the dusky glass vault he drew up the window beside which he sat for it was impossible for him to take a seat with his back to the direction of progress since the sight of receding landscape always made him feel slightly unwell but as he was alone in his carriage there was no reason why he should not refresh his clay coloured face with a mist of wall flower scent which he squirted delicately over his forehead and closed eyes from a bottle in his silver mounted dressing case then he pulled down all the blinds in his carriage and sitting quite still in this restorative gloom indulged in pleasant anticipations he was a very large stout person wearing his hair which was beginning to grow thin though no hint of greyness invaded its sleek blackness conspicuously long round his ears and the back of his head it was still thick but it no longer felt capable of growth on the top of his high peaked head and in consequence he brushed it from the territories on the left side of his head over the top of his bald skull and mingled the extremities of these locks with those that grew on the territories on the right of his head it might thus be hoped that short sighted and unobservant persons would come to the gratifying conclusion that the thatch was complete he wore a small reddish moustache which in the centre of his immense colourless face might remind a biblical beholder of the burning bush in the desert of sin for he looked vaguely debauched which he was not and overfed which was probable to the verge of certainty his hands of which he was exceedingly proud were small and white and plump they were carefully manicured and decorated with a couple of rings each set with a large cabochon stone when as now they were not otherwise occupied he habitually used one of them to caress the side of this desert of sin as if to make sure that no whisker was surreptitiously sprouting there in dress though he was certainly old enough to know better he affected the contemporary style of a fashionable young man and his brown flannel suit had evidently the benediction of the tailor fresh upon it his tie in which was pinned a remarkably fine pearl was slightly more vivid than his suit but of the same colour as his socks a smooth two inches of which appeared below his turned up trousers and his shirt had a stripe of the same colour as his tie no watch chain glittered on the amplitude where it would naturally repose but on his left wrist he wore a narrow band of gold braid with a lady's watch set in it a white straw hat and brown shoes were the alpha and omega of his costume though his face was singularly unwrinkled except for rather heavy bags of loose skin below his eyes it was quite evident that arthur craddock had left youth far behind him but it would have been an imprudent man who would have wagered as to his ability to guess it within the limits of four or five years for his corpulence was of the somewhat gross sort that may come early to an inactive man in whose sedentary day dinner is something of an event but it would not have required a very subtle physiognomist to conjecture for him an alert and athletic mind his small grey eyes which were unsurmounted by any hint of eyebrow were though a little red and moist of a singular intensity in focus and as active in poise and dart as a hovering dragon fly while even in repose they wore a notably watchful and observant look his hands too which afforded him so constant a gratification were undeniably the hands of an artist long fingered in proportion to the palms and taper nailed artist he was too to the very tips of those pink and shining triumphs of the manicurist and though he neither painted nor played nor set forth on adventures in romance or poetry his judgment and perception in all such achievements on the part of others was a marvel of unerring instinct and was solidly based on an unrivalled knowledge of the arts not only too could he appreciate and condemn with faultless acumen but side by side with that gift and totally distinct from it he had an astonishing flair for perceiving what the public would appreciate and just as he was seldom at fault in true artistic judgment so also was he an accurate appraiser of the money earning value of play or picture he was it may be stated not unconnected with the artistic columns of the daily press and the frequent articles he contributed to three leading papers on pictures concerts and plays were often masterpieces of criticism while at other times and for other reasons he plentifully belauded work in which though he might artistically despise it he was financially interested his critical powers and the practical use to which he put them in purchases and in these penetrating paragraphs had proved most remunerative to him during these last fifteen or twenty years and he had already laid by a very comfortable provision for his declining days which he sincerely hoped were as yet very far off he was fond of money and very wisely had not the least objection to spending it in works of art which gave him pleasure especially when his judgment told him that they would go up in value then if a picture or a bronze could be sold again at a much higher price than that which he paid for it he would part with it without any agony of reluctance these transactions were conducted unobtrusively and it occurred to nobody to call him a dealer if such a supposition ever occurred to himself he put it from him with the utmost promptitude but every quarter he paid the rent of thistleton's gallery in bond street from which so many of the english masters set forth on their voyage to the united states his immediate anticipations as has been already remarked were pleasurable for the thames side house at thorley where he was to dine and sleep would certainly be a refreshing exchange from the baking airlessness of town it was true that there would be nothing special in the way of dinner to look forward to for his host philip wroughton was a penurious dyspeptic of long but hypochondriacal standing and arthur craddock made wise by a previous experience had directed his valet to take with him certain palatable and nutritious biscuits in case dinner proved to be not only plain in quality but deficient in quantity but there were two attractions which he was sure of finding there each of which more than compensated the certain short comings of the table these were philip wroughton's daughter and philip wroughton's reynolds briefly he hoped to possess himself of both it was impossible to decide between the rival excellencies of these the reynolds picture was exquisite it represented his host's great grandmother but joyce wroughton his host's daughter might have sat in person for it and the artist would have congratulated himself on having so supremely caught the frank charm and vigour of her beauty more than most of the master's portraits it set forth a breezy and glorious vitality it was as if diana and an amazon had been ancestresses to the sitter in so swift and active a poise the slim white clad figure paused with head turned and beckoning hand and smile before it passed up the glade of dark foliaged trees behind it how often had craddock seen joyce wroughton in just such a momentary attitude as she swung across the lawn from her punting on the river and turned to call her collies lest they should enter the tent where her father sat and disturb him at his employment of doing nothing at all craddock sluggish of blood and corpulent of limb found a charm of wonderful potency in the girl's lithe and athletic youth and his own subtle intricate weaving mind admired hardly less the serenity and simplicity of hers which seemed as untroubled and unmorbid as that which he would conjecture for some white hellenic marble it cannot be truthfully stated that in the common acceptance of the word he was in love with her but he immensely admired her and being of the age when a man says to himself that if he intends to marry he must without delay put out from the harbour of his bachelorhood he had decided to set his sails she only just twenty years of age was more than a quarter of a century his junior but this seemed to him a perfectly satisfactory chronology since for full twenty years more her beauty would but ripen and develop his desire to possess himself of the reynolds portrait was in a sense more altruistic since he did not propose to keep it himself he was prepared to offer to the present owner of it what would certainly appear to one not conversant with salesrooms a very generous price and he was also prepared to take a far more generous price for it himself from an american friend who was victim to a trans atlantic ambition to possess a dozen portraits by this master he scarcely knew a picture from a statue but he wanted pictures and craddock in previous transactions with him had learned not to be shy of asking enormous sums for them since mr william p ward's comment was invariable laconic and satisfactory i'm sure i'm very much indebted to you was all he said and proceeded to discharge his indebtedness craddock's precautions with regard to the sun that beat on the carriage windows were quite successful and he felt cool and presentable when he was shown into this riverside house and out again onto the lawn that bordered the thames where tea was laid under the big plane tree that shaded a drowsy area of cool green joyce inimitable save for the foreshadowing sir joshua rose to receive him forgetting to turn off the water from the urn which was ministering to the teapot upon which a thin hand came out of an encompassing chair and a rather fretful voice said the tea will be drowned joyce oh is that mr craddock charmed having saved the tea from drowning philip wroughton gave craddock a sufficiently cordial welcome he did not rise from his basket chair but extended a welcoming hand he had a footstool to keep his feet from any risk of damp from the scorched and arid grass and a thin plaid shawl was laid across his knees as a preventative of miasmic humours reaching those joints in person he was a wizen bird eyed little man fleshless and hollow cheeked and grey haired and by the side of his daughter he looked like a dried normandy pippin compared to a fresh apple sun tinted and vivid skinned beside him chiefly concealed from view by the scarlet sunshade which cast a red glow on to her face sat his mother old lady crowborough who was by far the most juvenile of any company in which she found herself not being on speaking terms with her elder son though she spoke about him a good deal she stayed with philip whenever she found it convenient and gave him a great deal of good advice which he seldom acted upon she delighted in her age which she habitually exaggerated and had now for several years said that she was ninety though as a matter of fact she would not attain that agreeable age for several years yet she was remarkable for her shrewdness her memory and her health and wore a rather girlish and simple costume with a flapping linen sun bonnet time that inexorable accountant seemed to have passed over her page and her face was still marvellously soft and unwrinkled and her sight and hearing were yet acute and undimmed arthur craddock had not expected to find her here and he was not sure that the discovery pleased him for she always produced in him a sensation of being detected philip wroughton continued his low voiced and languid phrases of welcome charmed to see you he said you know my mother do you not it is good of you to come down and see us in our retreat i with my wretched health as you know cannot leave home and joyce really prefers the river and her dogs and perhaps the society of her poor old father to the distractions of town eh joyce joyce might or might not have endorsed the filial sentiments thus attributed to her but her opportunity of doing so was snatched from her by her grandmother who endorsed none of these things it's all stuff and nonsense about your health philip she said you would be as strong as me if you only would put your medicine bottles into the grate and eat good nourishing food instead of the slops you stuff yourself with and as for joyce preferring to spend her time with you instead of dancing and flirting with all the agreeable young fellows in london you know quite well that it's you who keep her mewed up here to carry your cushions and pour out your medicines and put up your umbrella joyce interrupted this recital of menial duties with a laugh granny darling she said how many lumps of sugar three if they're decent big ones said lady crowborough with decision tell us what's going on in town mr craddock arthur craddock habitually made himself agreeable when it was worth while and here he had three persons whom he desired to stand well with philip wroughton for the sake of the reynolds joyce for her own sake and lady crowborough for reasons of self protection a burning fiery furnace is going on in town my dear lady he said the heat has been a torture and i only hope i have been expiating some crime the worst of it is that i have searched my memory without any success for something i have done to deserve these flames but i seem to have been almost priggishly virtuous what do you think i can have done miss joyce joyce put the three decent lumps into her grandmother's tea and laughed again she always felt a certain slight physical repulsion for this stout white man though she recognised his agreeable qualities ah how can i tell she said you have not made me your confessor mr craddock remembered that he would probably not get very much dinner and took a large soft bun with sugar on the top of it i instantly offer you the post he said though i can still think of nothing to confess you will have a sinecure and yet after all it was one's own choice to stop in town and certainly there have been pleasant things going on i suppose too that at this moment the keenness of my pleasure in sitting on this delicious lawn in the shade and coolness of your beautiful plane tree is enhanced by the contrast with the furnace i have escaped from and will you take me out again in your punt after tea as you did when i was here last all the way down i have had a prospective vision of you looking like a victory off some greek frieze with your punt pole and of myself reclining on the cushions like like a middle aged but unintoxicated silenus this speech since not addressed to lady crowborough was too lengthy for her taste nasty uncomfortable things are punts she observed going crawling along with one person poking and fuddling away among the mud and eels at the bottom of the river and dribbling the water from the pole over the other joyce made me go out with her yesterday and one of her great dogs sat on my lap and the other panted and slobbered over my frock while the sun frizzled the marrow out of my bones if i must go on the river give me a motor boat that takes you along instead of going backwards half the time i think i shall not find it too chilly in the punt to night joyce said her father if i take the shawl that is next thickest to the one i have here or perhaps it would be more prudent to take both will you see to that my dear when you have finished tea and tell them also to put dinner a quarter of an hour later then i shall be able to rest for a little after we get in let us start very soon bring mr craddock one of my shawls too he will be likely to find it chilly after the heat of town a shetland wool shawl mr craddock i find keeps one warm without any feeling of weight lady crowborough's impatience at her son's hygienic precautions fizzed and spurted again at this and bring me my cough drops joyce she said and my goloshes and my little fur cape and a digestive pill and my liver mixture and don't forget to take some cotton wool to put in your ears and the eye lotion lord save us philip you and your shetland shawls i envy you your robustness dear mother said he i only wish you had bequeathed me more of it lady crowborough had finished tea and accompanied joyce on her errand of shetland shawls thus leaving the two men together joyce will bring the punt around in ten minutes said her father and in the interval i shall be glad to have a chat with you mr craddock i have been considering the question of selling the reynolds if you remember our talk when you were last here and i have come to the conclusion that it is really my duty to do so i feel that i ought to spend next winter in some warm and sunny climate where i may have a chance of recovering some measure of my ruined health but that of course would cost money and my wretched poverty puts it out of the question for me unless i can sell some such possession joyce too poor girl will enjoy a greater stir and gaiety than i can give her here there is little enough of it in her life though i know she finds compensation from its absence in the sedulous care with which she insists on looking after me i dare say there will not be many more years of invalid nursing before her all i can do is to make them as little tedious as may be indeed it is chiefly for her sake that i contemplate the sale of this picture he paused a moment and lit a curiously smelling cigarette which counteracted a tendency to hay fever like many people he was strangely credulous about his own statements and came to believe them almost as soon as they were made indeed on this occasion before his cigarette was well alight he fancied that in part at any rate his plans of wintering in some warm climate had been made for joyce's sake i think you mentioned some number of pounds you thought you could get me for my great grandmother's picture he said five thousand was that the amount i have no head for figures yes and an american was it not i hate the thought of my picture going to america but poor men like me must not mind being kicked and plundered by the golden west probably it would be hung up in some abattoir where oxen are driven in at one end and tinned meat taken out at the other and for once my mother agrees with my determination to sell it she says that i cannot afford to have such a large cheque hanging framed in my study arthur craddock did not find much difficulty in sorting the grain from the husk in this very characteristic speech but he wisely treated it all as grain i know well your solicitude for miss joyce's happiness he said and i need not tell you how much it honours you but with regard to the future home of your delightful picture i can assure you that there is no abattoir awaiting it mr ward has half a dozen reynolds already and some very notable examples among them and as i told you i think there is no doubt he would give five thousand for it he caressed the side of his face and finding no disconcerting whisker there wondered how much he would actually venture to charge mr ward for the picture in fact i offer you five thousand for it here and now he said ah here is miss joyce in her punt coming for us philip wroughton dismissed this insignificant interruption then call to her mr craddock he said if you will be so good and tell her we shall be ready in five minutes i cannot raise my voice above the ordinary tone of speech without excruciating pain she will take a little turn in her punt and come back for us you will excuse me if i shut my ears when you shout a loud noise tears my nerves to ribands arthur craddock got up i will go and tell her he said so good of you i am ashamed to trouble you said wroughton not moving he walked down to the edge of the lawn where was the landing stage we are talking business miss joyce he said so will you come back for us in five minutes you have just stepped off some greek frieze of the best period let me tell you i long to recline like a teetotal silenus of the worst period on those cushions in five minutes then joyce leaned towards him on her punt pole and spoke low oh mr craddock she said are you talking about the reynolds father told me he was thinking of selling it do persuade him not to i am so fond of it she gave him a little friendly nod and smile do try she said yes i will come back in five minutes there's a swans' nest among the reeds down there and i will just go to see if the cygnets are hatched out yet wroughton looked languidly at him on his return joyce has a ridiculous affection for that portrait he said and i have a reasonable affection for it i can't afford to look at it i am far more in need of a suitable winter climate than of any work of art yet sometimes i wish that these pactolus people had left us alone this was not a strictly logical attitude for it was obviously possible to refuse the offer and leave the pactolus people alone nothing more than an opportunity had been offered him of which he was free to take advantage or not just as he chose as for craddock he felt himself advantageously placed for if he upheld joyce's wish he would ingratiate himself with her while if the sale took place he would reap an extremely handsome profit himself for the moment the spell of the riverside diana was the most potent i can understand miss joyce's feeling he said and yours also when you wish that the pactolus people as you so rightly call them had left you alone i respect those feelings i share and endorse them so let us discuss the question no further i will tell my friend that i cannot induce you to part with your picture no doubt he will find other owners not so sensitive and fine as you and miss joyce of course he will be disappointed but equally of course i gave him to understand that i could in no way promise success in the enterprise even as he spoke the balance wavered he could tell joyce that he had urged her father not to part with his picture and her gratitude would be earned and he knew that he wanted that more than he wanted to gratify her by his success thus it was satisfactory to find that he had not disturbed the stability of wroughton's determination and his profit was safe also ah that is all very well for you said wroughton with your robust health and your ignorance of what it means to be so poor that you cannot afford the alleviation which would make life tolerable beggars cannot afford to be so fine even joyce does not know what i suffer in this miserable swamp during the winter months but i am convinced she cannot have her father and the picture with her for i am sure i should never survive another winter here his thin peaked face grew soft with self pity which was the most poignant emotion that ever penetrated to his mind she would bitterly reproach herself he went on if after i am gone she conjectured that i might have been spared to her a little longer if i had been able to spend the winter months in a climate less injurious to me she does not really know how ill i am for of course i do not speak to her about that i want to spare her all the anxiety i can and in speaking to her of my project of spending the winter in some sunny climate in egypt or on the riviera i have laid stress only on the pleasure that such a visit will give her no no mr craddock my poor joyce and i must put our pride in our pocket indeed there is nothing else there i will close with your american friend's offer my mind is made up naturally i should want a good copy of the picture made for me without cost to myself it might be possible for you in your great kindness to arrange that for me you might perhaps make it part of the condition of sale five thousand pounds and a good copy craddock waved this aside he had delicately disposed of another bun that is easily arranged he said wiping his fingers that were a little sticky with the sugar on his fine cambric handkerchief i feel sure i can guarantee his acceptance of your terms philip wroughton coughed gently once or twice he always said that questions concerning money were distasteful to him it is quite true that they were so when they concerned his parting with it and am i right in supposing that you would expect whatever the usual commission happens to be he asked if so shall i pay it or your friend craddock interrupted him with the promptitude born of horror at such a suggestion i beg you not to hurt my feelings by proposing anything of the kind he said philip wroughton instantly and with apologies withdrew his inhumanity by this time joyce had returned from her expedition to the swans' nest and was waiting for them she had already put into the punt a selection of grey shetland shawls with a quantity of cushions and the task of making her father quite secure and comfortable next demanded all her patience and serenity but she had to make one more expedition to the house to get his white umbrella for the heat of the sun not yet set might easily penetrate the black one which he had brought with him he needed also a fly whisk in case the midges became troublesome a binocular glass and the very careful disposition of cushions so that no draught could conceivably come through the cane back against which he reclined then when he was quite settled craddock got in and joyce pushed out into the stream leaving two pairs of pathetic dogs' eyes wistfully regarding her from the bank but it was impossible to take huz and buz his brother when her father was in the punt for they fidgeted him on these hot days with their panting and could not be relied on to keep perfectly and permanently motionless joyce as was usual with her was bareheaded and was clad in a very simple home made skirt of butcher's blue much stained with water and bleached with sun and a white flannel blouse the arms of which she had rolled up to above her elbows but craddock who was a skilled appreciator with regard to female apparel would not have had her change her really elementary garments for the most sumptuous and glittering fabrics in general he entirely believed that a woman's beauty is enhanced by the splendour of her attire and saw the value of satin and tiaras but there was something so completely satisfying and suitable in this rough river dress that he would not have added any embellishment to it nor have expunged a single water stain or sun bleach the girl's superb slim figure divine in the elasticity of its adolescence now bending to her stroke now rigidly erect again as she trailed her pole back through the frilled water stood out in the simplicity of attic relief with its plain white and blue against the reflected greens and browns which the trees and shady places cast onto the polished mirror of the water her arms bare to above the elbow showed the full roundness and soft slim strength of her beautiful limbs and for the most part except when she turned at the end of her stroke her face was in profile to him giving him the short straight nose of the reynolds picture the fine mouth with generous underlip a little drooping and the firm oval of the curve from chin to ear here in the stern while she made these magnificent sweeps and curtsies with her punt pole were sitting her father and himself and he had no need to glance at mr wroughton or to think consciously of himself with his obese and middle aged figure in order to remind himself of the glorious contrast between the passengers and the splendour of their long limbed conductress she was thames she was june she was the enchanted incarnation of all that was immortally young and beautiful and though naturally vain he felt delighted to be part of her foil to set her off more than any silk and fine array could have done for the first time he hardly knew whether he did not admire the reynolds portrait so much because it was so like her there was the same spirit of wind and woodland and sunshine and joyous serenity about it the type was here incarnate and he bathed his mind in it washing off temporarily at least the merchandise and tittle tattle of its normal environment surely this admiration of his touched ecstasy touched love there soon came a turn in this sunny fluid reach of thorley and mr wroughton without imprudence furled his white umbrella and adjusted his binoculars for a languid survey of the shadowed river on one side a wood of tall virginal beeches clad the hill side down to the edge of the towing path and the huge curves of aspiring tree tops climbed unbroken to the summit of the hill a fringe of hawthorn trees cascades of red and white bordered this fairyland of forest and below the towing path a strip of river fed grasses and herbs of the water side were fresh and feathery spires of meadow sweet reared their stiff stemmed umbrellas of cream colour and loosestrife pointed its mauve spires into the tranquil air the dog rose spread its maiden hued face skywards with defence of long thorned shoots and lovely sprays with half opened chalices hung narcissus like above the tranquil tide below the water waved secret forests of river weed with darting fishes for birds in the drowned branches that undulated in the stream and here and there tall clumps of rushes with their dry brown blooms wagged and oscillated mysteriously to the twitchings of unseen currents to the left the ground was low lying in stretch of tree bordered meadow and from not far in front of them the sleepy murmur of thorley weir sounded with the cool melodious thunder of its outpoured and renewed waters willows fringed the banks and glimpses of meadow behind them lying open to the level rays of the declining sun shone with their rival sunlight of buttercup and luxuriant marsh marigold birds were busy among the bushes with supper and resonant with even song and jubilant thrushes were rich with their rapturous and repeated phrases and arthur craddock with his swift artistic sense not too sophisticated for simplicity saw with an appreciation that was almost tremulous how all this benediction of evening and bird song and running water was reflected and focussed in the tall bending figure of this beautiful girl and in her vigour and in the serenity of her brown level eyes she was in tune with it beating to its indwelling rhythm a perfect human instrument in this harmony and orchestra of living things part of it thrilling to it singing with it and the fact that he saw this so strongly appreciated it so justly measured the myriad miles he was distant from loving her an infinite hair breadth placed him further from love than is the remotest star from the revolving earth they glided up opposite a juncture of streams to the right lay the main body of the river towards thorley lock to the left a minor stream hurried from the low thundering weir joyce pushed strongly outwards on the right of the punt and turned it with frill of protesting water into the narrower and swifter stream willow framed on both sides here there was shallower and more rapid water that gleamed over bright gravel beds and even as they turned a king fisher ashine with sapphire and turquoise wheeled like a jewelled boomerang close in front of them giving a final hint of the gleaming romance and glory that lies so close below the surface of the most routined and rutted life they made a sharp angle round a corner and close in front of them was the grey spouting weir and the deep pool below it lucid with ropes and necklaces of foam and iridescent bubble a long spit of land jutted out into the river and on it was a grey canvas tent joyce had been punting on the right of the boat with her back to this but just as they came opposite to it the shifting current of the stream thrown across it by this spit of land made it advantageous to change the sides of her poling and from close at hand she saw the tent and the presumed inhabitants thereof two young men one perhaps eighteen years old the other some four or five years his senior they were as suitably clad as she and more scantily for a shirt and a pair of trousers apiece without further decoration of tie or shoe or sock was all that could be claimed for either of them the younger was utterly intent on some elementary cooking business over a spirit lamp the elder with brush and palette in hand was frowningly absorbed in a picture that stood on an easel in front of him so close to the river bank was the easel set that it was impossible not to apprehend the vivid presentment that stood on it there was the weir and the nude figure of a boy on the header board in the act of springing from it into the water then at the moment when the punt was closest the artist hitherto so intent on his picture that the advent of the punt was as unnoticed by him as by the boy who bent over the spirit lamp looked away from his canvas and saw them thereat he attended no more to his work but merely stared rudely if it had not been instinctively at joyce with young eager eyes half opened mouth vivid alert and suitable to the romance of the river side and the pulse of the beating world it seemed right that he should be there like joyce and the willow trees he belonged to the picture that would have been incomplete without him young and smooth faced and barefooted and bright haired on the instant the cooking boy spoke high and querulously oh charles he said this damned omelette won't do anything it's a sort of degraded glue joyce laughed before she knew she had laughed with her eyes still on charles indeed she hardly knew she laughed at all any more than a child knows who laughs for a reason as primal as the beat of the heart the blood flows then still primally she saw his responsive amusement and as they laughed a glance as fresh as the morning of the world passed between them she had looked at him no longer than it took her to pull her punt pole up to her side again then turning her head in obedience to the exigence of another stroke she looked away from him but it seemed to her that that one moment had been from everlasting it was the only thing that concerned her that meant anything and the strange fantastic moment was passed craddock's voice terminated it your glasses for a second mr wroughton he said and without waiting for verbal permission he snatched them up with a quickness of movement that was rare with him and had one fleeting look at charles' picture the next stroke of the punt pole took them round the spit of land into the bubble and foam of the bathing pool below the weir joyce skirted round this keeping in shallow water and out of the current a backwash of water made it unnecessary for her to exert herself further for a moment and she turned full face to the two men something within her some indwelling beat of harmony with the simple and serene things of the world made a smile as unconscious as her laugh had been to uncurl her lips what a jolly time those two boys are having she said i hope the omelette will cease to be degraded glue and mr craddock wasn't charles the cook called him charles wasn't charles painting rather nicely did you see certainly craddock had seen though he wanted to see again but it was her father who answered i think we will turn and go home joyce he said it will be chilly at sunset what have you done with my second shawl joyce laid down the dripping punt pole here it is she said will you have it over your shoulders or on your knees the bows of the punt were caught by the weir stream and the boat swung swiftly round take care joyce he cried you will have us swamped and you should not put down your punt pole in the boat it has wetted me joyce spread the second shawl over his knees and tucked the edges of it round him no dear it hasn't touched you she said and we aren't going to be swamped she took up her pole again and a couple of strokes sent them swiftly gliding down the rapid water next moment they were again opposite the tent one boy was still stirring the deferred omelette the artist with brush still suspended had his eyes fixed on their punt once again joyce's glance met his and once again arthur craddock picked up wroughton's glasses and got a longer look at the picture on the easel before they floated out of range he was even more impressed by this second glance there was a vitality and a sureness about the work which was remarkable for the moment the thought of the reynolds and even joyce herself blue and white with the background of feathery willow trees was effaced from his mind certainly the boy could paint and he was for ever on the look out for those who could paint more particularly if they were young and unknown he felt certain he had never seen work by this young man before for he could not have forgotten such distinctive handling as certainly he would see artist and canvas again before he left thorley this was the sort of opportunity with which his quick unerring judgment was occasionally rewarded there might be a bargain to be made here philip wroughton was in amazingly genial humour that night and read them extracts about the climate of egypt from a guide book he had quite an affecting and tender little scene with joyce in the presence of arthur craddock on the subject of the sale of the picture and had told her with a little tremble of his voice that it was for her to choose whether she would part with the portrait or himself according to the formula he had already employed in discussing the matter with craddock on this second repetition it had gained reality in his mind and joyce with her sweet indulgence for all that concerned her father did him the justice of recognizing that to him this tissue of imagination was of solid quality somehow the prospective loss of the picture too did not weigh heavily with her for she was conscious of a sunlight of inward happiness which could not be clouded by any such event she had no idea from whence it sprang it seemed to be connected with no particular happening but was like one of those hours of childhood which we remember all our lives when we were intensely and utterly happy for no definite reason never too had she seen her father more alive and alert and he went so far as to drink nearly a whole glass of the bottle of champagne which he had opened for his guest to wish prosperity and a happy home for the portrait but in this established imperfection of human things he had slight qualms on the wisdom of this daring proceeding and bade himself remember to take a little digestive dose as soon as dinner was over with a good copy here in its old place he said i have no doubt that we shall not really miss it joyce my dear these beans are not sufficiently cooked and mr craddock i hope you will arrange that the transaction shall be quite private we joyce and i do not want the fact that i have had to sell the picture publicly known lady crowborough gave a little shrill laugh at this without explanation of her amusement it shall not be spoken of at all said craddock nor of course will the picture be seen in london it shall go straight from your house to philadelphia why even your servants need not know the copy will one morning take the place of the original which i will arrange shall not be moved until the copy is ready i will get a copyist to do the work here if that is agreeable to you mr ward naturally will want to see his picture before the purchase is complete but you need not see him he will call at a time convenient to yourself but should you care to see him you will find him a very agreeable fellow mr wroughton held up his hand which was thin almost to transparency no spare me the sight of my executioner he said i don't know where you get all these fine feelings from remarked his mother not from my side of the family i'll see mr ward for you and see if i can't get him to buy some garnets of mine that i never wear i shall like a month or two in egypt with you philip too long a journey for you mother i am afraid said philip hastily there i knew you'd say something mean said she rising well i've finished my dinner and i shall get to my patience the night had fallen hot and starry and still and though it was not to be expected that mr wroughton should risk himself in the air after dinner craddock and joyce at his suggestion strolled down to the river's edge in the gathering dusk the even song of birds was over and bats wheeled in the darkening air and moths hovered over the drowsy fragrance of the flower beds from somewhere not far away sounded the tinkle of a guitar accompanying some boyish tenor and joyce without thought found herself wondering whether this was the voice of charles of the unknown surname or the anonymous fashioner of the omelette the tune was tawdry enough a number from some musical comedy and though the performer had no particular skill either of finger or throat the effect was young and fresh and not in discord with the midsummer stillness something of the same impression was made on arthur craddock also who listened with an indulgent smile on his big face that gleamed whitely in the faded day and dimness of stars he does not know how to play or sing very much he said but it is somehow agreeable though a little heart rending to my middle age he is clearly quite young his voice is unformed yet and i should guess he is thinking of her enviable young wretch for though miss joyce we miserable ones go a thinking of one or another her all our lives they cease to think of us just when we need them most there was considerable adroitness in this speech as a prelude to greater directness and he looked at her out of his little grey eyes with some intentness she seemed more diana like than ever in this grey glimmer of starlight it really seemed possible that she would spring up from the earth to meet the tawny moon disc that was even now just rising in the east and charioteer it over the star scattered fields of heaven she seemed dressed for her part as mistress of the moon all in white with a riband of silver in her bright hair but what of us she said lightly do not you men cease to think of us even before we are middle aged suddenly it struck craddock that no more heaven sent opportunity for carrying out the second of the purposes that had brought him down here could possibly be desired he was in luck to day too the business of the portrait had been carried through so smoothly so easily but immediately he became aware that he was not in vulgar parlance quite up to it he needed support he needed her father's consent but above all he needed the imperative call the hunger of the soul clearly too her words did not refer however remotely to herself and him he felt that they were spoken quite impersonally and immediately she changed the subject i have to thank you she said for trying to dissuade my father from selling the portrait he told me you had suggested that he should not that was kind of you he caressed the side of his face with the usual gratifying result i found his mind was made up he said though in accordance with your request i suggested he should not sell it always command me miss joyce and i will always fly on your quests i am aware that i do not look particularly like a knight errant but there are motor cars and railway trains nowadays which transport us more swiftly and less hazardously than mettlesome chargers especially if we can't ride he had again made himself an opening but again he found when he came close that it was barricaded to him but this time some hint of his intentions though he could not manage to carry them into effect was communicated to her and conscious of them and uncomfortable at them she again changed the subject oh i am not going to ask you to take the train to night she said the most i shall ask of you is that you play bezique with my father by and by i play so badly that it is no fun for him hark the singing is coming closer they had come to the landing stage at the far end of the lawn and looking up the tranquil lane of the river joyce saw that the sound came from a canadian canoe which was drifting downstream towards them the boat itself was barely visible in the shadow of the trees it was conjectured rather than seen by the outline of shirt sleeves that outlined it and it was on the further side of the stream by this time the moon had swung clear to the horizon and though the boat was still shadowed joyce and craddock standing on the lawn were in the full white light at the moment the musical comedy song came to an end and the voice of some imprudent person from the canoe forgetting the distinctness with which sound traverses water spoke in a voice that was perfectly audible to joyce though not to craddock charles there's the girl of the punt and her fat white man it observed charles was more circumspect his answer was a murmur quite inaudible and instantly he thrummed his guitar again the melody was new to joyce and though he might not have great skill in singing he had a crisp enunciation and the delicious old words were clearly audible see the chariot at hand here of love wherein my lady rideth louder and more distinct every moment as the canoe drifted closer came the beautiful lyric the singer was not using more than half his voice but as the distance between canoe and audience diminished the light boyish tenor was sufficiently resonant to set the windless air a quiver just as the canoe emerged into the blaze of moonlight opposite came the final stave and the white shirted singer sang from a full and open throat or have smelt o' the bud o' the briar or the nard in the fire or have tasted the bag of the bee o so white o so soft o so sweet is she the silence of the night shut down like the lid of a jewel box then after a little while came the drip of a paddle and the canoe grew small and dim in the distance down stream those jolly boys again said joyce arthur craddock heaved a long sigh horribly conscious of his years and riches and joyce heard the creak of his shirt front that young man has diplomatic gifts he said it is clear that he intended to serenade you and he chose the far side of the river so as to make it seem that he had no intention of any kind it is a reasonable supposition that if serenading was his object and it certainly was he might be supposed not to see you standing here so he serenaded with the open throat if i tried to do the same which sorely tempts me i should only convince you that i had not an open throat but a sore one nobody has ever heard me sing not even when i was as young as that white shirted youth in the canoe he will paddle back to his tent before long unless you stay here visible in the moonlight and dream steadily about you till morning joyce laughed oh what nonsense mr craddock she said knowing in the very secret place of her girl's heart that it was not nonsense at all boats with guitars and singers go by every night and often half the night they can't all be serenading me i cannot imagine why not a mormonism of serenading young men is not illegal i would join them myself miss joyce if i could sing and if i did not think that any canadian canoe in which i embarked would instantly sink philip wroughton in addition to the glass of champagne he had drunk at dinner permitted himself the further indulgence of sitting up for nearly an hour beyond his usual bedtime to talk to his guest and read more about the delectable climate of the upper nile while craddock and joyce were out in the garden a train of thoughts had been suggested to him by his very shrewd mother before she began her patience which he was preparing to indicate ever so lightly to that gentleman after joyce had gone upstairs he's got your picture philip said that observant lady and now he's after your daughter why don't you send joyce up to town for a month and give the girl a chance you're a selfish fellow you know like all wroughtons but she had not succeeded in provoking him to a retort nor had she affected the independence of his own conclusions it required no great perspicacity to see that craddock was considerably attracted by the girl and it seemed to her father that she might easily marry less suitably for him she had led a very solitary and sequestered life with him and he did not propose to alter his habits in order that she might come more in contact with the world true in this projected egyptian winter she was likely to meet more young men than she had ever come across in her life before but he could not imagine any one who would suit him as if it was his own marriage that was in contemplation better than craddock philip found him quiet and deferential and agreeable and since it was certainly necessary that joyce and her husband if she was permitted to marry should be with him a good deal these were favourable points he detested young men with their high spirits and loud laughs and automatic digestions and he did not for a moment intend to have such a one about the house furthermore craddock was certainly very well off philip would have had a fit if he had known that he and his picture were in the act so to speak of enriching him more and it was clearly desirable to have wealth about the house possibly some one more eligible might discover himself but philip had little difficulty in convincing himself that he would be failing in his duty towards his daughter if he did not let craddock know that his attentions to joyce were favourably regarded by her father but if his meditations were stripped of the fabric of unrealities until truth in bare austerity was laid open it must be confessed that he planned joyce's possible marriage with a single eye for his own comfort a game of bezique succeeded craddock's stroll with joyce and a cigarette with a whisky and soda consoled him for the withdrawal of the ladies and you have positively to go up to town again to morrow said philip cannot we by any means persuade you to stay another night you in your modesty have no idea what a refreshment it is to us in our retirement to get a whiff of air from the busy bustling world yes i may say 'us' for my dear little joyce was so pleased at your coming would you not be more prudent to close that window i am sure you are sitting in a draught this of course meant that philip was and craddock did not misunderstand i was saying that joyce was so pleased repeated her father i ask nothing better than to please miss joyce said craddock you do please her i am sure of it dear joyce i know it cannot be long that i shall be able to give her a home her future continually occupies my thoughts i daresay she will meet someone when we winter in egypt who will attract her she is not ill looking is she i think there must be many suitable men whom she would be disposed to regard not unfavourably yes yes it was all spoken very softly and tunefully the calm sunset of declining day seemed to brood over it the effect was that arthur craddock got up and paced the room once or twice in silence will you give me your permission to ask miss joyce if she will make me the happiest of men he asked my dear friend said philip with hand outstretched chapter ii dawn was brightening in the sky though the sun was not yet risen when charles lathom awoke next morning in the tent by the river side close by him in the narrow limits of their shelter his brother reggie was lying on his back still fast asleep with mouth a little parted a plume of tumbled hair falling over his forehead and a bare brown arm and shoulder outside the sheet in which he was loosely wrapped late last night after they had got back from their moonlit drift down the river reggie who to do him justice had done all the paddling so as to leave charles free to serenade saw the propriety of one dip in the pool below the weir before bed and had come back into the boat dripping and refreshed and glistening and without further formality of drying had curled himself up and gone to sleep with a mocking reference to the lady of the punt the picture of him taking a header into the pool now on the point of completion leaned against the tent side and a couple of bags gaping open and vomiting clothes and brushes and a box of provisions the lid of which did duty for a table completed the furniture of the tent charles got up quietly so as not to disturb the sleeper and went out into the clean dewy morning the thickets behind their encampment were a chirrup with the earliest bird music of the day and high up in the zenith a few wisps of cloud that had caught the sun not yet risen on the earth itself had turned rosy with the dawn the spouting of the weir made a bass for the staccato treble of the birds but otherwise the stillness of night was not yet broken little ripples lapped at the side of the canadian canoe drawn half out of the water onto a bank blue with forget me not and a tangle of briar rose with cataract of pink folded petals hung motionless over the water then with a sudden shout of awakened colour the first long level rays of the sun sped across the meadows and with the sigh of the wind of dawn the world awoke the morning light was what charles needed for his picture but not less did he need his brother for the painting of the braced shoulder muscles of his arms as they pointed above his head for the imminent plunge sun and dappled shade from the trees that bounded the meadow just beside the weir fell onto his naked body making here a splash of brilliant light here a green stain of sunlight filtering through the translucent leaves while his face and the side of his body seen almost in profile were brilliantly illuminated by the glint from the shining pool below him but underneath these surface lights there had to be indicated the building and interlacement of the firm muscles and supple sinews of his body he had all but finished them he had all but recorded what he saw but it was necessary that reggie should stand for him just a little while more meantime since it was still so early and his brother still so profoundly dormant there was a little more work to be done to the ecstatic dance of sunlight on the pool just at the edge the shadow of the wall of the weir lay over it and it was deep brown with a skin of reflected blue from the sky but a few yards out the sun kindled a galaxy of golden stars flowers of twinkling and dazzling light he got his picture out of the tent set it on its easel and put a kettle of water on the spirit lamp it was still far too early to have breakfast but a cup of tea brought presently to reggie's bedside might tend to make him unresentful of being awakened when charles found he could get on no further without him so when this was ready charles rattled the sugar in its tin loud enough to wake not one only but seven sleepers and reggie sat up with a justifiable start what the deuce he began sorry said charles i'm afraid i made rather a row but i've made some tea too have a cup of course is it late well no not very i've been up some little time painting but i can't get on any more without you reggie gave a great yawn i suppose that means you want me to turn out and stand with my arms up on that header board it's lucky i have the patience of an angel archangel said charles fulsomely you've been a real brick about it and will you get breakfast ready if i come now yes and i'll make both beds reggie accordingly got up and glanced at the picture as he passed it on his way to the header board i suppose i am like a dappled frog if you insist on it he said but a devilish finely made young fellow absolute adonis said charles humbly oh reggie stand exactly like that as long as you possibly can that's exactly right the work went on in silence after this for the modelling of muscle and flesh below this checker of light and shade and reflection was utterly absorbing to the artist he had tried all ways of solving this subtle and complicated problem once he had put in the curves and shadows of the tense muscles first and painted the diaper of sun and shade on the top of it but that made the skin thick and muddy in texture once he had mapped the sunlight and surface shadows first and overlaid them with the indicated muscles but this seemed to turn the model inside out then only yesterday he had seen that the whole thing must be painted in together laid on in broad brushfuls of thin paint so that the luminousness and solidity should both be preserved and this method was proving excitingly satisfactory often during this last week he had almost despaired of accomplishing that which he had set himself to do but stronger than his despair was his absolute determination to record what he saw not only what he knew to be there it was impossible for his brother to hold this tiring pose for more than a couple of minutes and often it was difficult to get its resumption accurately but this morning reggie seemed to fall or rather stretch himself into the correct position without effort and charles on his side knew that to day he had the clear seeing eye and the clever co ordinating hand for an hour of pose and rest reggie stood there and then charles stepped a few yards away from his canvas and stood a moment biting the end of his brush and frowning as he looked from model to picture and back again then the frown cleared thanks most awfully reggie he said it's done good or bad it's done reggie gave a great shout and disappeared altogether in the pool charles made breakfast ready according to agreement and the two sat for a while afterwards in the stupefaction of out door content this week has gone on wings said reggie and it's an awful melancholy thing to think that this is my last day here but it's been a beauty of a week i'm no end grateful to you for bringing me reggie had the caressing moods of a very young thing as he spoke he left his seat and established himself on the ground leaning back against his brother's knees and anchoring himself with a hand passed round his leg i should have had to stew in sidney street for my week of holiday he went on if it hadn't been for you it was ripping of you to let me come it's i who score said charles you've earned your keep all right i should have had to hire a model otherwise or have done without one oh well then we both score reggie threw away the end of his cigarette and abstracted charles' case from his pocket i must go up to town this afternoon he said for thistleton's gallery opens again to morrow morning and there i shall sit all july at the receipt of custom and sell catalogues and make the turn stile click and acknowledge receipts oh a dog's life jove what a lot of money some of those fellows have there was an american who came in last week and went around the gallery with a great fat white man called craddock who often comes and shows people round i rather think he is thistleton and owns the place i say charles reggie broke off suddenly why i believe it was he who was in the punt last night he said and was standing on the lawn with that girl you sang at didn't notice him particularly said charles no you were noticing somebody else particularly but i feel sure it was he as i say he was taking an american round last week who bought a couple of little dutch pictures he stopped at my desk on the way out and borrowed my pen and wrote a cheque for l right straight off without coughing i remember he said he was going to post date it but he didn't tip me i don't quite know what this is all about remarked charles nor do i i hoped it was just agreeable conversation don't you find it so but i bet you what you like that the fat white man in the punt was craddock reggie lay further back against his brother's legs i see a great tragedy ahead he said with inquests and executions craddock is about to marry the girl of the punt and charles will cut his throat and whose throat asked charles his own or craddock's perhaps craddock's first and his own afterwards then there will be a sensational trial and i can't bother to make up any more are you going to paint all the morning charles no none of it it's enough for to day to have finished you i shall stop down here a day or two more and do another sketch after you have gone i'm at your disposal this morning then let us do nothing for a long time and then bathe for a long time and then do both all over again lord i wish i was an artist like you instead of a doorkeeper to stop about all day in delicious places and do exactly what you like best in the world which is to paint it would make it completer if anybody wanted best in the world to buy what i had painted remarked charles but you sold two water colours the other day for three pounds each remarked the consolatory reggie that's as much as i earn in a month it might happen oftener said charles by the way i heard from mother last night a nice woman said reggie quite she sent me another sovereign in case funds had run low when you get back you will find she has been living on tea and toast because she didn't feel hungry reggie gave a huge sigh i wish a man might marry his mother he observed i should certainly marry her and we would ask you and the punt girl to stay with us very kind said charles these two young men who were enjoying so open aired a week of june by the thames side were the only children of the widow whom they kindly agreed to regard as a nice woman they had been brought up in easy and well to do circumstances and educated at public schools until the suicide of their father a little more than a year ago had disclosed a state of affairs that was as appalling as it was totally unexpected he was a jobber on the stock exchange and partner in a firm of high repute but he had been privately indulging in a course of the wildest gambling and he could not face the exposure which he knew could no longer be avoided the sale of the pleasant country home at walton heath and the disposal of all that could be converted into cash had been barely sufficient to make an honourable settlement of his unimagined debts neither his wife nor either of the boys had ever dreamed of the possibility of such a situation never had it appeared that he had had the slightest anxiety with regard to money his self control had been perfect until as with the breaking of some dam it had given way altogether in ruin and destruction till that very moment he had been the gayest and youngest of that eager little family party all of whom brought an extraordinary lightness and zest to the conduct of their unclouded lives charles had already left school for a three years when the stroke fell and was studying in a famous atelier in paris while reggie still at marlborough was devoting as much time as he could reasonably be expected to spare from athletic exercises to the acquiring of foreign tongues with a view to the diplomatic service they had both been instantly sent for by their mother who met his death with a fortitude that never wavered it was not long that they had to wait for the explanation of the utterly unlooked for catastrophe for a very short examination of his private papers showed the extent of his defaulting and the imminence of the crash willingly had it been possible would she have kept from her sons the knowledge that he had killed himself bearing alone the unshared secret but an explanation of accident was impossible equally impossible was it to conceal the miserable cause of it it was on the evening of charles' return from paris as they sat in the still house that till to day had always rung with jollity while heathery sweetness and the resinous odour of pines came in at the open windows that she told them everything quite shortly and when that was done and they were still half stunned with the sudden horror that had blackened life she rallied her own courage by awakening theirs you know it all my darlings she said and now whenever you think of it and for a long time it will always be in your thoughts you must think of it all as some dreadful mistake that dear dad made something he never meant at all he got his troubles muddled up in his head till he didn't know what he was doing he felt he couldn't bear it just as sometimes he used to call out when we were playing some silly game like animal grab 'i can't bear it i can't bear it' oh charles my darling don't cry so awfully we've got to go straight ahead again with all our courage undismayed and show that we can face anything that god chooses to send us she waited a little comforting now one and now the other it was all a mistake she went on and we must never allow ourselves to think that it was the dear dad we knew who did it he wasn't himself trouble had made him forget himself and all of us just for a moment we will think about that moment as little as we can and then only as a mistake but we will think constantly and lovingly of the dear dad we have known all these years who was so loving and tender to all three of us and whom we knew as so gay and light hearted we will have him constantly in our thoughts like that this and all the loving kindness of the years in which we laughed and loved together and if we can't help as we shan't be able to do thinking with a sort of wondering despair of that blunder that mistake we must remember that somehow or other though we can't explain how it is and was even then in the hands of god it had been no vague piety or bloodless resignation that had inspired her then nor in the year that followed and it had required a very full measure of the essential spirit of youth which never sits down with folded hands but despises resignation as it despises any other sort of inaction to bring them all to the point where they stood to day whether the boys helped their mother most or she them is one of those problems of psychological proportions into which it is unnecessary to enquire since each had been throughout the year essential to the others for if there had been no jolly boys coming home at evening to mrs lathom in their lodgings in the meagre gentility of sidney street she could no more have got through her industrious day with hope never quenched in her heart than could they if there had been no mother waiting to welcome them she without waiting a day after they moved to london invested a few pounds of their exiguous capital in buying a typewriting machine and before long by dint of unremitting work was earning a wage sufficient with reggie's office salary to keep the three of them in independence and adequate comfort as well as to pay for a slip of a dilapidated studio in a neighbouring street where charles toiled with all the fire of his young heart and swiftly growing skill of hand at his interrupted studies it was for him of all the three that life was most difficult since he was an expense only to the others and it required all the young man's courage to persevere in work which at present brought in almost nothing but his mother's courage reinforced his while it was possible for him to continue working it would be a cowardly surrender to give up tending the ripening fruit of his years in paris and let the tree wither and turn his brushes so to speak into pens and his palette into an office stool besides he had within him lying secret and shy but vitally alive the unalterable conviction of the true artist that his work was ordained to be art and that where his heart was there would sufficient treasure be found also but it was hard for him even with the endorsing sincerity of his mother's encouragement to continue being the drone of the hive so far as actual earning was concerned and it had demanded the utmost he had of faith in himself and love for his art to continue working with that ecstasy of toil that art demands at all that which his education needed and not to grudge days and weeks spent in work as profitless from the earning point of view as he believed it to be profitable in his own artistic equipment drawing had always been his weak point and hour after interminable hour from casts or from the skeleton properties saved from the lavish paris days he would patiently copy the framework of bones and patiently clothe them in their appropriate muscles and sinews as must always happen long weeks of work went by without progress as noticed by himself until once and once again he found himself standing on firm ground instead of floundering through bogs and quick sands which endlessly engulfed his charcoal and his hours and knew that certain haltings and uncertainties of line troubled him no longer but he made no pause for self congratulation but continued with that mingling of fire and unremitting patience which is characteristic of the true and inspired learner colour and the whole complex conception of values which go to make up the single picture instead of a collection however well rendered of different objects was naturally his he had by instinct that embracing vision that takes in the subject as a whole the heat of the morning disposed to quiescence and the two boys with the spice of meadow sweet and loosestrife round them and the coolness of the running water drowsily booming to temper the growing swelter of the day talked lazily and desultorily concerned with these things for a long time after breakfast was over but they were vividly concerned with them no more to each the opening pageant of life was more engrossing than the tragedy of the past being young they looked forward where the middle aged would have dwelt with the present and the old have mumbled and starved with the past but to them it was but dawn and the promise of day was the insistent thing and there was no temptation to dwell in ruins and conjure back the night but before long the itch for activity in spite of their resolve of a lazy morning possessed each and reggie fervidly washed up the used crockery of breakfast while charles went up the few yards of path that lay between the tent and the side of the weir to behold again the picture he had left standing on its easel in his heart he knew it was finished but in the eagerness of his youth he almost looked forward to some further brushful of inspiration he would not touch what he knew was good he hoped only to find something that could be touched with advantage he turned a sharp corner where willows screened the weir his picture was planted within a dozen yards of him but between him and his picture was planted a big white faced man who was regarding it so intently that he did not hear the swish of the parted willows it was not till charles was at his elbow that craddock turned and saw him and he put into his manner the deference which he reserved for duchesses and talent i have come to your private view he said without being asked and it was very impertinent of me but really this is my second visit i had my first private view yesterday when i looked at your picture from a punt in which i happened to be i had just a couple of glimpses at your work before this you have been very fortunate in your inspiration since then the muse paid you a good visit this morning charles said nothing but his eyes questioned this intruder giving him a tentative welcome but before the pause was at all prolonged the tentative welcome had been changed into a wondering and tremulous expectancy were there fairies still by the thames side was this fat white man to prove a fairy you have painted an admirable picture continued the possible fairy and the handling of the most difficult part of all of course you know i mean the lights and shadows on that delightful figure is masterly of course there are faults plenty of them but you can see and you can draw and you can paint craddock saw charles' lip quiver and heard that it cost him an effort to command his voice not really he stammered unless i am much mistaken and it has been the business of my life to seek out those who can see and draw and paint now i don't know your name and assuredly i have never seen your work before and since it is my business also to know the names and the works of all young men who can paint i imagine that you have your artistic debut so to speak still in front of you but i shall be exceedingly grateful to you if you will sell me your picture straight away here and now and if you won't let me have it for fifty pounds i shall have to offer you sixty charles looked vaguely round first at craddock then at his picture then at the spouting weir almost expecting to see them melt as is the manner of dreams into some other farrago as fantastical as this or dissolve altogether into a waking reality do you really mean you will give me fifty pounds for it he asked no i will give you sixty but don't touch it again take my word for it that it is finished or did you know that already oh yes said the boy i finished it an hour ago but i came back to make sure well then when you leave your encampment here will you please send it to me at this address that is to say if i am to have the privilege of purchasing it this repetition gave reality to the interview people in dreams were not so persistent and charles gave a little joyous laugh as craddock took a card out of his pocket and gave it to him or were you thinking of exhibiting it he asked i was meaning to have a try with it at the autumn exhibition of the 'artists and etchers' said charles i have no objection to that provided you will let me have a little talk with you first and put certain proposals before you he looked at the picture again and saw more surely than ever its admirable quality it had unity it was a picture of a boy just about to plunge into a sunlit pool not a boy and a pool and some sunlight a mere pictorial map or painted enumeration of objects it was all tingling with freshness and vitality and the rapture of early achievement no artist however skilled if he had outgrown his youthful enthusiasm could have done it like that though he would easily have produced a work more technically faultless eagerness though wonderfully controlled burned in it the joy of life shouted from it and when he looked from it to the tall shy boy whose grey eyes had seen that whose long fingers had handled the brushes that recorded it he felt sure he would not go far wrong in his own interests in making a proposal to him that would seem to him fantastical in its encouraging generosity indeed he felt that there was no element of chance in the matter for there could be no doubt about this young man's temperament which lies at the bottom of all artistic achievement and in this case was so clearly to be read in those eager eyes and sensitive mouth naturally he had a tremendous lot to learn but a temperament so full of ardent life and romantic perception as that which had inspired this idyll of youth and sunshine and outpouring waters would never rest from the realization of its dreams and visions he looked at his watch and found he had still half an hour before he need to go to the station can you give me a few minutes of your time now he said of course i will just tell my brother that i can't come with him at once we were going on the river do tell him to come back for you in half an hour that is he i suppose on the header board charles went quickly down the little path to the tent o reggie he said the fat white man has come and bought my picture absolutely bought it it's real i'm just beginning to believe it reggie stared for a moment then for he had a poor opinion of his brother's business capacities how much he demanded sixty pounds not shillings pounds and he wants to talk to me now so come back for me in half an hour he says i can paint and somehow i think he knows bless his fat face said reggie we'll let him have it at his own price anything for the model i think the model deserves something he shall get it said charles reggie caught hold of his brother by the shoulders and danced him round in three wild capering circles arthur craddock had sat himself down on the steps that led to the header board waiting for charles' return he had turned the picture round so that he saw it in a less perplexing light and found that he had no need to reconsider his previous conclusions about it it was brimful of lusty talent and there seemed to him to be a hint of something more transcendent than talent there was a really original note in it it had a style of its own not a style of others and though he felt sure that the artist must have studied at bonnart's in paris there was something about the drawing of it which had never been taught in that admirable atelier and the artist was so young there was no telling at what he might not arrive craddock had a true reverence for genius and he suspected genius here he also had a very keen appreciation of advantageous financial transactions which he expected might be gratified before long for both these reasons he awaited charles' return with impatience he was prepared to make his proposal to him at once if necessary but he felt he would prefer to see more of his work first charles did not tax his patience long he came running back let us begin at the beginning like the catechism said craddock what is your name charles lathom and mine is arthur craddock so here we are craddock was capable of considerable charm of manner and a disarming frankness and already charles felt disposed both to like and trust him your work such as i have seen of it craddock went on interests me immensely also it makes me feel a hundred years old which is not in itself pleasant but i bear no grudge for the means and he pointed at the picture excuse the effect now my dear lathom be kind and answer me a few questions you studied with bonnart did you not yes for two years only that you used your time well but who taught you drawing charles looked at him with a charmingly youthful modesty and candour nobody he said i couldn't draw at all when i left bonnart's of course i don't mean that i can draw now but i worked very hard by myself for the last year i felt i had to learn drawing for myself at least bonnart couldn't teach me and have you copied much i copy in the national gallery i try to copy the english masters there is no better practice and you will do well to keep it up provided you do plenty of original work too but of course you can't help doing that i should like to see some of your copies unless you have sold them charles laughed not i worse luck he said indeed i have only done bits of pictures you see he was warming to his confession the artist within him bubbled irrepressibly in the presence of this man who seemed to understand him so well and to invite his confidence you see i didn't care so much about copying entire pictures he said it wasn't reynolds' grouping is that fearfully conceited that i wanted to learn and to understand but his drawing ears noses hands i find i can manage the composition of my picture in a way that seems to me more or less right and can see the values but the drawing that was what i wanted to get and it has improved it was perfectly rotten a year ago a further idea lit its lamp in craddock's quick brain you shall show me some of your studies he said and should you care to copy a reynolds i feel sure i can get you a good commission if your copies are anything like as good as your original work do tell me anything more about yourself that you feel disposed to charles brushed his hair back off his forehead craddock's manner was so supremely successful with him that he did not know that it was manner at all he felt he could tell him anything he trusted him completely i studied with bonnart for two years he said and then there came a crash my father died and we were left extremely poor in fact we were left penniless perhaps you remember my mother earns money so does reggie my brother but for this last year you see it is i whom they have been supporting they wanted me to go on working and not mind about that so i worked on i have been very industrious i think but till now till this minute i haven't earned more than a pound or two that's why charles had to pause a moment the reality and significance of what was happening almost overwhelmed him sixty pounds meant a tremendous lot to him but the meaning of it that of which it was the symbol meant so infinitely more that's why i could hardly believe at first that you wanted to buy my picture he said it seemed too big a thing to happen it's not only the fact of sixty pounds it's your belief that my picture is worth it that i can paint but if nobody ever wanted to buy or saw any merit in what i did i don't believe i could help going on working he was sitting on the ground just below the steps which craddock occupied and he felt a kind hand on his shoulder as if to calm and fortify his voice which he knew was rather unsteady so i guessed said craddock but it is just as pleasant to find that somebody does believe in you and i assure you that i am only the first of many who will now about our arrangements i will give you ten pounds at once to show you i am in earnest about buying your picture o good lord no interrupted charles i should prefer it and i will send you the balance from town now will you come up there to morrow and show me what you call your bits of things show me them the day after to morrow and shall we say ten in the morning you must give me the address of your studio and i will come there bring up your picture with you but get some boy from the village to look after your tent and belongings for a night or two if you prefer this to rooms very likely you will want to occupy it again the reynolds of which i spoke is in a house near craddock got up and pulled out a russia leather pocketbook here is my earnest money he said your studio address thanks charles' heart was so full that it seemed to choke his brain and his power of utterance the first ineffable moment of recognition dear even to the most self reliant of artists had come to him and until then he had not known how nearly he had despaired of its advent he held out his hand and smiled and shook his head it's no use my trying to thank you he said for there are no words that are any use but i expect you know as has been said arthur craddock had a profound reverence for talent quite apart from his keen pleasure in advantageous bargains and his answer dictated by that was quite sincere the thanks must pass from me to you he said people like myself who are unable to create find their rewards in being able to appreciate the work of those like yourself pray do not think of me as a patron i am a customer but i hope i may prove to you that i am a good one ten o'clock then the day after to morrow craddock had the invaluable mental gift of attending with a thoroughness hermetically sealed from all other distractions to the business on hand nor did he let his mind dribble its force into other channels when he wanted the whole of it to gush from one nozzle and in this interview with charles lathom he had summoned his whole energy though the expression of it was very quiet to winning the boy's confidence and making himself appear as a discerning and generous appreciator it would have seemed to him a very poor policy to obtain this picture as he could no doubt have done for a quarter of the price he had offered for it while on the other hand it was unnecessary to offer twice that price which he would willingly have done since he could make the impression that was needful for his future scheme at the lower figure economy was an excellent thing but there was no mistake more gross than to economize at the wrong time he was satisfied as to this and now he dismissed the subject of charles and his picture quite completely and turned his whole thoughts elsewhere there were several directions in which it might profitably have turned he turned it to one in which any possible profit was remote that morning before he made this visit to charles craddock had proposed to joyce who had refused him he had not taken and did not now take her refusal as final and told her so but it had considerably surprised him he knew well how restricted a life she led at home how subjected she was to her father's peevish caprices and complaints how cut off she was from the general diversions of life and this added to her father's assurance that he pleased her was sufficient to make him frankly astonished at her rejection of him and her refusal to walk through the door which he held open for her and which provided so easy an escape from all these disabilities he had put before her though not pompously these advantages he had mentioned that her father endorsed his application he had not omitted to lay stress on his devotion to her and had ascertained that there was no rival in the field of her maidenly preference it is true that he was not in love with her but acute man though he was in all that concerned the head it never entered into his mind even now as he drove to the station and thought intently about the subject that this omission could have had anything to do with his ill success it is quite doubtful whether even if he had been desperately in love with her joyce would conceivably have given any different answer but as it was the omission was so fatal to her instinct that there could not be a moment's struggle or debate for her she was not even sorry for him for clearly there was nothing real to be sorry for otherwise she would have sincerely regretted her inability to accept him for in spite of a certain physical distaste which she felt for him she liked him and admired his quickness and cleverness had her father told her that craddock was going to live with him she would have hailed him with a genuine welcome but quite apart from her feeling towards him there was the insuperable barrier of his want of feeling towards her of that barrier of the possibility of her knowing it he with all his cleverness had no idea but to joyce the whole matter was abundantly evident she knew he did not even love her and his love for her was the only thing that could have made her acceptance of him ever so faintly possible without that all other reasons for marrying him were fly blown no debate no balancings were conceivable the scale dinted the beam with its unchecked kick he thought over this ill success guessed without getting within miles of the truth at the primary reason for it as he drove through the white sunshine from his interview with the astounded and grateful charles and almost immediately became aware that in the last hour his feelings for joyce had undergone a curious intensification inspired as he had been all his life by desires that were entirely material he had been used by the aid of his clever brain to compass and possess them often of course he had not been able for the mere wanting to obtain the coveted object and hitherto it had almost invariably happened that this temporary check stirred him up to such further efforts as were necessary a wish denied him hitherto had connoted a wish intensified and since there is a great deal of truth latent in the commonplace that to want a thing enough always earns the appropriate reward of desire he had not often fainted or failed before reaching his goal even now though up till now his desire for joyce had been scarcely more than a wish it seemed to him different from all other wishes it was becoming a desire as simple and primal as hunger for food or sleep some internal need dictated it this was disturbing and since he had other immediate work on hand he turned his attention to a typewritten manuscript of which he had read part last night he proposed to finish it in the train craddock as has been said had a mind profoundly critical and appreciative he had also quite distinct and segregate an astonishing flair for perceiving what the public would appreciate often he bought pictures which from an artistic point of view he thought frankly contemptible because he saw signs so subtle that they were instinctively perceived rather than reasoned that the public was going to see something in either an old outworn mode or in some new and abominable trickery he then transferred his purchases to thistleton's gallery and gladly parted with them on advantageous terms but this flair of his was by no means confined to mere pictorial representations and he was always glad to read a novel or a play in manuscript with a view to purchasing it himself and disposing of his acquired rights to publisher or playwright living as he publicly did in the centre of things an assiduous diner out and frequenter of fashionable stair cases he yet had a quiet and secret life of his own as distinct from the other as are the lives of inhabitants in adjoining houses whose circle of friends are as diverse as bishops from ballet dancers he preferred to deal in the work of men who were young or unknown and at present had not been able to get producers for their possible masterpieces he was thus often able by liberal offers to secure an option of purchase at a specified figure over the output of their next few years often to the sick heartedness of their deferred hopes such prospects seemed dictated by a princely liberality and they were gladly accepted scores of such plays he read and found wanting but every now and then he came across something which with judicious handling and backed by the undoubted influence he had with the public through the press he felt sure he could waft into desirable havens only this morning by the weir side he had found a gem of very pure ray which he believed to be easily obtainable and now as he read this manuscript in the train he fancied that his jewel box need not be locked up again yet the public he thought to be tired of problem dramas they liked their thinking to be peptonized for them and presented in a soft digestible form just at present too they had no use for high romance on the one hand or on the other subtle situations and delicate unravellings they wanted to be shown the sort of thing that with a little laughter and no tears might suitably happen to perfectly commonplace undistinguished though not indistinguishable persons and in this comedy of suburban villadom with curates and stockbrokers and churchwardens behaving naturally and about as humorously as they might be expected to behave without straining themselves he felt sure that he held in his hand a potential success on a large scale the author was young and desperately poor he had already had a play on the boards at the first night of which arthur craddock had been present which had scored as complete a failure as could possibly have been desired to produce suitable humility in a young man but craddock who always thought for himself instead of accepting the opinions of others had seen what good writing there was in it how curiously deft was the handling of the material and knew that the failure was largely due to the choice of subject though ten years ago it would probably have been welcomed as vigorously as it was now condemned it was an excellent play of ten years ago or perhaps ten years to come with its lurid story too difficult for the indolent theatre goer of this particular year to grasp and its climax of inextricable misery he had therefore immediately written to frank armstrong the author and at an ensuing interview told him what in his opinion were the lines on which to build a popular success then guessing or rather knowing that armstrong must have attempted drama many times before he had produced so mature a piece of work as the unfortunate lane without a turning he said i daresay you have something in your desk at home rather like what i have been sketching to you which you have very likely failed to get produced before now send it to me and let me read it it was this play easter eggs which craddock finished as the train slowed down into paddington station it could not be described as so fine a play as that which had achieved so complete a failure but it had all that the other lacked in popular and effective sentiment even to a man of craddock's experience in the want of discernment in theatrical managers it was quite astounding that it had ever been refused but he could guess why this had been its fate for there was no star part in it there was no character overwhelmingly conspicuous who could dominate the whole play and turn it into a one man show the success of it must depend on level competent acting without limelight and slow music it was a domestic drama without villain or hero or dominating personality and when he again read over the list of acting managers to whom frank armstrong had submitted it he saw how absurd it was to suppose that tranby or akroyd or miss loughton could ever have considered its production but he saw also how a company of perfectly unknown artists could admirably present it with a great saving of salaries it needed moderate talent evenly distributed and one part mishandled would wreck it as surely as would some ranting actor manager who tried to force a dominant personality into the play and only succeeded in upsetting the whole careful balance of it even as craddock drove back to his sumptuous and airless flat in berkeley square he jotted down a half dozen names of those who filled minor parts in star plays quite excellently he wanted them without the stars and then quite suddenly his mind usually so obedient bolted and proceeded at top speed in quite another direction without intention he found himself wondering what joyce was doing whether she would have told her father about his proposal or confided in that astutest of grandmothers whether she was in the punt with panting dogs or still troubled with the undoubted indisposition of buz who had not been at all well so she had told him this last day or two her life seemed to him a deplorable waste of heavenly maidenhood partly owing to a selfish father partly now at least because she had not consented to waste it no longer youth lasted so short a time and its possessors so often squandered it on things that profited not ailing dogs for instance and swans' nests among the reeds then he caught sight of his own large face in the mirror of his motor and felt terribly old he too had squandered his youth in the amassing of knowledge in all that could have been acquired when the leap of the blood thrilled less imperatively in the passion devoted to passionless things in the mere acquisition of wealth in the formation of his unerring taste and acumen but he knew that his blood had tuned itself to a brisker and more virile pulse since joyce had shaken her head and smiled and been a little troubled or was it over the indisposition of buz that she was troubled then arriving at his flat he became his own man again and cordially telephoned to frank armstrong to have lunch with him chapter iii an hour later frank armstrong was sitting opposite craddock eating lunch with the steadfast and business like air of a man who was not only hungry now but knew from long experience that it was prudent to eat whenever edibles could be had for nothing some minutes before craddock had suggested a slice of cold meat to give solidity to the very light repast that was so suitable to the heat of the day and since then armstrong had been consuming ham and firm pieces of bread without pause or speech but nobody was less greedy than he only for years of his life he had been among the habitually hungry in appearance he was rugged and potentially fierce a great shock of black hair crowned a forehead that projected like a pent house over deep set angry eyes and it might be guessed that he was a person both easy and awkward to quarrel with for his expression was suspicious and resentful as of some wild beast accustomed to ill usage but whom ill usage had altogether failed in taming but though this ugliness of expression was certainly the predominant characteristic of that strong distrustful face a less casual observer might easily form the conclusion that there were better things below a certain eagerness a certain patience a certain sensibility he looked up at craddock after a while with a queer crooked smile on his large mouth not without charm i will now cease being a pig he said but when one is really hungry one can't think about anything else it is no more hoggish really than the longing for sleep if you haven't slept for nights or for water when one is thirsty i had no breakfast this morning now what have you got to talk to me about craddock was a strong believer in the emollient effects of food and had determined to talk no business till his client was at ease in a chair with tobacco and quiescent influences ah no breakfast he said i myself find that i work best before i eat frank armstrong laughed i don't he said i work best after a large meal no i did not have breakfast because it would have been highly inconvenient to pay for it there are such people you know i have often been one of them arthur craddock found this peremptory young savage slightly alarming for himself he demanded that social intercourse should be conducted in a sort of atmosphere of politeness of manners just as in landscape painting you had to have atmosphere else the effect was of cast iron so in dealings with your fellow men there should be no such things as edges particularly raw ones he thought he had seldom seen anybody so unatmospheric my dear fellow he said do you mean that you have been actually in want of money to pay for food why did you not tell me you knew what an interest i took in you and your work frank looked at him quite unatmospherically but why should my having breakfast matter to you he said you wanted my work if you thought it good if not i was no more to you than all the rest of the brutes who go without breakfast now about the play at least i don't suppose you asked me to lunch in order to talk about breakfast i quite expect you to tell me it's twaddle indeed i know it is but does it by any chance seem to you remunerative twaddle craddock really suffered in this want of atmosphere he gasped mentally speaking like an unaccustomed aeronaut in rarefied air ah i can't agree with you that it is twaddle he said the plot no doubt is slender but the dialogue is excellent and you show considerable precision and fineness of line in the character drawing but what characters said the candid author the curate the housemaid the churchwarden lord what people without a shred of life or force in them but it answered your description of what theatre goers liked i wrote it last year in a reaction after the 'lane without a turning' ah was that it said craddock it puzzled me to know how a boy like you you are a boy my dear fellow could possibly write anything so bitter and hopeless as that and something so quietly genial as 'easter eggs' easily enough i myself wrote the one it was me and as i found out nobody liked it 'easter eggs' is merely my observation of a quantity of blameless chattering people i lived in surbiton when i was quite a boy they were rather like that there were teaparties and sewing societies to relieve distress among the poor packets of cross overs used to be sent to cancer hospitals let's get back to the subject remunerative or not without doubt remunerative agreed craddock again gasping but i have given three of our leading actors the opportunity of remunerating themselves and me and they won't touch it are their souls above remuneration and do they only want topping high art arthur craddock did not see his way to telling armstrong that he had sent his play to exactly those managers who would be quite certain to refuse it because that was information which he had excellent reason if he was to conclude an advantageous bargain for keeping to himself nevertheless i am right about your play he said and tranby and akroyd are wrong frank shrugged his shoulders so you tell me he observed yes and i am willing to back my opinion i will here and now buy this play from you and pay for it at a figure which you will not consider ungenerous considering it is a pure speculation on my part but there are certain conditions frank armstrong pulled his chair up closer to the table and put his elbows on it craddock could see that his fingers were trembling name your conditions if you will be so good he said perhaps you would also tell me more about the not ungenerous figure craddock held up a white plump hand of deprecation he positively could not get on without manners and life's little insincerities as this young man seemed to have none of them he had to supply sufficient for two he was glad to observe that signal of nervousness on armstrong's part it argued well for the acceptance of his bargain you are so direct my dear fellow he said you demand a 'yes' or a 'no' like a cross examining counsel you must permit me to explain the situation i take a great interest in your work and in you and i am willing to run a considerable risk in order to give your work a chance of being fairly judged and appreciated now there is nothing more difficult to gauge than the likings of the public and while i tell you that your play will be without doubt remunerative i may be hopelessly in error but i see in it certain qualities which i think will attract though in your previous play which frankly i think a finer piece of work than this the public was merely repelled but here armstrong's elbow gave a jerk that was quite involuntary shall we come to the point he said of course this is all very gratifying but we can talk about the play's merits afterwards how much do you offer me for 'easter eggs' and on what conditions craddock drummed with his plump fingers on the table looking across at the strong rough face opposite him he could see suspense and anxiety very clearly written there he felt a rather nasty pleasure in that it was like poking up some fierce animal with a stick where there are bars between which prevent its retaliating violence but perhaps it would be kinder to put it out of its suspense for armstrong wanted to know this more than he had wanted lunch even i offer you l down for all rights of your play he said on conditions that you let me have three more of your plays within the next three years at the same price should i choose to buy them armstrong did not take his eyes off him nor did the stringency of their gaze relax did you say l he asked in an odd squeaky little voice i did then the tension relaxed the young man got up and rubbed the backs of his hands across his eyes if i'm asleep he said i hope i shan't wake for a long time it's deuced pleasant i don't quite know what five hundred pounds mean i can't see to the end of them i thought perhaps you were going to offer me l i should certainly have accepted it why didn't you this was a good opportunity for craddock because i do not happen to be a sweater he said and because like an honest man i prefer paying a fair price for good work armstrong gave a great shout of laughter and because there isn't much difference to you between fifty pounds and five hundred he said he paused i beg your pardon he said i had no business to say that but i don't understand your offer by the way of course i accept it craddock had tried to look hurt when this rather ruthless suggestion as to the reason for his generosity was made but he did not feel within himself that his attempt was very successful and was glad to look benign again when frank armstrong apologised the tremulousness of his hands had ceased and he looked straight at his benefactor with his distrustful gaze then once more the crooked rather charming smile came on his mouth personally i am sure you rather detest me he said so i suppose it seems to you worth while financially to run this risk with your money so though i'm bewildered i tell you frankly with the prospect of five hundred pounds i'm not grateful to you i wish i was of course if 'easter eggs' makes anything of a hit you will do pretty well and i shall be a popular playwright he broke off a moment and pushed back his hair ah i see that's where you come in he said you have an option to buy three more plays by a popular playwright at the same price again if any of the three new ones makes a success you won't do very badly craddock went on the whisker hunt for a moment and if 'easter eggs' is put on and fails as your other play did he observed shall i not be considerably out of pocket and another failure would not encourage me to exercise my option over any future work of yours however let it be me this time who asks you to come to the point do you accept my offer or not i may mention that i shall not renew it i cannot waste my time over arrangements that come to nothing armstrong nodded at him with comparative friendliness good lord yes i accept it he said i told you i should have accepted l craddock got up then if you have finished your lunch we might draw up an agreement over our cigarettes certainly i daresay you will let me have a cigar too and when i've signed or whatever i have to do will you give me a cheque straight off i shall have a banking account i suppose and i shan't be hungry again for ever as far as i can see by george i ought to be grateful to you but i think the sort of experience i've been through don't give a fellow much practice in gratitude gratitude is an acquired virtue it is the prosperous who mainly acquire it craddock patted him on the shoulder my dear fellow you may leave the cynicism of the lane that had no turning behind you he said armstrong suddenly drew up his shirt cuff and showed a long scar healed years ago which ran nearly up to his elbow that's where my father threw a knife at me once he said it was a bad shot for he threw it at my head it's healed you might think it looks healed it bleeds inside though this was a savage young beast it seemed that craddock had got hold of one who had been set in slippery places that sloped hell wards craddock had known some who had learned patience from their sojournings in such resorts he had known others who had simply been broken by it others again and of those possibly the joyful and attractive charles lathom was one who seemed to have taken no colour from their surroundings but emerged with their serenity and sweetness undisturbed but never yet had he seen anyone who came out of dark places with mere anger and resentment against his sufferings and yet with strength quite unimpaired armstrong seemed to him like that the flames apparently had but hardened and annealed him he had suffered under the lash of circumstance not stout heartedly nor with any loss of spirit and now when for the first time he saw daylight ahead he was in no wise grateful for the dispersal of the darkness he did not hail the sun or melt to the benignancy of its beams he came out iron remembering the hunger of the years that had starved his body and his soul without subduing either for physically he was hard and muscular morally he was cynical expecting from others little except such emotions as he himself shared the instinct of self defence and the stoical bearing of such blows as he could not ward off he was not in himself kind or unselfish or loving and up till now he had practically never come across such qualities in others and there was really no reason why he should believe in their existence hitherto nobody as far as he remembered had done him a good turn unless thereby he reaped a personal benefit and indeed armstrong saw little reason why anybody should for the world as he had known it was not run on lines of altruistic philanthropy the strong spoiled the weak and the weak looked for opportunities of preying on the weaker the rich paid as little as they could for the service of the poor which was obviously the course that common sense indicated while the poor the workers combined so far as was possible to make the rich pay more there was no reason for either side to act otherwise and thus he was puzzled to know why craddock had offered him more than was necessary in order to get this play from him and the ensuing contract as a matter of fact craddock had done so for exactly the same reasons as that which prompted him to give charles lathom sixty pounds for his sketch he wanted to earn a sort of blind unreasoning gratitude from his new client since clients possessed of this convenient spirit were far easier to manage and to deal with but he had failed and knew it this new client though he looked forward to finding him very remunerative indeed could not possibly be considered to be blind with gratitude but after all the main point was that he should sign the contract that embodied craddock's proposals which he was perfectly willing to do and craddock's butler coming in with coffee witnessed the transaction a leaf from craddock's cheque book completed it all the appliances of refrigeration in the way of electric fans and outside blinds were not more than sufficient to keep craddock's flat at an agreeable temperature and when that evening about six o'clock mrs lathom put away her typewriter and the neat piles of manuscript and transcription which had occupied her all day the heat in the little sunbaked sitting room in sidney street which at meal times did duty also as dining room was almost overpowering but she expected the younger of her two handsome boys to arrive from his holiday on the thames with charles in time for supper and tired as she was and worn out with her daily work in this little furnace of a room her fatigue forgot itself in thought of and preparation for his home coming reggie had on a picture postcard that showed thorley weir advertised her of the hour of his train's arrival and before she need busy herself over the gas stove that stood in the corner of the passage outside the sitting room and had to be fed with pennies to keep its flame burning she found there was a quarter of an hour left her to rest herself and if possible to get a few minutes' doze to clear the heat and heaviness from her eyes this evening in spite of the home coming of one of her darlings she was conscious of an unusual despondency which quite rightly she told herself was only physical and did not touch her spirits or her essential self but this utter fatigue of body apparently reached down to her mind and she could not help since dozing proved an impossible feat receding backwards into the ashes and desolation of the past yet when she allowed herself to do so something stronger than any sense of desolation met her love and her womanhood and her motherhood and the blessing of her boys and the tired eyes grew brighter again strawberries had been very cheap that morning and she had bought a basket of them which she had laid out on a newspaper on her bed each separate so that they should not bruise each other she could give reggie some toasted cheese as well and tea and bread and butter it was not such a feast as she had planned for him on the evening of his return before he went back to his work again at thistleton's gallery next morning but she had sent the boys a sovereign only the day before in order to let them have a plethora of boat hire and general jubilance and until she took the completed copy of the manuscript back to the office next day there was nothing more in the way of cash that could be expended womanlike with all the direct and tender instincts of womanhood alert she loved to treat her males to the material comforts of life her love had to express itself not only in affection but in the edible transcription of it and while she would not have denied that mary had chosen the good part she had a strong sympathy with martha who showed her love in a fashion less purely spiritual perhaps but none the less authentic to serve even if the only monument of service was unbruised strawberries and the preparation of toasted cheese cooked over a smelling gas stove in the heat of this broiling evening did not seem to her an inferior lot she knew she had the mary love for her boys but though she did not reason about the point nor even was conscious of it she believed martha had not chosen a bad part when she put on her apron so to speak and got uncomfortably warm over the kitchen fire there were still a few minutes left before she need stir reggie's train was just about arriving now and it would take him a good half hour to walk home in twenty minutes she could do her best by his supper and have the toast and cheese hot and crisp for him and she had already put the kettle on tea would be ready simultaneously she knew the chronology of these simple suppers very well she sat in a frayed arm chair the room looked west and at this hour it was not possible to place it entirely out of the sun and since there was a little wind blowing in she drew up the blind of the window admitting both it was her hands and her eyes that were so tired for a couple of months now it had been something of a strain to read small writing and to day even the clear cut letters of her typewriter were hard to focus very probably she was in need of glasses but an oculist's fee when expenses so nearly met income was not a disbursement to be incurred lightly and certainly her eyesight was not always so bad as it had been to day the strain of continual focussing had ruled two vertical lines between her eyebrows as she had seen when she went to wash her hands after putting away her machine and before cooking reggie's supper she had seen them there before but more faintly to day they were deeply carved mrs lathom was but a year or two over forty and she was aware that wrinkles such as these had no right as yet to set up so firm a dwelling house on her face but they only troubled her as a sign of eye strain a direction post to the oculist's and as symbols of approaching age they concerned her not at all except in so far that approaching age might prove a drag on her energies and her work yet it was easy to see that as a girl she must have been beautiful and women who have been beautiful as girls are not usually so careless over the signs of their lost youth but the moment's glance sufficient to disentangle from her face the loveliness of its youth would have been except to the most superficial observers enough to make him desist from his disentangling and stand charmed and almost awed at the gifts the advance of years had brought her which so vastly out valued the mere smoothness of line and brightness of colour that they had taken away they with the losses and griefs that had visited her had taken so little in comparison with the love and the patience and the proved unconquerable serenity which they had brought her nor except that for the moment when heat and physical fatigue lay like a mist over her face dimming the inward brightness of it had they robbed her of the lighter gifts of the spirit humour and the appreciation of the kindly merriment that to cheerful souls runs through the web of life like some gold thread in the windings of a labyrinth high moral courage and simple faith are without doubt essential to noble living on whatever scale but it is only the puritanically minded who would discount the piquancy that an appreciation of the comical aspects of a world possibly tragic gives to the business of life and a certain sparkle in mrs lathom's grey eyes a certain twist in her mouth clearly betokened that she was quite capable of laughing at those she loved when they behaved in a ridiculous manner in the end without doubt a deeper abiding tenderness would overscore her amusement but she would never commit the error of blindly spoiling her idols but her ten minutes' rest was over and she got out of her cupboard the materials for supper and went out onto the landing where stood the gas stove that browsed on inserted pennies mercifully it stood near the window that looked out on to sidney street at the top of this shabby genteel house and the generous fumes grafted on to the faint odour of oil cloth and a more pronounced smell of other culinary operations on some lower storey did not hang in stagnation on the landing outside on the pavements and roadway shadowed by the houses children not quite gutter snipes but markedly a little lower than the angels played about with the eked out contrivances of childhood a pair of ill running skates shared between two a small box on wheels which would hold a baby and cabalistically labelled squares drawn on the paving stones opposite there were no houses for a stiff church stood in an acre of disused graveyard rather sad and spiritless marriages used sometimes to be officiated there and on sunday a great clamour of four bells brought together a sparser congregation than so much noise seemed to deserve over all lay a grey heat hazed sky somehow the gas stove with its accompanying odour of oil cloth and another supper below in which it was now clear that fish was an ingredient was more encouraging than those symbols of worship and mortality the gas stove promised supper anyhow and supper is a symbol that life not only is not extinct but that it demands to be maintained and mrs lathom turned to the kettle from which steam was beginning to spurt and put her saucepan on the bars of the top of the range simultaneously a motor car hooted outside and appeared to draw up still throbbing at the house then there came an impatient roulade on the bell and the moment after the leap of active ascending feet on the staircase it was impossible to mistake that tread nobody in the house but reggie came upstairs like a charging brigade and yet how should reggie have taken a motor from paddington it could scarcely be that charles was ill that there had been some accident for then surely he would have telegraphed nor did these flying feet sound like the bearer of ill news but she left her gas stove and went to the head of the stairs not exactly expecting ill news but wanting to know reggie flung himself upon her in his usual tornado of welcome oh mother things have happened he said and charles hasn't decided whether berkeley square or grosvenor square is the nicest and so he'll leave it to you yes quite right i'm mad and i've kept the taxi because charles orders you to drive out with me and have supper somewhere it's his treat to come to the point he has sold his picture right off the easel for sixty pounds i said pounds and it seems that's only the beginning oh my dear said mrs lathom i know i am so put on your hat goodness how hot the house is and oil cloth and fish and cheese don't smell as good as thorley weir berkeley square and a ticking waiting taxi and a supper at a restaurant while the root of the matter the fountain head of all this glory was just sixty pounds made up an admirable example of the charles reginald attitude towards money both of them seemed to regard it the moment that there was any immediate superfluity of it as a thing to be got rid of as soon as possible this mrs lathom continuously and earnestly and not very successfully tried to combat a future rainy day in the opinion of her sons was not worth a moment's thought if the present day was a fine one but at this moment mrs lathom also gloriously desired the swift rush through the air the sense of shaded lights and tinkle of ice for she was not in any way immune from the temptations of these sub celestial pleasures and it was with not any very great firmness that she resisted it's too dear of charles to have ordered all these nice things she said but my darling it's out of proportion even to such a fortune as sixty pounds for us to go to a restaurant send the taxi away like a good boy i was just beginning to cook your supper reggie shook his head can't be done he said charles' orders and my promise to obey them are binding and the taxi is a ticking out the sweet little twopences mrs lathom made one more effort but it's ridiculous she said and supper will be ready in two minutes and oh reggie i am longing to hear all about the sixty pounds and there are strawberries i separated them so that they should not spoil each other we will eat them when we come back said the inexorable reggie i shan't tell you a word about the sixty pounds unless you come i promised charles i heard another twopence go then a little puff of air came upstairs laden and flavoured with oil cloth and fish which would not positively improve if kept and the curious poor smell that dwells in houses where in winter the windows are not very often opened for fear of losing the warmth so expensively procured when coals are high mrs lathom's resolution wavered one of us has to give way she said please let it be you reggie can't be done the taxi is working awful quick mother all opposition collapsed oh i will get my hat you monster cried she it's exceedingly wrong of me to come and for that very reason i am going to enjoy it all the more how i long to hear about the sixty pounds put out that dreadful gas stove darling we will stop all the tickings charles duly arrived next morning with the picture not yet quite dry on the seat opposite him propped up by a melon which he had felt compelled to buy for his mother reggie had already gone off to his desk at thistleton's gallery when he arrived and she was at work with her typewriter and had not heard his step above the clacking of the busy keys she turned as the door opened with surprise and welcome on her face and rose pushing herself up with a hand on the arm of her chair a hundred times and more when he came home of an evening had charles seen her in exactly that attitude with all that love and welcome beaming in her face but to day she took his eye in a way she had never done before the artist in him not the affectionate son only perceived her he paused in the doorway without advancing oh you picture he cried how is it i never saw you before you are my next model please mother darling here i am the melon yes that's for you and the picture that's for mr craddock and me well i'm for both of you charles deposited these agreeable properties and reggie has told you all there is to be told i expect he said but unless i'm mistaken there'll be much more to tell when i've seen mr craddock to morrow morning he's coming to my studio at ten and i'm sure things are going to happen what i don't know a commission to copy a reynolds perhaps other things perhaps who knows but my next picture is going to be you you with your typewriter just getting up as you did this moment because reggie or i came in lord how often have i seen you do that and yet i saw it for the first time to day now i must go and put my studio in order in preparation for to morrow but i shall stop and talk to you for ten minutes first yes that's reggie just going to take a header into the weir dappled like a horse and spotted like a frog he says but if you won't tell anybody there's some devilish good work in it i happen to know because i put it there clever handling in the modelling of the 'nood' as bonnart used to call it when he talked english and as for the light and shadow on his blessed shoulders i call it a wonder and if i'm not deceived it'll be thorley weir he's just going to dip into oh mother i've grown silly with happiness they sat down together on the shabby shiny american cloth sofa which reggie said was guaranteed to slide from under the securest sitter in ten minutes it's a new world he went on just because somebody who i am sure knows tells me i can paint and has already shown himself willing to back his opinion you don't know what a nightmare it has been to me all this year to be earning nothing while you and reggie were supporting me she laid her thin white hand on his brown one ah my dear do you think i haven't known all along she said couldn't i see you struggling to keep your heart above water so to speak all this year my darling you haven't chattered as you chattered just now i suppose not but i mustn't chatter any more i've got to get my studio arranged and all my bits of things stuck out for mr craddock to see i wonder what he wants to come down to see everything for if it had been about this reynolds' copy only he could have asked me to bring a couple of bits of work up to him mother he is such a good sort he was so friendly over it and considerate and understanding i shall come back as soon as i've dusted and cleared up it won't take long she glanced at the sheets on her desk i think i shall come and help you she said and when we've put things to rights i will go on with my work in your studio dear if i shan't be in the way it gets so baking hot here in the afternoon hurrah and while you work i shall begin the world famed picture of the artist's mother i think you owe yourself a holiday dear after finishing that other picture pooh who wants holidays when he's happy we'll bring the melon and the typewriter and the picture along and have a jubilation charles' studio was but a few hundred yards away down a side street leading off the brompton road and had not it been called a studio it might not have been misnamed an attic four flights of dark and carpetless stairs led to it and its garniture was of the most rudimentary kind carpet and curtains it had none a dishevelled screen and torn blind shut the light when so desired from its southern facing window but in the opposite wall was a big casement giving the rayless illumination from the north in one corner the skeleton which had been arranged in an attitude of dejected thought by reggie on his last visit here had a straw hat tilted back on its skull on a shelf by it were casts of a skinless man with flayed muscles and three or four reproductions from greek antiques an easel a rough square table and three or four cane backed chairs in various stages of disrepair completed the furniture in one corner a cupboard let into the wall was masked by a ragged curtain which bulged suspiciously thither mrs lathom's housewife eyes were led and she drew it aside with a contumelious finger horror was revealed she had scarce believed that any cupboard could contain so appalling a catalogue of evidence to prove the utter incapability of a man to live when left to himself in a way consistent with self respect or tidiness or cleanliness she had not been to his studio for a month past and to day she would cheerfully have sworn that for all these weeks charles had never touched the cupboard except to stow away in it some new and disgraceful object crockery and knives and forks some clean some dirty were lodged there there were twisted and empty tubes that had contained colour there was a hat without a brim and a jug without a handle irregular shapes done up in newspaper bottles of medium tin tacks sheets of paper with embryonic sketches painting rags half used sticks of charcoal remains of food remains of everything that should have been cast into the dust bin it was a withering face she turned on charles i should not have survived it if mr craddock had seen in what a pig sty you choose to live charles she said i should have died of shame it's little work i shall do this morning in the way of typewriting water and dusters and a scrubbing brush please charles twitched the curtain over the cupboard again something fell behind it as he did so and his mother groaned it's little work you shall do in the way of cleaning up my messes he said there's a charwoman about who brushes and scrubs and makes everything resplendent for half a crown per resplendency on my word of honour she shall dust and clean but you might help me to dust my sketches and put them out mother i got her to tidy up once and she wiped off a complete oil sketch which was still wet mrs lathom looked round of course i will she said but oh charles what squalor a torn blind and a broken screen and three chairs all of which want reseating and to think of reggie and me last night stuffing ourselves at a restaurant with your money where shall we sup to night asked charles bringing out a pile of canvasses at twenty three sidney street give me a duster my dear what a quantity of paintings an hour was sufficient to make charles' private view presentable and to display all his sketches finished and unfinished round the wainscot of his walls then without pause he put a new canvas on his easel and bribed by his promise not to spend more than five shillings on their supper to night mrs lathom consented to abandon her own work for an hour and sit for him he put her typewriter on the table and made her rehearse it's like an instantaneous photograph he said at least that is what the picture is going to be like oh do attend mother and not look at the skeleton reggie stuck it there with a straw hat on it it doesn't matter you may dust it afterwards now tinkle with your typewriter and then all of a sudden reggie or i come in here to your right and you put your hand on the arm of your chair and get up saying 'gosh what a surprise and how nice' does your poor mind take that in at all it's rather important mrs lathom sat down in obedience to this peremptory son she clacked her machine and turned woodenly round with a smile as wooden as her gesture no not at all like that said charles he had set his easel up and was waiting with poised charcoal can't you manage to get up as you did when i came in this morning exercise your imagination look surprised will you try again you are working hard with your typewriter is that clear you are thinking that there is a debt of sixty pounds to clear off and that reggie is very ill then on a sudden the door opens here to your right and reggie comes in quite well bursting with health and a stack of sovereigns do attend think of what i tell you to think of then you get up and say 'darling reggie' i shall say 'one two three' and then do it and then stop just in the position i have told you never mind about your face charles took up his charcoal again and stood with hand poised one two three he said she got up and the seconds added themselves into minutes there was no sound at all except the dry grating of the charcoal on the canvas otherwise the austere stillness of the actual creation of art filled the room once again as on the morning of yesterday charles knew his hand was attuned to his eye and his eye attuned to the vision that lay behind it rapidly and unerringly the bold strokes grated across the canvas then they ceased altogether you beautiful woman said charles i've got you you can't escape me now then his face which had been grave and frowning lit into smiles mother darling he said i'm going to make such a queen of you with your shabby old dress and your eyes of love now for a treat you may dust the skeleton for ten minutes and then you must give me your face again i see it i see it all he rummaged behind the terrible curtain and found a palette and a couple of brushes he squirted onto it worm casts of colour and filled his tin with turpentine it was a medium sized canvas he had chosen about three feet six by three feet and with big brushfuls of colour very thinly laid on he splashed in the dull neutrality of greys and browns to frame his figure making notes rather than painting a blot of black indicated the typewriter and then with greater care he filled in the black of her dress and smeared in the white of the apron she wore with body colour this took but ten minutes for his bold brush and then standing a little back from it he half closed his eyes and looked a long time at it to see whether the value of background to figure and figure to background were as he meant them to be he did not want the figure to jump out from its place for even as she rose to greet the incomer with that face of loving welcome her left hand still hovered with fingers outstretched over her typewriter it had to be felt that the greeting over her work must occupy her again she had not detached herself from it for all the leaping forth of her heart in shining eyes and smiling mouth as yet the figure was a little too near the spectator a little too far off from its background and while he puzzled over this the solution struck him a little more emphasis given to the chair the arm of which she grasped gave him what he wanted she belonged to the chair and it anchored her in her place charles suddenly threw back his head and laughed oh jolly good he exclaimed and i don't care if nobody else agrees with me mother leave that silly skeleton please and get back to your place you may sit down but turn your face towards me and remember that reggie is just coming in and you've thought he was ill and charles' voice suddenly ceased and he stared at his mother as she obeyed these instructions with eyes as of some inspired seer very slowly his hand moved to his brush which he had laid down very slowly and quietly as if afraid of startling away the vision which he saw he mixed his paint and laid on the first brushful in planes of colour bold and firm and defined between the strokes he paused a long while but the actual application was but the work of a second but it was in these pauses when he stood with drooping mouth head thrust forward and eyes that seemed as if they burned their way into that beloved face that his work was done to record what he saw was far less an effort than to see the insight was what demanded all the fire and effort and imagination which possessed him he had set himself to divine and to show what motherhood meant for half an hour he worked thus he too absorbed for speech she wise enough not to risk an interruption then from mere fatigue of brain and eye with this sustained white heat effort he felt his power of vision slipping from him and laid his palette down come and look at it he said to his mother the face was but roughly put in as yet but the spirit of the face was there oh charles dear she said that is just how i love reggie and you how did you guess he took her face in his hands and kissed her guess i didn't guess he said you told me your face told me charles was not to be induced to leave his picture while daylight lasted but he wheeled it round with its face to the wall before he shut up his studio for the night he was not sure whether he wished craddock to see it in its present stage somehow it seemed to him private not for everybody until it had been clothed so to speak in paint he felt shy though at the same time he told himself he was merely fantastical at exhibiting so crude a confidence and while he was in two minds about it next morning he heard his visitor's footstep on the bare and creaky staircase outside the last flight of steps as he knew well was a mere trap to the ignorant with the darkness of it and its angles and corners and he set his door wide to give light to his visitor then just before craddock came in he told himself he was ridiculous in imagining that there could be privacy in a portrait and wheeled the easel round so that it stood just opposite the door craddock large and white and gently perspiring emerged from the stairs with outstretched hand and good morning my dear fellow he said it is very well for art to sequester herself and live alone but four flights of break neck stairs are really an exaggerated precaution against intrusion however here i am suddenly he caught sight of the portrait and he dropped charles' hand without another word and stared at it the silent seconds grew into a minute and more than a minute passed without a sound hard and commercial and self seeking as craddock was he had the saving grace of true reverence for genius and there was not the smallest question in his mind that it was a master's work that stood before him there was no need to ask who was this tired and beautiful woman for no one but her son could have painted a woman so and have divined that unique inimitable love that no woman ever felt even for husband or lover but only for those who have been born of her body and her soul it was that tenderness and love no other that charles had seen and for none but a son could it have glowed in that worn and lovely face craddock was immensely touched he had expected a good deal from this visit to charles' studio but he had never dreamed of so noble and simple a triumph as that unfinished portrait presented and when at length he turned to charles his eyes were moist and he spoke with a simplicity that was quite unusual to him that is very true and beautiful he said you are fortunate to have a mother to love you like that charles gave an exultant laugh then i have shown that he asked his shyness entirely vanishing before this penetrating person where was the point of being shy when a man understood like that indeed you have said craddock and you have shown it very tenderly and very truly it required a son to show it he looked again at the eager welcoming face on the canvas and from it to the face of the boy beside him and asked himself impatiently what was this mysterious feeling of perception that underlay and transcended all technique here was a portrait with perhaps two days' work only it happened to be less than that expended on it and even now it had arrived at a level to which mere technique could never lift it love and the inspiration that love gave it caught it up gave it wings caused it to soar yet how why there were hundreds and hundreds of artists who as far as mere technique went could paint with the same precision and delicacy why should not any of them have put on the brushful just so yet even in the most famous of all portraits of the artist's mother there was not such a glow of motherhood then he turned from it abruptly he had not come here merely to admire though he hoped that he should admire he had come on a business proposal which should satisfy both himself and the young man to whom it was made and he began examining the smaller canvases which charles and his mother had displayed round the room here were a couple of studies of thorley weir here half a dozen sketches of reggie prepared to take his plunge with details thereof a raised arm a bent knee the toes of a foot pressed heavily in the act of springing there were copies of casts there were portraits and numerous transcriptions of leg bones arm bones ribs with muscles without muscles and all betokened the same indomitable resolve to draw then there were the copies or bits of copies from masterpieces in the national gallery half a dozen heads of lady hamilton as a bacchante and in particular philip iv of spain quantities of philip iv his head sometimes sometimes a dozen of his left eyebrow with the eye beneath his right hand a finger of his right hand the thumb of his right hand could they have been put together like the dry bones of ezekiel's vision there would be a great army of philip iv and in none was there any sign of impatience the argus of eyes was drawn for a purpose and till that purpose was achieved it was evident that the artist was prepared to go on copying eyes until his own were dim admirable also was the determination to achieve the result by the same process as that employed by the master to get the general effect was clearly not sufficient else there would not have been so copious a repetition an examination of a quarter of these delicate copies was sufficient for craddock's purpose in looking at them his only doubt was whether it was not mere waste of time to give this youth more copying work to do but the study of a picture so admirable as wroughton's reynolds could hardly be waste of time for anybody also he was not sure whether his involuntary tribute to the unfinished portrait had not been too strong he did not wish charles to think of himself as one with the world at his feet i see you have got a sense of the importance of copying method he said and i feel sure you will be able to produce an adequate copy of the reynolds i have in mind now you will see why i told you to leave your camp at thorley weir unbroken for the picture in question is at the house a little lower down the river the mill house probably you know it the lawn comes down to the water's edge certainly charles knew it involuntarily there sounded in his brain a song he knew also see the chariot at hand decidedly he knew it but an infantine caution possessed him and he raised and wrinkled his eyebrows i think i do he said is there a big tree on the lawn and are there usually some dogs about yes and a charming young lady who looks after them now i can't offer you very much for the work but if l tempts you at all i can go as far as that i should not recommend you to do it at all if i did not think it would be good for you what do you say charles drew a long breath i i say 'yes' he remarked let us consider that settled then i will telegraph for the exact size of the picture and you can take your canvas down i should start to morrow if i were you ah and talking of l here is another specimen of l which i already owe you i advanced you ten did i not i will take my picture away with me if i may the crisp crinkling notes were counted out and charles took them up and stood irresolute then by an effort the words came you can't know he said what you've done for me and i feel i must tell you the notes trembled and rustled in his hand you've given me hope and life he said i i don't think i could have gone on much longer with the others working and earning and me not bringing a penny back you've done all that you've put me on my feet craddock felt for his whisker in silence a moment to do him justice there was a little struggle in his mind as to whether he should put the proposal he had come here to make or do what his better self the self that reverenced the unfinished portrait prompted him to do yet for a year now this boy had been toiling and struggling unaided and undiscovered none of all those who must have seen him copying in the national gallery had seen what those eyes of philip iv those repeated fingers and thumbs implied none had ever suspected the fire and indomitable patience of those admirable sketches it was but just that he who had recognised at once what charles already was and might easily become should reap the fruits of his perspicuous vision and the offer he was about to make would seem wildly generous too to his beneficiary my dear lathom he said i hope to put you much more erect on your feet i haven't said anything of what i came to say now let me put my whole proposal before you he paused a moment it is quite impossible for you to continue in your studio here he said you are a painter of portraits and what sitter will come up those stairs your admirable portrait of your mother will certainly be seen next year at some big exhibition and certainly people will enquire for the artist but it is mere folly for you to live here you must be more accessible more civilised some fine lady wants to be painted by you but will she survive or will her laces survive these stairs will she sit on a chair like this for an hour together and look at a torn blind i know what you will say quite sensibly you will say that you can afford nothing better but i can afford it for you i will start you in a proper studio well furnished and comfortable and as it should be why even a dentist has a comfortable chair for his sitter and a waiting room with papers and a servant who opens the door again craddock paused for he had caught sight of the unfinished portrait again and felt desperately mean but the pause was very short i will start you decently and properly he said and i will not charge you a penny but i want a return and you can make me that return by your paintings i propose then that you should promise to let me have a picture of yours every year for the next three years at the price of l do you understand in a year's time or before i can say to you pointing to a picture 'i will take this for this year' i can say the same next year i can say the same the year after you get your studio and all appurtenances free you also get a hundred a year for certain provided you only go on painting as well as you paint now i shall get three pictures by you at a price which i honestly believe will be cheap in three years' time i tell you that plainly i think your pictures will fetch more than that then craddock caressed the side of his face a moment i shall also he said have had the pleasure and the privilege of helping a young fellow like yourself who i believe has a future in front of him to get a footing in that arena where attention is paid to artistic work i have a certain command of the press it shall assuredly be exercised on your behalf you have heard of struggling geniuses i do not say you have genius but you have great talent and i shall have enabled you to work without the cramp and constriction of poverty as you paint now you need not tell me now what you decide think it over talk it over with that beautiful mother whom i hope i may see some day it is just a business proposal on the other hand if you feel no doubt as to your answer if you are going to tell me to go to the deuce for certain charles took two quick steps towards him i accept he said how gladly and thankfully i can't tell you but you might guess i think you understand so well craddock laid his hand on the boy's shoulder then there's our little private bargain he said tell your mother and that bathing boy of course but we'll not talk about it otherwise our little agreement yours and mine i don't think we shall either of us repent it it won't be me who starts repenting said charles joyously chapter iv charles was in camp again at the little peninsula fringed with meadow sweet and loosestrife below thorley weir scarcely hearing far less listening to its low thunder diminished by the long continuance of the drought scarcely seeing far less looking at the dusky crimson behind the trees which showed where the sun had set probably his unconscious self that never resting observer and recorder of all the minutest unremembered incidents of life saw and took note but though his eyes were open and his ears alert his conscious brain was busy with what concerned him more vividly than those things besides in a way he had already made them his own he had painted them half a dozen times in sketches and studies he had guessed their secret learned the magic of their romance and they were his all that was not his all the life that was expanding and opening about him could not but claim and receive this surrender of his brain and his heart he had come back here two days ago and on the morning following had presented his card at the mill house to a parlour maid who had taken it in leaving him and the canvas easel and paint box he had brought with him to grill at the door this rather haughty young person returned after a while and bidding him follow took him upstairs into what looked like a disused nursery overlooking the lawn and river and pointed at a picture propped against the end of a sofa mr wroughton hopes there is everything you require she said and please to ring if you want anything she rustled out of the door which she closed with elaborate precaution exactly as if charles had fallen into the sleep which was necessary for his recovery charles' grave grey eyes had been twinkling with amusement as he was thus led through an empty house and stowed away like a leper in this sequestered chamber and left alone a broad grin spread over his face then before looking at the picture which stood with its face towards the end of the sofa his eye made an observant tour of the room certainly it had been a nursery for here stood a doll's house here a child's crib here a chair with a confining bar between the arms so that no child imprisoned there could by any means escape but there were signs of a later occupancy a couple of big arm chairs and a revolving book case stood there also on the top of which evidently in recent use lay a writing pad with ink bottle and pen tray attached also there was that indefinable sense in the air manifest subtly but unmistakably that the room was still in use a rap at the door which indicated not may i come in but i am coming in interrupted this short survey and the parlour maid entered she cast a vulturine glance round the room she saw and annexed the writing pad but again before leaving she spoke like a delphic oracle up to date if you desire to rest or smoke there is the garden she observed now charles had already drawn his conclusions about the room and he resented the removal of the writing pad by anybody but its owner for it required but little constructive imagination to reform the history of this room surely it had been the nursery of the girl of the punt and was still used by her as a sitting room she ought to have come and got her blotting pad herself however she had done nothing of the sort and in the meantime it was his business not to dream dreams but see and reproduce another painter's vision he took hold of the picture that stood against the end of the sofa turned it round then gave a short gasp of amazement for here was the girl of the punt inimitably portrayed just so and in no other fashion had she turned opposite their tent and looked at charles while his brother execrated that which should have been an omelette there was no question that it was she there was no question either that it was a superb reynolds instantly the artistic frenzy awoke the dream that lay deep down in his young soul dim and faint and asleep seemed suddenly to awake and merge and personify itself in the treasure that it was his to copy instantly the whole room too burst into life when this prototype of its owner was manifested nor apart from the sweet and exquisite pleasure that it gave him to work here had the room been badly chosen there was an excellent north light and by drawing down the blinds of the window opposite he could secure exactly the illumination he required in five minutes he had adjusted his easel and with his canvas already mapped faintly out into squares to guide his drawing the charcoal began its soft grating journeys for a long time he worked on in one absorbed pulsation and was just beginning to feel that his arm was momentarily unable to continue without some pause for rest when an interruption unlooked for and for the moment inexplicable occurred a faint continued scratching not impatient but entreating came at the door and rightly rejecting the first idea that had presented itself to him that the indomitable parlour maid suddenly brought low besought admittance charles opened to the intruder a big golden collie stood outside who sniffed at him with doubt and hesitancy and then deciding that he was harmless came softly by and established himself on the sofa established there in the haven where it would be it thumped gently with its tail as a signal of gratitude charles stood with the open door in his hand a moment but it seemed impossible to continue drawing into the passage so to speak and with a tremor of anticipation in his wicked young heart he closed it again a parlour maid could remove a writing pad but it might easily require someone with greater authority to entice away that other possession then before going back to his work he tested the friendliness of his visitor and finding he was welcome spent a minute in stroking its ears and received as thanks a rather dry hot nose thrust into his hand clearly the dog was not well and with that strange canine instinct was grateful for the expression of even a stranger's sympathy then it lay down with muzzle on its outstretched paws and eyes wide open and suffering and puzzled charles went back to his canvas but he expected further interruptions now in a little while they began through the open window on the side towards the river where he had drawn down the blind he heard a footstep on the gravel path below a whistle and then a voice calling buz buz heard too for he pricked a languid ear and just moved a languid tail but did not feel equal to a more active recognition again and once again buz was whistled for and called and it seemed to charles that he was in the position of an unwilling accomplice who had better turn king's evidence so as quietly as he could he pulled up the blind and looked out below on the grass stood buz's mistress and perhaps the whisper of the blind had caught her listening ear for on the moment she looked up and saw charles at the window i beg your pardon he said but i was shown up here and i think it must be buz who asked to come in he is lying on the sofa there was a sudden surprise in the girl's face it might only be due to being thus addressed by a stranger from the upper storey but as a matter of fact it was not a stranger quite who addressed her she perfectly recognised him though the surprise was there oh thank you she said i will come up to fetch him charles stood there waiting with his blood somehow strangely a tingle and alert it seemed to him as if this had all happened before yet he could not remember what happened next but it all seemed very natural then he heard her quick step on the stairs and she entered she smiled at him rather remotely but not without friendliness and certainly without embarrassment thank you so much she said i could not find him buz dear come along she stood in the doorway with head already half turned to leave the room again just as in the hundred year old portrait of her buz tattooed languidly with his tail i'm afraid he is not very well said charles with the sense of taking a plunge his nose is hot and dry i'm afraid so the dogs always think of this room as their sick room if they don't feel what's called the thing buz come along buz thought not but won't you leave him here said charles joyce came a couple of steps into the room oh i hardly like to she said won't he disturb you not an atom do leave him if he feels like stopping he doesn't object to me that last sentence won joyce's heart it was easy to reach it through her dogs but she detached herself from charles again as it were and went up to her ailing dog buz darling i'm so sorry she said you can stop here if you like not quite well oh i'm afraid not well at all she bestowed a kiss on buz's head who wrinkled puzzled eyebrows at her it appeared she could not help him and he did not understand then she turned to charles again please forgive my interrupting you she said and weren't you painting below thorley weir a week ago yes i thought it was you before he had time for more than the bare affirmative she had left the room again and all the way downstairs she mingled with compassion for buz a wonder why she had felt as if she could not help asking that although she was perfectly certain it was he it was characteristic of charles that he flew to his drawing again for that expressed his feelings better than any mooning reverie would have helped him to do he must draw he must draw just as an eager young horse must run to give outlet to the life that rejoices in its limbs besides each moment of industry brought him nearer to the painting of the face and the half turned neck but before he began again with buz's permission he kissed the top of his flat golden head and went to his work with a heightened colour feeling a little ashamed of himself perhaps an hour passed while from the house came no sound at all nor any from the room where charles worked except the scrape of his charcoal and the rather quick uneasy breathing of the dog then came an interruption which did not excite him in the least for he had not forgotten the manner of access peculiar to the parlour maid will you be working here this afternoon sir mr wroughton wants to know she said and if so will you take some lunch charles' foolish heart leaped i should be delighted to he said again silence descended then with a heart that leaped down again he heard a subdued clink on the stairs it was even so then re entered the parlour maid with a neat tray on which was set an adequate and austere refreshment and as charles ate his excellent cold mutton and rather stringy french beans he grinned largely at his mental picture of himself as the prisoner in solitary confinement who might take exercise in the prison yard when he wanted to smoke but buz shared his confinement and the apparition of buz's mistress was not unknown by and by he would take his exercise and then again the glory of the reynolds portrait the exquisite satisfaction too of being able to see from his studies in the national gallery the manner of its doing and the knowledge that he could owing to his long and careful practice put on the paint somewhat in that manner swallowed up his entire consciousness again a gong sounded from below and buz from mere force of habit knowing this was dinner time got off his sofa before he realized that dinner was of no use to him he went but a few steps towards the door then turned and sat down in front of charles seeking his eyes with his own mournful not understanding mutely beseeching to know what was the matter asking him to help charles tried to convey comfort and buz acknowledged his efforts by a few heavy sighs breathed into his caressing hands then walking stiffly and painfully he went back on to his sofa again but charles felt as if he had been taken into the poor beast's confidence buz had enlisted him to give such aid as was possible the room had grown very hot in the last hour with the unflecked outpouring of the sun on its roof and charles thought with a touch of not more than secondary rapture of the cool liquid embrace of his weir but a more primary ecstasy was in the foreground and putting aside his charcoal he could not resist getting out his paints and rioting with loaded brushfuls over the expanse of the faded blue of the sky that toned into pale yellow above the low horizon to the right of the picture on the left rose a thick grove of dark serge clad trees against which was defined that exquisite head and to which there pointed that beckoning hand who was the unseen to whom she beckoned with that gracious gesture yet a little imperious to what did she beckon him perhaps only and that would be the best of all to a saunter through the twilight woods with her alone away from such crowds as might be supposed to throng the stone terrace seen glimmeringly to the front of the picture to a talk sitting on the soft moss or on some felled tree trunk in low voices as befitted the quietness of the evening hour to an hour's remission from the gabble and gaiety of the world or was it he the unseen onlooker who had asked her to give him half an hour he had something he wanted to tell her charles could picture him in his satin coat and knee breeches stammering a little a little shy something for her ear alone then the mere quality of the splendid work struck and stung him afresh what depth of clear and luminous twilight was tangled among the trees that cast tides of long shadows clear as running water over the lawn the grass had been painted first and the shadow laid over it it was impossible not to daub in some of that no one had ever seen quite as reynolds saw not quite so simply and comprehensively and then suddenly despair benumbed his fingers it would be a profanity were it not so grotesque to think of copying such a wonder and at that charles became aware that both hand and eye were thoroughly and deservedly tired also that he had a searching and imperative need for tobacco it was decidedly time to seek the prison yard the sun had ceased pouring in at the window when he had raised the blind to turn king's evidence with regard to buz and now a cooler breeze suggestive of the coming of evening sauntered in it was this perhaps that had refreshed the sick dog for when charles opened the door buz shambled off the sofa and followed him downstairs there was no difficulty about finding the way into the garden for it lay straight in front of him at the foot of the stairs and still seeing no signs of life he crossed the lawn and walked on a grass path down between two old yew hedges buz still at his heels towards the river then turning a corner he stopped suddenly on a low chair sat a very old lady suitably to this hot day she was dressed in a little print gown with a linen sunbonnet and looked exactly like the most charming of kate greenaway's gallery she was employed without the aid of spectacles on a piece of fine needlework that looked rather like baby linen but was probably for her own embellishment joyce full length on the ground was reading to her she instantly dropped her work never in all her life had she failed to make herself agreeable to a good looking young man and she was not going to begin now joyce had half raised herself also and gave charles a half smile of welcome which she augmented into a most complete one when she saw buz buz dear she said lady crowborough did not quite say charles dear but she easily might have if she had known his name joyce introduce him to me she said joyce looked at charles raising her eyebrows and quite taking him into the confidence of her smile and her difficulty it's the she nearly said boy but corrected herself it's the gentleman who is copying the reynolds granny she said then to charles may i introduce you to lady crowborough lady crowborough held out her little smooth thin hand charmed to see you she said of course i knew what my silly granddaughter has told me such a to do as we've had settling where you were to paint and where to stow all joyce's bits of things and what not charles had excellent manners full of deference and void of embarrassment and my name's lathom he said as he shook hands well mr lathom and so you've come out for a breath of air continued the vivacious old lady get yourself a chair from the tent there and sit down and talk to us only go quietly else you'll wake up my son who's having a nap there and that'll cause him indigestion or perspiration or a sinking or i don't know what perhaps joyce had better get it for you she won't give him a turn if he happens to wake oh but i couldn't possibly began charles well you can go as far as the tent with her while she pops round the corner and carries a chair off and then you can take it from her but mind you come back and talk to us or if you want to be useful you can go to the house and tell them i'm ready for tea and i'll have it here ring the first bell you see and keep on ringing till somebody comes the whole lot of them go to sleep here after lunch such a pack of nonsense what's the night for i say and then instead of dropping off at the proper time they lie awake and say a great buzzing or a dog barking or a grasshopper sneezing prevented their going to sleep charles went swiftly on his errand and accomplished it in time to join joyce outside the tent and take the chair from her already the comradeship which naturally exists between youth and maiden had begun sensibly to weave itself between them in addition charles had been kind to buz and seemed to understand the significance of dogs it was good of you to let my poor buz stop with you she said he has adopted you too for he came out when you came didn't he yes i hope he feels better what's the matter i don't know and the vet doesn't know and the poor lamb himself doesn't know he's old poor dear and suffers from age perhaps like most old people except darling grannie i shall send for the vet again if he doesn't mend they had come within earshot of lady crowborough who was profoundly indifferent to the brute creation she preferred motors to horses mousetraps to cats and burglar alarms to dogs she was equally insensitive to the beauties of inanimate nature though her intense love contempt and interest for and in her fellow creatures quite made up for these other deficiencies now you're talking about your dog joyce she said i'm sure i wish he was well with all my heart but if his life's going to be a burden to him and you i say put the poor creature out of his pain a dab of the stuff those murderers use in the east end and the thing's done i say the same about human beings let the doctors do the best they can for them but if they're going to be miserable and a nuisance to everybody i should like to put them out of their pain too give 'em time to get better in if they're going to get better but if not snuff them out much more merciful isn't it mr lathom i hope they'll snuff me out before i'm nothing but a mass of aches and pains but they haven't got the sense though i daresay they'll so stuff me up with drugs and doctor's stuff that i shall die of the very things that were meant to cure me joyce giggled darling granny she said you wouldn't like it if i came to you one morning and said 'drink it down and you'll know no more' well i'm not a nuisance yet with rheumatics and bellyache observed lady crowborough lor' the medicine your father takes would be enough to sail a battleship in if he'd collected it all instead of swilling it and much good it's done him except to give him a craving for more why when i was his age a good walk and leave your dinner alone if you didn't want it was physic enough but i've no patience with all this talk about people's insides it's only those who haven't got an inside worth mentioning who mention it and did you come all the way back from your tent in the heat mr lathom to go on painting this afternoon oh no said charles they very kindly sent me a tray up with some lunch on it and you sat there all by yourself mum as a mouse and ate up your tray she asked you don't do that again mind you come and talk to me at lunch to morrow i never heard of such a thing joyce my dear pour out tea for us i want my tea and so does mr lathom i warrant he got nothing for lunch but a slice of cold mutton and a glass of sarsaparilla if your father had the ordering of it now i hear you live in a tent mr lathom tell us all about it ain't you frightened of burglars there's nothing to steal except a tin kettle and me said charles well that makes you more comfortable no doubt joyce my dear it's no use giving me this wash put some more tea in and stir it about and let it stand i like my tea with a tang to it and your tent doesn't let the rain in not that i should like to sleep in a tent myself i like my windows closed and my curtains drawn you can get your air in the daytime the outside air is poison to me unless it's well warmed up in the sun but i should like to come and see your tent she regarded charles with strong approval he was certainly very good to look upon strong and lean and clear skinned and he had about him that air of manners and attentiveness which she missed in the youth of to day he sat straight up in his chair when she talked to him and handed her exactly what she wanted at the moment she wanted it ah but do come and see it he said mayn't i give you and miss wroughton tea there some afternoon i promise you it shall be quite strong to morrow said lady crowborough with decision i'll go in the punt for once and joyce shall push me along charles excused himself soon after in order to get another hour of his work and he was scarcely out of earshot when lady crowborough turned to joyce well my dear she said i don't know what you've done but i've fallen in love with that young man and to think of him having his lunch all alone as if he was your father's corn cutter or hairdresser when philip awakes he shall know what i think about such rubbish where's my cup i don't want to tread on it as i did yesterday why mr lathom's put it back on the table for me i think he's a dear said joyce and he was so nice to poor buz don't begin again about your dog now said lady crowborough though i daresay mr lathom has been most attentive to him and no wonder with which rather delphic utterance she picked up her needlework again while a smile kept breaking out in chinks as it were over her face for though she liked presentable young men to be attentive to her she liked them also to be attentive to any amount of their contemporaries young men did not flirt enough nowadays to please her they thought about their insides and that silly scotch golf but she had noticed the change of expression in charles' respectful eyes when he looked at joyce she liked that look it was many years since she had seen it directed to her but she kept the pleasantest recollection of it and welcomed the sight of it as directed at another and in her opinion joyce well deserved to have a handsome young fellow looking at her like that she so strictly dieted on the somewhat acid glances of her father a little judicious flirtation such as lady crowborough was quite disposed to encourage would certainly brisken the house up a bit at present in spite of her own presence there it seemed to have no more spring in it than unleavened bread next day according to the indisputable orders of lady crowborough charles had taken his lunch with the family and though philip wroughton had thought good to emphasize the gulf which must exist between his family and a young man who copied their portraits for them by constantly using the prefix mr when he spoke to charles the meal had gone off not amiss irrespective of lady crowborough there was the inimitable lightness of youth flickering round it a lightness which joyce by herself felt unable to sustain but which instinctively asserted itself when a little more of the proper mixture was added afterwards charles had paddled back to his encampment in order to prepare for his visitors and soon after while philip slept the sleep of the dyspeptic his daughter and mother left in the manner of a riverside juliet and a very old nurse to go to what lady crowborough alluded to as the party she had dressed herself appropriately in a white linen frock with little rosebud sprigs printed on it and an immense straw hat with a wreath of rose to embellish it she had a horror of the glare off the water which might cause her to freckle and wore a thick pink veil which being absolutely impenetrable served the additional purpose of keeping the poisonous air away from her her whole evergreen heart rejoiced over this diversion for not only was she going to have tea with her handsome young man my new flirt as she daringly called him but having had a good go of flirtation herself she was prepared to encourage the two young people to advance their intimacy most of all she hoped that they would fall in love with each other and was then prepared to back them up for she had guessed in the twinkling of an eye that craddock had philip's consent in paying attentions to joyce and with her sympathies for youth so keen and her antipathy for middle age so pronouncedly contemptuous she altogether recoiled from the idea of joyce ever having anything to do with that great white cream cheese as she expressed it to herself she found the cream cheese agreeable enough at lunch and dinner to give her the news of the town and a bit of tittle tattle in this desert of a place but she had no other use for him either for herself or her granddaughter charles received them at the edge of his domain ankle deep in forget me nots and conducted them a distance of three yards to the shadow of his tent where tea was spread there were two deck chairs for the visitors the box of provisions with a handkerchief on the top for table and a small piece of board for himself he had pinned up against the tent side two or three of his sketches and his sole tumbler stood by the tea things with a bunch of forget me nots on it he made no apologetic speeches of any description about the rudimentary nature of the entertainment because he was aware that he had nothing else to offer them besides the tea was strong and there was a pot of strawberry jam joyce'll be saying she must live in a tent too remarked lady crowborough withdrawing her veil upon my word mr lathom i like your dining room very much that thicket behind cuts the beastly wind off that's the colour i like to see tea it's been standing a quarter of an hour lady crowborough said charles with his respectful glance are you sure it's not a little well a little thick not a bit joyce and you may add water to yours if you like and are those sketches yours they seem very nice though i don't know a picture from a statue she looked at them more closely and has joyce been sitting to you already she asked in a tremor of delight they had been sly about it the ingenious charles looked mightily surprised oh that he said following her glance that's only a little water colour sketch i did of the head of the reynolds picture but it is like miss wroughton isn't it it was indeed so for that matter was the reynolds lady crowborough was a little disappointed that joyce hadn't been giving clandestine sittings but she knew as well as charles himself that he had executed this admirable little sketch with joyce so to speak at his finger tip and not her great great grandmother and her new flirt rose higher than ever in her estimation and when will you have finished your copying she asked here again charles did not fail i can't possibly tell he said when i came down i imagined it would take a week or ten days if i worked very hard but i see how utterly impossible it will be to do it in anything like that time but it's lovely work i don't care how long it takes bless me how sick and tired you'll get of it said she not if you'll come and have tea with me lady crowborough said this plausible young man lady crowborough grinned all over she knew just how much this was worth but she liked it being said well anyhow this american mr ward is quick enough about his part of the bargain she said my son received his cheque this morning sent by your friend mr craddock joyce my dear five thousand pounds there's a sum of money charles paused a moment some remembrance of an american and a cheque for l stirred in his brain without his being able to establish the connection what has he got it for five thousand pounds he asked yes plenty too i should say for a bit of canvas and a lick or two of paint on it i'm sure when you have finished his copy none of us would be able to tell the one from the other isn't five thousand pounds a good enough price mr lathom well it's a very good picture said charles joyce was watching him and saw the surprise in his face why did mr craddock send father the cheque she asked lord my dear i don't know said lady crowborough cheques and bradshaws are what i shall never understand i suppose it was what my bankers call drawn to mr craddock his name was on the back of it anyhow whenever i get a cheque which is once every fifty years i send it straight to my bank and ask them what's to be done next and it always ends in my writing my name somewhere to show it is mine i suppose but as for bradshaw it's a sealed book to me and i send my maid to the station always to find out suddenly charles remembered all about this american and the cheque for five thousand pounds and the slight film of puzzle uncertainty though nothing approaching suspicion rolled off his mind again reggie a week ago had mentioned the drawing of this post dated cheque at thistleton's gallery it was all quite clear but undoubtedly this mr ward had obtained his picture at a very reasonable figure then as if to abjure what had never been in his mind he spoke not more warmly than his heart felt about craddock mr craddock has been tremendously good to me he said it's scarcely a week ago that he first saw me when i was painting here one afternoon and you brought him by in the punt miss wroughton the very next day he bought my picture off my easel well i hope he gave you five thousand for it too said lady crowborough charles beamed at her she had finished her second cup of positively oily tea and was smoking a cigarette with an expression of extreme satisfaction he did more for me than that lady crowborough he said he gave me a chance a start then he came to see my studio and gave me the commission to paint this copy and then charles' simple soul found it hard to be silent but he remembered craddock's parting admonition and then my dear asked lady crowborough then he's made me feel he believes in me he said that's a lot you know when nobody has ever cared two straws before by jove yes i owe him everything certainly her new flirt was a charming young fellow and lady crowborough saw that joyce approved no less than she she felt he was probably extremely unwise and inexperienced and would have bet her veil and gone back veilless the prey of the freckling sun that craddock had made some shrewd bargain of his own it was now time for her flirt to have an innings with joyce she was prepared to cast all the duties of a chaperon to the winds and inconvenience herself as well in order to secure this well i've enjoyed my tea and my cigarette she said and all i've not enjoyed is joyce's punt i shouldn't wonder if it leaked and the gnats on the river were something awful they get underneath my veil and tickle my nose and i shall walk home across the fields and leave you to bring the punt back my dear and if you've got a spark of good feeling joyce you'll help mr lathom wash up our tea things first and this wicked old lady marched off without another word joyce and charles were left alone looking exactly like a young god and goddess meeting without intention or scheme of their own in some green herbaged riverside in the morning of the world they did the obvious instinctive thing and laughed everyone does what darling grannie tells them said joyce so we had better begin the only suggestion i make is that i wash up because i'm sure i do it better than you and you sit down and sketch the while because i shouldn't wonder if you do it better than me but i wash up beautifully said charles i think not there was egg on my tea spoon i'm sorry was that why you didn't take sugar yes have some now by itself said he i think i won't where's a tea cloth charles wrinkled his brows they dry in the sun he said we thread them tea cups that is on to the briar rose and the plates do begin sketching they dry also they are placed anywhere but one tries not to forget where anywhere is otherwise they get stepped on charles plucked down the reynolds head from the tent wall i began it from the picture he said but may i finish it from you if you wash up by the forget me nots and i sit in the punt at the far end i can do it oh how is buz to day he didn't come up to the nursery she neither gave nor withheld permission to finish the head in the way he suggested but her eyes grew troubled as she emptied the teapot into the edge of the water it was choked with tea leaves gorged replete with them he picked up his water colour box and climbed out to the cushions of the punt buz isn't a bit well she said i've sent for the vet to come again to morrow oh isn't it dreadful when animals are ill they don't understand they can't make out why one doesn't help them buz has always come to me for everything like burrs in his coat and thorns in his feet and he can't make out why i don't pick his pain out of him sorry said charles scooping some water out of the river in his water tin but looking at her their eyes met with the frankness you would say of children who liked one another but for all the frankness only a few seconds had passed before the unwritten law that a boy may look at a girl a shade longer than a girl may look at a boy prevailed and joyce bent over the tea cups she was not the less sorry for buz but but there were other things in the world too i know you're sorry she said and so does buz and we both think it nice of you and how long really do you think your copy will take and what will you do if the weather becomes odious i shall get a cold in my head said charles drawing his brush to a fine point by putting it between his lips joyce looked at him with horror oh don't put the brush in your mouth she said they always used to stop my doing it at the drawing school some of the paints are deadly poison oh do you paint said charles you ought to have painted and i to have washed up please stop still for a moment exactly like that so sorry but i shan't be a minute damn an unfortunate movement of his elbow jerked his straw hat which was lying by him into the thames it caught and pirouetted for a moment on am eddy of water and then hurried gladsomely down stream but your hat said joyce in a strangled whisper as if being forbidden to move she must not speak i'm afraid i've already said what i had to say about that said charles just one second he worked eagerly and intensely with concentrated vision and effort of its realization for half a minute then again he used that forbidden receptacle for paint brushes and dragged off the excessive moisture from his wash now i'll get it while that dries he said he picked up the punt pole and ran down the edge of the bank to recapture his hat but it had floated out into mid stream and his pursuit was fruitless and it looked quite new said joyce reproachfully on his return i'm afraid you are extravagant just the other way round it would have been false economy to have saved my hat price half a crown and have risked losing the the sight i got of you just for that minute while my hat started voyaging but now he said gleefully washing out his brushes now that i've got you let the great river take it to the main he made the quotation simply in the bubble of high spirits not thinking of the context nor of the concluding and following line no more dear love for at a touch i yield but instantaneously the sequel occurred to him for the words were set to a tune which he very imperfectly sang with his light tenor and accompanied on his banjo you talk of too many things in one breath mr lathom said joyce you said if the weather broke you would catch cold here so of course you must go to the inn in the village if it rains men have no sense i believe you would stick on here while you get congestion and inflammation and pneumonia then you asked me if i painted and i may tell you i don't i used to try if i have any sketches left the sight of them would convince you of the truth of what i say charles' art and heart tugged for his whole attention for another minute he was silent and absorbed quite done he said thank you so much miss wroughton charles looked at her and all thought of his art passed from him she was entrancing and he suddenly woke to the fact that in the last quarter of an hour they had made friends he came towards her stripping the sketch off its block do let me give it you he said rather shyly you see i shall enjoy the fruits of your labour as i shan't have to wash up it's only fair that you should have the fruits of mine at least if you would care for them at all she could not but take in her hand the sketch not yet dry which he held out to her and looking at it she could not but care never was there anything more admirably simple never had an impression been more breezily recorded there was no attempt at making a picture of it there were spaces unfilled in a mere daub of hard edged blue in the middle of the sky was sufficient note to indicate sky the weir was a brown blob and a brown blot of reflection and a splash of grey as if the brush had spluttered like a cross nibbed pen showed where the water broke below against it came the triumphant painting of a head her own on the head in the reynolds picture but so careful so delicate and for the rest of her there was a wash of stained blue for her dress a patch of body colour careless apparently but curiously like a tea cup against it at her feet was a scrabble of blue lighter than her dress but none could doubt that this meant forget me nots they were like that though the scrabble of pale blue seemed so fortuitous probably charles never painted more magically than in those ten minutes even when the magic of his brush had become a phrase in art criticism a cliche there was all that a man can have to inspire it there and the inspiration had all the potential energy of the bud of some great rose it had the power of the full blossom still folded in it the energy of the coiled spring the inimitable vigour of a young man's opening blossom of love it was no wonder that she paused when he handed it to her her own face her own slim body and gesture as he saw her leaped at her from the sketch and she thrilled to think is that what he sees in me no array of compliments subtly worded brilliantly spoken could have told her so much of his mind it was an exquisite maiden that he saw and that was she she could not but see how exquisite he thought her she could not fail to glow inwardly secretly at his view of her those few minutes' work at the cost of the straw hat came as a revelation to her he showed her herself or at least he showed her how he saw her the insatiable and heaven born love of all girls to be admired shot in flame through her now that she saw his sketch she knew that she had longed for that tribute from a man though till now she had been utterly unconscious of any such longing mr craddock when he proposed to her lacked all spark of such a flame had even he but smouldered she knew she was loved that in itself seemed almost terrifyingly sufficient she let herself droop and lie on it on the thought of it it was transcendent in its significance her scrutiny lasted but a moment then from the sketch she looked back to charles again him who had seen her like that and had she possessed his skill of brush and could have painted him there would have been something in her sketch as in his of the glimmering light that trembles high in the zenith when the day of love is dawning back and forth between them ran the preluding tremor a hint a warning of the fire that should one day break into full blaze fed by each but to the girl at present it was but remotely felt and its origin scarcely guessed at to him the tremor was more vibrant and its source less obscure the waters were already beginning to well out from their secret spring and he beginning to thirst for them the moment had been grave but immediately her smile broke on to it oh that is kind of you she said i shall love to have the sketch and i retract it was worth a lot of straw hats to do that perhaps you have not even lost one i may overtake it on its mad career as i go back home i will rescue it for you if i come across it and give it first aid i must be getting back now thank you ever so much for the delicious tea and the delicious sketch you will be at work again i suppose to morrow morning such was the history of the two days which charles revolved within him that evening after he had eaten his supper and sat out by the water side unwitting of the dusky crimson in the west and the outpouring weir things fairer and more heart holding than these absorbed and dominated his consciousness day by day his copy of this wonderful reynolds wonderfully grew beneath the deftness and certainty of his brush though he had said that it would take much longer than he had originally contemplated he found that he was progressing with amazing speed and though he would gladly have worked more slowly and less industriously so as to lengthen out the tale of these beautiful days it seemed to be out of his power to keep back his hand he was dragged along as it were by the gloriously galloping steeds of his own supreme gift once in the room opposite the portrait he could no more keep his fingers off his brush or his brushes off his canvas than could a drunkard refrain alone with his cork drawn intoxicants nor could he for another and perhaps more potent reason keep away from the house where the picture was or after a reasonable morning's work lounge away the afternoon on the river by cords he was drawn to the mill house for there was the chance of not infrequent fulfilment of meeting joyce and then he had to go to his extemporized studio and the other frenzy possessed him but poor buz had no pleasures in these days and as they went by the old dog grew steadily worse he was a constant occupant of the sofa where he had established himself on the first morning of charles' occupation and if he was not as was generally the case in his place when charles arrived of a morning it was never long before there came at the door the request for admittance daily feebler and more hesitating charles had to help him to his couch now for he was too weak to climb up by himself but he always managed a tap or two with his tail in acknowledgment of such assistance and gave him long despairing glances out of dulled topaz eyes that expressed his dumb bewilderment at his own suffering the abandonment of his dismay that nobody could help him once on entering charles found joyce kneeling by the sofa crying quietly she got up when he entered and openly wiped her eyes i'm so glad you don't think me silly she said for i feel sure you don't other people would say as darling grannie does 'it's only a dog' only what more do you want charles laid a comforting hand on buz's head and stroked his ears i could easily cry too he said for helplessness and because we can't make him understand that we would help if we possibly could what did the vet say yesterday joyce shook her head there's no hope she said there would have to be an operation anyhow and probably he would die under it he wouldn't get over it altogether in any case he's too old mr gray told me i had much better have him killed but i can't bear it i know i ought to but i am such a beastly coward he sent a bottle and a syringe this morning there it is on the chimney piece i can't bear that the groom or coachman should do it or the vet and i can't do it myself though it's just the only thing that i could do for poor darling buz charles turned from the dog to her let me do it miss wroughton he said i know what you mean you can't bear that a stranger like a coachman should do it but buz always liked me you know and rather trusted me you mean that don't you joyce gave a great sigh yes oh just that she said how well you understand but would you really do it for me charles went across to the chimney piece and looked at what the vet had sent yes it's perfectly simple he said i see what it is i did it for a dog of my own once it's quite instantaneous he won't feel anything and when said joyce piteously as if demanding a respite i think now said charles he's dying he won't know anything joyce bit her lip but nodded to him then she bent down over the sofa once more and kissed buz on his nose and on the top of his head then without looking at charles again she went out of the room this aroused buz but before many minutes were past he had dozed off again then charles filled the little syringe wiped the end of it so that the bitterness should not startle him and gently pushing back the loose skinned corner of his lip he inserted the nozzle and discharged it a little shiver went through the dog and he stretched out his legs and then moved no more at all charles went to the door and found joyce standing outside it's all over he said buz felt nothing whatever joyce was not up to speaking but she took his hand between both of hers pressing it chapter v a dark october day with slanting flows of peevish rain tattooing on the big north window of charles' new studio was drawing to a chill and early close and the light was rapidly becoming too bad to paint his mother at whose picture he had been working all day was sitting in front of the plain deal table from his old studio with fingers busily rattling on her typewriter and charles had put his easel on the model's stand and worked from this elevation since the figure in the picture was looking upwards it was nearing completion and the last steps which were costing him so much biting of the ends of his brushes and so continual a frown that it seemed doubtful if his forehead could ever again lose its corrugations were being taken and his progress which up till now had been so triumphantly uninterrupted was beginning to shuffle and mark time admirable though the wistful welcoming love in her face was thrice admirable as craddock had thought it charles knew now it did not completely represent what he saw all day he had been working at it making his patient model keep rising and looking at him and not only was he dissatisfied with the inadequacy of it but he knew that he was losing the simplicity and brilliance of his earlier work on it hence these knottings in his forehead and the marks of teeth in the handles of his brushes mother darling he said stand up once more will you and that will be all now by incessant repetition she had got the pose with unerring accuracy and she pushed back her chair and rose facing him he looked back from her to his canvas and from it back again to her and the frown deepened it was not the best he could do but he could not better it by patching and poking at it for one moment he wavered the next he had taken up his palette knife and with three strokes erased the whole of the head then he gave a great sign of relief thank god that's done he said and to morrow i will begin all over again i was afraid i wasn't going to do that my dear what have you done she asked leaving her place and coming to look oh charles you've scraped it all out yes thank god as i said before but when mr craddock saw it this afternoon he said it was so wonderful well i daresay it wasn't bad but if craddock thinks that i'm going to be content with things that aren't bad he's wrong said charles it'll be time for me to say 'that will do' in twenty years from now for the present i'm not going to be content with anything but the best that i can do and that wasn't the best and that is why there's that pat of paint on my palette knife and no head on your dear shoulders mrs lathom still looked troubled but he had ordered it dear she said he had chosen it as the picture he was going to buy from you this year charles rapidly turned on all the electric light i don't care a straw he said nobody is going to have pictures of mine that aren't as good as i can make them i see more than i saw when i painted it first and i couldn't inlay that into it your face isn't a patch work counter pane no we begin again now mother dear do be kind and toast muffins for tea while i give the place where your head was a nice wash down with turpentine so that there's no speck of paint left on it reggie's coming in and as soon as we've got greasy all over our faces with muffins we'll go and stand in the queue at the theatre we shall have to go pretty early 'easter eggs' is a tremendous hit and the pit's always crammed charles scrubbed away at his canvas for a minute or so in silence beaming with satisfaction at his erasure of the head i'm blowed if we stand in the queue at all he said as a thanks offering for my own honesty i shall go and get the three best places that are to be had now i won't be thwarted i shall get fifty pounds this week for the reynolds copy and i choose madam i choose to go to the stalls i will be economical again to morrow for weeks and weeks hullo here's the child reggie come and look at my picture of ma haven't i caught the vacant expression of her face quite beautifully i think i shall let craddock have it just as it is and he can call it 'the guillotine at play' charles you are the most tiresome began his mother i know i touch the limits of endurance but i am pleased to have wiped your face for you i shall want you at ten o'clock to morrow morning goodness how it rains i am glad i'm not going to stand outside for a couple of hours reggie had subsided into a large chair and was toasting his feet at the fire mother's morose he said when i was prepared to enjoy myself she always was a kill joy mother darling you shouldn't indulge in these melancholy fits consider what a great girl you are consider anything but put lots of butter on the muffins charles history repeats itself mr ward opulent american you know came in again to day with craddock and again he drew a cheque at my desk and again though i lent him my pen he didn't tip me he must be indecently rich because to day he gave craddock a cheque for ten thousand and one hundred pounds what had he bought dunno some little trifle for the servants' hall i suppose ten thousand for the picture one hundred for the frame do you think oh another thing there was a long notice in the 'whitehall' about the exhibition at the 'british painters and etchers' i brought it home it says all kinds of things about the picture of me here it is catch hold charles snatched at the paper with all a boy's natural pride in being for the first time noticed in the press nor was the morose mrs lathom less eager for with muffin on toasting fork she left the fire and read over his shoulder and the moroseness vanished oh charles she cried 'brilliant achievement masterly technique the gem of a rather mediocre exhibition figure of a graceful stripling' reggie my graceful stripling that's you 'a new note in english painting' you darlings what a pair of you i should like to know who wrote it i wish the people would sign their names but as charles read his first impulse of pleasure faded altogether at the end he crumpled the paper up and threw it into the fender good lord what rot he said lays it on thick doesn't it said reggie but i like the part about the graceful stripling you would said charles the studio which was part of craddock's bargain with charles was admirable in design and appointment a huge sky light set in the slope of the roof looked towards the north and an apparatus of blinds made it easy to get as much or as little light as was required the walls were of that most neutral of all tints the grey green of the underside of olive leaves and the parquet floor had a few sober hued rugs over it but colour was there in plenty a couple of brilliant screens one of lacquer one of stamped spanish leather intercepted possible draughts and gave a gorgeous warmth of hue to their neighbourhoods and a big open fireplace with dutch tiles and a little congregation of chairs round about it added to a mere workroom a delightful focus of rest and comfort the faithful skeleton and the flayed man kept each other company in a sequestered corner where they might be supposed to entertain each other with dismal tales of how they came to be what they were for the room was no longer the study of a student but the living place of a practitioner beyond these things there was little to attract the attention or seduce the eye for the vision that comes from within must feed on what it suggests to itself and not be tickled with what others have done and thought at the time when craddock had made his offer to charles the room with its little chamber adjoining was already in his hands and he had thought of using it as an overflow gallery from thistleton's but he had drawn a longer bow in offering it to charles for his speculation there he believed to hold a larger financial possibility than an extension of thistleton's promised and his furnishing it in accordance with what he thought to be charles' psychical requirements was not less than masterly morning by morning when charles arrived there he felt instinctively that he saw clearly here that his own vision was unharassed by things that were ugly and inconvenient and yet not distracted by the challenge of beauty that demanded attention in this temperate colourless place he grew as plants grow on warm grey days not soaked or scorched but realizing themselves and expanding accordingly to their own irresistible vitality a month ago charles could not have scraped out the face that to day he so joyfully erased from his canvas no doubt these utterly congenial conditions did not produce his development but they presented nothing that hindered above all the constant gnawing at his heart of the thought that he earned nothing contributed nothing to those who worked for him was removed to some natures such conditions are a spur to him they had only been a drag they had never retarded his industry but they had always caused him that inward anxiety which though he knew it not shackled the perfect freedom of his service to art to day he had no touch of such cramp or stiffness he felt entirely untrammelled his soul stood nude and unimpeded like some beautiful runner or wrestler there was nothing to hinder its leap and swiftness arthur craddock had been exceedingly busy this autumn indeed since the month that he had spent at marienbad during august when he atoned for the plethora of nourishment which he had taken during the year before and cleared his decks so to speak for action again he had hardly spent a night out of town the bulk of his work was in connection with the production of easter eggs for since he knew that no acting manager would look at it for not containing a star part or if he did would quite infallibly spoil it by making a star part out of it he on rather a magnificent scale of speculation had taken a theatre himself and himself engaged the actors whom he desired to see in it these were without exception ladies and gentlemen who had not hitherto been so fortunate as to attract attention for this reason their services were more cheaply secured which was an advantage but the corresponding disadvantage was that they were not possessed of any great histrionic experience and thus needed the more drilling and instruction craddock had engaged an excellent stage manager who fully entered into his conception of the manner in which the play must be presented but there was scarce a rehearsal at which he was not himself present and after which he did not confabulate with his stage manager sometimes from the incessant hearing of the scenes they seemed to him to lack all significance and dramatic force and be as their despairing author had openly avowed them the merest twaddle but even when hope burned lowest and craddock seriously wondered how great would be the loss he would have to face he still stuck to his opinion that there were marketable elements in this quiet drama he had another cause for financial disquietude during the summer there had been an outrageous exhibition of post impressionists at one of the london galleries and though from an artistic point of view he considered that these nightmare canvases had as little to do with art as the tasteful decorations of a saloon carriage he had through an agent made very considerable purchases of them with a view to unloading again on the confiding public since his return from marienbad he had caused them to be hung in thistleton's gallery and had written several signed articles in the whitehall which he considered should have proved provocative of purchasers but up to the present the gallery had been barren of buyers and even though himself pointed out to mr ward to whom his recommendation had hitherto been always sufficient the marvels of this new mode of vision and masterly defiant absence of all that had hitherto been known as drawing or painting the latter though lamenting his artistic blindness had altogether declined to make breaks in the frieze of nightmare which brooded on the gallery walls but though for the present his money a considerable sum of it was locked up in these monstrous and unmarketable wares he did not which would have affected him far more poignantly lose prestige as a critic and appraiser of art since he had bought under an agent's name and the secret of his identity with thistleton's gallery was at present inviolate his astute young clerk as has been seen had conjectured as much but it was only a conjecture and the conjecturer was only reggie had craddock known of reggie's brotherhood to his new protege he might perhaps have devoted a little thought as to whether he should take any steps to ensure secrecy as it was he neither knew reggie's name nor suspected his conjecture or relationship a third disagreeableness had chequered september for craddock and added a further burden to his anxieties during the weeks of rehearsal for this play four years before he had purchased one of his convenient options on the literary work of a slow labouring and diabolically canny scotchman who had failed to find a publisher for a story which craddock had judged to be a very beautiful and delicate piece of work he had given this execrable pict the sum of three hundred pounds for it coupled with the right to purchase any future work by him during the next three years for the same sum whereupon the execrable pict having made quite sure that he had mastered the terms of his agreement had sat down in his frugal house in perthshire and devoted himself to study and porridge and reflection for those three years he had not set pen to paper but lived a life of meditation that would have done credit to a student of raja yogi attaining samadhi and the period of his apprenticeship to craddock being finished and the contract terminated had written a book over which when it was published during september the whole world it seemed had laughed and wept never was there a more tender and exquisite idyll reviewers hailed him as scotland's most transcendent sun round which all lesser lights must for ever burn dim hot and hot the editions poured from the press and craddock impotent and dismayed saw the little fortune which he felt was justly his pour into the purse of this disgusting northerner the execrable pict was a danae he sat with gold showering round him the gold that he had acquired in those three years when he sordidly lived thanks to craddock's bounty on porridge and meditation craddock had not it will be observed lost money over this unfortunate transaction since he had more than gathered back his original outlay but the thought of what he had missed woke him early in the morning after the remembrance of the last rehearsal had prevented his going to sleep at night legally he believed he might be judged to have some claim since the book in question was if not blackly written with ink on paper invented and thought over and prepared during those years in which he had a claim on the author's work but for personal reasons he did not desire that this pathetic history should be exposed to the unsympathetic ventilation of the law courts but it confirmed to him the wisdom of doing business wherever possible with the young and inexperienced though these financial clamours were loud round him craddock was not so distracted by them as to neglect his interests in the work of his new artist and it says much for his equanimity in troublesome times that between these discouraging rehearsals and the contemplation of the execrable pict and the unmarketable post impressionists he devoted his full attention to the furnishing of such a studio for charles as would give him the best possible conditions for work he himself chose its furniture and embellishment he sat with his white face on one side and his little eyes half closed to select the colour for the walls he himself pulled the blinds up and down over the big north light to make sure that this novel system of springs worked smoothly he did not of course go so far as to believe that a suitably appointed studio can do anything whatever towards the ripening of a possible genius but his own thoroughness and common sense told him that when you are dealing with a brain and hand so sensitive as that of a true portrait painter it is the falsest economy to spare either money or trouble in securing for him the best possible conditions for his work and when this afternoon he paid a visit to the studio an hour before charles triumphantly and joyously expunged that sweet and tender face from his canvas craddock thought himself justified it will be readily understood that among this multiplicity of ventures and perplexities craddock had little time or psychical stuff to devote to the girl who it is not too much to say had brought a new type of emotion into his life but though he had no time to address himself actively to thoughts of her her image lived somewhere in the background of his mind without loss of vividness indeed without volition on his part it seemed to be gently soaking into the businesses with which he was more acutely concerned so that for instance even when his brain was most attentive to some lugubrious rehearsal he would see himself and her with perhaps lady crowborough as chaperone and frank armstrong as perspiring author seated in the stage box on the night of the first representation perhaps he would not ask armstrong as there was a fierce rugged kind of strength about him that a girl might possibly find attractive but such is the blindness with which ironical fate smites her puppets no such qualms with regard to charles who had so he had learned stayed at the mill house on lady crowborough's invitation for a week after the summer had broken in torrential rain towards the end of july ever entered his head then only a week ago for the date of production had to be postponed and yet again postponed until the rehearsals went with a smoothness that no friction disturbed came the first night of easter eggs and before the evening was half over the conduct of the execrable pict and the apparent permanence of the post impressionist pictures on the walls of his gallery had been smoothed out of craddock's mind as a wrinkle in the sand is erased by the incoming tide from the first moment the simple and brilliant little play with its neat construction and well etched delineation of character charmed and captivated the house it was not necessary for the audience to put too strenuous a call on their intelligences and as craddock had foreseen they found an entertainment much to their minds in watching and enjoying the unfolding of the unpretentious but absorbing little chronicle it had something of the fragrance of cranford about it and its gaiety was of some little bonneted quakeress suddenly moved to dance in a shy decorous manner nor did the faint patronizing blame and praise of the critics next morning disturb him in the slightest he knew well from the manner of its reception and the pleased chattering crowd that waited for their vehicles in the lobby when the last act was over that he need have no fear for the solidity of its first night's success being a critic himself he knew how seldom his colleagues spotted the right horse indeed the only jarring note was the attitude of the sardonic author when subsequently he supped with the owner and in reply to craddock's congratulations returned those congratulations into his bosom armstrong in fact seemed rather vexed at the success of the evening and craddock remembering for a brief moment his own feelings on the success earned by the book of the execrable pict understood something of the young man's ingratitude certainly the ill luck which followed craddock these last months even at marienbad the number of pounds of the too too solid which he had lost were not what he had hoped for seemed to have turned for easter eggs when it had run a week gave evidence by its advance bookings of the security of its favour with the public and the critics also were airily beginning to say that they had said so all along so with the removal of these financial anxieties craddock was at leisure to turn his mind to the riverside again and on the evening of the day on which he had visited charles just previous to the ruthless destruction of the head in his portrait he went down again to thorley to dine and sleep at philip wroughton's house he had two ostensible reasons for so doing in the first place he wanted to see charles' copy of the reynolds in the second he wanted to talk over his friend's plans for the egyptian winter he was minded to spend a month or two in egypt himself and wondered whether a little judicious hinting would cause philip to make a suggestion that he would be eager to fall in with he found and was not ill pleased to find that lady crowborough was not in residence but had gone back to town where she was accustomed during the winter months to hermetically seal herself up in the manner of a hybernating dormouse in a small dark house in half moon street but he found when the subject of egypt was mentioned at dinner that she had gone to town principally in order to supply herself with linen frocks and veils that should thwart the freckling powers of the egyptian sun my dear mother said philip as he passed the port to craddock has got it into her head that she would like to accompany joyce and me and when she has got any plan of any kind in her head joyce and i find it useless to protest she does not listen to any arguments nor does she reply to them she carries out her plan i do not entirely applaud this one as likely as not it will be i who will have to look after her for i am sure she will find the journey and the heat very trying and as i planned this expedition with a view to regaining such measure of health as may be possible for a confirmed invalid i do not quite applaud her resolution but as i say she is quite indifferent to applause or its absence sometimes i think that old people tend to become a little selfish he frowned slightly as he poured himself out the water with which he was to facilitate the entry of his after dinner cachet and she will expect joyce to be with her and read to her and look after her he continued and i shall be companionless shut up and condemned to an invalid life as i have been i find it difficult to think of anybody who might accompany us and relieve me of the solitude which will so largely be mine but the world in general and even one's friends soon forget an invalid like myself but certainly i should like now that my mother has settled to come with us a further addition to our party philip was sufficiently astute to observe others when he was not entirely absorbed in himself and as he looked at craddock now it seemed to him that there was a certain suggestion of expectancy of tension even about him in fact he had raised his wine glass from the table as if to drink but sat with it poised neither drinking nor replacing it if only i could induce you to come with us he said craddock put his glass down i think if you had not suggested that he said that i should have risked a rebuff and done it myself he paused a moment only one thing might have deterred me he added namely the fear that my presence after what happened when i was here last might be distasteful to miss joyce philip waved this away with his thin white hand i know that the young are often very selfish he said but i do not believe that joyce would for her own sake wish to deprive me of so congenial a companion even if your suggestion was well founded but i am sure it is not indeed i think your being able to come with us is a very fortunate circumstance for her and if i may say so for you as well as for myself she will have ample opportunities for knowing you better and appreciating you more truly shall we go into the next room ah by the way since you will now be seeing about your journey and your hotel accommodation in egypt perhaps it would not be troubling you to make arrangements for us also my mother i know will take a maid who will look after her and joyce i cannot afford a similar luxury the rain and gale that had clamorously wept all day had vastly increased at nightfall and when the two men left the dining room they found joyce sitting in the drawing room with open windows in the attempt to clear the room of the smoke that had been blowing down the chimney this rendered the room impossible for her father to sit in and since his own sitting room was in no better plight joyce was despatched to see whether her room which was on the other side of the house and sheltered from the fury of the wind was more tenable her report was favourable and her father coughing and feeling sure that this quarter of a minute's exposure to the open window of the drawing room had chilled him went upstairs with her leaving craddock to look at the copy of the reynolds which hung in the dining room he had had dusky glimpses of it during dinner but now when he examined it by a fuller illumination the execution of it amazed him not only was it faithful in line and colour but in that indefinable quality of each which marks off the inspired from the merely intelligent copy there was the same gleeful mystery in that turned and radiant face it was as if charles no less than the painter of the original picture had known this entrancing girl had penetrated by his artistic insight into the joy and vitality that enveloped her and how like she was to joyce he was swift to see and the picture did not long detain him but on his way upstairs he very sincerely congratulated himself on the tide in his affairs that was proving so fortunate easter eggs he already counted as a gold mine three pictures of charles' one of them that admirable portrait of his mother were enviable possessions and there was the winter in egypt and the golden possibilities which it contained already his own he determined or almost determined to give charles the hundred pounds which he had received from his customer in payment for the copy made of the reynolds instead of the fifty he had promised him he could easily say that mr ward had been so delighted with it that in a fit of altruistic generosity seeing that the copy was not his he wished to make a larger remuneration charles would be so ingenuously grateful and craddock liked gratitude and ingenuousness they contained the elements of security joyce gave him a charming welcome to her room she had just heard from her father that craddock would join their party it is delightful that you will come to egypt with us she said a party of four is the ideal number there was an absence of the personal note in this which craddock as he caressed the side of his face did not fail to observe quantitatively then we are all right miss joyce he said but is the latest addition qualitatively satisfactory joyce wore raised eyebrows and a slightly puzzled smile at these polysyllabic observations but it is probable that she understood very well it is delightful that you are coming she repeated craddock might have attempted to get a more personal welcome than this but at the moment his very observant eye caught sight of a small framed sketch that stood in the circle of lamplight on the table instantly his attention was diverted there nor was it only his artistic attention that was thus captured for in a glance he saw that this sketch concerned him in ways other than artistic he put out his hand and drew the picture more immediately under the light unconscious that he had not even acknowledged joyce's repeated speech of welcome there she knelt in charles's sketch on the carpet of forget me nots at the water's edge her head was turned as in the reynolds picture to face the spectator while her body was in profile it was possible enough that charles had begun this water colour replica of her head from the reynolds itself but there were differences in it subtle and insistent that showed beyond all doubt that the girl had sat to him for it also she was engaged as to her hands with a white blot of a tea cup the dish cloth which she held in her other hand was green with reflection from the bank beside her which basked in brilliant sunshine behind was the weir with its screen of trees above a dab of blue was sufficient neither more nor less to indicate the serenity of the summer day critic to his finger tips craddock could appreciate none better than he the slenderness of the means employed to portray these things and the adequacy no one but a great artist would have dared to omit so much the foreground of forget me nots was two mere swirls of paint the weir a splash of brown with a smudge of grey to indicate the shadowed water while a mere twirl of the brush showed the swift current of the river but in the midst of these mere symbols and notes of colour was her face and that was a marvel of portraiture into which an infinity of care was absorbed of the same quality were the vague lines that showed the girl's slim body it was she and no other who knelt among the forget me nots and it seemed to craddock that just as none but a son could have painted that portrait of charles' mother so none but a lover could have painted this he saw the difference between joyce and the reynolds picture now previously he had only seen the marvellous similarity but here the blood and heart beat of the artist throbbed in the exquisite handiwork but his artistic sense took the first call on his faculties but a little masterpiece he said i have never seen a happier moment that's an inspired boy philip just shrugged his shoulders at this admiring explosion ah that little picture of joyce he said it has always seemed to me rather sketchy and unfinished but if you admire it so much i am sure joyce would be delighted to let you have it joyce turned quickly to her father and for the first time craddock saw her troubled and disturbed oh father i can't possibly she said quickly mr lathom gave it me she broke off short and her face and neck were flushed with the blood that sprang there then bright eyed and rosy as the dawn she turned to craddock it is a clever sketch isn't it she said and all the background is only three dabs and a smudge i suppose they happen to be put in the right place he did it one afternoon when granny and i were having tea with him she gave him a few seconds more for looking and then quickly held her hand out for it and replaced it on the table then she baldly and ruthlessly changed the subject i don't think you have even been up here before mr craddock she said it was my nursery once as the rocking horse and the doll's house witness then my school room as the time table of lessons above the chimney piece witnesses and please let it now become your smoking room and light another cigarette now do tell us about egypt i know darling granny will want to stop in cairo and go to every dance and dinner party the new topic effectively diverted her father from the channel concerning charles and his sketch for he was always more ready to talk about things that concerned his own comfort than any topic which was unrelated thereto but a week in cairo before going up the nile to settle down for a month's sunshine at luxor was not unreasonable if lady crowborough desired more cairo there was of course no cause why she should not indulge herself to any extent in its pleasures and festivities but she would be obliged to indulge herself alone the party whose sole object was the pursuit of health for philip could not be expected to hamper their guest joyce had no inclination so he assumed then for gaieties like these the temples of karnak were much more to her mind joyce left the two men before there was any sign of the discussion growing lukewarm and went to her bedroom this was on the other side of the house fronting the full bugling of the gale and the maddened tattoo of the rain on her panes it was impossible in this onslaught of elemental fury to open her windows but she felt in the very bones and blood of her a longing for the out of doors whatever its conditions up and down her room she walked strangely and unwontedly excited and had she obeyed her impulse she would have put on a cloak and let herself out of the house to walk or to run or even to stand in the blackness of the night and the bellowing of the wind and feel herself one with the wild simplicity and force of the storm better even than that she would have liked to go forth and plunge herself naked under the hueless night with the torrent and froth of the weir to struggle and be buffeted by the furious water to be herself and nobody else not anybody's daughter not anybody's companion not even his with whom her soul seemed suddenly mated she had gone out for a drenching walk to this weir only this afternoon and had leaned over its grey wooden railing and watched the water in flood over the promontory where a tent had stood below her a carpet of forget me nots where she had knelt and she could have found it in her heart to wade through the foam of the flood to kneel there again and recapture the first thrill of the knowledge that had come to her then that unbidden flash of desire had lightened on her but for a second and she had instantly shoved it away again slamming the door on it and turning the key and shooting the bolts but it had been there and to night as she paced her room she knew quite well what lay behind the barred doors of her consciousness and though she had imprisoned it giving it no bail to go abroad she was not ashamed of it it burned there within her warmly radiant and though she would not allow herself to see the light of it she knew it to be there and secretly exulted in the knowledge but she did not directly want to throw it open to herself just now she only wanted to be herself as she felt she would be if she could be out in the storm she did not formulate in her mind the indubitable necessity of unlocking her inmost self in order to be herself illogically enough but with a very human inconsistency she longed for the conditions that would give her the sense of freedom of expansion that she demanded without contemplating that on which her whole freedom was based yet she knew well that against which she revolted from which she longed to escape in a word it was the fact and the implication founded on that fact that arthur craddock was coming to egypt with them coupled with it was the idea so cursorily introduced by her father that she should give craddock the sketch that charles had made of her literally no expedition of ingenuity could have framed a more unfeasible request there was nothing in the world she could less easily have parted with and the suggestion was just thrown over the shoulder so to speak like an idle question a meaningless complimentary speech but now she wondered whether it was only that taken in conjunction with craddock and his bloodless wooing of her she felt it was possible that this was in the nature of a test question was it was it once more for a moment she desired the night and the storm and the waters of the swollen river then instantly she knew that all this was but a symbol of the knowledge that burned behind the closed and barred door of her mind she seemed to have no volition in the matter she but looked at the doors and they swung open and the light that burned within was made manifest she ceased from her restless pacing of her room and with a little sigh of recovered rest sat down at her dressing table and unlocked one of the drawers it was empty but for a couple of letters addressed to her they were quite short and nearly quite formal but they filled the drawer and they filled everything else beside she read them dear miss wroughton i hope the copy of the picture satisfies your father i didn't see him before i left and i should so much like to know that he is pleased with it if he is i can't tell how sorry i was to finish it for it was such a pleasure to do it i should so like to see it in its place if that is possible i often think of you and poor buz there was nothing here that the merest formalist might not have written only a man formalist would not have written it she took out the second letter dear miss wroughton i am so glad your father likes the copy about that silly little sketch if you are going to frame it i think you had better just have a plain gilt frame and no mount a mount will only make it look more dabby i am busy with a portrait of my mother and it's tremendous fun chiefly i suppose because she has a perfectly darling face and is utterly like her face but of course any day will suit me to come down and look at the copy and i do want to see if it is fairly satisfactory i will come on any day and at any hour that you suggest sincerely yours charles lathom p s i have got into a new studio which is lovely won't you be up in town sometime before you go to egypt and won't you come to lunch or tea lady crowborough said she would and i will ask her the same day or if my mother came wouldn't it do but i should like you to see my things it has been quite dark for days and i suppose will be all the winter i wish i could put my studio down in egypt there was nothing here that anybody might not see but joyce would not have shown those letters to anybody she felt she would have shown his heart no less than her own in showing them and for comment on the text if any were needed there was his sketch of her that was how he saw her all restlessness had utterly subsided she had only been restless as long as she had wanted to be herself without admitting to herself all that was most real in her as long as she shut up the bright burning knowledge that shone in her innermost heart now she had thrown the closed doors wide and sat very still very bright eyed with the two simple little notes on the table in front of her desiring no more the air and the tumult of the night but unconscious of it hearing it no longer below the drawer where she kept those letters was another also locked after a while she opened that also and took out what it contained often she had laughed at herself for keeping it often she had scolded herself for so doing but neither her ridicule nor her blows had stung her sufficiently to make her throw it away or destroy it in its present condition it would have been hard to catalogue or describe but there was no doubt that this shapeless and mud stained affair had once been a straw hat she had found it drowned and pulpy just below the landing stage of the mill house the day after charles had made his sketch of her meantime arthur craddock though glib and instructive in matters of hotels and travel had been very deeply busy over a new condition that he felt to concern him considerably rightly or wrongly he believed that this boy who had painted that wonderful little water colour of joyce was in love with her he could not wholly account for his conviction but judging intuitively it seemed plain to him and what seemed no less plain and far more important was the fact that joyce peculiarly valued that sketch no intuition was necessary here the trouble and sudden colour in her face when she told her father that she could not possibly part with it spoke more intelligibly than her words even had he known or guessed a little more had he conjectured that even at this moment joyce was sitting in her room with those two little notes spread in front of her while in a drawer yet unopened there lurked the dismal remains of charles' straw hat he might have suspected the futility of the abominable interference that he was even now concocting for little meddling lies have seldom the vitality to enable them to prevail against needs that are big and emotions that are real soon or late by logical or chance discovery comes the vindication of the latter and they assert themselves by virtue of their inherent strength soon or late for the air is full of thousands of stray sparks comes the explosion that shatters such petty fabrications the chance circumstance that blows it sky high but he only thought that he was dealing with the calf love of a boy whom he had rescued if not from a gutter at any rate from a garret and who was altogether insignificant save for his divine artistic gift the fruits of which he was bound to sell at so reasonable a price to himself and with he supposed the fancy of a girl who knows nothing of the world for a handsome young face so in this dangerous state of little knowledge he planned and invented as he talked about steamers and hotels till even his companion was convinced that the utmost possible would be done for his convenience and comfort then for he was now ready craddock took up charles' sketch again certainly that young lathom has a wonderful gift he said and i congratulate myself on having obtained you so fine a copy of your reynolds he stayed with you did he not when the weather broke philip glanced at the clock it was already half past ten but he did not mind having a word or two about charles indeed it is possible he would have initiated the subject yes he was with us a week he said though the invitation was not of my asking he seemed a well behaved young fellow craddock caressed the side of his face before replying i wish i could share your good opinion of him he said of course when i recommended him to you for the work which he has certainly done very well it never occurred to me that you would have him in the house like that but i have no wish to enter into details and since his connection with you is over there is no reason why i should philip got up indeed i am glad to know that he said because there certainly was considerable friendliness between him and joyce which i did not altogether like though it was hard to prevent now i have a reason which my duty forbids me to disobey for refusing to allow any resumption of their acquaintance i am not sorry for that craddock got up also then let us leave the subject he said now i know your bedtime is half past ten so pray do not be ceremonious with me but allow me to sit here for a quarter of an hour more while you go to bed listen at the storm but by this day month i hope we shall both be in that valley of avalon basking in the warm sunshine of nile side for the present it is goodnight and goodbye for i have to go early to morrow i will write to miss joyce fully about our travelling arrangements craddock lit another cigarette after his host was gone and knowing he would not see him again in the morning thought over what he had just said to assure himself that he had managed to convey that indefinite sufficiency which he had in view he thought that he had probably succeeded very well for he had given his host an excuse which he was clearly glad to make use of for stopping any future intercourse between this young fellow and his own circle and he had effected this without being positively libellous for he had said no more than that he wished he could share philip's good opinion of him he felt that it was certainly time to prevent the ripening of this acquaintanceship that joyce had better have it conveyed to her as assuredly she would that she would not see the author of that sketch any more the sketch stood by him on the table and once again he took it up and found it even more admirable than he had thought and even as he looked the injury and wrong that he had done to its artist made him feel for the first time a curious dislike of him he disliked him just because he had injured him but this dislike did not extend to his pictures and the thought that the portrait of his mother and two more canvases besides would pass into his possession gave him the keenest sort of satisfaction since he augured for their author a fame and a future of no ordinary kind what would that hand be capable of when its power was fully matured certainly it should not be for want of recognition that he should any longer remain unknown he himself though anonymously had written the notice to the whitehall regarding charles' picture of his brother at thorley weir and next week under his own signature would appear a column's notice of the same exhibition practically devoted to that one canvas at any rate that would have the effect of making the world in general turn their eyes to that which had evoked from him so apparently extravagant a eulogy and he completely trusted the picture itself to convince them that no extravagance had been committed people would be set talking and in next year's academy would be hung the portrait of charles' mother that would be sufficient he got up and lit his bedroom candle it seemed to him that he had arranged charles' future very satisfactorily he would do the most that could be done for a young man with regard to his artistic career and as regards his private affairs he had made arrangements for them already in half a dozen sentences that had not been spoken amiss but his new born dislike of him made him reconsider his resolve to pay him the hundred pounds which mr ward had been so pleased to give for the copy of the reynolds after all charles had been promised only half that sum and had been more than content to close with that bargain the fact that mr ward had paid more for it was a thing that lay outside questions that concerned him craddock had promised him fifty pounds for the copy and craddock would pay it but he did not definitely settle either on one sum or the other it was three days after this that craddock's word of warning to joyce's father bore fruit she had come into his study that morning before lunch and found him singularly well pleased at the proposed itinerary which craddock had sent him that morning sleeping berths had already been secured they would not have to change trains at paris and the sleeping car went on arrival at marseilles straight through to the quay where their ship was berthed and you came in to ask me something joyce he said when he had explained this yes father i have heard from mr lathom asking when he can come down to see his picture framed and in its place i suppose any day will do will it not shall i ask him to stay the night philip had been expecting this he remembered a cordial invitation conveyed by his mother to the artist to come back and see his handiwork when it was framed and in the room of the original picture but it was a little uncomfortable to be obliged to give a reply so different to that which joyce expected and there was nothing in the world which he disliked so much as being uncomfortable bodily discomfort of course was the worst form of that imperfection but mental discomfort was odious also i think mr lathom may take it for granted that his picture looks well and pleases me he said we have less than three weeks here before we actually start for egypt there is an infinity of things to do you will be very busy without the extra burden of entertaining people joyce did not at once assent to this or even reply to it all her secret knowledge seethed within her he was asked to come to see it she said a more definite statement was necessary philip had been glad enough of craddock's information but he did not find it quite easy to use it with joyce's young eager face looking at him yet its eagerness gave him an added courage it was too eager in spite of the excellent reasonableness of her words he felt the unreasonable wish behind them by my mother he said who does not regulate all my affairs frankly my dear joyce i do not want mr lathom in my house again i do not hear a very good account of him to copy a picture for me is one thing to have him proposing himself even though asked is quite another you may take it that we have finished with mr lathom joyce's instinct and desire urged her i don't see how i can write a letter to him on those lines she said am i to say that you don't wish to see him again if that is so father you must write it yourself i i was very friendly with him when he was here why should i appear to cease to be so philip went into the rage of a weak man he had not meant to argue the point with joyce he had in his imagination framed this interview on quite different lines in his imagination it was enough for him to have said that charles' proposed visit was inconvenient and that joyce would have written a note that should embody his wish but while he delayed and fussed with the little appurtenances of his writing table adjusting sealing wax and putting pens level joyce spoke again he isn't quite like a bootmaker or a tailor she said whom you can order down and who will send in what you have commanded he has been staying with us i can't say to him that we have finished with him the weak rage burst out that is what you are to say he cried you will make it clear that he is not to come here again you will show me your note when you have written it quite polite of course but it must be made clear that we have finished with him he came to paint a portrait and he has done so and he has been paid no doubt for his trouble that is all we are going to egypt within a week or two his visit will be inconvenient he may come after we have gone away if he chooses and look at his picture he wants to see it very well he shall see it after the third week in november he beat with his feeble closed hand on his table do you understand he said you will tell him that he may come here when we are gone not before and not after we get back he can look at his picture every day for three months you may tell him that if you choose and you have no consideration for me joyce you make me excited and make me raise my voice which as you know quite well always gives me a fit of coughing joyce came back from the window and sat down by her father at his table if i am to write such a letter father she said i must know why i write it you must tell me something which accounts for it she had her voice perfectly in control but she could not control her colour she felt that her face had become white and though she detested herself for this palpable sign of emotion she was powerless to prevent it it is easy for me to account for it said philip though i should have hoped that my wish was enough it isn't enough said joyce quietly i have treated him like a friend you must treat him as a friend no longer and as an acquaintance no longer he is not a desirable friend for you nor an acquaintance he is nothing to you he painted a portrait he begins and ends with that he is not the sort of man i want to know or want my daughter to know the weak rage subsided but the calmer tone which followed was not less ineffectual you must take my word for it dear joyce he said you are young and inexperienced and you must obey me and not see any more of this young man i have excellent authority for telling you that he is undesirable as friend or acquaintance i am sorry for it he seemed harmless enough and even well bred joyce got up the accumulated weight of the habit of filial obedience was heavy but her heart was in declared rebellion nor did she believe what had been told her will you tell me who this excellent authority is she asked no you must take its excellence on trust from me joyce turned to him she spoke quite respectfully but quite firmly then i can't write that letter she said i am very sorry but it is quite impossible and do you intend also to disobey me with regard to neither seeing nor communicating with mr lathom again joyce hesitated no i intend to obey you she said at least at least i promise to tell you if i ever intend to do otherwise for the first time it struck him that he was dealing with a force greater than any that was at his command hitherto joyce had never put herself into open opposition to him and he had had no experience of the power which her habitual serenity held within it you are vastly obliging he said i had no idea i had so obedient a daughter i am sorry father she said but you have been asking me to do things i can't do things you won't do said he you have made me feel very unwell with your obstinacy i am sorry for that too she said chapter vi the autumn session combined with a singularly evil season as regards pheasants had caused london to become very full again during november with the class that most needs and happily can best afford to pay for amusement and theatres were enjoying a period of unprecedented prosperity night after night the queue outside the theatre where easter eggs was being performed had the length attained usually only by gala performances and after a month's run craddock had successfully accomplished the hazardous experiment of transplanting it to a much larger theatre which by chance happened to be tenantless his luck still burned as a star of the first magnitude and he had without difficulty sublet the scene of its initial triumph and started a couple of provincial companies on a prosperous progress money poured in and with a generosity that surprised himself he presented the author though there was no kind of claim on him with a further munificent sum of two hundred pounds but armstrong's continued ingratitude though it pained him did not surprise him nearly so much as his own generosity he knew exactly how the young man felt it was but a few days before he was to start on the egyptian expedition when armstrong was dining with him in his flat in berkeley square intending to read to him after they had dined the first act of the lane without a turning which with somewhat cynical enjoyment he was remodelling in order to suit the taste of the great ass as he called the patrons of the drama though craddock had urged and entreated him not to attempt this transformation however thoroughly it was transformed he argued that the great ass would detect that below lay the original play of which it had so strongly disapproved would feel that it was being laughed at and would as it always was quick to do resent ridicule he put forward this view with much clearness as they dined you have had the good fortune that comes perhaps to one per cent of those who try to write plays he said you have scored a great and signal success and i beseech you not to imperil your reputation and prestige by so risky an experiment i don't doubt your adroitness in remodelling and even reprincipling if i may coin a word frank had only just filled his wine glass he emptied it at a gulp not exactly reprincipling he said it's more turning it upside down but i think your advice is rather premature do you know considering you have not at present the slightest idea what this remodelled play will be like had you not better wait till i read you some of it i don't think it matters what it is like said craddock because there will still be 'the lane without a turning' at the bottom of it it might be macbeth and hamlet rolled into one that remarkable combination would certainly have a very short run remarked frank you were saying i was saying that the public and the critics will know that at the base of your play lies the play they so unmistakably rejected there was one critic who thought it promising said frank and he is reaping a very tidy little harvest for his perspicacity you are girding at everything i say this evening my dear fellow said craddock placidly frank looked at him with scarcely repressed malevolence i think the sight of this opulent room and this good dinner and delicious wine makes me feel vicious he said i can't help remembering that it is i who have really paid for all i am eating and drinking a hundred times over and yet it is you who ask me to dinner i am sorry if i burden you with my hospitality said craddock and as a matter of fact it was you who asked yourself frank armstrong laughed quite true he said and i will ask myself to have another glass of port but really i think the situation justifies a little wailing and gnashing of teeth craddock was slightly afraid of this very uncompromising young man he liked to feel himself the master and the beneficent patron of his proteges and it was a very imperfect sense of mastery that he enjoyed when he was with this particular beneficiary he had tried cajolery and flattering him with the most insignificant results and he determined to adopt more heroic methods as to the gnashing of teeth he observed there certainly was less gnashing of teeth on your part before i put on this play for you for the simple reason that you often had to go without meals but i am bound to say you didn't wail frank laughed again that's not bad he said but i repeat that it is maddening to think of you earning in a week over my labour as much as i earned altogether of course you had the capital one can't expect labour and capital to fall into each other's arms i had much more than the capital said craddock i had the sense to see that star actors would not take or if they did take would ruin your works you had not the sense to see that if you will pardon my saying so true i like you better when you answer me back and i'm not denying your shrewdness god forbid when i have been the victim of it i've been thinking let me tell you how i can get out of your clutches but really i don't see my way you may take it i suppose that you're safe now about this play i don't see to begin with why it matters to you what i write you needn't exercise your option over it unless you please in that case i shall get it done on my own account ah but it does matter to me said craddock if you produce a couple of plays that fail you may consider your present success as wiped out you can't tamper with a reputation and the bigger it is yours at this moment is very big indeed the more it is vulnerable it is for your sake no less than mine that i am so strong about this surely for my sake a little less than yours suggested frank if you will have it so and for your sake a little less than mine i advise you not to produce plays too quickly the public are very fickle if you flood the theatres with the dramas of frank armstrong they will soon laugh at you i disagree with that policy altogether said frank whatever happens they will get tired of you in five or six years so for five or six years i propose to produce as many plays as i possibly can i find i've got lots more twaddle sketches and things half finished and scenarios that were invariably returned to me but they shall be returned to me no longer actors and managers are tumbling over each other to get hold of my work i like seeing them tumble by the way there is a point in our agreement i should like to discuss akroyd came to me to day good lord think of akroyd coming to me when a few months ago he wouldn't even let me come to him he came to me with his terrible smile and his amazing clothes and offered me a thousand pounds in advance on account of royalties for a play he wants to see and approve the bare scenario now supposing i accept and you choose to exercise your option on it do you get that naturally i have acquired all rights in such a play i shall also try to make akroyd give me a little more than that hell said frank succinctly he poured himself out another glass of port as he spoke and shaking the drop off the lip of the decanter broke his glass and flooded the tablecloth his action was on the border land between purpose and accident and he certainly was not sorry as he looked at the swiftly spreading stain my port my tablecloth he observed and your manners said craddock drily yes i deserved that but i didn't really do it on purpose so as it was an accident i'll say i am sorry no no more thanks but i feel in a better temper you may be pleased to hear there's nothing so soothing as smashing something if one doesn't value it oneself i spent an hour this afternoon at one of the side shows in the exhibition banging wooden balls seven for sixpence at a lot of crockery on a shelf what an ironical affair the world is when i had hardly enough money to get dinner for myself nobody ever asked me to dinner and now that there is no longer any difficulty in paying for my own dinner everybody wants me to dine at his or her chiefly her house people i have never seen who live in squares write to me giving me the choice of a couple of nights they ask other people i have never seen to meet me they roar with laughter whatever i say or if it obviously isn't funny they look pensive and say 'how true' what a great ass it is ah make the most of that said craddock a dozen people talking about you will do more for you than a dozen newspapers shouting about you probably but i rather like the newspaper shouting it's so damned funny to think of a lot of grinning compositors ruining their eyesight to set up columns about me i read your article in the 'whitehall' by the way you didn't spare the adjectives did you they send interviewers to me too with cameras and flash lights who fill my room with stinking smoke and ask me to tell them about my early days hot stuff some of it they are nuts on the story of my father throwing the knife at me did you tell them that asked craddock feeling rather bruised certainly why should i not he came to see me this morning himself rather tipsy and i told him to go away and come back when he was sober and i would give him half a crown to get drunk on again there's a commandment isn't there about honouring your father i should like to see a fellow trying to honour mine it's out of my power frank lit a cigar and leaned forward with his elbows on the table success hasn't made me a snivelling sentimentalist he observed now that i'm on the road to make money or i shall be when i've got out of your hands i don't instantly think the world is a garden full of ripe apricots and angels it's a hard cruel world same as it always was and the strong tread on the weak and the clever suck the foolish as a spider pulls off the leg of a fly and sucks it i've often watched that i've been foolish too at least i've been hungry and in consequence you are sucking me but why should i go slobbering over and blessing my father who made life hell to me or why should i say it's a kind nice world just because i myself am not cold or hungry any longer and i'm not a bit sorry for the cold and hungry any more than i was sorry for myself when i was among them i hated being cold and hungry it is true but nobody cared and i learned to expect that nobody should care unless he could get something out of me as you have done all your fine rich people were there while i was starving and nobody asked me to dinner or treated me to dozens of wooden balls at the exhibition now i've shown that i can amuse them for an hour or two after dinner they think i'm no end of a fine fellow but i've not changed i always believed in myself even when i was hungriest and not being hungry doesn't make me believe in anything else no no more wine thanks i'm not going to take after my father by the way i met a dear little female methuselah last night name of lady crowborough who told me she knew you i congratulated her of course did you did you mention your connection with me asked craddock with some little anxiety not wholly concealed you wouldn't have liked that would you but you can make your mind easy i didn't and i don't suppose i shall i wouldn't vex you for the world that is not so good a reason as i should expect from you no try this one then you made a fool of me you see you outwitted me i don't want people to know that for my sake far more than yours the role of the brilliant successful dramatist is more to my mind than the role of your dupe these are offensive expressions said craddock certainly but why should you care no doubt other people have used them before to you by the way again there was another fellow there last night who knew you under lady crowborough's slightly moulting wing lathom that was his name i congratulated him also there was something rather taking about him a weird sort of guilelessness and gratitude he's coming to the play with me sometime next week and now if you want to hear the first act of the 'lane without a turning' we had better begin i'm going to mrs fortescue's party later on who is mrs fortescue the prettiest bore in london which is saying a good deal both as regards looks and as regards ennui but she is so convinced she is only twenty eight she is worth your study as showing the lengths to which credulity can go by all means let me hear your first act armstrong got up i want you to tell me when you have heard it he said and when i have told you how the second and third acts will go whether you exercise your option or not you are going to egypt in a few days you tell me and i don't want this hung up till you get back i have no doubt i shall be able to tell you said craddock in spite of this assurance craddock found himself an hour afterwards in a state of bewildered indecision the finished first act together with a very full scenario of the other two gave him as he was well aware sufficient data for his conclusions but he was strangely embarrassed at the recital of the brilliant and farcical medley which as the author had said turned the original play upside down parodied it and winged it with iridescent absurdity he knew well the unaccountableness of the public well too he knew the value of a reputation such as easter eggs had brought its author and it seemed to him a frantic imperilment of that reputation to flaunt this rainbowed farce in the face of the public armstrong had acquired the name of an observant and kindly humorist here he laughed at not with the gentle lives of ungifted people again in the original play he involved his puppets in a net of inextricable tragedy here as by a conjuring trick he let them escape with shouts of ridicule at the suppose destiny that had entangled them the play might easily be a failure the more stupendous because of the stupendous success of easter eggs on the other hand there was the chance the bare chance that its inimitable and mocking wit might be caught by the rather stolid ass but he had to decide he knew quite well that he had sufficient data for his decision and he did not in the least desire merely to annoy armstrong by a plea for further opportunity of consideration but he most sincerely wished that the play had never been written and that wish gave him an idea that for the moment seemed brilliant he was harvesting money in sheaves he could well afford it i will exercise my option he said at length and then i will destroy the play for your convenience my dear fellow you needn't even put on paper the last two acts you can take your cheque away with you to night frank armstrong considered this munificent proposal for a moment in silence looking very ugly you didn't purchase the right to destroy my work he said i purchased the right to possess it for a minute more armstrong frowned and glowered then suddenly his face cleared and he gave an astonishing shout of laughter all right he said draw the cheque and here are my manuscript and notes which you are going to destroy to morrow i shall begin a new play exactly like it how's that gosh what an ass i am i ought to have got your cheque first and cashed it before i told you but you gave yourself away so terribly by telling me you would purchase and destroy it that i was off my guard but now once again the sense of imperfect mastery struck craddock there was this difference about it now that it forced itself rather as being a sense of mastery on the other side he was thrown back on the original debate in his mind doubt of success prevailed i take no option he said curtly frank got up thank god he said good night craddock sat quiescent for a few minutes after armstrong had left him feeling rather battered and bruised and yet conscious of having passed a stimulating evening and he did not wonder that that section of london who spend most of their time and money in procuring tonic entertainments that shall keep their pulses racing should pursue this flaring young man with eager hospitalities he was liable it is true to behave like a young bull calf he might and often did lower his head and fixing a steady and vicious eye on you charge you with the most masculine vigour but it was quite impossible to be dull when he was there there was a strength a driving force about him that raised the level of vitality at social gatherings and though it was a little disconcerting to have him suddenly attack you he might equally well attack somebody else which was excessively amusing moreover many women found a personal attack exciting and inspiriting to be tossed and tumbled conversationally did not do one any harm and so virile and brutal an onslaught as his had something really fascinating about it to be sure he had no manners but yet he had not bad manners he would not plan an impertinence he only ran at a red rag of which apparently the world held many for him if he was bored it is true that he yawned but he didn't yawn in order to impress upon you your boring qualities he only expressed naturally and unaffectedly his own lack of interest in what you were saying to be sure also he was ugly and clumsy but when there were so many pretty little men about who talked in the softest of voices and manicured their nails a great rough young male like this who said he hated dancing and asked leave to smoke his pipe instead of a cigarette brought a sense of reality into the room with him he was not rough and uncouth on purpose merely that big clever brain of his was too busy to bother about the frills and finishings of life scandal and tittle tattle had no interest for him but when he told you about his own early years or even when with inimitable mimicry he showed you how craddock felt for a whisker and looked at his plump little hands he was immensely entertaining very likely he would soon become tiresome and familiar but it would be time to drop him then craddock was not in the least surprised at this lionizing of young armstrong not only had he written the play which was undeniably the bull's eye of the year which in itself was sufficient but unlike most writers and artists the strength of whose personality is absorbed into their achievements he had this dominating personal force craddock knew well the mercantile value of the social excitement over the author of easter eggs as he had said to armstrong a dozen people talking was worth the shouting of two dozen journals and while it lasted there was no question that stalls and dress circles would overflow for his plays apparently too they had the no less valuable attraction for pit and gallery there was a sincerity about his work that appealed to those who were not warmed by the mere crackle of epigrams and neat conversation but while he welcomed armstrong's appearance as a lion as a remunerative asset at the box office he was not so sure that he entirely approved of a possible intimacy between his new artist and his new playwright he could not have definitely accounted for his distaste but it was there and though he was in the rapids that preceded his departure for egypt he found time next morning to go round to charles' studio ostensibly to see the finished portrait of his mother but with a mind alert to sound a warning note as to undesirable companionship charles the joyful as craddock had christened him received his visitor with arms open but with palette and brush and mahl stick the confidence which he had so easily won from the boy at that first meeting by their weir burned with a more serene brightness than ever and his gratitude towards his patron was renewed morning by morning when he came into the comfortable well appointed studio which had been given him oh i say mr craddock he exclaimed but it is jolly of you to come round to see me do say that you'll stop for lunch it will be quite beastly by the way but i promised to cook lunch for lady crowborough who is coming but there are things in tins to eke out with indeed this was a very different sort of protege from him who had spilt the port last night so much easier to deal with so much more conscious of benefits gratitude and affection were so infinitely more becoming than the envious mistrust that frank habitually exhibited and how handsome the boy was with his fresh colour his kindled eyes and unconscious grace of pose as he stood there palette on thumb how fit to draw after him like a magnet the glances of some tall english girl and at the thought and at the remembrance of the injury he had done charles craddock felt his dislike of him stir and hiss once more i can't do that my dear charles he said as i have only a quarter of an hour to spare besides i am far too prudent to think of incurring lady crowborough's enmity by spoiling her tete a tete with you but on this grey morning i felt it would do me good to see your serene joyfulness and also the presentment of your joyfulness' mother which you tell me is finished charles looked deprecating i'm rather frightened he said you see i've changed it a lot since you saw it i took out the whole of the head and painted it quite fresh and quite differently craddock frowned it was as if armstrong had interpolated an act in easter eggs without permission my dear fellow i don't think you had any business to do that without consulting me he said i had said i would buy the picture you knew too that i immensely admired it as it was where is it let me see it charles seemed to resent this somewhat hectoring and school master like tone below the serene joyfulness there was something rather more firm and masculine than craddock had expected oh i can't concede to you the right to tell me how i shall paint he said just after you saw the picture the other day i suddenly saw i could do better than that i must do my best and as a matter of fact i don't think you will mind when you see it here it is anyhow he wheeled the picture which was on an easel face to the wall into position and stood rather stiff and high headed i shall be sorry if you don't like it he said but i can't help it somehow it struck craddock that charles had grown tremendously in self reliance and manliness since he had first seen that shy incredulous boy at the weir he was disposed to take credit to himself for this these weeks of happy expansion of freedom from the dragging sense of dependence had made a man of him and then still blameful he looked at the picture long he looked at it and silently and quickly in his mind the conviction grew that he must climb quite completely down from his hectoring attitude but after all it was not so difficult there were compensations for the lower he had to go the higher the picture soared soared like some sunlit ship in air you were perfectly right he said at length it was the rashest presumption in me to suppose that i knew better than you that will make you famous i was an utter fool my dear charles to have imagined that you could have spoiled it oh that's all right said charles tall amid his certainties again craddock looked long at it is it finished now he asked humbly i think so it seems to be what i see and a picture is finished when that's the case i daresay i shall see more sometime then i shall do another craddock felt no call on his superlatives i must say i shall be seriously anxious if i thought you were going to scrape it out again he said though this time i shouldn't dream of interfering now what other work have you got on hand i am off to egypt in two days and i should like to know i leave you busy did mrs fortescue come to your studio i recommended her to i know it was awfully good of you and i am going to paint her you told me to charge two hundred guineas which seemed a tremendous lot not in the least you won't remain at that figure long charles made a face of comic distaste i i don't quite know how to paint her he said i can't make her as young as it is clear she thinks herself and i can't make her such a bore as i think her how could your portrait show you think her a bore asked craddock how it shall not is my difficulty i must try not to get a weary brush then lady crowborough says she will sit to me when she comes back in the spring i shall love doing that by the way charles hesitated a moment you've been so extraordinarily kind to me he said that perhaps you don't mind my consulting you she told me to propose myself to go down and see my copy of the reynolds picture when it was framed and in its place and for the last month i've been ready to do so any day but mr wroughton wrote me rather a queer letter he suggested that i should go down after they left for egypt it read to me rather as if he didn't want to see me and i was so friendly with them all what can have happened craddock assumed his most reassuring manner happened he said what on earth could have happened you know our respected host down at the mill house i assure you when i was there three weeks ago for one night he could think about nothing but his underclothing for egypt and the price of pith helmets he had already i believe begun to pack his steamer trunks and his medicine chests do not give it another thought charles gave a sigh of relief i'm so glad you think that is the reason he said all the same i should have liked to go down and say goodbye to to them to her don't you mean said craddock charles flushed and laughed well yes to her he said why not why not indeed every sensible young man likes to say some goodbye to a charming girl if he can do no more than that my dear fellow if only i was your age i should take a leaping heart to egypt and now that we've pricked that little troublesome bubble tell me a little more about yourself and your life i meant to have seen much more of you this last week or two but i have been distractedly busy and have seen no one but people on business apart from your work have you been going about much hardly at all i don't know so many people you see i dined with lady crowborough though a couple of nights ago and she took me to a big party oh and i met there such a strange queer fellow name of armstrong who said he knew you he wrote easter eggs such a ripping play have you seen it he is going to take me to it next week craddock puffed the smoked out end of his cigarette from its amber tube into the grate yes i know him he said i should not have thought there was much in common between you i'm not sure i should like to find out and heavens how i should like to paint his portrait where's the charcoal charles seized a stick and spread a loose sheet of paper on the table eye like that he said with the eyebrow like a pent house over it face did you ever see such a jaw square like that and hungry that's the sort of face it pays to paint there's something to catch hold of and his ears are pointed like a satyr's i think i must ask him to sit to me i'll give him the portrait if he will craddock took up this six line sketch yes very like indeed he said and a terrible face and now i must go but i wonder if you will resent a word of advice try said charles encouragingly well i will now my dear charles you are a young man just beginning your career and it is immensely important you should get among the right people the latin quarter in paris is one thing bohemianism in london is quite another for the next forty years your work will be to paint these charming mothers and daughters of england they have got to come and sit to you in your studio they won't if they find that it savours of the bohemian you can't be too careful as to your friends for the strongest and most self sufficient people take their colour from their friends they can't help it he laid his plump white hand which he had been observing on charles' shoulder you must pardon me he said but i have got to the time of life when an unmarried man wishes he had a son growing up but i have none i have to expend my unfruitful potentiality of parentage elsewhere if you were my son i should choose your friends for you so carefully there was something pathetic and unexpected about this which could not but touch charles but somehow he felt as if he ought to have been more touched a propos of armstrong he suggested a propos of intimacy with mr armstrong in general said craddock feeling somehow that he had missed fire and that it was as well to get behind a hedge again charles nodded then suddenly he felt his own lack of responsiveness he felt also though without touch of priggishness that here was a man who had been wonderfully good to him and who felt the burden of the years that were not lightened by the tie of fatherhood with youth it struck him suddenly vaguely but convincingly you have been as kind as a father to me he said quickly i hope i don't pay you with a son's proverbial ingratitude you have been like a father to me i i've often wanted to tell you that he looked up a moment at craddock and then seized with a fit of misgiving at his blurted outspokenness shied away from the subject like some young colt but i should like to paint armstrong's portrait he said i promise you that you would not think i had wasted my time craddock appeared to accept this sudden switching off of sentiment i will leave you free from any option of mine regarding it he said to have it on the wall opposite me would certainly cause me indigestion if it was as like as your charcoal sketch the truth is he has not behaved very nicely to me i tried to befriend him as i have tried to befriend you but with less success in amicable relationship it is a mere nothing but i felt i might do worse than give you a word of warning it is of course for your private ear alone goodbye my dear charles i shall let you know when i get back from the land of bondage and accept my long experience to make your mind easy over the matter of going down to see your admirable copy of that reynolds picture i should not for instance confide in lady crowborough god bless you craddock took the unusual step of walking back to berkeley square after he had left charles and as he pursued his portly way up the brompton road he thought rather intently over what he had said and again as on the evening when he had let drop a few lying words to philip wroughton he felt he had not spoken amiss he could not possibly prevent an acquaintance between his two proteges nor could he certainly prevent it ripening into an intimacy but he felt he had spoken well when he hinted that armstrong had not behaved very nicely to him as a rule he did not much believe in the stability of such an emotion as gratitude but he believed very strongly in the child like simplicity of charles in this his conclusions were firmly founded for in the course of his life he had never come across as a matter of fact so guileless and unsuspicious a nature he almost regretted the necessity of deceiving him for the feat was so inconspicuous a one charles was a child a child with a divine gift of which he himself was in the position to take secure advantage after all nurses and kind mothers habitually deceived children they told them that if they squinted and the wind changed their squint would be permanent they told them that many poor beggars would be glad of the food they rejected in order to induce them to swallow it and thus incidentally to extinguish altogether the outside chance of a poor beggar getting it they told them that god would be angry with them if they disobeyed orders and got their feet wet charles was just a child though certainly he had grown a good deal lately but his soul was a child's it was not until he had walked as far as hyde park corner that he knew he was waging a war instead of merely conducting a child's education he was at war he with his obese person and half century of years with the generation that had sprung up after him and was now realising the zenith of its youthful vigour already it trod on his heels already he seemed to hear in his ears its intolerant laughter at his portly progress and his first acute attack of middle age stabbed him like the lumbago from which he occasionally suffered it seemed to him a devilish complaint not to be acquiesced in but to be ostentatiously disregarded and denied even since last june when he had first felt the charm and the need of girlhood he had suspected this foe and the fact that charles admitted the attraction which was his magnet also stiffened his resistance he hated the young generation chiefly because his own youth had been a bloodless affair but he did not feel himself old except when he met the guileless eyes of charles or the vindictive glance of young armstrong both of these in their widely different fashions illumined the truth and thus for them these young and vigorous males he cherished an enmity that rivalled armstrong's but he was not shelved and done with yet as far as the attainment of love went he entered the lists against charles as far as hard business capacity went he was willing to meet armstrong but he had suffered an initial defeat on either hand on the one side armstrong had taken this remodelled play into his own control on the other this was more subtle charles had been able to paint that rough sketch of joyce among the forget me nots yet he had weapons against these attacks he could and would write feebly appreciative notices of the play more damning than any slash of onslaught he could and would go southwards with joyce and her approving father the day after to morrow and then with a spasm of satisfaction he thought of lady crowborough with one if not both feet in the grave she was kissing her hands as vigorously and contentedly as ever her conviction of perennial youth overrode the disabilities of years age was a mere question of conviction he had only to convince himself even at this moment she who had attained middle age before he was born was lunching with a boy whose father he himself might be and tasting all the delights of flirtation and unspeakable decoctions over a gas stove the new flirt he could hear her say it with unctuous serenity and the new flirt was that child charles he who was so much younger than anyone craddock had ever known of course lady crowborough was a freak but if a woman did not feel old at ninety according to her own account what excuse was there for a man feeling middle aged at fifty or a little less he determined to have no lunch whatever but have a turkish bath and a swim at the bath club instead just as craddock might have made a certain sinister suggestion to philip wroughton about charles had he known that after she left them she read and re read two common place little letters and regarded something that had once been a straw hat so to day he might not have foregone lunch and sat in the agreeable tropics underneath the bath club as a matter of fact these processes made him so hungry that he indulged in a sandwich or two afterwards in the heroic hue and cry after his vanished youth if he had been aware of charles' immediate occupation after he had left him there was another canvas a big one leaning with averted face in the corner of his studio it represented a girl kneeling among forget me nots at the edge of a stream behind was a spouting weir he had half a dozen sketches of the weir to help him some very carefully finished which he had made in preparation for that picture of the bathing boy and he had so many sketches more vivid than these more brilliantly lit by the steadfast lamp within his brain to help him but he had felt he could not show this to craddock he did not know if he could ever show it to anybody it was his own or hers if ever she cared for it or for him but it was not craddock's eagerly now he pulled it into the light it mattered not what he worked on in this picture so long as he worked at it the figure that knelt there dressed in stained blue had suffused the whole so that the grey camp sheltering below the weir the loosestrife and meadow sweet the rope of hurrying water woven by the force of the stream were all part of her unsuspicious and trustful by nature relying on craddock's experience and knowledge of the world on his brief assurance that there was nothing below the curt note which had given charles leave to see his reynolds' copy after the family had gone he wiped off his mind almost without an effort the vague doubts that had for the last week or two tarnished and dimmed it craddock who had been so uniformly kind to him who had almost lapsed into parental sentiment to day had not thought his doubts worth a moment's debate besides what could have occurred to change the friendliness of the family into this cold acidity what also could be more reasonable than the explanation which craddock threw off over his shoulder so to speak of philip's amazing solicitude for the complete provision of his own comfort blue blue what a world of blues sky dress eyes forget me nots reflection of sky reflection of dress and eyes that looked straight into his these reflections came not into his picture he caught and kept these craddock's prophecy the wish perhaps being father to it that the two young men whom he had benefited would not find much in common seemed at their first meeting to be likely of fulfilment they met at the theatre and charles' enthusiastic appreciation of the piece at the second time of witnessing it seemed to rouse armstrong's contempt i wish you had told me you had seen it before he said as they lounged and smoked between the acts and we could have gone to something else but there's nothing else i should have liked so much said charles eagerly i think that scene between violet and the curate is simply priceless do tell me about it did you know people like that frank beckoned to the man in the box office just show me the returns for this week he said then he answered charles yes i used to think they were like that he said i expect they were far harder and meaner and fouler really people can't be as gutless as i've made them all out to be oh but they're not gutless do you think they are kind and jolly and slightly ridiculous isn't that it like most people in fact but you've seen the funny side of them the man from the box office had returned and handed armstrong a strip of paper fuller than ever mr armstrong you see he said with a sort of proprietorship like the head waiter at a restaurant when guests find a dish to their taste and advance bookings go well on to the other side of christmas unaccountably the dish was not to armstrong's taste blasted fools people are he remarked and nodded curtly to the man i'm one of them you know said charles yes i forgot that but don't you ever despise your pictures anyhow distrust them just because they are popular charles laughed i haven't yet been in the position to find out what effect popularity would have on my own estimate he said oh but wait a minute i went to a gallery the other day where there was a picture of mine and there happened to be some people round it so i went among them and listened to what they said they were rather complimentary and and i think i liked them for it anyhow it didn't affect my own estimate frank armstrong glared at the well dressed well fed loungers in the entrance somehow i think fellows like these must be all wrong in their taste he said then would you like unpopularity would you be better pleased if the theatre was empty and there was no advance booking frank armstrong grinned no i should curse like mad he said it happened to me once and i had no use for it then his surliness broke down i don't mind telling you he said the fact is that i sold my play inside out from iceland to peru and madagascar and i don't get a penny more or less whether it runs to doomsday or only new year's day i feel all these people are defrauding me oh what a pity said charles i am sorry but they'll come flocking to your next play the thought that there were three more plays of his to be pouched by craddock sealed armstrong's good humour up again it had put in a very inconspicuous appearance and now popped back like a lizard into its hole he shrugged his shoulders there's the bell he said if you want to hear the third act don't want to miss a word said charles cordially through the first half of the act armstrong so yawned and fidgetted in the stall next him that about the middle of it charles felt that good manners prompted him to suggest that they should not remain till the end yet another way round good manners were horrified at such a course it would appear that the play bored him but he decided to risk it armstrong was so obviously tired of it all shall we go he suggested armstrong slid from his seat into the gangway i thought the third act would be too much for you he observed they went quickly and quietly up through the swing doors and charles rather troubled laid a hand on the other's arm it wasn't that a bit indeed it wasn't he said but you were yawning and grunting you know i thought you wanted to get out i i was enjoying it armstrong knew he was behaving rudely to his guest but to night the thronged theatre also in part the buoyancy of the serene joyfulness had got on his nerves then go back and enjoy the rest of it he said charles' good humour was quite unimpaired it was as fresh as paint i think i will he said thanks awfully for bringing me i'm enjoying myself tremendously good night somehow for the moment that annoyed armstrong even more and there is no doubt that he would have found a pungently flavoured reply but there was no reply possible on the word charles had turned and gone back through the swing doors once more then it dawned on armstrong that his annoyance with charles was really annoyance with himself at his own ill mannered behaviour for half a minute he hesitated more than half disposed to follow him to say a whispered word of regret if necessary then again the balance wavered and he went out into the street people with such infernally good tempers as his new acquaintance he thought should not be allowed at large they did not fit in with his own ideas of the world where everyone sought and grasped and snarled unless he had some specific reason for making himself pleasant he looked aimlessly up and down shaftesbury avenue as he stood on the steps of the theatre uncertain what to do with himself there was a party he was bidden to but he felt no inclination to stand and fire off the cheap neat gibes that he knew were considered his contribution to such gatherings his payment for a supper and a cigarette nor as on some nights did the illuminated street with the flaring sky signs up above and the flaring gaiety of the pavements below allure him in the least sometimes he wandered up and down piccadilly for an hour at a time in absorbed yet incurious observation of it all it all bore out his theory of life the spoiler and the spoiled the barterer and bartered everybody wanted something everybody had to pay for it but to night the street seemed a mere galaxy of coloured shifting glass should he then go home and work for an hour on his remodelled lane without a turning he thought with a little spasm of inward amusement at the title that had occurred to him to day namely it's a long lane that has five turnings they were all there in the play five distinct turnings parodies of passion five separate times would the stalls make a fixed face so as not to show they were shocked five separate times would they be utterly fooled and have fixed their faces for nothing those who happened to remember the original play there would not be many of them would laugh a little first because they would guess what was not going to happen those who had never seen that sombre and serious work would merely find here the most entrancingly unexpected farcical situations developing on legitimate lines out of tragical data strolling he found himself underneath the brilliantly lit doors of mr akroyd's theatre where within at this hour as armstrong well knew mr fred akroyd was being nobler than anybody who had ever yet worn a frock coat and patent leather shoes with a pith helmet to indicate india the third act would only just have begun akroyd was even now probably beginning to dawn like a harvest moon on the blackness of night and the plentiful crop the moon would reach the zenith in about twenty minutes then it died in the garden of the viceroy at simla blue incredible himalayas behind and if he sent his card in he felt sure that mr akroyd after death in the garden would be charmed to talk to him for ten minutes it would be well to make some sort of contract without delay in case craddock changed his mind about an option on this bewildering topsy turvy of a lane for the moment he even felt grateful to craddock for the hint he had given him as to the possibility of getting a larger advance on royalties out of akroyd than the thousand pounds which that eminent actor manager had offered he would certainly act on the suggestion akroyd was just expiring when he arrived and after waiting five minutes he was shown into his dressing room the actor was still a little prostrate and perspiring profusely with his efforts and extended a languid hand people sometimes said that if he acted on the stage as well as he acted off delighted to see you my dear fellow he said sit down while i rest for a minute it takes too much out of me this last act cruel work i feel the whole pulse of the theatre beating in my own veins arteries strong pulse for a dying man observed armstrong yes very good you don't know you authors how we slave for you well well as long as you give us good strong parts we have no quarrel with you how's 'easter eggs' by the way oh booked full over christmas said armstrong negligently such rot as it is too i don't wonder you refused to look at it no strong part in it but i've got something fully in my head and partly on paper which might suit you better i hear that this this present strain on you isn't likely to continue after the middle of december so if you feel inclined you might come round to my rooms and you can have some supper there while i read you what i've done and tell you about the rest a reassuring alacrity possessed akroyd at this and he made a good and steady convalescence from his prostration he always made a point of walking home after the theatre for the sake of his health he said he did not walk very fast and often he took off his hat and held it in his hand so as to get the refreshing breezes of the night on his brow which much thought expands his tall massive form and fine tragic face often attracted a good deal of attention and people would whisper his name as he went by but he put up with these small penalties of publicity it was very good for the hair to let the wind play upon it akroyd some ten years ago had sprung to the front of his profession by his masterly acting of a comedy part which verged on farce since then he had drifted into noble middle aged parts such as bachelor marquises who made marriage possible between fine young fellows and girls whom the marquis was secretly in love with husbands of fifty with wives of twenty five all those parts in fact in which tact nobility breadth of view and unselfish wisdom untie knots for everybody else and give everybody else a splendid time but his drifting though in part dictated by his conviction that he handled these virtues as if born to the job was due also to the fact that during these years he had really not been given a comedy that seemed to him worth risking he knew he could always make a success as a prime minister or a marquis without any risk at all and his luck as less fortunate managers called it was proverbial for he never had a failure but it was not luck at all that was responsible for these successes it was fine business capacity and a knowledge of what his following among play goers expected of him he always gave the public what they expected and then never disappointed them but in his secret heart he had a longing provided the risk was not too great to play a rousing comic part again to set his stalls laughing instead of leaving them dim eyed he was aware that he must do it soon if he was going to do it at all there is an age when even the most self reliant do not feel equal to the strain of being funny it's rather out of your line said armstrong abruptly as he sat akroyd down to his oysters but you once did a part of the same kind it was the first play i ever saw you were marvellously good in it ah 'the brittlegings' said akroyd considerably stimulated old history i'm afraid time of the georges well it's the time of the georges again remarked armstrong the play is called 'it's a long lane that has five turnings' akroyd when discussing theatrical matters always criticised freely an author once had suggested forty two as a suitable age for the part that he was to play he had considered this and replied forty three i think forty three that's a very long title he said it was a long lane said armstrong anyhow it is the title dramatis personae tell me what you have designed to be my part said akroyd i think i shall leave you to guess there are many points by the way that want discussion and i should like your advice but i think i will read straight through the first act without interruption akroyd as has been stated was a very shrewd business man but his keen appreciation of the wit and effectiveness of this act made it difficult for him to bring his business capacity into full working order many times throughout it had he checked his laughter throughout it too had he seen himself in the glorious tragico farcical situations provided for him he had no difficulty in guessing his part in a sort of parody of his own manner it was a brilliant piece of work he saw himself brilliantly interpreting it but at the end he with an effort put the cork into his admiration yes yes very clever very sparkling he said but hardly in my line do you think hardly in yours perhaps either it would be taking a great risk i should not expect there to be much money in it appreciative stalls perhaps it is hard to say however read the scenario of the rest frank armstrong felt he knew quite well what this meant it was the usual decrying of work by the intending purchaser in order to get it cheaper and it roused in him all the resentment that as producer he had so often felt for craddock as capitalist he threw the manuscript onto the table resolved to play the same game hardly worth while he said obviously the play doesn't appeal to you though i think it might have ten years ago before you took to the heavy work business i was thinking of you as i saw you first jove it's thirsty work reading and now i shall have to read it all over again to somebody else to morrow ah you rush at conclusions altogether too much said akroyd slightly alarmed much necessarily depends on the working out of the play it is admirably laid down the scenes are full of wit and interest i i insist on hearing the rest shan't bother you said armstrong taking whisky and soda and enjoying himself keenly then let me take it away and read it said akroyd really my dear fellow it is hardly fair to ask me here to listen to an act and the scenario of the rest and then refuse but i feel now i read it how much more suitable it would be for tranby said armstrong i will telephone to him and read it to him to morrow he has been asking me if i hadn't got anything for him i hope the oysters are good let me read it myself then now said akroyd holding out a hand that almost trembled with anxiety frank gave up his obstinacy with an indifferent yawn o well i'll tell you the rest of it he said but having begun his indifference vanished while akroyd's anxiety increased to think of tranby his esteemed and gifted colleague having this marvel of dexterous fooling submitted to him to morrow was to picture himself on the edge of a precipice he felt giddy his head swam at the propinquity of that catastrophic gulf fortunately he could crawl away now for armstrong was continuing intentionally he did the utmost he could for the reading giving drama and significance to the bare sketch here and there he had written upwards of a page of dialogue in his wonderful neat hand and once when he found a dozen lines of a speech by akroyd he passed them over to him asking him to read them aloud which he did moving about the room with excellent gesticulations then as one of the ludicrous turnings approached armstrong would drop his voice speak slowly and huskily surely he can't be fooling us this time thought akroyd as the tragic moment approached then came another ludicrous legitimate situation of the impasse another thwarting of ridiculous destiny life became a series of brilliant conjuring tricks all carefully explained and the gorgeous conjuror was akroyd he felt there must be no further mention of tranby for his nerves could not stand it at the end he got up and shook hands with armstrong i am much obliged to you for offering me the most brilliant piece of work i have seen for years he said i will certainly accept it and put it on when we open after christmas i will send you a contract to sign to morrow frank armstrong lit a cigarette we might talk over the lines of it to night he said else perhaps i might not sign it akroyd as was his custom became so great an artist and so magnificent a gentleman when any question of money was brought forward that it was almost impossible to proceed i am sure you will find my proposals framed on the most generous lines he said armstrong allowed the faintest shadow of a grin to hover about his mouth no doubt he said but there is no reason that you should not tell me what they are advance for instance on account of royalties what do you propose akroyd put a hand to his fine brow frowning a little i think i suggested some sum to you he said eight hundred pounds advance was it something like that again armstrong boiled within himself yet after all this was business akroyd wanted to pay as little as he could he himself wanted to obtain the most possible but it was mean when he knew quite well that he had himself proposed a thousand pounds it was great fun too the thought of craddock now on the bosom of the treacherous mediterranean perhaps being sea sick oh no he said quite good naturedly a thousand was the sum you proposed but i don't accept it the interview did not last long after this a mere mention of tranby's name was enough and a quarter of an hour afterwards akroyd went home in a taxi as the streets were now empty having yielded on every point but well pleased with his acquisition fifteen hundred pounds down and royalties on a high scale was a good deal to give but it seemed to him that there was a good deal to be got frank sat up for another half hour alone in a big arm chair hugging his knees and occasionally bursting out into loud unaccountable laughter what an excellent ten minutes scene the last half hour would make in a play called say the actor manager or the middleman how mean people were and how delightful fifteen hundred pounds was but what work what work to bring his play up to the level of the first act but he would do it he was not going to be content with anything but his best then he laughed again 'the middleman the sweater thwarted' good play for tranby he put down his expired pipe and rose to open the window the room was full of tobacco smoke the table hideous with remains of supper it was all rather stale and sordid stale and sordid too now it was over was his encounter with akroyd and his complete victory he had scored oh yes he had scored he leaned out for a moment into the cool freshness of the night air that smelt of frost finding with distaste that his coat sleeve on which he leaned his face reeked of tobacco it reeked of akroyd too somehow of meanness and cunning and his own superior cunning it was much healthier out of the window gosh i wish i hadn't been such a pig to that jolly fellow at the play he said to himself chapter vii philip wroughton was sitting not on the steps for that would have been risky but on a cushion on the steps of the mena hotel occasionally looking at his paper occasionally looking at the pyramids in a state of high content to relieve the reader's mind at once it may be stated that egypt thoroughly suited him he had not sneezed nor ached nor mourned since he got here nearly a month ago the voyage from marseilles it is true had been detestably rough but he blamed nobody for that since he had come under the benediction of the egyptian sun not the captain nor messrs thomas cook sons nor joyce nobody this was the sun's doing there never was such a sun it seemed regulated for him as a man can order the regulation of the temperature of his bath water it was always warm enough it was never too hot if you had your white umbrella you put it up if you had forgotten it it didn't matter several times he had assured joyce that it didn't matter in every way he felt stronger and better than he had done for years and to day greatly daring he was going to mount himself with assistance on an egyptian ass and ride to see the sphinx and make the tour of the great pyramid in company with craddock it may be added that his reason for sitting on the hotel steps was largely in order to make a minute survey of the donkeys on hire just beyond he wanted one that was not too spirited or looked as if it wanted to canter there was a pinkish one there that might do but it flapped its ears in rather an ominous manner perhaps craddock would choose one for him and glancing again at his paper he observed with singular glee that there were floods in the thames valley lady crowborough and joyce had gone into cairo that morning to do some shopping and lunch with friends this happened with considerable frequency not infrequently also they went to a dinner or a dance in that gay city and stopped the night there these dinners and dances had at first been supposed to be for joyce's sake they were actually and now avowedly for lady crowborough's sake though joyce for more reasons than one was delighted to accompany her on such days as the two did not go into town it was pretty certain that small relays of british officers and others would ride out to have lunch or tea with them at ulena and lady crowborough had several new flirts altogether she was amazing prodigious she rode her donkey every morning as beveiled as the temple in a blue cotton habit and with a fly whisk accompanied by a handsome young donkey boy with milk white teeth and an engaging smile he called her princess being a shrewd young man and it is to be feared that he was to be numbered also among the new flirts also as he ran behind her donkey he used to call out in arabic make way for the bride o ah which used to evoke shouts of laughter from his fellows then lady crowborough would ask what he was saying that made them all laugh and with an ingenuous smile he explained that he told the dogs to get out of the way of the princess and they laugh he added 'cause they very glad to see you this was perfectly satisfactory and she said none of your nonsense joyce beyond any doubt whatever was enjoying it all very much the sun the colour the glories of the antique civilization the kaleidoscopic novelties of the oriental world the gaiety and hospitality so lavishly welcoming her grandmother and herself all these made to a girl accustomed to the restrictions and bondage of her dutiful filialness to a thoroughly selfish father a perpetual festa and spectacle but though she was in no way beginning to weary of it or even get accustomed to it she found as the full days went by that two questions one retrospective the other anticipatory were beginning to occupy and trouble her with regard to the future she was aware that craddock was exercising his utmost power to please her and gratify her and felt no doubt whatever as to what this accumulation of little benefits was leading up to before long she knew well he would ask her again to give him the right to think for her always to see after her welfare in things great and small in a hundred ways too she knew that her father wished him all success in his desire often he made dreadfully disconcerting remarks that were designed to be understood in the way joyce understood them ah joyce he would say mr craddock as usual has seen to that for you i declare mr craddock guesses your inclination before you know it yourself he has ordered your donkey for half past ten she felt that assuredly mr craddock was going to send his bill in account rendered this time and ask for payment but not possibly not conceivably could she imagine herself paying it the retrospective affair occupied her more secretly but more engrossingly behind all the splendour and gaiety and interest and sunlight there hung a background which concerned her more intimately than any of those things compared with it nothing else had colour or brightness and her father had told her that this background was stained and daubed with dirt with commonness with things not to be associated with never had the subject been ever so remotely alluded to again between them charles' name had not crossed her lips or his she had never asked him who his informant was but she felt that any such question was superfluous she knew her whole heart and mind told her that she knew whether she had ever actually believed the tale she scarcely remembered anyhow she had accepted it as far as action went but now without further evidence on the subject she utterly and passionately disbelieved it by communing with herself she had arrived at the unshakeable conviction that it not only was not but could not be true through quietly thinking of charles through telling over like rosary beads the hours of their intercourse together she had seen that it was as clear as the simplest logical proposition but she saw also that when craddock repeated the question he had asked her last june he would ask it far more urgently and authentically there had been no fire behind it then now she saw that he was kindled before he used to look at her with unconcealed glances of direct admiration make her great speeches of open compliment comparing her to a greek victory a bacchante now he looked at her more shyly more surreptitiously and he paid her compliments no longer just because they no longer expressed all he had to say about her they had become worn like defaced coins out of currency but this acquired seriousness and sincerity of feeling on his part which before would have earned at any rate her sympathy now in the conviction she held that it was he who had spoken of charles to her father made him the more detestable as a wooer even as in ordinary converse he now excited her disgustful antipathy he was as pleasant as agreeable as clever and adaptable as before but her conjectured knowledge had spread through his whole personality staining and poisoning it he had thought so she now supposed to put a rival out of the field by this treacherous stab in the back to unhorse him and ride over him in that he had bitterly erred and though still thinking he had succeeded deep in her heart was his disgraceful failure blazoned and daily she felt the nightmare of his renewed proposal was coming nearer very possibly she thought he was delaying speech until they should go up the nile and should be leading a more leisurely and she was afraid a more intimate life in the comparative quietude of luxor where they proposed to make a long stay for that reason largely she gladly joined her grandmother in her amazing activities in cairo and gave the kindliest welcome to those pleasant young english soldiers who were so ready to come out to them but most of all joyce loved to wander over the hot yellow sands of the desert or go out alone if possible and sit looking at the pyramids or at the wonderful beast that lay looking earthwards with fathomless eyes of everlasting mystery as if waiting patiently through the unnumbered centuries for the dawning of some ultimate day or else ensconced in some wrinkles of the undulating ground she would watch the hawks circling in the fathomless sky or let her eyes wander over the peacock green of the springing crops to the city sparkling very small and bright on the edge of the nile a long avenue of carob trees giving the value of prussian blue against the turquoise of the sky and the vivid green of the rising maize and corn led in a streak across the plain to it she was not conscious of consecutive or orderly thought in these solitary vigils but she knew that in some way even as her mind and her eye were expanded by those new wonders of old time that waited alert and patient among the desert sands so her soul also was growing in the stillness of its contemplation she made no efforts to pry it open so to speak to unfold its compacted petals for it basked in the sun and psychical air that was appropriate to it expanding daily silent fragrant philip had not to wait long for his escorting craddock he mused gleefully over the news of floods in the thames valley he remembered it was new year's day to morrow he kept his eye on the pinkish donkey and felt confidently daring the pinkish donkey looked very quiet except for the twitching ears he hoped that craddock would approve his choice and not want to mount him on the one that shook itself craddock had proposed this expedition himself and for a minute or two philip wondered whether he wanted to talk about anything special joyce for example but he felt so well that he did not care just now what craddock talked about or what happened to anybody he felt sure too that he would be hungry by lunch time really it was insane to have let that reynolds hang on the wall so many years and rot like blotting paper in the thames valley but then he had no notion that he could get five thousand pounds for it he owed a great deal to craddock who at this moment came out of the hotel large and fat and white reassuring himself as to that point about a whisker suddenly he struck philip as being rather like a music master on holiday at margate who had ordered new smart riding clothes in order to create an impression on the pier but he looked rich as usual he was very very deferential and attentive highly approved philip's penchant for the pinkish donkey and selected for himself a small one that resembled in some essential manner a depressed and disappointed widow his large legs almost touched the ground on either side of it he could almost have progressed in the manner of the ancient velocipede and philip having made it quite clear that if his donkey attempted to exceed a foot's pace he should go straight home and give no backshish at all they made a start as smooth and imperceptible as the launching of a ship craddock had interesting communications to make regarding the monarchs of the fourth dynasty but his information was neither given nor taken as if it was of absorbing importance philip indeed was entirely wrapped up in observation of his donkey's movements and the satisfaction he felt in not being in the thames valley indeed so long ago as that he said how it takes one back and even then the nile floods came up here did they ah by the way the thames is in flood probably my lawn is under water i should have been a cripple with rheumatism if i had stopped there don't make those clicking noises mohammed we are going quite fast enough yes and there were three dynasties before that i don't find the movement at all jerky or painful my dear craddock i should not wonder if i rode again fancy my riding i should not have believed it possible as for you you manage like a positive jockey what do i say mohammed if i should want to stop the positive jockey whose positiveness apparently consisted in size and weight decided to slide away from the fourth dynasty to times and persons who more immediately concerned him indeed it is difficult to imagine such things as floods and rain he said when we bask in this amazing illumination i can't express to you my gratitude in allowing me to join your happy harmonious party philip just waved his fly whisk in the direction of the sphinx as if to acknowledge without making too much of its presence dear joyce he said i think it has been and will continue to be a happy time for her it gave me a great deal of satisfaction to be able to bring her out though of course it entailed a certain sacrifice alone i should have been able to compass the journey i think on the interest of what the reynolds picture brought me with her i have had necessarily to part with capital still of what use is money except to secure health and enjoyment for others she is looking wonderfully well craddock who had till now been standing outside his topic took a sudden header into the very depth of it rather adroitly there is no money i would not spend on miss joyce's health and enjoyment he said there is nothing nearer to my heart than that this sounded very pleasing and satisfactory for the more philip saw of craddock the more he liked him as a prospective son in law but everything seemed slightly remote and unimportant to day in comparison with his own sense of comfort and well being my dear friend i renew my assurance of sympathy and good wishes he said ah i was afraid my donkey was going to stumble then but i held it up i held it up craddock's habit of attention to philip found expression before he continued that which he had come out to say anyone can see you are a rider he said rather mechanically of course you must know that my pleasure in being out here with you consisted largely in the furthering of the hope that is nearest my heart but since we have been here i am coming to you for counsel i have seen so little of miss joyce often of course she is engaged and that i quite understand but she has seemed to me rather to avoid me to to shun my presence and hers i may say grows every day more dear and precious to me craddock was really moved beneath his greed for money his unscrupulousness in getting it his absorption in his plundering of and battening on those less experienced than he there was something that was capable of feeling and into that something joyce had certainly made her way the depth of the feeling was not to be gauged by the fact that in its service he would do a dishonourable thing for that it is to to be feared was a feat that presented no overwhelming natural difficulties to him but his love for joyce had grown from liking and admiration into a thing of fire into a pure and luminous element it did not come wholly from outside it was not like some rainbow winged butterfly settling for a moment on carrion it was more like some celestial hued flower growing if you will out of a dung heap it might it is true have been fed and nourished in a soil of corruption and dishonour but by that divine alchemy that love possesses none of this had passed into its colour and its fragrance it was not dimmed or cankered by the nature of the soil from which it grew it was splendid with its own nature and every day even as he had said it became more dear and precious to him i don't know if you have noticed any of this i mean any of her avoidance of me philip was able to console quite truthfully he hadn't noticed anything at all being far too much taken up in himself indeed i have seen nothing of the kind he said and i do not think i am naturally very unobservant besides joyce i think guesses how warmly i should welcome you as a son in law ah i held my donkey up again he would have been down unless i had been on the alert no no my dear craddock you are inventing trouble for yourself lovers habitually do that they fancy their mistress is unkind i recommend you to wait a little be patient until we get out of all this va et vient of cairo it is true joyce is much taken up with my mother and her social excesses i think i am not harsh in calling them excesses at her age in the romance and poetry of of luxor and all that you will find my little joyce a very tender hearted girl very affectionate very grateful for affection not that i admit she has shunned or avoided you not for a moment far from it don't you remember how pleased she was when she knew you were coming with us mohammed stop the donkey i am out of breath craddock reined in also the depressed widow was not very unwilling to stop and he stepped off her and stood by philip this is not too much for you i hope he said not at all not at all i am enjoying my ride and positively i have not had to use my fly whisk at all i was wondering how i should manage it as well as my reins but there are no flies no my dear fellow don't be down hearted joyce likes you very well then i shall tempt my fate without waiting any longer he said if i am fortunate i shall be happiest of men and i may add the cheerfulest of travelling companions if otherwise i think i shall go back to england at once the situation would be intolerable philip was perfectly aghast for a moment he could say nothing whatever but that would be out of the question he said i do not see how we could get on without you who would make our arrangements and settle the hundred little questions that arise when one is travelling i could not do it my health would completely break down perhaps too my mother will stay on in cairo if it suits her fancy i am sure she will and joyce is utterly incapable of arranging for our comfort in the way in which you do i should be left without a companion for as you see joyce has become totally independent of me and your valet who at your direction is so kind as to look after me and pack for me and see to my clothes no doubt you would take him with you it was understood i thought that you would make the entire journey with us you can hardly mean what you have just said it would spoil everything it would break up our party altogether pray assure me that you do not mean what you say the idea agitates me and any agitation as you know is so bad for me besides of course this is the root of the whole matter that is why i state it to you last after those minor considerations your best opportunity your most favourable chance is when we are alone and quiet up the nile we are living in a mere railway station here none of us have a minute to ourselves till he heard this rapid staccato speech craddock felt he had never really known what egotism meant here it was in excelsis almost grand and awe compelling in this gigantic and inspired exhibition of it i am very much agitated said philip haloing and crowning it do not leave my donkey mohammed in spite of the danger of prolonging this agitation craddock was silent for a moment and philip had one more remark to make it would be very selfish he said and very unlike you and i am sure it would not be wise craddock hesitated no longer he had received a certain assurance though he could not estimate its value that his interpretation of joyce's bearing towards him was mistaken he had been recommended a course which seemed sensible to wait for the comparative quiet of luxor where the relations of their party would naturally be more intimate and familiar he had also had ocular evidence that philip was perfectly capable of having a fit if he precipitated matters unsuccessfully and returned home all these considerations pointed one way certainly i will continue your journey with you he said it is delightful to me to find how solidly you have been counting on me and from my point of view my own personal point of view i think you have probably indicated to me the most promising course i exceedingly regret the agitation i have caused you philip mopped his forehead it is nothing he said i will make an effort and become my own master again but i do not think i feel up to continuing our ride let us turn perhaps to morrow i shall feel more robust i should like to rest a little before lunch and take heart of grace my dear man i felt just like you once and how happily it turned out for me this was not true philip had never been in love with anybody joyce's mother however had soon overcome his somewhat feeble resistance to her charms and had led him a fine life for the few years that she was spared to him our party had designed to stay in egypt two months altogether and a month being now spent and lady crowborough being at length a little fatigued by her whirl of gaiety in cairo it was settled that day at lunch that they should proceed southwards up the nile in a few days' time going by steamer all the way in order to save philip's nerves the jar and jolting of the ill laid line lady crowborough's flirts came in flocks to see her off bringing bouquets and confectionery enough to fill both her cabin and joyce's and she made a variety of astounding speeches in a brilliant monologue to them all addressing first one and then another all you young men are trying to spoil me she said and it's lucky i've got my grand daughter with me to play chaperone and see you don't go too far and are these chocolates for me too joyce my dear put them in my cabin and lock them up i shall have a good blow out of them as soon as we start as for you mr wortledge i daren't stop in cairo a day longer because of you you'd be coming round for me in a cab and driving me off to a mosque or a synagogue or some such heathen place of worship to be married to you under pretence of showing me the antiquities and what would mr stuart do then i never saw such roses mr stuart joyce my dear oh she's gone with the chocolate i shall wear a fresh one every day that's what i shall do and make pot pourri of the leaves and put it among my clothes if that'll content you and there's a note attached to them i see i shan't open that till i'm alone so that no one shall see my blushes and i'll be bound you'll all be flirting with some other old woman the moment my back's turned because i know your ways a shrill whistle warned her that this court de conge must draw to an end and she began shaking hands with them all you've all made my stay in cairo uncommonly pleasant she said and i thank you all with all my heart you're dear nice boys all of you and i'm really broken hearted to say goodbye to you goodbye all of you and this charming old lady with real tears in her eyes put up all her veils and kissed away handfuls of her delicious little white fingers as the boat began to churn the green nile water into foam then she went to her cabin had a good blow out of chocolate and slept the greater part of the three days' voyage up to luxor with intervals for food and a few expeditions to temples on donkey back she had bought ropes and ropes of ancient egyptian beads in the bazaars with which she adorned herself and when a professor of antiquities otherwise promising hinted that they were modern and came from manchester she told him he knew nothing about it and was dead cuts with him ever afterwards craddock now that he was committed not to separate himself from the party was in no hurry to put his fortune to the test in spite of philip's assurance he still fancied he had been right regarding joyce's avoidance of him and until their stay was beginning to draw to an end and philip had begun to fuss about having a sufficiency of warmer underclothing put in his steamer trunk so that even when the weather grew colder as they sailed northwards again across the mediterranean he should be able to sit out on deck without risk of chill devoted himself to restoring joyce's confidence in and ease of intercourse with him many times it so happened he was alone with her going on some expedition that philip declared himself not equal to while lady crowborough's appetite for antiquities had proved speedily satiated indeed she announced when she had been at luxor a week that the sight of any more temples would make her sick thus he was often joyce's only companion and while waiting his time made himself an admirable guide and comrade he had studied the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties before and with the air of a friendly tutor interested her in the history and monuments he soon saw how apt she was to learn and appreciate and by degrees re established unembarrassing relations with her winning her back to frank intercourse with him with his knowledge and his power of vividly and lightly presenting it he succeeded in weaving their true antique charm about the temples and silent tombs and joyce found herself taking the keenest enjoyment in their long sunny days together to her immense relief he seemed to have banished altogether his yearning for another relationship and she told herself she must have been quite wrong in imagining that he would approach her again and this time with fire yet she had been so convinced of it and here he was with day long opportunities at his disposal plunging her to her infinite satisfaction in the heresies of amenhotep and the elizabethan rule of hatasoo he unfolded the stories of the carven walls for her with their hawk faced gods or adoring kings he traced for her the merchandise that the queen's expedition to the land of plenty brought back with it ivory and apes as in the days of solomon and gold weighed in the balances by overseers he told her of sen mut the architect of deir el bahari to whom the queen showed all her heart and entrusted with the secrets of her will and how thothmes on his mother's death erased from the inscriptions all mention of the low born fellow then day by golden day went on and joyce's confidence increased and her debt of pleasant hours to him grew heavier and was less felt by her but never did she quite get out of her mind that it was he who had said she knew not quite what to her father speaking evil of the boy who painted beside the weir could she have been wrong about that too if so she had indeed wronged this large kindly man who was never weary of his pleasant efforts to interest her her manner to him changed as her confidence returned and with the changing of her manner he drew nearer to confidence in himself but it must not be imagined that all life's inner workings with regard to craddock were centred in this successful charming of joyce to comradeship with him nor in restraining himself from attempting to pluck the fruit while clearly unripe week by week there came to him the most satisfactory accounts from the box office with regard to the reaped and ever ripening harvest so to speak of easter eggs but against that solid asset he had to set not indeed a positive loss but a sacrifice of what might have been a tremendous gain for the long lane that had five turnings was there ever so insolently careless a title had appeared early in january and all london rocked with it akroyd had clearly made the biggest hit of his industrious career and the author had leaped at this second spring over the heads of all other dramatists critics even the most cautious of them seemed to have lost their heads and sheridan redivivus was among their less extravagant expressions his informant as to all this was frank armstrong himself who very thoughtfully sent him a stout packet of these joyful cries as supplied to him by a press agency and with it a letter that seemed to touch the pinnacles of impertinence you have often told me wrote this amiable young man of the great interest you take in my work and so i am certain you will be pleased to hear of the success of the play i have to thank you also for the hint you so kindly gave me about screwing akroyd up to favourable terms and i made a bargain for myself about the scale of royalties that really was stupendous about the play itself it is not being a very good theatrical season generally and even peter i hear isn't panning out very well but you should see the queues at the pall mall golly it's the same in the stalls and boxes mrs fortescue has taken a box every night next week and i think i have persuaded akroyd to raise prices he says it is illegitimate but i rather think he will do it after all the rule of supply and demand must affect prices i'm afraid 'easter eggs' is bound to suffer indeed it was distressingly empty the other night but the box office says it will recover again i see there is a flat vacant just below yours in berkeley square i am thinking of taking it it will be nice to be near you i can never forget what you did for me over my first play also after an unpropitious beginning i have struck up a friendship with charles lathom he has told me in confidence how you played providence to him i hope you will do well over him i should think you would people are talking about him and he has several sitters i tried to tell him all you have done for me but the recollection was too much the words wouldn't come so i pretended to burn my finger over a pipe i was lighting and said 'damn' was not that clever and dramatic i enclose quantities of press notices and i wish i could see your delight over them it was very vexing that you were not here for the first night for i should have liked to have seen what you said but perhaps when i saw it i shouldn't have liked it as i remember you didn't think very much of the play when i read it to you perhaps i shall take a long holiday now not write again at all for a year or two i am besieged with repeats of course that threat did not much alarm craddock he felt as convinced as he felt with regard to the rising of the sun that the young man could not keep off it but there was the very scorpion of a sting in the sentence immediately preceding in which he was reminded of his own rejection of the play his wits must have been wandering that night his flair for anticipating public taste had never betrayed him with so desperate a lapse of perception and somehow it gave him unease to think that an assured enemy of his sharper than a serpent's tooth should have thus leaped into affluence as well as prominence nor did he like this growing friendship between charles and the other he did not like any of the letter nor any of the press notices his evening was completely spoiled and mr wroughton beat him at bezique but next morning with that power which was not the least of his gifts he switched his mind off these disturbances and fixed himself heart and soul on that which lay before him here and now thus passed for them at luxor a complete moon which among other celestial offices had magically illumined for them an hour of night among the ruins of karnak then too they had gone about and there up till then had come the hardest struggle in restraint for him all the spell of the starry kirtled night was woven round them while the huge monoliths and spent glory of the columned hall reminded him urgently insistently how short life was how soon for the generations of men nothing but the hard granite of their work remains no joy no rapture any more for eyes are closed and mouths dumb and the soft swift limbs laid to rest where at the most they can but feel the grasses that wave over their graves or more horribly injected and wrapped in cero cloth and bitumen to be preserved as a parody and mocking of what they once were and this these few years was his time his innings before the silence that preceded closed in on him again all he wanted stood in front of him now as joyce leaned on a fragment of wall white and tall in the moonlight and let her great eyes wander over the outlined columns with young fresh mouth a little parted and hand almost resting on his yes it is all later than he heard his voice saying and suddenly he stopped feeling that to talk here and now and to her of egyptian kings was a mere profanity in this temple which his love had built so much holier than all that had ever been made with hands but at his sudden cessation he saw joyce withdraw herself a little instinctively on guard bitterly he saw that it is all so woundingly sad he said this eternal glorious moon and sky looking down on to what in so few years is but ruin and decay and yet they thought that their houses would endure for ever joyce instantly recovered her confidence and flowed to meet him on this oh yes oh yes she said all this month that has been haunting me i think i hate the moon to night it is like some dreadful imperishable governess always presiding and watching us poor children that broke the tension oh mistress moon said craddock laughing but she is a governess of remarkable personal attractions then the last day of their sojourn came joyce immensely reassured by her own mistaken conviction that he was going to speak that night at karnak and slightly ashamed of herself had nothing left of the trouble she had anticipated at cairo and with regard to retrospect that which had also been a conviction to her though not absolutely vanished was as remote as the imperishable governess that day the two companions had settled to spend not in detailed study for indeed they had gathered a most creditable crop nor even in farewell visits to shrines but in a general out door survey and assimilation of river and temple and desert and sky a long exposed photograph so to speak of panorama to take back to the fogs of a northern february soon after breakfast they took ferry over the nile and joining their donkeys there rode straight away from the river going neither to the right nor left up the narrow path between fast rising stretches of lengthening crops past the two great silent dwellers on the plain who looking ever eastward wait for the ultimate dawn that shall touch mute lips again to song through the huddled mud houses of gurnak and up and beyond and out till the level green was left below them and they met the sand dried untainted air of the desert here on the brow of the sandstone cliffs they dismounted while josef bestowed their lunch in a cool shadow of a rock in this thirsty land joyce sat down on this bluff we can't dispose of the flesh pots of egypt yet she said nodding at the provision basket may we sit here a little mr craddock and will you let me say my eighteenth dynasty catechism and then joyce turned to him we must plan out this day so carefully she said as it is the last i want to sit here quite silent for about half an hour and if it isn't rude out of sight of you and everybody and just look look get all that the river the crops the sky the temples right deep down then let us have lunch and then let us go a long ride out into the desert where there isn't anybody or anything and then oh oh we shall have to go back and the last day will be over i promised father to go and call on the chaplain after tea with him chaplain he's a dear man but think chaplain on the last day joyce's desired menu of the mind was served to her she said her eighteenth dynasty kings and then strolled along the edge of the cliffs till she was out of sight and sound of donkey and donkey boy and craddock the magic of the land indeed had made its spell for her and now she wanted just to look to absorb to be wrapped in it then just because she had planned this her mind grew restive and fidgetty she had determined on her own account to speak a grateful word to mr craddock to day for all he had done for her and she felt she must thank him too for his unremitting attention to her father he she felt sure would not do so and joyce felt that the family must discharge that indebtedness it seemed a simple task enough to perform but she could not in imagination frame a suitable sentence either about that or her own debt to him and insensibly beginning to worry about it she lost the mood that she had come here to capture craddock and her imminent acknowledgment to him drave between her and the sun and her half hour alone proved a not very satisfactory item she went back to him at the end of it and found that he had already spread their lunch and you have had a 'heart to heart' talk with egypt he asked i thought i heard sobs joyce laughed they were sobs of rage then she said my plan broke down i could think of everything under the sun except egypt just because i meant to gaze and meditate i could not meditate at all but i am so hungry that is something how good of you to have made ready hard boiled eggs and sandwiches however hungry the attack do not need much time for their due disposition and in a quarter of an hour craddock had lit a cigarette preparatory for their ride into the desert and this seemed to joyce a very suitable moment for the dischargal of her thanks and compliments i've had a burden on my mind so long mr craddock she said and that is to let you know just in so many words how i appreciate all that you have done for us your presence has made the whole difference to my father she had begun to speak not looking at him but at the hot sand at her feet but here a sudden movement of his a shifting of his place so that he sat just a little nearer her made her look up at the same moment she saw that he flung away the cigarette he had only just lit then she looked at his face and saw that his mouth was a little open and that his breath came quickly and she knew the moment she had feared a month ago but had allowed herself to think of as averted hovered close to her and has my presence made any difference to you he asked joyce knew the futility of fencing as everybody does who knows a crisis is inevitable but until the end of the world everybody will continue to fence of course it has she said i was just going to speak of that and thank you for it all he drew himself quite close to her there is just one way and no more in which you can thank me he said and it is by letting me offer for your acceptance all my services and all my devotion the fire the authentic primal need was there and though she shrank from it though instinctively she hated it she could refuse it neither with respect nor sympathy she could not interrupt him either what he had to say must come it was his bare right to speak he took up her hand and clasped it with both of his enclosing it as it were in a damp dark cavern at that without being able to help it she drew back a little o stop don't she said he seemed not to hear i offer you much more than i knew was mine to offer last june he said you were so right joyce to refuse me but it is so different now you have woke in me or created in me a power for love which i did not know was mine surely you know that you created it it is yours take it for what you made is me he paused a moment then seemed suddenly to realize that he had said all that could be said a little wind drove upwards from the plain below fluttering the papers which had held their sandwiches joyce hated herself for noticing that then she tried to withdraw her hand oh i am so sorry so sorry she said it is quite impossible more impossible than ever i mean i don't know what i mean but i can't she knew very well what she meant when she said more impossible than ever and mixed with her regret which was wholly genuine was a sort of nausea of her soul once more she felt she knew who had spoken to her father of charles the motive too was as clear as the sunshine she loathed this continued contact but it only lasted a second more the tone of her reply would have carried conviction to the most ardent of lovers he dropped her hand i have done he said he got up and walked a few paces away and stood there with his back to her a quantity of disconnected pictures went through the blank impassivity of his mind he remembered the look of the green packet of tickets for their passage down the nile to morrow which he had seen on his table before he went out this morning he heard philip's voice say take care of my little joyce he felt himself licking the envelope which contained mr ward's cheque for five thousand pounds he had the vision of another cheque for ten thousand and one hundred pounds he saw the sketch of joyce that had stood beneath the lamp in her room on the evening the chimneys smoked at the mill house he heard himself console charles for the queer note philip wroughton had written him collectively these presented their whole case his whole connection with the wroughtons succinctly and completely and the curtain fell on them he went back to joyce who was sitting by the side of the fluttering paper with her head in her hands what would you like to do he said shall we take our ride into the desert or go home joyce got up oh let us go home she said please call mohammed and do realize i am sorry i am very sorry but there was nothing in him now that could respond to or help the girl's evident distress it seemed that the wonderful flower that grew out of him had been plucked only the soil out of which it grew remained and that was exactly what it had always been that night when lady crowborough went up to bed she was not surprised to hear joyce's tap on her door a moment afterwards she had felt the constraint that had hung over dinner like a thunder cloud though philip flushed with victory at the ideal disposition in the packing of his underclothing which had occurred to him as he dozed or slept he thought slept before dinner had been unconscious of all else come in my dear she said and tell me all that's happened oh granny he has proposed again said joyce lor' my dear do you think i didn't guess that and you needn't trouble to tell me that you refused him well joyce i can't say i'm sorry though i suppose he's rich and agreeable enough for i never could stand stout white men myself give me one of my cigarettes dear and sit down and have a talk there's nothing i enjoy more than a cigarette and a talk about love just before going to bed gives such pleasant dreams joyce could not help giggling but she knew well the golden heart that beat behind these surprising flippancies but i'm sorry granny she said but but i'm afraid i'm not sorry enough no my dear said this astute old lady if you were sorry enough you'd say 'yes' instead of 'no' let me see this is the second go isn't it yes well then i hope this time that you made it plain the man whom you don't mean to have gets tedious if he goes on i used to tell them so joyce had come here to do much more than merely announce the event to her grandmother there was so much more she wanted to say but she felt it would be easier if it came out in answer to questions probably grannie was wise enough to ask the right questions i think i made it plain she said i said it was quite impossible more impossible than ever lady crowborough in the dusk allowed herself to beam all over her face and what did you mean by that my dear she said to me it sounds as if there was nobody else last june but somebody else now oh grannie it means just that said joyce in a whisper and was it any of my flirts in cairo asked lady crowborough who liked a little joking even when her heart was most entirely tender and sympathetic quite truly she believed it helped things out to grin over them joyce grinned no not in cairo she said then it was that flirt of mine down at the mill house who's going to paint my picture she exclaimed don't deny it my dear a nice boy too though he ain't got a penny however we'll talk about the pennies afterwards now do you think he fancies you at all don't be so silly joyce hiding your face like that yes grannie i think he does i can't be sure you know i i haven't had any experience lor' my dear what do you want with experience over that sort o' thing asked lady crowborough and if you're too modest to say i'll say it for you he does like you and you know it i saw him the wretch looking at you in the right way so i don't understand what all the fuss is about you like him and he likes you eh the cleverest of grandmothers could not guess the further confidence that joyce wanted to make she had to open it herself but but there's a difficulty grannie she said somebody has told father that he's not not nice that he isn't the sort of person he would like me to know father wouldn't let him come down to see his copy of the reynolds while we were there because of that and i feel sure i know who it is who told him that and why he said it that craddock asked lady crowborough quickly yes and i can't believe it is true i don't believe it oh grannie dear what a comfort you are lady crowborough's shrewd little face entirely ceased to beam and i don't believe it either my dear she said he seemed as decent a young fellow as i ever saw but you can leave that to me i'll find out if it was your craddock who said it first of all it's only your suspicion as yet joyce and whatever you do my dear don't you go through life suspecting anybody and then not doing him the justice to find out if you're right and then after that we must find out if there's any truth in it and what the truth is oh but will you can you asked joyce yes my dear unless i die in the night which god forbid i'll craddock him and here am i doing just the same as you and treating your suspicions as true before i know lor but it does seem likely don't it and now about what has happened to day are you going to tell your father or is he mr craddock thought we had better say nothing about it at present said joyce i expect he is quite right he said he thought father would be very much upset that was as we rode back oh grannie fancy saying that i think he meant it as a sort of final appeal or perhaps he meant it quite nicely i'm sure father wanted me to marry him but that didn't seem a good enough reason lady crowborough began to beam again not with your mr lathom waiting for you she said well now my dear you must let me go to bed i'm glad you told me all about it and i can tell you now i should have thought very poorly of you if you had accepted this mr craddock did he kiss you my dear joyce again felt an inward bubble of laughter no thank goodness she said that's a good thing you wait till you get back to town there's somebody there bless me how i keep getting ahead now send me my maid joyce and don't give way my dear and when i say my prayers i'm not sure i shan't give thanks that you ain't going to be mrs craddock i don't like the man and i don't like the name and that's sufficient in spite of this distaste lady crowborough did craddock the justice to admit that he behaved very well next day his invaluable gift for switching off stood him in good stead his manner was perfectly normal again and sitting on the deck of the northward going steamer after lunch he talked to her about the exhibition of old masters at burlington house which was now open there are a dozen fine reynolds there he said but none finer i think than the one that used to be at the mill house lady crowborough affected a very skilful carelessness but what prices for a bit of canvas and a daub of paint she said i can't see a bit of difference between it and the copy that was a nice young fellow who did it too i was sorry that you had to give so bad a report of him to my son craddock hardly paused he assumed that philip had said something to his mother about it and though he would not have chosen that his name should have been mentioned as informant he felt it was useless to deny it nor did he wish to jealousy impotent and bitter took hold of him yes a loose young fellow i am afraid he said but i am doing what i can for him for his gift is perfectly marvellous indeed i should not wonder if he is some day known among the greatest english masters as i was saying there are some very fine reynolds in the exhibition i had the pleasure of getting hold of one or two for them you must see it oh drat the exhibition she said she explained that a sudden twinge of neuralgia had visited her and put on several veils chapter viii one morning towards the end of march frank armstrong was sitting in charles' studio with a writing pad on the table in front of him a sucked out pipe upside down between his lips a corrugated forehead rumpled hair and an expression of the wickedest ill humour on his face beside him on the floor a waste paper basket vomited half sheets of futile manuscript and other crumpled up and rejected pages strewed the floor at the far end of the studio charles was encamped he and his manuscript on the model's stand painting as he had done in the portrait of his mother from a position above the sitter it gave an opportunity of subtle foreshadowing which was a holy joy if you could do it right which he was quite convinced he could an expression of vivid and absorbed content absorbed he was by the sight of frank wrestling with his work and cursing and swearing at his difficulties pervaded his face to him from the artistic point of view that angry scowling countenance was a beatific vision frank had come earlier than he had expected that morning bringing his work with him as desired and charles half dressed only in loose shirt and flannel trousers had hopped on to his seat immediately for frank with scarcely a word of greeting had sat down at once to struggle with a troublesome situation seated there with his sheaf of spear like paint brushes and his young and seraphic face he looked like some modern variation of st sebastian frank had already remarked this with singular annoyance charles smiled and stared and painted if you could manage to put that pipe out of your mouth for five minutes frank he said tentatively but i couldn't it doesn't matter a bit said charles cordially frank instantly took it out and charles had to stop painting for a moment for he was so entertained by the brilliance of his own guilefulness that his hand trembled but in a moment he got to work again and began whistling under his breath oh do stop that row said frank the picture had been begun a month ago and was nearing completion at present charles was pleased with it which is saying a good deal his mother on the other hand thought mr armstrong was not quite such a bear as that and mr armstrong had said you don't know much about bears charles' first request to paint him had met with a firm refusal but very shortly after frank had said you can do a picture of me if you like charles but on one condition only that you let me buy it of you in the ordinary way this time the refusal came from the artist but a second attempt on frank's part met with better success you don't understand about the picture he said i really want it for mercantile reasons i'll pay you whatever mrs fortescue paid and i shall think i've made an excellent bargain just as she does people are talking about you you'll get double these prices next year then i shall sell my picture and buy some more beer and perhaps give you a tip i'm as hard as nails about money don't you think i'm doing you a favour and as a word of general advice do get rid of a little of your sickly humility you're like uriah heep isn't he mrs mrs heep mrs lathom looked up at him very gravely there is something in what you say master copperfield she observed this morning after charles' whistling had been thus peremptorily stopped the work went on in silence for some quarter of an hour then frank gave a great shout i've got it he said and began scribbling and reading as he scribbled it isn't that you don't believe me it's that you are able not to believe me yes that's it and the british public won't understand the least what it means so we'll put 'long pause' and then they will give a great sigh as if they did now it's plain sailing his face cleared as the pen began to move more rapidly and when charles looked up at him again the st sebastian air left him altogether you are perfectly useless if you smile in that inane manner he said perfectly useless perfectly useless said frank absently but soon his inane smile left him he was in difficulties again and charles greatly prospered frank got up and yawned i'm worked out he said charles it's a dog's life and all the time i'm not doing it for myself there's the rub i've been grinding here all morning and have done a couple of pages if i sit and grind every day like this for a couple of months perhaps i may get it done and then i shall go with my hat in my hand on bended knee to that old fat cross legged buddha who sits there sniffing up the incense of our toil and say 'please mr craddock will this do will you deign to accept this humble token from your worshipper' i can hear you say it said charles half shutting his eyes to look at his work and not attending to frank frank jumped up onto the model stand putting his hand on charles' shoulder to steady himself no you can't said frank because i never shall say it charles i'm sure that's libellously like me shall i bring an action against you for it or shall i merely topple you and the stool over onto the floor whichever you please it is pretty like you you know charles looked up at him but not when you look like that why this unwonted good temper it will soon pass i think it's because i've done a good bit of work oh lord it will soon pass all for craddock you know i wish to heaven i could infect you with some of my detestation of him charles frowned oh do give up trying he said it's no use arguing about it of course he's making the devil of a lot of money out of you and it's very annoying if you look at that fact alone but where would you have been if he hadn't put on 'easter eggs' for you sleeping beneath the church yard sod as like as not and i daresay he's going to make something out of me well where would i have been if he hadn't bought that picture of reggie and come to look at my things in the sidney street garret still instead of which and charles waved a paint brush airily round his studio frank relit his pipe and began gathering up the debris of his rejected manuscript you oughtn't to be allowed about alone he said you say 'kind man' too much you're like a fat baby that says 'dada' to everybody in the railway carriage i tell you people aren't kind men they want to 'do' you they want to get the most they can out of you and you out of them said charles within limits kind craddock hasn't got any limits besides i don't humbug people nor does well he tries to he tried to humbug me telling me he took such an interest in me and my work he didn't he took an interest in the money he thought he could make out of it oh it isn't only craddock it's everybody it's the way the world's made i'm not sure women aren't the worst of all look at the way they all took me up when 'easter eggs' came out i didn't see why at first but it's plain enough now they thought i should make some more successes just like craddock and then i should take them to the theatre and give them dinner oh bosh said charles very loud it's not bosh the idea that fellows like you have of women is enough to make one ill you think they are tender and self sacrificing and helpless and trustful and loving helpless good lord an ordinary modern girl is as well able to take care of herself among men as a dreadnought among fishing smacks she sidles along just turning her screw and then 'bang bang' she blows them all out of the water if she doesn't want them and sucks them in if she does and lets down a great grappling iron from her deck and hauls them on board and when they are married they are supposed to be clinging and devoted and absorbed in their husbands and babies was there ever such a misconception why supposing you find a block of women on the pavement opposite a shop you may bet ten thousand to one that that shop is a dress maker's or a seller of women's clothes they stand glued to the glass like flies on fly paper thinking how sweet they would look in that eight guinea walking dress and when they have to move away they walk with their heads still looking at the windows stupefied and fascinated still gazing at some dreadful white corset trimmed with lace or open work stockings and they aren't thinking how ravished their silly dick or harry will be to see them in that new skirt with the foolish open work stockings peeping out below it they are thinking how ravishing they will look when other women see them in it and how greenly jealous other women will be if they were thinking of their husbands they would be imagining how ravishing darling dick or harry would look in that cheviot tweed but not they oh put it all into one of your rotten plays said charles not i thank you the dreadnoughts would blow me out of the water but i'm saying it to you for your good you trust people too much men and women alike you go smiling and wagging your tail like a puppy thinking that everybody is going to be kind and tender and unselfish especially foolish is your view of women you've got a sense of chivalry and a man with a sense of chivalry always gets left you're just as absurd about men too you think people are nice to you because they like you it is very conceited of you oh i was uriah heep not long ago remarked charles so you are still but the truth is that people seem to like one in order to be able to get something out of one who of all men in the world now is going about saying perfectly fulsome things about me why that slimy akroyd because he is making his fortune out of me but he tried to 'do' me all right over the play craddock too i'm told he is always saying nice things about me that's because he wants me to put my very best work into the plays i have got to write for him charles remembered that craddock had said not altogether nice things about frank on one occasion he often remembered that but as often he remembered also that they were expressly meant for his private ear the fact lurked always in his mind in the shadow into which he had deliberately pushed it and here we are back at craddock he said yes oh by the way charles i saw a flame of yours last night a very old flame in fact lady crowborough i daresay you would have thought she was being tender and solicitous about you i thought that she was merely extremely inquisitive about me said charles yes she wanted to know all i could tell her about you she reminded me of somebody wanting to engage a servant from a previous employer charles looked thoroughly puzzled lady crowborough he asked again about me yes i've already said so what's the matter charles had risen and came across to where frank sat in the window seat into his head there had instantaneously flashed the episode of his proposing himself to go down to the mill house to look at his reynolds' copy and the inexplicable letter of mr wroughton's nothing's the matter he said sitting down close to frank but please tell me just all you can did you ask her why she wanted to know not i it was perfectly clear that somebody had been gently hinting things about you but i told her a good deal frank's face grew quite gentle and affectionate i told her you were the best chap in the world he said that's about what it came to i think i made her believe it too then hurrying away from anything approaching to sentiment of course we have to lie on behalf of a friend he said briskly i daresay she wanted to be sure she could trust herself in your studio without a chaperone charles did not smile at this but you think some one has been telling damned lies about me he asked probably why not and what does it matter don't be upset charles i wish i hadn't told you at least i don't think i do it may convince you that there's somebody in the world not set to a hymn tune now do dress and you will then come and lunch with me in my flat and you may be able to hear craddock walking about overhead that'll make you happy and you can get a step ladder and kiss the ceiling but there was another idea now that had to be put in the shadow of charles' mind it was far uglier than the first and had to be poked away in the darkest of recesses as soon as money had begun at all to flow his way last autumn charles had hounded his mother as she put it out of her disgusting rooms so he put it in sidney street and had established her modestly indeed but comfortably in grieve's crescent not far from his new studio to night he was going to dine at home and he looked forward to the serenity that always seemed as much a part of her as her hands or her hair as a man after a hot and dusty day may look forward to a cool bath pictures that were candidates for the academy had to be sent in before the end of this week and he had spent an industrious afternoon working steadily at the background and accessories in his portrait of frank craddock had advised him to send this and the portraits of his mother and mrs fortescue to the august tribunal and had promised to speak helpful words if such were necessary in authoritative ears but to day the joy of painting had wholly deserted him and as he worked his conscious mind occupied with light and shadow his unconscious mind had done a great deal of meditation and the disagreeable objects he had so loyally stuffed away in the dark seemed gambolling there like cats active and alert every now and then one or other seemed to leap out of the shadow and confront him and with frank's face always before him on the canvas they seemed in some nightmare sort of fashion to be using their mask of paint to communicate with him it was as if frank knew all that charles had been so careful not to tell him it was as if he said oh he warned you against me did he that was so like him worse still frank seemed to say and he's warned other people against you that's why you weren't welcome at the mill house he wanted to cut you off from the wroughtons i wonder why what motive can he have had look for a bad one let me see wasn't there a girl why yes i bet she is the girl among the forget me nots what a liar you are charles you always said it was a picture out of your head are you a rival do you think all afternoon this sort of vague unspoken monologue rang in his ears again and again he pulled himself up knowing that these were conversations internal to himself not to be indulged in but the moment his conscious and superficial mind was occupied again with his craft they began again there were other voices mixed with them he almost heard lady crowborough say five thousand pounds for a lick of paint he almost heard reggie say drew a cheque for ten thousand and one hundred pounds and again he pulled himself up he felt that he would be suspecting his mother next for overcharging him for board and lodging it was all frank's fault with his cynical false views about the rottenness of mankind for once charles felt glad that the light was beginning to fail and that he could honestly abandon work but before he left his studio he turned joyce's picture round to the light and stood looking at it for a moment i can't and won't believe it he said there was still an hour to spare before he need go home to dinner and he bustled out for a walk in the park in the fading day spring was languorous in the air but triumphantly victorious in the spaces of grass where she marched with daffodils and crocuses for the banner of her advancing vanguard the squibs of green leaves had burst from their red sheaths on the limes and planes were putting forth tentative and angled hands as if groping and feeling their way still drowsy from the winter's slumber into the air under the provocation of the compelling month all this did charles good he liked the sense of the silent plants all expanding according to their own law minding their own business which was just to grow and blossom and not warning each other of the untrustworthiness of their neighbours frank ought to be planted out here with a gag in his clever mouth and an archangel or two to inject into his acidulated veins the milk of human kindness charles smiled at the idea he would make a cartoon of it on a postcard and send it to him and then suddenly his heart hammered and stood still and out of his brain were driven all the thoughts and suspicions that he had been stifling all day frank and his cynicism craddock and his clung to kindnesses his art his mother his dreams and deeds were all blown from him as the awakening of an untamed wind by night blows from a sultry sky the sullen and low hung clouds leaving the ray of stars celestial to make the darkness bright and holy again and down the broad path towards him came joyce until she had got quite close to him she did not see him but then she stopped suddenly and suddenly and sweetly he saw the unmanageable colour rise in her face and knew that in his own the secret signal answered hers oh mr lathom she said is it you grandmamma telegraphed for me to come up this morning i am here for a night not ill i hope said charles joyce laughed no i am glad to say she was not in when i got to her house and i had to come out spring you know their eyes met in a long glance and charles drew a long breath i discovered it ten minutes ago he said spring just spring month of april for another long moment they stood there face to face spring round them and below and above them and in them then joyce pointed to the grass oh the fullest wood she said i don't know why grannie sent for me i must be getting back i am late already is there a taxi do you think charles' ill luck prevailed there was and he put her into it and stood there looking after its retreat as it turned the corner not fifty yards away out of the park most distinctly did he see joyce lean forward and look out and though not one atom of his ill defined troubles or suspicions was relieved he walked on air all the way home instead of wading through some foul resistant stickiness of mud the great star the only star that really mattered had shone on him again not averting its light but though he walked on air the mud was still there a visitor to tea charles i wish you had been home earlier three guesses mother lies remarked reggie you do you enjoyed being asked those things that would never have happened if charles had been at home this was rather like the uncomfortable though not uncommon phenomenon of feeling that the scene now being enacted had taken place before charles experienced this vividly at the moment my first guess and last is lady crowborough he said right i fancy near enough said reggie and her questions charles felt himself descend into the mud again it closed stiffly about him and he thrust something back into the darkness of his mind perfectly simple he said she wanted to know exactly all about me as if as if she was going to engage me as a servant and was making enquiries into my character very clever how was it done asked reggie never mind it is done isn't it mother yes dear but how did you know it had to be so that is all oh i've had a tiresome day all but about half a minute of it and my portraits have to go in before the end of the week and they will all be rejected dear there's not much conviction in your voice observed mrs lathom aren't you being uriah ish as mr armstrong says probably but frank was sitting to me this morning and his tirades put me out of joint the worst of it is he had stuck fast again in the slough and again things with dreadful faces and evil communications on tongue tip looked at him from the darkness the sight of reggie also had given birth to others there they stood in a dim and lengthening line waiting for his nod to come out into the open you may as well let us know the worst said reggie encouragingly i can't bear the suspense what is it akroyd says 'it it kills me' that's over the fourth turning much the funniest what did frank tirade about charles i wish i had been there i love hearing his warnings about the whole human race it makes me wonder when i can't account for a sixpence whether you haven't taken it out of my trousers pockets while i was asleep i suppose that's the sort of thing you really enjoy thinking about said charles savagely yes it's so interesting sometimes i think you are rather bad for frank he said to me the other day 'you can always trust charles' i asked him if he didn't feel well it wasn't like him mrs lathom got up it was perfectly evident that something worried charles and it was possible he might like to talk alone either with reggie or her if she took herself upstairs charles could join her and leave his brother or wait with him here if he was to be the chosen depository don't be too long boys she said going out charles did not at once show any sign of the desire to consult and reggie who had left thistleton's gallery in the winter and obtained a clerkship in a broker's office in the city politely recounted a witticism or two from the stock exchange with a view to reconciling his brother to the human race they fell completely flat and charles sat frowning and silent blowing ragged rings of smoke at length he got up reggie i've been worried all day he said and seeing you has put another worry into my mind reggie linked his arm in his brother's i'm so sorry charles he said and i've been babbling goatishly on why didn't you stop me nothing i've done to worry you i hope reggie went anxiously over in his mind a variety of small adventurous affairs but there was nothing that should cause the eclipse of his brother's spirits no it doesn't concern you in any way except as regards your memory if you aren't perfectly certain about a couple of points i want to ask you say so well the first is this do you remember last june an american called ward drawing a cheque at your desk at thistleton's i want you to tell me all that you remember about it reggie leaned his arm on the chimneypiece ward and craddock came out together he said after a pause ward asked for my pen and drew a cheque for five thousand pounds post dating it by a day or two i'm not sure how long it doesn't matter said charles the cheque the cheque was for some dutch picture he had bought there was a van der weyde i think but dutch pictures you never told me that are you sure quite is that all and what's wrong charles was silent a moment one of the figures in the shadow leapt out of it and seemed to nod recognition at him no there's one thing more didn't the same sort of affair happen again he asked oh yes much later i should say in october ward did exactly the same thing drew another cheque out at my desk i mean for rather an odd sum what was it ten thousand ten thousand and something ten thousand one hundred i think he drew it to craddock as before yes i'm sure it was for that but how does it all concern you or why does it worry you may i know charles charles wondered whether his horrible inference was somehow quite unsound whether to another his interpretation would seem ingenious indeed but laughably fantastic he felt he knew what frank would make of it but to reggie the whole affair might seem of purely imaginary texture yes i'll tell you he said and i can't say how i long to find that you think i am suspicious and devilishly minded the facts are these craddock paid mr wroughton five thousand pounds for his reynolds giving him a cheque of ward's who purchased it but you tell me this cheque was for dutch pictures the picture did not go to him till much later i don't know when and craddock gave me fifty pounds for copying it do you see what if if ward gave craddock a cheque for ten thousand pounds for the picture with a hundred for me for the copy now am i worse than frank more suspicious more more awful reggie was staring at him with wide open eyes and shook his head no he said it sounds it sounds but surely it's impossible oh i'm tired of saying that to myself by the way don't say a word to anyone there are other things too oh reggie can't you think of any explanation that is at all reasonable again reggie shook his head no he said the first cheque was for some dutch pictures well let's go upstairs said the other later in the evening when mrs lathom went to bed charles followed her up to her room and sat down in front of her fire while she brushed her hair it was not rarely that he did this and these minutes were to him a sort of confessional generally the confession was a mere babble of happy talk concerning his pictures and his projects but to night he sat silent until the hair brushing was nearly over then he spoke mother darling he said i saw miss joyce this evening and and she was jolly and friendly and natural it lifted me up out of what is it out of the mire and clay but i've gone back again oh much deeper i want your advice she instantly got up and came across to him he put her in his chair and sat down on the rug by her leaning against her knees ah i'm so glad my darling she said that you want to tell me what's wrong these are my jewels i can't tell you explicitly what is wrong but i suspect someone whom i have always trusted immensely who has been very good to me of of swindling and perhaps worse what am i to do she stroked his hair oh my dear if it is only suspicion dismiss it all from your mind or make a certainty of it one way or the other but how i can't be sure without knowing the facts but if your suspicion is reasonable if i mean you can see no other explanation except the bad one go as soon as you can to anyone who can give you certain information but if there's a loophole for doubt i don't see that there is said charles quickly then make certain somehow and quickly she said not in a hurry of course for you must not act foolishly but as soon as you can with wisdom oh charles we can none of us risk keeping suspicion in our minds there is nothing so poisoning to oneself it it shuts the wisdom of your soul it turns everything sour it spreads like some dreadful contagion and infects all within us so that there is no health left or sense of beauty or serenity it is like walking in a cloud of flies but my dear unless your suspicion is is terribly well founded don't give it another thought if you can possibly avoid it be very certain that you can't explain things away otherwise charles turned a shining face to her shining for her through all his trouble thanks mother darling he said it really is a beastly position and i'm such a coward so are we all dear she said but most of us don't turn back really perhaps we aren't such cowards as we think it is so easy to make the worst of oneself charles got up yes but i'm pretty bad he said i know dear you are a continual sorrow and trouble to me ah bless you and you saw joyce that's something isn't it well a good deal said he good night i must get back home charles had labelled himself coward and indeed as in the manner of youth whose function so clearly in this life is to enjoy he shrank from pain instinctively not seeing beyond the present discomfort but living in the moment yet it was not his bravery that was here attacked it was at his trust that the blow at which he cowered was aimed at the confidence in his fellows which was so natural to him as he lay tossing and turning that night he could not imagine himself taking the only step that seemed to be able to decide his suspicions which was to go to craddock himself with the whole history of them there was just one other chance namely that lady crowborough's purpose in making these inexplicable enquiries about him might declare itself that in a manner ruthlessly convincing would settle everything if her purpose was that which he could not but surmise and at the thought he felt his face burn with a flame of anger at the possibility of so monstrous an explanation yet all this agitating thought was just the secret nurture and suckling of suspicion against which his mother had warned him how right she was how the poison encroached and spread frank turned up early next morning for his final sitting with an evil eye and a brisk demeanour a plan at last he announced a real plan and a good plot for a play it's all quite serious and i'm going to do it it's taken me five months to puzzle it out and last night it all burst upon me new play of mine which i shall begin working at immediately i'm stale over the other and this will be a change i daresay craddock will like it so much that he will ask me to put the other aside a bit you see it's about craddock he's an egotist you see he will like that charles was touched on the raw oh do leave him alone frank he said with a sudden appeal as it were to his own vanished confidence we disagree about him you know as we settled yesterday it isn't really very nice of you to abuse a man who's a friend of mine nor is it nice of you to stick up for an enemy of mine remarked frank you should respect my dislike just as much as i should respect your affection as you never do i shall proceed charles packed himself on his painting stool he could at least try to absorb himself in his work for the sake of stifling his own thoughts even more than for distracting them from what frank said rumple your hair he said and stop still i'm going to submit the scenario to craddock this evening if i can see him he said obligingly rubbing up his hair golly it's a good plot i've really only thought out the first two acts but that will be enough for him to judge by it's called 'the middleman' there's a lot in a title charles sighed you needn't groan he said i can tell it you he's a great big fat chap popular and wealthy and hearty engaged to a delightful girl then it comes out that he sweats young men of genius you and me of course takes them up when they are unknown and gets options on their future works isn't that it 'where's the plot then' you don't see the hang of it one of those young men of genius that's me goes to him in the play with a play of which what you have just said is the sketch hamlet's not in it any more and says 'now let me out of these options of yours or i shall write a play like that' and then it will faintly dawn on craddock that the play is really happening to him and that in real life that i shall do exactly what the young man of genius says he will do do you see simultaneously another of the young men of genius that's you you can be in love with 'the middleman's' girl says 'i'm going to paint a portrait called the middleman a great big fat chap with gold dust on his coat collar there's a play called the middleman coming out at the same time you may have heard of it now will you let me out of your options' the middleman in a burst of righteous indignation exclaims 'this is a conspiracy' and they both say 'it is a conspiracy what then' he's in rather a hole isn't he charles did not answer you're an ungrateful dog charles said frank it gets you out of your options too that shall be part of my bargain i really am going to craddock with that scenario there's no third act it is true but he will give me credit for thinking of something spicy tranby would take that sort of play like a shot craddock has 'done' me why shouldn't i 'do' him do those whom you've been done by a very christian sentiment and an application of abstract justice charles put down his palette and got off his stool there was a frank ish a fiendish ingenuity about this which in ordinary mental weather so to speak with a gleam of sun on his own part to give sparkle to the east wind of it could not have failed to make brisk talking but to day with his nightmare of doubt swarming bat like round him he found no humour but only horror in it sometimes i hardly think you're human frank he said if you really believe craddock is a swindler how can you make jokes about it if it was true it would be too terrible to speak of but you believe it is true and yet you dwell on it and gloat on it i think you're a sort of devil rubbing your hands when you see poor souls damning themselves hullo said frank rather startled by this it's no good saying 'hullo' it isn't news to you said charles standing in front of the fire flushed and troubled and looking younger than ever i've often told you i hate your attitude towards craddock it hurts me to hear a jolly good friend of mine abused and you're continually doing it it would have required a prodigiously dull fellow not to see that there was something serious at the bottom of this for all frank's cynicism for all the armoured hardness with which he met the world there was just one person for whom he felt an affection a protective tenderness that he was half ashamed of and yet cherished and valued more than any of the other tinned foods so to speak in his spiritual larder it had fragrance the freshness of dew on it he got up and put his hands on charles' shoulders charles old chap he said you never told me in that voice you know charles shook his head i know i didn't he said i never felt it in in that voice before but i do now i can't bear the thought of anybody i know cheating and swindling and lying suppose i found out that you had been cheating me or blackguarding me should i be able to laugh about it do you think or sketch out a damned little play to read to you which would show you up yes but you always say that craddock's been so good to you said frank till now you have always half laughed at me when i slanged him and who has been blackguarding you i should like to know what does that mean or or are you referring to what lady crowborough asked me i talked some rot about the explanation being that some one had been abusing you charles grasped at this rather appealingly yes it was rot wasn't it frank he said of course it was charles i never dreamed it would stick in your mind like this but what has that got to do with craddock and his nimble option charles interrupted clamourously nothing nothing at all he said i've got the blues the hump the black cat what you please now be a good chap and don't think any more about it i want to finish your hair it won't take long the interrupted sitting had not been in progress many minutes before the telephone bell stung the silence and charles went to it where it hung in a corner of the studio a very few words appeased that black round open mouth and charles put back the receiver frank noticed that his hands were a little unsteady craddock's coming down here almost immediately frank he said he's bringing a man called ward with him for whom i copied wroughton's reynolds customer i hope said frank what do you want me to do charles charles flared out at this with the uncontrolled irritability of his jangled nerves stop here and behave like a gentleman i hope he said if any other man in the world had said that he would assuredly have found the most convenient hard object in full flight for his head all right old boy said frank craddock arrived not a quarter of an hour later with mr ward he was in the height of cheerful spirits having only an hour before disposed of his entire lunatic asylum of post impressionist pictures to a friend of ward's whose ambition it was to spend as much as possible over the embellishment in a manner totally unprecedented and unique of his house in new york the dining room was called the inferno it had black walls with a frieze of real skulls the floor of the drawing room was on a steep slant and all the tables and chairs had two short and two long legs in order to keep their occupants and appurtenances on the horizontal it was for this room brightly described to him by the owner that the post impressionists were designed and craddock in sympathy with his client's conviction that they were predestined for it had put an enormous price on them and the bargain had been instantly completed after that he cheerfully gave up an hour to do charles this good turn of taking mr ward down to his studio and on the way he found himself hoping that the picture of mrs lathom had not yet gone in to the academy on the way too he gave the patron a short resume i think you never saw young lathom when he was at your work on your reynolds he said you will find him a charming young fellow and he as soon as the academy opens this year will find himself famous he will leap at one bound to the top of his profession i strongly recommend you to get him to do a portrait of you now in fact his charge for a full length at present is only four hundred pounds however here we are and you will judge for yourself on the value of his work craddock made himself peculiarly amiable to frank while ward looked at the portraits in the studio before the one of charles' mother he stopped a long time regarding it steadily through his glasses he was a spare middle aged man grey on the temples rather hawk like in face with a low very pleasant voice from it he looked at charles and back again you may be proud to have your mother's blood in you mr lathom he said and i daresay she's not ashamed of you i wish i'd got you to copy some more pictures for me at a hundred pounds apiece craddock had given up wasting amiability on that desert of a playwright and was standing close to the other two quite involuntarily charles glanced at him and he had one moment's remote uneasiness he could not remember if he had given charles a hundred pounds or not but it really was of no importance should charles say anything what was easier than to look into so petty a mistake and rectify it but charles said nothing whatever ward turned and saw craddock close to him i was saying to mr lathom he said that there were no more full length copies to be had for a hundred pounds any more than there are any more original reynolds of that calibre to be had for what i gave for mr wroughton's what did you give asked charles deliberately he felt his heart beat in his throat as he waited for the answer well don't you tell anyone mr lathom he said but i got it for ten thousand pounds but i've felt ever since as if i had been robbing mr wroughton this time charles did not look at mr craddock at all yes i suppose that's cheap he said considering what an enormous price a fine reynolds fetches yes now i suppose mr lathom that portrait of your mother is not for sale i am building i may tell you a sort of annex or luxembourg to my picture gallery at berta entirely for modern artists i should like to see that there i should indeed charles smiled you must talk over that with mr craddock he said it belongs to him you may be sure i will and now i should be very grateful to you if you could find time and would consent to record mr ward had a certain native redundancy to record at full length your impression of my blameless but uninteresting person your price our friend tells me is four hundred pounds and i shall think i am making a very good bargain if you will execute your part of the contract charles saw craddock from where he stood just behind mr ward give him an almost imperceptible nod to confirm this valuation if he had not seen that it is very likely that he would have accepted this offer without correction as it was that signal revolted him it put him into partnership with with the man in whose studio he now stood now and for all future time there could be nothing either secret or manifest between them you have made a mistake about the price he said to ward i only charge two hundred for a portrait i shall be delighted to paint you for that from a little way off he heard frank make the noise which is written tut and he saw a puzzled look cross craddock's face who just shrugged his shoulders and turned on his heel i am very busy for the rest of this week said charles but after that i shall be free he glanced at craddock who had moved away and was looking at the portrait of mrs fortescue i am changing my studio said charles in a low voice i will send you my new address craddock did not hear this but frank did it seemed to him with his quick wits to supply a key to certain things charles had said that morning he felt no doubt of it mr ward involved himself in a somewhat flowery speech of conge next week will suit me admirably he said and i shall think it an honour to sit to you the only thing that does not quite satisfy me is the question of price you must allow me at some future time to refer to that again the picture i may tell you is designed to be a birthday present for mrs ward and though the intrinsic merit of the picture i am sure will be such that the donor he became aware that he could never get out of this labyrinth and so burst so to speak through the hedge well we must talk about it and now i see i have already interrupted a sitting and will interrupt no longer mr craddock i shall take you away to have some conversation in our taxi about that picture of mr lathom's mother charles saw them to the door and came back to frank i suppose you guess he said well you've guessed right he threw himself into a chair he has swindled mr wroughton he said he has swindled me me of a paltry wretched fifty pounds which is worse meaner than the other and mr wroughton asked frank he gave him five thousand for the reynolds receiving ten that's not so despicable there's some point in that but to save fifty pounds when he was giving me this studio getting me commissions doing everything for me there's that damned telephone see who it is will you frank went to the instrument lady crowborough he said she wants to see you particularly very particularly can you go to her house at three yes said charles he got up from his chair white and shaking there may be something worse frank he said she may have something to tell much worse than this good god i wish i had never seen him frank came back across the studio to charles charles old chap he said i've often told you there are swindlers in the world and you've run up against one well face it don't wail charles turned a piteous boyish face to him but it hurts he said he paused a moment my father killed himself he said because he had gambled everything away and none of us knew nor suspected that's where it hurts frank it's not anything like that of course but somehow it's the old place we've all got an old place said frank wounds good lord i could be a gaping mass of wounds if i sat down and encouraged myself buck up and if you find there's anything to be done or talked about well ring me up won't you now you're not going to sit here and mope you are coming straight off with me to have lunch there's nothing like food and drink when one is thoroughly upset and afterwards i shall leave you at the house of that very mature siren suddenly it occurred to charles that joyce was staying with her or at any rate had done so last night till then his first outpouring of amazed disgust had caused him to forget that and it is a fact that he ate a very creditable lunch indeed chapter ix lady crowborough as has been incidentally mentioned was in the habit of hermetically sealing herself up in a small dark house in half moon street for the winter months this year as recounted she had substituted a process of whole hearted unsealedness in egypt for a couple of months but on her return had been more rigorously immured than ever to counteract it must be supposed the possibly deleterious effects of so persistent an exposure to the air and to fortify her for her coming visits to charles' studio in the evening it is true she often went out to dine in a small brougham with the windows up but except for her call yesterday on charles' mother the daylight of piccadilly had scarcely beheld her since her return windows in the house were always kept tightly shut except owing to the carelessness or approaching asphyxia of servants rooms were ventilated by having their doors set ajar so that the air of the passage came into them and dry stalks of lavender were continually burned all over the house so that it was impregnated with their fresh fragrance she was a standing protest against those modern fads so she labelled them of sitting in a draught and calling it hygiene and certainly her procedure led to excellent results in her own case for her health always good became exuberant when she had spent a week or two indoors her natural vitality seemed accentuated and she ate largely and injudiciously without the smallest ill effects between meals she worked at fine embroidery without spectacles sitting very upright in a small straight backed cane chair the house was tiny and crammed from top to bottom with what she called my rubbish for without collecting she had an amazing knack of amassing things oil paintings water colour sketches daguerrotypes photographs finely shaded pencil drawings samplers trophies of arms hung on the walls and on chimney pieces and tables and in cupboards and cabinets were legions of little interesting objects dresden figures carved ivory chessmen shells silver boxes commemorative mugs pincushions indian filigree work bits of enamel coins coral ebony elephants all those innumerable trifles that in most houses get inexplicably lost she had just cleared a shelf in a glass case by the fireplace in her minute drawing room and was busy arranging the beads and doubtful scarabs of me egyptian campaign in it when charles entered upon which she dismissed from her shrewd and kindly old mind all concerns but his sit down my dear she said and light your cigarette i saw your mother yesterday as she may have told you i'm coming to sit for you next week and so please have the room well warmed and not at all what these doctors call aired lord bless me i had enough air in egypt to last me for twenty years to come she indulged in these cheerful generalities until she saw that charles was established then she broke them off completely now i sent for you because i wished to see you most particularly mr lathom she said no there's nobody here but me i sent joyce back to her father this morning so if you think you're going to see her you'll be disappointed now it's no use beating about the bush there's something i've got to tell you and here it comes that craddock i call him that craddock told my son philip that you were a disreputable young fellow that's about what it comes to i had it from craddock's own lips that he did joyce knew from her father that somebody had done so and guessed it was that craddock so i was as cool as a cucumber and just said 'i'm sorry you had so bad a report to give my son of mr lathom' i said it so naturally that he never guessed i didn't know it was he and there he was caught like a wasp in the marmalade i wish he had been one i'd have had the spoon over him in no time charles sat quite still for a moment and in that moment every feeling but one was expunged from his mind there was left nothing but a still white anger that spread evenly and smoothly over his heart and his brain he had no longer any regret that craddock had done this the consciousness that he had sufficed to choke all other emotions more superficially the ordinary mechanism of thought went on i never believed a word of it my dear went on lady crowborough nor did joyce but it was my duty for reasons which you can guess to find out if it was true or not well i got your mother's account of you yesterday as she may have told you and your friend mr armstrong's account as he also may have told you and there were several others so either all these people are liars or else that craddock is and there ain't a sane person in the land who could doubt which it was and joyce has gone back home to tell her father charles got up still very quietly i want to know one thing he said why did craddock do it good lord my dear said lady crowborough as if that wasn't plain why the man wanted to marry joyce himself and proposed to her too he guessed and i don't suppose he guessed very wrong either that there was somebody in his way at least she added with a sudden fit of caution it might have been that in his mind for my part the less i know about craddock's mind the better i shall sleep at night and that was why mr wroughton didn't want me down there last autumn he asked why of course he wanted joyce to marry the man but joyce will have told him all about it by now and spoiled his lunch too i hope but if he don't ask you down for next sunday when i'm going there too i'll be dratted if i don't take you down in my own dress basket and open it in the middle of the drawing room that's what i'll do but he'll ask you don't fear i sent him a bit of my mind this morning about believing what the rats in the main drain tell him yes a bit of my mind and if he ain't satisfied with that there's more to come suddenly over the sea of white anger that filled charles there hovered a rainbow lady crowborough he said flushing a little you told me that it was your duty to find out whether these lies were true or not for reasons that i could guess did you did you mean i could really guess them yes my dear unless you're a blockhead but it ain't for me to talk about that and i ain't going to now what about this craddock he's got to eat those lies up without any more waste of time and he's got to tell philip they were lies how can we make him do that charles looked at her a minute considering i can make him do that he said by punching of his head asked lady crowborough no by a very simple threat you told me once you had seen the cheque that mr ward paid for mr wroughton's reynolds and that it was five thousand pounds that is so is it not yes my dear mr ward paid him ten thousand pounds for it said charles good lord my dear do you mean that she asked mr ward told me this morning that he paid craddock ten thousand for it said charles and certainly he gave philip mr ward's cheque for five thousand said lady crowborough for i saw it myself and thought 'what a sum for a picture of a young woman' well he's brought a pretty peck of trouble on himself and i ain't a bit sorry for him but even that's not so bad as what he did to you with those nasty mean lies as he thought could never be caught hold of and so you'll go to him now will you and tell him what you know and threaten that we'll have the law on him as a common swindler is that it something like that said charles getting up i think i shall see frank armstrong first aye do and take him with you he looks a hard one said lady crowborough vindictively i wish i could come too and tell him what i thought about it all and he wouldn't forget that in a hurry my dear if there's a rough side to my tongue and you'll let me know won't you of course charles paused a moment then he bent down and kissed her hand i can't thank you he said you don't know what you've done for me it's it's beyond thanks altogether beyond it she drew his brown head down to hers and kissed him soundly get along my dear she said or you'll be calling me an idiot next minute and then i shall have to quarrel with you get along and have a talk with that craddock and mind you shut the door tight when you go out charles came out into half moon street and the pale sunshine of the spring afternoon in a sort of black exaltation of the spirit for the time all thought of joyce of the magical the golden possibilities that this detected slander opened in front of him was utterly obscured by his immediate errand that hung between him and it like some impenetrable cloud which must first find its due discharge in outpoured storm before the clear shining could dawn on him he felt void of all pity void even of regret that the man whom he had so completely trusted for whom he had cherished so abounding a sense of gratitude should have proved so sinister a rogue what he should say and on what lines this scorching interview would develop and fulfil itself he had no sort of idea nor to that did he give one moment's thought he only looked forward with a savage glee to the fact that within a few minutes if he was lucky enough to find craddock in he would be face to face with him all his shrinking from the suspicions which he had so sincerely tried to keep at arm's length was gone now that the suspicions had turned out to be true and he only longed to fling the truth of them in the teeth of the man whose integrity so short a while ago he had rejoiced to champion that integrity was blown into blackened fragments and his belief in it seemed now as incredible to him as the happenings of some diseased dream which to his awakened senses were a tissue of the wildest rubbish a mere babble of unfounded incoherence there could be no regret for the cessation of impressions so false and unreal he walked quickly along piccadilly with colour a little heightened and a smile vivid and genial on his mouth every now and then his lips pursed themselves up for a bar or two of aimless whistling and he swung a light hearted stick as he went the pavement was full of cheerful passengers the roadway of briskly moving vehicles and all the stir of life seemed full of the promise of this exquisite springtime then in a flash all recognition of the lively world passed from his consciousness and he saw only that black cloud of his own exalted indignation and blind anger which so soon so soon now was going to discharge itself in god knew what torrent and tempest or would it quietly dissolve and drain itself away would there be no explosion no torrent of storm only just little trickling sentences and denials no doubt then more little trickling sentences until there was just silence and no denials at all he did not know and certainly he did not care the manner of the affair in no way occupied or interested him and over his boiling indignation that he knew raged below there stretched a crust that just shook and trembled with the tumult within but showed no sign of giving way every now and then he said softly to himself something's got to happen something's got to happen as he whistled his tuneless phrase and swung his stick frank who occupied a flat immediately below craddock's was in and charles brisk and gay of face marched in upon him i've seen lady crowborough he said and now we will go to see craddock he's he's amazing the worst that i suspected which i didn't tell you is all soberly true he has lied about me he told the wroughtons that i was a disreputable sort of affair he has lied lied to get me out of the way now he has got to eat his lies come on come on what are you waiting for frank sprang up tell me about it first he said oh not now i'll tell you about it upstairs by the way you had some little scheme to get yourself and me out of his hands we'll take that first we'll lead up to the grand crash more artistic eh or shall we begin with the grand crash i don't know i don't care let's go upstairs anyhow and see what happens let nature take her course let's have a touch of nature what is it i have got to do according to your plan oh yes just say i'll draw a portrait of the middleman frank why the devil am i not blazing with indignation and chucking things about you're a psychologist aren't you tell me that you study people and make them have adventures i'm all for adventures come on and let's see what happens we've such a fine day too frank licked his lips gosh i'm on in this piece he said now wait a minute we'll take my little farce first just a curtain raiser he's got an agreement of yours i suppose just as he's got one of mine that gives him his options we must get those out of him first of all then then we can proceed with unbiassed minds ha frank gave one mirthless crack of laughter we'll get those first he said and then start fair up we go craddock was in and the two were admitted it appeared that he had been having a little nap for even as they entered he struggled to a sitting position on his sofa sorry to disturb you said frank but i wanted to see you rather particularly charles also so we came up together frank took up his stand on the hearth rug while charles gracefully subsided into a long low arm chair craddock looked from one to the other not nervously but with an air of slightly puzzled expectancy there was something vaguely unusual about it all i wanted to speak to you about a play said frank which under certain circumstances i shall assuredly write tranby would be sure to take it i naturally want to know if it appeals to you craddock stroked the right side of his face it was smooth and plump my dear fellow he said i should be charmed to hear it but as a matter of fact i have not very much time this afternoon perhaps if you left the scenario with me it's not written out said frank craddock glanced at the clock ah i see i have half an hour he said that ought to be sufficient if not perhaps you can postpone your next engagement however you will see if you think it worth while i propose to call my play 'the middleman' craddock's hand that was still up to his face paused a moment then it began stroking again quite a good title he said with an absolutely impassive tone i thought you would approve of course he is the hero shall we say of the play he's large and stout i want you to picture him to yourself and wealthy and cultivated a great judge of pictures and the arts generally he purchases options on the work of young and unknown men that's how he gets his money and makes devilish good bargains craddock raised his eyebrows slightly and turned to charles and what is your part in this conspiracy he said quietly it is a conspiracy i suppose charles crossed one leg over the other and put his finger tips together oh yes you may call it a conspiracy he said we thought you would you see i'm going to paint a portrait of frank's middleman i know just what he looks like i could draw him for you on a half sheet if you think it necessary then i shall send it to some gallery or other it will be very like just about the time that frank's play comes out you might like to exercise your option over it so i shall paint another one not in your present studio said craddock suddenly certainly not in my present studio i shall never paint anything more in my present studio craddock grasped the whole situation indeed it did not require any very great acuteness to enable him to see exactly how he stood and on the whole he felt up to dealing with it for a moment there was dead silence and charles whistled a futile tuneless phrase there are such things as libel actions he said to frank for those who feel up to bringing them said he once again craddock paused he got up from his sofa went to the window and came back again he rather expected to surprise a consultation of eyes going on between the two young men but there was nothing of the kind frank was regarding his own boots charles was staring vacantly and stupidly smiling a little straight in front of him craddock was by no means a coward and he felt not the smallest fright or nervousness if you think i should hesitate to bring a libel action against you he said to frank if you ever put on anything that could be construed as defamatory to my character you are stupendously mistaken i know quite well that you have always disliked me me who took you out of the gutter and gave you a chance of making your talents known but that is always the way to befriend a certain type of man means to make an enemy by all means proceed to write your play and make it as scandalous and defamatory as you please i shall make not the smallest protest against it you can produce it as soon as you like but mind you it will run for one night only and you will then find yourself involved in a libel action that will beggar you incidentally though i imagine that this will seem to you a comparatively light matter you will find you have caused to be recorded against you the verdict not of a jury only but of every decent minded man and woman in england frank looked at him and suppressed an obviously artificial yawn hear hear he said and about my portrait said charles from the depth of his chair craddock turned to him all i have said to your friend regarding my line of conduct applies to you also he said you may do any caricature of me you please and the more you hold me up to ridicule the sounder will my grounds for action be but what applies to you only is this i consider that your conduct is infinitely more treacherous than his he at least has from the first almost been avowedly hostile to me you have pretended that you were conscious of the gratitude you certainly owe me you have made me think that i was befriending a young man who was fond of me and appreciated my kindness to him armstrong at any rate has made no such nauseous pretence how deeply i am hurt and wounded i do not care to tell you but if it is as i suppose it must be a source of gratification to you to know that you have wounded me you may rest thoroughly well satisfied with what you have done i congratulate you on the result i warned you months ago about your choice of friends the only possible excuse for you is that you have fallen under the influence of the man i cautioned you against frank looked up from his boots to charles did he caution you against me he asked you never told me that no frank i didn't want then to give you another cause for grievance but he did warn me against you you would have been wise to take my advice said craddock as it is perhaps you will see the propriety of your vacating my studio as soon as is convenient to you i should think that by to morrow evening i might hope to find it at my disposal certainly said charles i daresay you will soon find some other promising student craddock turned his back on frank for a moment i never should have thought this of you charles he said there was real sincerity in his reproach bitter as was the injury he had inflicted on the boy he was very fond of him and valued the return of his affection it might be objected that a man does not wilfully and cruelly injure one whom he is fond of such an objection is mistaken and ignorant for herein lie three quarters of the tragic dealings of the world namely that day by day and all day long men strike and betray their friends they do not wrong those who are indifferent to them for where should be the motive of that i should never have thought it of myself said charles and his voice faltered on the words craddock turned to frank again you have told me about your proposed play he said which i imagine was the object of your coming here and charles has come about his portrait i do not know that anything further detains either of you frank could have applauded the quiet dramatic development of the scene if he had come across it in a play he would have watched it with the tensest diligence and here it was all unplanned the situation seemed to develop itself without any exterior assistance craddock for instance was taking exactly the line that the drama demanded and it was quite certain that he had not rehearsed his part he felt certain also that charles would prove equally discerning there is just one more thing he said i require you to destroy in my presence the contract i signed giving you an option to purchase three more plays of mine you have a similar one with regard to pictures by charles that must be destroyed also craddock stared at him in amazement and is there anything else you would like me to do for you he asked no that is all craddock gave his usual sign of merriment the laugh that chuckled in his throat but did not reach outwards as far as his lips which remained without a smile it was something of a relief to find that this was the object of their outrageous threats for he again felt himself quite competent to deal with it it was not that he had actually feared anything else but in spite of that he was glad to have the object of their threats avowed you are most original conspirators he said you threaten me first and when you see that your threats do not disturb me in the slightest degree you produce somewhat as an anti climax surely the object which you hope to gain by your futile menaces go away and practise that is what i recommend you to do get some small handbook about conspiracy and black mail you are ignorant of the very rudiments of it as you have seen i snap my fingers at your threats indeed i am not sure whether it would not amuse me if you put them into execution but to make your demands upon the top of so pathetic a failure is surely what you armstrong would call a 'weak curtain' certainly that would be a very weak curtain said frank looking at his boots again there was no need for him to look at charles it was as certain as if they had gone over the scene till they knew it by heart that charles would pick up his cue but when charles spoke frank looked up at craddock again he wanted to see how he would take it charles neither shifted his position nor cleared his throat how much did ward give you for philip wroughton's reynolds he asked frank watching craddock's face saw only the very slightest change pass over it but for the moment his eyes looked inwards squinting a little that i suppose is your business he observed yes in a moment i will tell you how it is said charles but first i may say what i am going to tell you still craddock's face did not change do you mean by that what you have just asked me it is the same thing it was not in order to get free of your options that i tell you this that is a very minor concern what matters is that you have swindled mr wroughton and it is my business because the cheque that was paid you for the reynolds included a certain sum for my copy of the picture of that you only gave me fifty pounds then the change came craddock's face grew a shade whiter and his upper lip and forehead glistened but in a moment he pulled himself together ah so this is the real threat he said we are going to have a weaker curtain than ever i entirely decline to discuss my private affairs with you go and tell whom you please that i have swindled to use your own word my very good friend philip wroughton go down to thorley and see how he will receive you and your news do you suppose he would listen to you and do you suppose that i will do so any longer tell this story and any other you may have been concocting to the whole world and at the proper time i will very effectually stop you you and your friend seem to have so much money that libel actions are the only way in which you can get rid of it but first tell wroughton whom i have swindled the the monstrous suggestion for one moment his indignation flared up the next he had mastered it again but inflamed by this or by some underlying emotion he made an error and allowed himself to say more when he had so rightly intimated that enough had been said it is lucky for me he said with such fellows round me that i was business like in the matter the cheque ward drew me for five thousand pounds i passed straight on to my friend when the purchase was concluded and have his receipt for it and as for your miserable fifty pounds you agreed as you very well know to make the copy for that sum you were glad enough to get it and your gratitude was quite pretty and that is all i think i have no more to say to either of you he got up and indicated the door neither charles nor frank moved and then a second sign escaped him his indicating hand dropped and the one word he uttered to charles stuck in his throat well he said you have forgotten said charles that ward gave you a cheque for five thousand pounds in payment for some dutch pictures there was a van der weyde among them it was from thistleton's gallery i may remind you you are very copiously informed yes you see my brother was your clerk there he well remembers the purchase and the drawing of the cheque that was in june the cheque was post dated by a few days without doubt craddock was listening now though he had said he would listen no more frank watched him with the same hard devouring interest with which he would have watched a man pinioned and led out to the execution shed charles went on in a voice that sounded a little bored it was as if he repeated some well known tiresome task he had learned it was in october he said that another cheque was drawn to you by mr ward under the same circumstances he wrote it that is to say at thistleton's gallery at my brother's desk this time the cheque was larger for it was of ten thousand and one hundred pounds reggie told me of it at the time i did not connect it then with the reynolds picture lies a pack of lies said craddock under his breath but still listening no not a pack of lies said charles you should not say that sort of thing this morning i asked mr ward how much he paid for the reynolds he told me not to tell anyone but it is no news to you and so i repeat it he paid you ten thousand pounds also he said to me you heard that that he didn't suppose i would do many more copies for one hundred pounds each i drew an inference and the whole cheque is accounted for suddenly frank looked away from craddock and glanced at charles nodding he's done he said as if some contest of boxing was in progress frank was right during the fall of these quiet words craddock had collapsed there was no more fight left in him he sat hunched up in his chair a mere inert mass with his eyes glazed and meaningless fixed on charles his mouth a little open and drooping the shame of what he had done had all these months left no trace on him but the shame of his detection was a vastly different matter but he made one more protest as forceless and unavailing as the last roll of a fish being pulled to land dead beat lies he said just once and was silent charles got quickly out of his chair and stood up pointing at him as yet he felt no spark of pity for him for there was nothing to pity in a man who with his last effort reiterates the denial of his shame and the tale of his indictment was not done yet he spoke with raised voice and vivid scorn you should know a lie when you hear it better than that he said do i sound as if i was lying did you lie like that when you lied about me to philip wroughton last autumn not you you let your damned poison just dribble from you you just hinted that i was a disreputable fellow not fit to associate with him and his you said it with regret oh i can hear you do it you felt you ought to tell him wasn't it like that go on tell me whether what i am saying now is lies too you can't you're done as frank said there's a limit even to your power of falsehood now sit there and just think over what's best to be done that's all you know it all now no word came from craddock he had sunk a little more into himself and his plump white hands hung ludicrously in front of him like the paws of a begging dog a wisp of his long black hair that crossed the crown of his head had fallen forward and lay stuck to the moisture on his forehead the two young men stood together away from him on the hearth rug looking at him and a couple of minutes passed in absolute silence then an impulse not yet compassionate for this collapsed rogue compassionate only for the collapse came to charles you had better have a drink he said it will do you good shall i get it for you he received no answer and went into the dining room next door the table was already laid for dinner and on the side board stood syphon and spirit decanter he poured out a stiff mixture and brought it back to him and then as he held it out to him and saw him take it in both his hands that even together were scarcely steady enough to carry it to his mouth pity awoke i'm awfully sorry you know mr craddock he said i hate it all it's a miserable business craddock made no answer but sip by sip he emptied the glass charles had brought him for a few minutes after that he sat with eyes shut but he smoothed his fallen lock of hair into its place again what do you mean to do either of you he asked charles nodded to frank to speak i don't know what charles means to do he said because we haven't talked it over for myself i mean to have back my contract with you or to see it destroyed when that is done i shall have nothing more to ask from you he thought a moment you mustn't do unfriendly things you know he said you mustn't systematically run down my work in your papers that wouldn't be fair i intend i may tell you to hold my tongue about you for the future i shan't i shan't even want to abuse you any more as for what i have heard about you in this last hour it is quite safe with me unless you somehow or other provoke me to mention it i just want my contract and then i shall have done with you craddock got up and unlocked a pigeon holed desk in the corner of the room there were a quantity of papers in it of these he took out one from the pigeon hole a another from that of l he glanced at these and handed one to each of the young men frank read carefully over what was written on his and then folded it up and put it in his pocket thank you that is all he said charles stood with his contract in his hand not glancing at it instead he looked at the large white faced man in front of him we have more to talk about he said shall we wouldn't it be better if we got it over at once if you wish i will come in later the uncontrolled irritability of nerves jangled and overstrung seized craddock for god's sake let us have finished with it now he said unless you've got some fresh excitement to spring on me what do you want me to do and why does he wait there he said pointing to frank charles nodded to frank i'll go then he said charles' anger and hot indignation had burned itself out of it there was nothing left but ashes grey feathery ashes not smouldering even any longer it was impossible to be angry with anything so abject as the man who sat inertly there it was impossible to feel anything but regret that he sat convicted of such pitiful fraud and falsity he saw only the wreck of a year's friendship the stricken corpse of his own gratitude and loyalty here was the man who had first believed in and befriended him and it was not in his nature to forget that it had so long been to him an ever present consciousness that it had become a permanent inmate of his mind present to him in idle hours but present most of all when he was at work and thus wrought into the web of his life and his passion in the extinction of his anger this reasserted itself again tarnished it might be and stained but existent and with that awoke pity sheer pity for the man who had made and marred it he waited till frank had closed the door it's wretched he said absolutely wretched even to craddock in the shame of his detection and in his miserable apprehension of what must yet follow the ring of sincerity was apparent it reached down to him in the inferno he had made for himself and the pity was without patronage it did not hurt thank you for that he said now tell me what you want done or perhaps you have done what you wanted already he broke off short and charles waited he guessed how terribly difficult any kind of speech must be there is just one thing i should like to tell you said craddock at length i i lied about you to philip wroughton but my object was not to injure you i didn't want to injure you but i guessed that you were in love with joyce i guessed also that she that she liked you you stood in my way perhaps my object was to reach her that is all there was no justification attempted it was a mere statement of fact he paused a moment but i was not sorry he said even when i found that i had not advanced my own suit i didn't seem to matter i suppose said charles in a sudden flash exactly that said craddock but i ask your forgiveness i always liked you charles did not answer at once because he did not know whether he forgave craddock or not certainly he did not want to injure him he felt he could go no further than that i intend to forgive you he said that will have to do even as he spoke all the innate generosity of the boy surged up in rebellion at this shabby speech and the shabbier hesitation of thought that had prompted it no that won't have to do he said quickly i should be ashamed to let that do forgive you why yes of course and now for the rest you owe mr wroughton five thousand pounds there is no reason i suppose why you should see him and explain i take it that you will send him his money is that so that shall be done right about me what you said about me i mean you must write to him i think you must withdraw what you said perhaps you had better do that at once yes charles got up i will go then he said my properties shall have left your studio by to morrow evening there is nothing more to settle i think he held out his hand goodbye he said i i can't forget we have been friends and i don't want to you have been awfully good to me in many ways i always told frank so goodbye craddock was perfectly capable indeed he had proved himself so of the depths of meanness and falsity but he was not in natural construction like the villain of melodrama who pursues his primrose path of nefarious dealing calm and well balanced without one single decent impulse to clog his tripping feet and when this boy for whose gifts he had so profound an admiration who knew the worst of him could not forget as he said that they had been friends he felt a pang of self abasement that shot out beyond the mire and clay in which his feet were set i wonder if you can possibly believe i am sorry he said i know it is a good deal to expect if that is so may i ask you as a favour which i should so much appreciate that you do not take your things away from my studio just yet anyhow won't you do that as a sign of your forgiveness i won't come there i won't bother you or embarrass you with the sight of me it isn't so very much to ask of you charles charles had an instinctive repulsion from doing anything of the sort he wanted to wash his hands clean of the man and of all that belonged to him or could awaken remembrance of him but on the other hand craddock was so down it was hardly possible to refuse so humble a petition besides he had said that he forgave him and if that was not fully and unreservedly done he might at least prop and solidify what he desired should be true in material and compassable ways his mind needed but a moment to make itself up but by all means if you wish he said i should be very glad to and perhaps soon not just yet but soon you will come and see my work if i ring you up do or when you feel you would like to see me again you will tell me goodbye craddock heard him go downstairs from frank's door and continue his journey not till then did he see that charles had left on the edge of the chimneypiece the contract concerning options which he had given him back for half a second the attitude of mind built and confirmed in him by the habit of years asserted itself and he would have put it back into the dark from which he had taken it half an hour ago but close on the heels of that came a more dominant impulse and he tore it to bits and threw the fragments into the fender then he sat down at his table drew out his cheque book and wrote a cheque payable to philip wroughton for five thousand pounds there was no difficulty about that mr ward's amazing friend who had carried off the complete nightmare decoration of post impressionists from the walls of thistleton's gallery had enabled his banking balance to withstand an even larger call on its substantiality than that but there was a letter to be written with it an hour later his servant came in to remind him that in half an hour he expected two friends to dinner already the waste paper basket was choked with ineffectual beginnings implying palliations where no palliation was possible telling half the truth and hinting at the rest and still craddock sat pen in hand as far as ever from accomplishing this epistolary effort and then an illuminating idea occurred to him he would state just what had happened neither more nor less saying it in the simplest possible manner it took him a full half hour always to dress for dinner but he was ready to receive guests who were almost meticulously punctual so short a time had his note taken him philip wroughton had become so he often said to himself and joyce a perfectly different man owing to his salutary wintering in egypt and in consequence thinking himself perhaps a differenter man than he really was had just been knocked flat by an attack of lumbago owing to a course of conduct that a few months ago he would have considered sheer insanity for one so physically handicapped as himself in consequence it was joyce's mission to take his letters and morning paper up to him after breakfast hear his account of himself and any fresh comments on the origin of this painful attack which had occurred to him during the night open his letters for him there was seldom more than one and entertain him with such news out of the paper as she thought would interest him to day the pain was a good deal better and he had remembered a new and daring action of his own which quite accounted for his trouble no doubt it was what i did on thursday evening he said for if you remember you called me to the window after dinner saying what a beautiful night it was and that the moon was full i am not blaming you my dear i only blame myself for my imprudence because if you remember i went out on the gravel path in thin evening shoes and dress clothes and stood there i daresay a couple of minutes i remember i felt a little chilly and i took a glass of hot whiskey and water before i went to bed i had already had a glass of port at dinner which in the old days was sufficient to give me a couple of days of rheumatism and the whiskey on the top was indeed enough to finish me off do you not think that it was that joyce sometimes i feel that you are not really interested in this sort of thing which means just heaven or hell to me i am sure if a mere look at the moon and a glass of whiskey and water without sugar put you on your back for three days in agony and sleeplessness i should show a little more curiosity about it but i suppose you are accustomed to my being ill it seems the natural state of things to you and i'm sure i don't wonder considering that for years that has been my normal condition well well open the paper and let us try to find there something which appeals to you more than your father's health aviation in france perhaps or the floods in the netherlands poor joyce had not at present had a chance of speaking but i am interested father she said and it was rather rash of you to take port and then a stroll at night and the whiskey i don't know what dr symonds will say to you if you tell him that particularly when you told him yesterday that it was the draught in church on sunday it all helps joyce said her father now contentedly embarked on the only interesting topic as dr symonds himself said these attacks are cumulative all the little pieces of unwisdom of which one is guilty add to the pile and at last nature revenges herself i wonder if coffee should go too i should miss my cup of coffee after dinner but i used to take it in egypt without the slightest hint of ill effects perhaps if i had saccharine instead of sugar i will ask dr symonds what letters are there for me only one i think it's from mr craddock philip wroughton frowned really what you told me when you came down from town yesterday about his slandering that young lathom he said seems to be quite upsetting if true if true certainly it took away my appetite for lunch at least if i had eaten my lunch i feel sure it would have disagreed and so briefly i left it but on thinking it over joyce i thought a great deal about it last night for i slept most indifferently i do not see why we should let it influence our bearing to craddock after all what has happened he said that young lathom was not a very nice young fellow and my mother has heard from his mother and his great friend that he is a very nice young fellow what would you expect his mother and his friend to say it is craddock's word against theirs as for flying out as you did into a state of wild indignation against craddock it was that which upset me for my lunch i feel convinced that is quite ludicrous and your grandmother's letter to me giving me what she called a piece of her mind i can only now i am better regard as the ravings of a very old and lunatic person and on the top of that tirade saying that she wishes to come down here next week and bring her precious young lathom with her luckily this attack gives me ample excuse for putting off a proposed visit from anybody you need only see them as much as you feel inclined said joyce on the contrary said philip with some excitement when one is ill and there are visitors in the house one is always meeting them when one does not want to as you know i do not take my hot bath till the middle of the morning i am sure to meet one or other of them in the passage and my mother invariably uses up all the hot water in the boiler it would all be very inconvenient besides as i say it was all hearsay about young lathom being not quite steady it is equally hearsay that he is he may be as steady as a rock or as unsteady as as that steamer from marseilles to port said for all i care but you acted on the report of his unsteadiness said joyce in not letting him come down to see his copy of your reynolds philip put a fretful hand to his face and closed his eyes you are very persistent and argumentative joyce he said and you know i am not up to these discussions and this morning only i was planning that as soon as i could move we would go and spend a fortnight at torquay i see they have been having a great deal of sunlight there pray let us not continue i think you said there was a letter from craddock to whom you never did justice you disappointed me very much and him too of course please take his letter and see what he has to say joyce tore open the envelope and took out the contents there seems to be a cheque enclosed she said philip raised himself in bed and put out his hand an unexpected cheque by post is a pleasant excitement to all but the most apathetic croesus give it me he said i wonder what that can be for he glanced at it good god how slow you are joyce he exclaimed read his letter i don't know what it means joyce read i enclose my cheque for five thousand pounds which is the balance of what i actually received from mr ward for your reynolds with regard to your subsequent proceedings i throw myself unreservedly on your mercy i have also to tell you that the statements i made to you about the character of charles lathom are entirely unfounded i unreservedly withdraw them philip made a quicker movement than he had done since am three mornings before the same being the moment when the lumbago stabbed him five thousand pounds he exclaimed why the man's a thief joyce five thousand pounds a liar too he acknowledges he told lies about that young lathom i've never had such a shock in my life and the interest on all this money doesn't he owe me that as well is it that he means by throwing himself on my mercy i am not sure that i am inclined to be merciful about that then he made an enormous concession joyce we must certainly show young lathom that why i am sitting quite upright in bed and felt nothing when i moved as i say young lathom must certainly be told that he may come down to see his copy it would not do to be less generous than craddock about that but i am very much shocked i hardly know what to say anyhow i will have my bath at once and you might look up the trains to torquay my dear your grandmother and young lathom must come down after we get back really even when i move i feel no pain at all only a little stiffness they say a great shock sometimes produces miraculous results joyce never quite determined the nature of this shock sometimes it seemed only reasonable to suppose it was the shock of joy at this unexpected and considerable sum of money sometimes she construed it into a shock of horror at this self revelation of their travelling companion but certainly the lumbago ceased from troubling and two days afterwards they started for torquay chapter x it was the day of the private view of the academy all morning and afternoon a continuous stream of public persons had been flowing in and out of the gates into piccadilly and the mysterious folk who tell the press who was there and how they were dressed and to whom they were seen talking must have had a busy day of it for everybody was very nicely dressed and was talking rather more excitedly than usual to everybody else in fact there was hubbub of a quite exceptional kind connected for once in a way with the objects which nominally brought these crowds together the crowd in fact was not so much excited with itself a habit universal in crowds as with something else indeed the sight of akroyd who had just been knighted talking to tranby who just hadn't roused far less attention than usual and all sorts of people whom he was accustomed to converse with on the day of the private view hurried by him as he stood in an advantageous position in front of an extremely royal canvas at the end of the third room catalogue in hand scrutinizing not him but the numbers affixed to the pictures for a little while he was inclined to consider that a tinge of jealousy perhaps or of natural diffidence more probably prompted these inexplicable slights but before long he became aware that there was something in the air besides himself opportunely enough craddock made his appearance at the moment and sir james annexed him something up something up is there craddock he asked yes many thanks my lady is very much pleased about it but surely there is an unusual animation how de do an unusual animation about us all this morning is it a picture or a potentate or a ballerina ah there is young armstrong armstrong i hope you will come to the hundredth night this evening i shall say something about you at the call no doubt your friends in front will demand you also frank looked craddock full in the face for a moment and decided to recognize him hullo craddock he said what'll you give me for my portrait or don't you do business in these sacred halls no i'm afraid no amount of demand will produce me this evening akroyd goodbye i'm going to stand by my portrait again it's the biggest lark out charles is up on top isn't he craddock charles certainly was up on top for it was he and he alone who was causing all this crowd to forget itself in its excitement about him and his work he had risen this new amazing star on the artistic horizon and all eyes were turned towards it in vain for the moment anyhow had mr hoskyns conceived and executed his last masterpiece angelic songs are welling in which a glory of evening sunlight fell through a stained glass window onto the profiled head of a girl with her mouth open sitting at an organ while four stupefied persons gazed heavily at her in a room consisting of marble and polished woodwork and mother of pearl in vain were acres of heather and highland cattle interspersed with birch trees and coffee brown burns in vain did the whole gamut of other portraits from staid railway directors in frock coats and maps spread on the table by them down to frisky blue and white youngest daughters of somebody esquire frown or smile or frolic on the walls there were just three focusses of interest one in the second room one here among the masterpieces of the masters a third in the room just beyond here was the portrait of the artist's mother in the room beyond mrs fortescue gallantly maintained her place by the presentment of herself and received congratulations in the second room frank scowled and wrestled with his play it was a boom in fact everybody wanted to see charles' pictures without delay and having done so told everybody else to go and do likewise craddock had made what is known as a good recovery after the painful operation recorded in the last chapter he had suffered it is true one relapse when on giving lady crowborough a choice of three nights on which to come to dine with him he had received a third person note regretting without cause assigned her inability to do so but it soon became apparent to him that nobody not even she had any intention of making the facts of his operation known to the world and with his recovery there had come to him a certain shame at what he had done true that shame was inextricably mixed with another and less worthy kinsman shame at his detection but it was there in its own right though no doubt detection had been necessary to bring it forth it had come anyhow cowering and crying into the world this morning more especially his shame grew and throve even as his recovery grew when he looked on those three superb canvases before which the whole world was agape there was little under the sun that he reverenced but his reverence was always ready to bow the knee before genius and it seemed to him that of all the low tricks that his greed or his selfishness had ever prevailed upon him to accomplish the lowest of all was when he let fall those little efficacious words about charles he had mocked and cheated the owner of the gift that compelled obeisance the gift to which he in all his tortuous spinnings had never failed in homage surrounded as these three stars were now with the smooth dark night so to speak of mere talent and more or less misplaced industry it was easier to judge of their luminous shining but he did not seek to excuse himself by any assurance of previous hesitation or doubt in his verdict of their quality he had known from the first when one summer morning close on a year ago he had stood by thorley weir that a star was rising he felt as if he had been picking velasquez' pocket and yet the temptation at the time had been very acute just as there was no mistaking charles' genius for any second rate quality so there had been no mistake in his telling himself that he had been in love with joyce when he had succeeded so easily and meanly for the time in removing from his path what undoubtedly stood materially in his way he had cleared the path for himself so he had hoped but the path when cleared led so far as he was concerned nowhere at all and he might just as well have left it cumbered to his passage and himself encumbered of his monstrous meanness joyce still stood impenetrably barred from him no longer only by the barrier he so rightly had conjectured to be there but by the fact of his own detection in its attempted removal but he had accepted the second rejection of himself as final and since his return from egypt had forbade himself to dally with the subject of domestic happiness consolation of all sorts could be brought to play like a hose on a burning place given time the most awkward wielder of it could not fail to quench the trouble and the house of life had many windows into which the sun shone without risk of provoking internal conflagrations only sometimes his subtly decorated and sumptuous flat seemed to him now a little lonely there was no longer any thought of a girl's presence abiding there turning it into that strange abode called home and there came there no longer that eager and divinely gifted boy whose growth during this last year had been a thing to love and wonder at he might have kept him that at any rate had been in his power instead he had grasped at a little more money which he did not except from habit want he had lied a little in the hope of entrapping that wild bird love and he had gained nothing whatever by it all a certain morality born perhaps of nothing higher than experience had in consequence begun to make itself felt in him the crowd surged and thickened about him and he found himself the bureau of a myriad of inquirers all this last winter and spring london had vaguely heard of this amazing young genius who was going to burst on the world and craddock in this room and mrs fortescue looking nearly as brilliant as her portrait in the next were seized on as fountains of original information elsewhere lady crowborough in a large shady hat trimmed with rosebuds and daisies could give news of her own portrait now approaching completion and mr ward who had marked down half a dozen pictures as suitable for his new york luxembourg followed faint but pursuing wherever he could get news of craddock having passed that way to tempt him with fresh offers for the mother portrait round that the crowd was thickest and there those who could see it were silent there were no epithets that seemed to be of any use in the presence of that noble simplicity and tenderness once in a shrill voice mr ward exclaimed well he's honoured his mother anyhow but even that though on the right lines savoured of inadequacy a fault to which she was mostly a stranger or now and then a critic would point out the wonderful modelling of the hand or the high light on the typewriter or even shrug a fastidious shoulder and wonder whether the quality of the brush work was such but for the greater part there was not much talking just in front of it somehow it lived to criticise or appreciate was like making personal remarks to its face it took hold of you you did not want to talk charles had not intended to appear on this day of private view but considering how deep and true was the knowledge that his portrait showed of his mother it was strange that it had not occurred to him that it was absolutely certain that she would insist on going herself and would not dream of considering any escort but his she called for him in fact at his studio about twelve dressed and eager with anticipation and charles had the sense not to waste time in expostulation over so pre ordained a fact as he now perceived his visit to be but accepted the inevitable and put on his best clothes while his mother brushed his hat it was thus about a quarter to one when the galleries were most crowded and the ferment over the three portraits was at its highest that they entered probably until that moment there were scarce fifty people out of all the multitude who knew charles by sight scarce five who knew his mother but even as they went their way up the steps and met the opposing crowd of out goers she was aware of eager unusual glances directed at her she heard little whispered conversations beginning why surely she knew that people stopped and looked after them as she passed and all the exultant pride uprose triumphant and laughing in the sheer joy of its happiness even as when first she knew she had borne a child vague and wild were the conjectures at first but every chattering group that passed them recognising suddenly confirmed it and from conjecture she passed to knowledge why did they all stare at her with her quiet unremarkable face who always passed about so private and unobserved unless something had happened to make her thus suddenly recognised and stared at she cared not at all for the little accesses of shyness and timidity that kept breaking over her making her sweet pale face flush like a girl's for all her conscious self was drowned and forgotten in her son in him who in an hour had caused her face to be famous and familiar and how she longed that no inkling of this might reach charles so that her triumph might be prolonged and magnified how she encouraged him to consult his catalogue and tell her who this picture and that was by fixing his attention by all means in her power on anything rather than the crowds that more and more openly stared and whispered about her well she knew that if once he guessed the cause of the whispers and glances a horror stricken face and flying coat tails would be the last she would see of him for the recognition of her she saw just led to the recognition of him and with ears pricked and eager she could catch the sequels that must be he what a handsome boy but surely he's so young it was sweeter than honey and the honeycomb they had passed in through the sculpture gallery into the third room where as she knew her own portrait hung and with infinite craft prolonging the time she had immediately caught sight of something on the opposite wall that claimed her instant attention from one picture she passed to another and furtively saw how dense a crowd was congregated on the other side of the room and knew what it was that so absorbed them and charles was getting interested now in showing her what he had seen on that his first historic varnishing day and was eager with speech and pointed finger look at that sargent he said it makes you hate to look at that sunshine how on earth does he do it isn't it magic just blue and yellow same as we've all got in our paint boxes but he sees so splendidly that's half the battle seeing this was capital at this rate her triumph would last all up the long wall round the top of the room and nearly half way down the other alas it was already nearly over charles looked up and saw the mass of people round the place where undoubtedly his picture was let's go and look at you mother he said as you said you wanted to see it hanging i say what a lot of people there are there's a gorgeous thing of lavery's hanging next it it was rather bad luck that on me though it's a miracle getting on to that wall at all come across we'll get that over and then can enjoy the rest they crossed the room and wedged themselves into the inter shouldered crowd very slowly indeed those in front of them cleared away and at length they stood opposite it then as they looked those round them recognizing her and making the infallible guess at charles' identity stood a little back for them and still a little more back charles still childlikely unconscious was intent on his picture's neighbours his mother knew exactly what was happening and despite herself felt a gathering dimness in her eyes in all her tale of unselfish years she had never felt so big with personal pride into which not one atom of self entered well if you've finished looking at yourself mother dear said he in rather a high voice he turned and horror glazed his eyes it was quite impossible to mistake what that half circle of pleasant well dressed folk were staring at not the picture's neighbours not his picture itself this moment for heaven's sake let's get out of this he said blushing furiously and the knot of people round his picture turned smiling and pleased at the boy's modesty and the mother's superb pride charles in his retreat with his mother in his wake ran straight into craddock this was no great embarrassment for craddock had been to the studio not long before also his mother knew nothing except that charles a month ago had been greatly upset in connection with craddock she might have guessed more but charles had told her no word and at the moment in his confusion any known face was a harbour of refuge hullo mr craddock he said my mother wanted to come and look at herself so i brought her here she is what a jolly show craddock made his answer to mrs lathom are you proud he said are you more than proud satisfied she shook hands with him i am even that she said and what am i to do with this foolish boy lead him about show him to everybody he has got to get used to it i expected a great deal myself but i have yet to get used to this charles' eyes went back to the crowd in front of his picture again what has happened he asked is it do you mean it's a huge success huge you know walk up and down again with your mother my dear fellow and judge charles became wild eyed again but it's a dream he said it's oh lady crowborough lady crowborough was sufficiently moved to recognize craddock how de do mr craddock she said well charles my dear you've gone and done it there ain't an artist here but what's cursing you there never was such a private view and i've seen somewhere about eighty of them now i'm going to have my lunch there's nobody as can say a sensible word this morning all along of your pictures and don't you forget to be at paddington in good time to morrow afternoon for the train down to thorley and if you get there before me lay hold of an empty carriage and put the windows tight up charles was instantly and completely diverted by this new topic oh mr wroughton does expect me he asked yes he told me to tell you and if you find you're enjoying yourself we'll stop over till tuesday i hate those saturday to monday things running away again before you get your boxes unpacked i daresay you'll find enough to amuse you till tuesday you can bring down your paint box if you want something to occupy you and make a drawing of me or my maid or joyce or something and with a very broad grin on her face she moved away frank descended next on them libel action imminent charles he said looking firmly at craddock this he found inevitable i've been standing in front of my portrait for an hour and listening two timid little people come up to it and say 'good gracious what a dreadful looking young man who is it turn up a hundred and seventy five jane' 'sunrise on the alps it can't be youngest daughter of lady jellicoe no a hundred and seventy five oh mr frank armstrong is it fancy and we liked easter eggs so much' i'll have damages for that sort of thing you've spoiled my public lord if i had wished to libel you said charles i wouldn't have let you off like that your mother too said frank why it's the kid seething its mother in its own vitriol i haven't seen it yet i was too occupied libellous fellow what does she say to it all mrs lathom turned to him she doesn't say much mr frank she said but but she's having rather a happy morning well then take me to have a look at you and i'll take you to have a look at me after that charles' brass band which i've ordered will be ready 'see the conquering' you know charles lingered with craddock now tell me really he said without chaff i mean like lady crowborough and frank they have told you really he said if you want it in other words say that your price for a full length is a thousand pounds that's practical isn't it charles shook his head but i still don't understand he said then all the boyish spirits surged high high too surged all his true artistic ambitions and passions rising to that splendid point of humility which must always accompany triumphant achievement and its recognition the utter surprise and the shock of this last quarter of an hour which had unsteadied and bewildered him cleared away what had happened began to be real but what gorgeous fun he cried and how i must work there's everything to learn yet craddock wondered whether he would find at thorley that which should be the centre and the sun of his wakening almost he hoped that he would for so radiant a completeness burned envy away or at the most left a little negligible dross joyce a centre sun loving and loved and her lover this splendid star with that inspiring bliss what was there that this young hand and eager eye might not see and accomplish the love of a son for his mother the comradeship of a friend the mere presence of a pretty woman a brother's well made limbs in act to spring had been sufficient to bring forth the work of just one astounding year what when the love light of man and woman flashed back and forth between him and the exquisite girl down by the riverside might that not open a new chapter in the history and records of the beautiful it did not seem to him an outrageous fantasy to imagine that the possibility was a real one it was seldom that those who were to travel with lady crowborough were privileged to reach the appointed station before her arrival for no amount of contrary experience convinced her that trains were not capable of starting half an hour or so before their appointed times also she liked to get a carriage to herself and dispose on all available seats so enormous a quantity of books parasols cloaks rugs and handbags that the question whether all these seats were taken could scarcely be ventured on so heavily and potently were they occupied consequently on the next afternoon charles found her already in possession with the windows tightly shut and a perfect bale of morning and evening papers by her she had bought in fact a copy of every paper published that day as far as she could ascertain with the object of utterly overwhelming philip with all the first notices of the academy in order to impress him as by a demonstration in force with charles' immensity she had attempted to read some of these herself but being unused to artistic jargon had made very little of them still there could be no doubt as to what they meant to convey that's right my dear she said as he appeared and jump in quick for though there's time yet you never can tell when they won't slide you out of the station clear a place for yourself and then we'll both sit and look out of the window and they'll take us for a couple on their honeymoon and not dream of coming in if they've any sense of what's right and when we've started you can read all about yourself and it's likely you'll find a lot you didn't know before i can't make head or tail of it all they talk of keys of colour and tones and what not as if you'd been writing a bundle of music and leit motif what's a leit motif they'll say your pictures are nothing but a lot of accidentals next chords and harmonies indeed as if you'd put a musical box in the frames there's that craddock got a column and a half about your keys and what not but i was so pleased yesterday i had to pass the time of day with him but what have you bought all these papers for asked charles oh yes here's craddock don't you mind him why to let philip see what they all think of you but that's my affair my dear i'm going to stuff them under his nose one after the other you'll see and there we are off now don't expect me to talk in the train you just read about yourself and if you see me nodding let me nod there's half an hour yet before we need be thinking of putting my things together great heat had come with the opening of may and spring was riotous in field and hedgerow with glory of early blossom and valour of young leafage all this last month charles had been town tied among the unchanging bloomlessness of brick and stone and pavement it had scarcely seemed to him that winter was overpast and the time for buds and birds had come already on the lawn by the water side the summer batswing tent had been set up and across the grass joyce and the unbrothered huz came to meet them with a smile and a tail of welcome a faint smell of eucalyptus had been apparent as they passed through the house and lady crowborough drew an unerring conclusion well joyce my dear here we are she said and i won't ask after your father because i'll bet that he has got a cold i smelt his stuff the moment i set foot in the house yes darling grannie said joyce but it's not very bad he's really more afraid of having one than than it how are you mr lathom lady crowborough's maid was standing a little way behind looking like tweedledum prepared for battle so encompassed was she by a mass of miscellaneous objects prominent among them was the file of to day's papers you'll find out how he is my dear said lady crowborough when you've dipped into that little lot he's just a grand piano of keys and harmonies ah i read the notice in the 'daily review' said joyce i was so pleased i long to see your pictures well then you'll have to wait your turn my dear said lady crowborough we all took our turns like a peep show drat that dog he's always licking my hand now take me and give me my tea at once and then he'll get something else to lick are we to see your father yes he's coming down to dinner if he feels up to it shall we have tea in the tent well it ain't so cold for the country said lady crowborough as if the arctic region began at the four mile radius it's broiling grannie and do you want quite all those cushions and wraps they'll hardly go into the tent yes i want them every one and i want my tea after my journey go back to the house charles my dear and tell them to bring it out she waited till charles had passed beyond earshot on his errand now joyce she said i don't want to see any fiddle faddling between that boy and you and talking about the moon and the stars and mr browning's poetry and what not as if that had anything to do with it grannie darling said joyce with an agonized look at tweedledum she don't hear said lady crowborough who could hear through that lot of cushions and veils and what i say to you joyce i'm going to say to him joyce grew suddenly grave oh indeed you mustn't do anything of the kind grannie said she why how could i look him in the face and have a moment's ease with him if i thought you had lady crowborough's face smiled all over very well then she said i don't want you not to look at the face but you take my advice joyce lord if i were seventy years younger i'd take it myself in less than a jiffy you make up your mind you're going to have him and let there be no nonsense about it mercy on us all girls get red in the face and look away and think one's a shocking old woman when one advises them to do exactly what they want to do you keep all the stuff about the moon and poetry till afterwards my dear it'll serve to talk about then only i expect you'll find you've plenty else to say he's a nice clean clever young fellow with a good head and a good heart and they're not too many of that sort going about lord you should have seen all the girls and women too staring at him yesterday at the picture show i thought somebody would catch him up and marry him under my very nose they'll be at him now like wasps round a jam pot but you get in first my dear and we'll put the lid on well here he comes don't you look shocked i've talked very good sense you haven't got a mother but if you had she'd tell you just the same with no end of beautiful words scattered about like the flowers on a dinner table just to hide the victuals as she always did but the victuals are there just the same it wouldn't be much of a dinner without 'em any intercourse flippant or nugatory or concerned with what lady crowborough summed up under the head of the moon and mr browning's poetry is sufficient cover for the hidden approach of two souls that are stealing towards each other any channel sufficient to conduct the conveyance of such streams and when not long after lady crowborough left them to go indoors to make her salutations to philip and get out of the nasty damp draught that was blowing up from the river it was under the most insignificant of shelter that they crept nearer ever nearer but for they talked over the happenings little and not so little that concerned them jointly in the past it was as if they gathered in the store that should so soon burst the doors of its granary or sat telling their beads in some hushed sacred place before it blazed out into lights and music and banners all this was below as leaven secretly working on the surface a boy and girl by the thames side talked as comrades talk with laughter and unembarrassed pauses wonder if it'll be a june like last year said charles sliding from his chair onto the grass i was camped up there half a mile away for three weeks of it and there was never a drop of rain oh except one night for half an hour it smelt so good i know the best watering carts in a dusty street said she you were doing that picture of the weir and your brother and then one afternoon you punted up with craddock and that's how it all began all what asked joyce knowing he could give only one answer but longing for the other answer my career large c said charles with pomp he came and bought the picture next morning i couldn't believe it at first i thought i thought he was a fairy mr craddock does not answer my idea of a fairy said joyce after a little consideration oh you left out about reggie isn't he reggie trying to make an omelette and succeeding only in producing a degraded glue i don't think i noticed that said charles looking at her no you were staring at us as if we were all fairies oh but you did notice it it made you laugh and me too charles went back to a previous topic no strictly speaking he isn't a fairy he said at least not completely but it was a fairylike proceeding oh yes grant him something fairylike he got me the commission to copy your reynolds and he started me on my feet and believed in me i found him a fairy for for quite a long time of course there are bad fairies as well said joyce conceding the point yes do you mind my asking you one thing did you ever of course not said joyce what on earth do you think of me but you don't know what yes i do i never never believed one word does that show you talk about something else i don't want to be sick on such a lovely evening charles relapsed into laughter isn't it so distressing on a wet day he asked no do you know i think what he did to father about the picture wasn't nearly so bad that only made me feel rather unwell have you seen him since you knew about it all charles made a little conflagration of dry leaves with the match he had just lit before he answered yes once or twice he said i'm rather ashamed of not having seen him oftener i believe he was sorry and if people are sorry well it's all over isn't it what a painfully noble sentiment said joyce but i don't think i should caress a scorpion however grief stricken besides how can you say that it's all over just because a person is sorry he has become to you a different person if you find out he has done something mean something something like that not that i thought very much of mr craddock before she added well i did said charles don't bias me said joyce she was silent a moment in a way an injury done to oneself is easier to forgive than an injury done to somebody else she began charles rudely interrupted painfully noble sentiment he enquired yes perhaps it was let us be careful we might die in the night if we became more edifying and the real point is that mr craddock's little plot didn't come off said he at least that seems to me the most important thing for a moment their eyes met and for that moment the huge underlying reality came close to the surface she smiled and nodded her assent to this leave it there she said and then where were we o yes then you came to copy the reynolds up in my room do you remember and dear old buz lay on the sofa and got worse and worse she leaned back in her chair so that he could not see her face oh what a coward i was she said i knew there was only one thing i could do for him poor darling and yet i let you do it instead of me well there was no delay said charles it was done oh but you understand better than that she said it was i who failed now that's a thing hard to forgive oneself i loved buz best it was my privilege to help him in the only way possible yes i know the thing in itself was nothing just to press a syringe but there was the principle behind it don't you see of course you do that i threw love's right away and i don't believe i ever thanked you for picking it up so to speak but i was grateful charles' little conflagration had burned itself out poor buz he said joyce sat up he didn't have such a bad time she said though why i expect you to be interested in buz i really don't know but i've confessed i always rather wanted to confess that to you penance i think a turn in the punt might do you good said he especially if i take the pole that for the present was the end of anything serious charles exhibited the most complicated incompetence as regards propulsion though as a piece of aquatic juggling his performance was supreme joyce told him how to stand and like that he stood and the juggling began he thrust his pole into the water and it stuck fast he pulled hard at it and the punt went a little backwards but a second wrench landed a chunk of mud and water weed on his trousers he pushed again this time with so firm and vigorous a stroke that they flew into mid stream and only by swift antic steps in the direction of the stern did he recover balance and pole once again he pushed this time in unfathomable water plunged his arm up to the shoulder in the astonished flood and fell in an entangled heap of arms and legs on the top of the stupefied huz are we going up or down the river asked joyce charles looked wildly round the bows of the punt seemed if anything to be pointing down stream down he said the punt thought not it yawed in a slow half circle and directed itself up stream that is down stream isn't it said he and they slowly slid into the bank a swift circular motion began and a fool hardy swan coming within range narrowly escaped decapitation then lady crowborough having made her visit appeared at the edge of the lawn and charles rashly promised to pick her up but they moved westward instead into the crimson pools of reflected sunset joyce had never ached so much in all her healthy life yet even these inanities brought them nearer love has a use for laughter six months ago on an evening of gale and autumn storm when the chimneys smoked and the rain made fierce tattoo on the streaming window panes joyce had gone up to her bedroom leaving her father and another guest together and had felt some wild primaeval instinct stirring in her blood that made her long to go out alone into the blackness and hurly burly of the streaming heavens to be herself solitary and unencumbered by the presence and subtle silent influence of others and to night when she and lady crowborough left philip and charles talking together philip's cold had miraculously almost encouraged by eucalyptus vanished altogether she again felt herself prey to the same desire but to night it was no pall of streaming blackness that drew her but the still starry twilight and the warm scents of spring but now even as then she wanted to be alone hidden and unsuspected in the deep dusk of the star shine to wander through the fresh fallen dew in the meadows to finger the new leaves on riverside willows to lie perhaps face downwards in the growing hay fields to listen to the mysterious noises of the night to learn to learn what she did not know or at any rate did not formulate the answer but it was something that the dark and the spring time were ready to tell her something that concerned the spirit of life that kept the world spinning on its secular journey and made bright the eyes of the wild creatures of the wood and set the rose a budding and made in her the red blood leap on its joyous errands surely somehow in the dark of the spring night she could link the pulse that beat in her with the great indwelling rhythm of the world make herself realise that all was one she and the singing bird whose time was come and the rose that tingled on its stem with the potential blossoms she had taken off her dinner dress and put on a dressing gown and now blowing out her light she went across to her open window drew up the blind and leaned out into the night and then in a flash of newly awakened knowledge she was aware that she wanted to be alone no longer she wanted a teacher who also would learn with her one more human than the star light and dearer to her heart than the fragrant hay fields but leaning out into the dark she was nearer him than in the house and she opened her heart it stood wide just below her the gravel path that bordered the lawn was illuminated by the light that came in yellow oblongs of glow from the long windows of her father's study she heard some little stir of movement below the sound of voices dim and unintelligible inside and presently after the tread of a foot step on the stairs and so along the passage past her room where her father slept then the window below was thrown open and charles stepped out onto the gravel like her perhaps he felt the call of the night she wondered if like her he needed more than the night could give him she could look out without risk of detection from outside her window would appear a mere black hole in the wall he paused a moment and then strolled onto the dewy lawn and as he walked away towards the river she heard him whistle softly to himself the song he had sung last year to his guitar see the chariot at hand here of love joyce lay long awake when she got to bed not tossing nor turning nor even desiring sleep but very quiet with wide open eyes she did not seem to herself to be thinking at all it was no preoccupation that kept her awake she but lived and breathed was part of the spring night but it seemed to her that she had never been alive till then sometimes for a little while she dozed nonsense of some sort began to stir in her brain but the drowsy moments were no more than moments from the stable clock not far away she heard the faint clanging of the hours and half hours which seemed to follow very rapidly the one after the other by her dressing table in the window there came a very faint light through the unblinded casement from the remote noon day of the shining stars the rest of the room was muffled in soft darkness then she missed the sound of one half hour and when she woke again the light in her room was changed already the faint illumination by the window had spread over the rest of it and there was a more conspicuous brightness on the table that stood there then from outside she heard the first chirruping of one bird and the light grew a light hueless and colourless a mere mixture of white with the dark more birds joined voices to the first heard in the earliest welcome of the day and a breeze set some tendril of creeper tapping at her panes colour began to steal into the hueless light she could guess there in the east were cloud wisps that caught the morning joyce got out of bed and went to the window and the lure of the sunrise irresistibly beckoned her out the message the night had seemed to hold for her though contradicted afterwards had been authentically transmitted to the dawn something certainly called her now she dressed herself quickly in some old boating costume went quietly along the passage and down stairs at the foot huz was sleeping but awoke at her step and found it necessary to give a loud and joyful bark of welcome it seemed to him an excellent plan to go out she crossed the lawn with her dog for the river seemed to beckon and would have taken her canoe except that that meant that huz must be left behind she did not want huz but huz wanted and she stepped into the punt that puzzled victim of charles' aimlessness and pushed off the boom of thorley weir that or was it something else about thorley weir determined her direction and she slid away upstream it was still not yet the hour of sunrise and she would be at the weir before that a few minutes before charles had wakened also he too had slept but little and his awaking was sudden he felt as if some noise had roused him the shutting of a door perhaps or the barking of a dog the early light that preceded dawn was leaking into his room and he got out of bed to draw up the blind the magic of the hour breeze of morning chirruping of birds seized and held him and into his mind brighter than the approaching dawn there came flooding back all that had kept sleep from him sleep was far away again now and the morning beckoned he dressed and went out and it was in his mind to wrestle with the punt perhaps to spring on joyce a mysteriously acquired adeptness and then suddenly he saw that steps had preceded him across the lawn wiping away the dew and his heart leaped could it be she who had passed that way already would they meet and his heart hammered in his throat in this pearly and sacred hour when only the birds were awake it was not quite sunrise yet should day and another day lit by the dawn that from everlasting had moved the sun and the stars dawn together but where had she gone where should he seek and find her the punt was gone the canoe lay tapped by the ripples from the mill stream right or left down stream or up then the boom of thorley weir decided him that or something else some quivering line that she had left to guide him the imperfect chirrupings were forming themselves into actual song on the smooth flowing river reflections of the blue above began to stain the grey steel colour and the willow leaves were a quiver with the breeze of morning he hardly noticed these things as he plied his paddle round bend and promontory of the stream louder sounded the boom of the outpoured weir and the last corner was turned and on the spit of land where a year ago his tent had been pitched stood joyce she had just tied her punt to the bank and stood looking up towards the weir itself huz was by her and hearing the splash of the paddle turned and waved a welcoming tail that beat against joyce's skirt at that she turned also and saw him but she gave him no word of welcome nor did he speak to her in silence he ran the boat into the soft ground beside the punt and stepped ashore he had left his coat in the canoe and came towards her hatless like herself bare armed to the elbow she looked at him still silent yet flooding him with her self and his own identity his very self and being seemed to pass utterly away from him he was conscious of nothing more than her it had to be like this he said joyce joyce still she did not answer but quivering a little bent towards him as a young tree leans before the wind then her lips parted oh charles she said have you come to me i was waiting for you

impressionable but some more than others and these first express them this explains the curious temporaneousness of inventions and discoveries the truth is in the air and the most impressionable brain will announce it first but all will announce it a few minutes later so women as most susceptible are the best index of the coming houremerson chapter i the day preceding beths birth was a grey day a serene grey day awesome with a certain solemnity and singularly significant to those who seek a sign there is a quiet mood an inner calm to which a grey day adds peculiar solace it is like the relief which follows after tears when hope begins to revive and the warm blood throbs rebelliously to be free of the shackles of grief a certain heaviness still lingers but only as a luxurious languor which is a pleasure in itself in other moods however in pain in doubt in suspense the grey day deepens the depression of the spirits and also adds to the sense of physical discomfort mrs caldwell looking up at noon from the stocking she was mending and seeing only a slender strip of level gloom above the houses opposite suddenly experienced a mingled feeling of chilliness and dread and longed for a fire although the month was june she could not afford fires at that time of year yet she thought how nice it would be to have one and the more she thought of it the more chilly she felt a little comfort of the kind would have meant so much to her that morning she would like to have felt it right to put away the mending sit by a good blaze with a book and absorb herself in somebody elses thoughts for her own were far from cheerful she was weak and ill and anxious the mother of six children already and about to produce a seventh on an income that would have been insufficient for four it was a reckless thing for a delicate woman to do but she never thought of that she lived in the days when no one thought of the waste of women in this respect and they had not begun to think for themselves what she suffered she accepted as her lot or the will of godthe expression varied with the nature of the trouble extreme pain was the will of god but minor discomforts and worries were her lot that much of the misery was perfectly preventable never occurred to her and if any one had suggested such a thing she would have been shocked the parson in the pulpit preached endurance and she understood that anything in the nature of resistance any discussion even of social problems would not only have been a flying in the face of providence but a most indecent proceeding she knew that there was crime and disease in the world but there were judges and juries to pursue criminals doctors to deal with diseases and the clergy to speak a word in season to all from the murderer on the scaffold to the maid who had misconducted herself there was nothing eccentric about mrs caldwell she accepted the world just as she found it and was satisfied to know that effects were being dealt with causes she never considered because she knew nothing about them but she was ill at ease that morning and did think it rather hard that she should not have had time to recover from her last illness she acknowledged to herself that she was very weak that it was hard to drag the darningneedle through that worn stocking and oh dear the holes were so many and so big that week and there were such quantities of other things to be done clothes mended and made for the children besides household matters to be seen to generally why wasnt she strong that was the only thing she repined about poor woman her want of physical strength she would work until she dropped however and mortal man could expect no more of her she assured herself with a sigh of satisfaction in anticipation of the inevitable event which would lay her by and so release her from all immediate responsibility worn and weary working mothers often uncomplaining victims of the cruelest exactions toilers whose days work is never done no wonder they welcome even the illness which enforces rest in bed the one holiday that is ever allowed them mrs caldwell thought again of the fire and the book she had read a good deal at one time and had even been able to play and sing and draw and paint with a dainty touch but since her marriage the many children the small means and the failing strength had made all such pursuits an impossible luxury the fire and the bookwho knows what they might not have meant what a benign difference the small relaxation allowed to the mother at this critical time might not have made in the temperament of the child perhaps if we could read the events even of that one day aright we should find in them the clue to all that was inexplicable in its subsequent career in deciding that she could not afford a fire for herself mrs caldwell had glanced round the room and noticed that the whisky bottle on the sideboard was all but empty she got up hastily and went into the kitchen i had quite forgotten the whisky she said to the maidofallwork who was scraping potatoes at the sink your master will be so put out if there isnt enough you must go at once and get somesix bottles bring one with you and let them send the rest the girl turned upon her with a scowl and whos to do my dinner she demanded ill do what i can mrs caldwell answered the servant threw the knife down on the potatoes and turned from the sink sullenly wiping her hands on her apron as she went mrs caldwell rolled up her sleeves and set to work but awkwardly household work comes naturally to many educated women they like it and they do it well but mrs caldwell was not one of this kind she was not made for labour but for luxury her hands and arms both delicately beautiful in form and colour alone showed that her whole air betokened gentle birth and breeding she looked out of place in the kitchen and it was evident that she could only acquit herself well among the refinements of life she set to work with a will however for she had the pluck and patience of ten men she peeled vegetables chopped meat fetched water carried coals to mend the fire did all that had to be done to the best of her ability although she had to cling many times to table or chair or dresser to recover from the exertion and brace herself for a fresh attempt when she had done in the kitchen she went to the diningroom and laid the cloth the sulky servant did not hurry back she had a trick of lingering long on errands and when at last she did appear she brought no whisky theyre going to send it she explained they promised to send it at once but i told you to bring a bottle mrs caldwell exclaimed stamping her foot imperiously the girl walked off to the kitchen and slammed the door mrs caldwells forehead was puckered with a frown but she got out the mending again and sat down to it in the diningroom with dogged determination presently there was a step outside she looked up and listened the front door opened her worn face brightened backache and weariness were forgotten her husband had come home and it was as if the clouds had parted and the sun shone forth she looked up brightly to greet him youve got your work over early today she said i have he answered drily without looking at her the smile froze on her lips he had come back in an irritable mood he went to the sideboard when he had spoken and poured himself out a stiff glass of whiskyandwater which he carried to the window where he stood with his back to his wife looking out he was a short man who made an instant impression of light eyes in a dark face you would have looked at him a second time in the street and thought of him after he had passed so striking was the peculiar contrast his features were european but his complexion and his soft glossy black hair curling close and crisp to the head betrayed a dark drop in him probably african in the west indies he would certainly have been set down as a quadroon there was no record of negro blood in the family however no trace of any ancestor who had lived abroad and the three moors heads with ivory rings through their noses which appeared in one quarter of the scutcheon were always understood by later generations to have been a distinction conferred for some special butcherybusiness among the saracens mrs caldwell glanced at her husband as he stood with his back to her in the window and then went on with the mending patiently waiting till the mood should have passed off or she should have thought of something with which to beguile him when he had finished the whiskyandwater he turned and looked at her with critical disapprobation i wonder why it is when a woman marries she takes no more pains with herself he ejaculated when i married you you were one of the smartest girls i ever saw it would be difficult to be smart just now she answered he made a gesture of impatience but why should a woman give up everything when she marries you had more accomplishments than most of them and now all you do it seems to me is the mending the mending must be done she answered deprecatingly and im not very strong im not able to do everything i would if i could there was a wild stampede at this moment the four elder children had returned from school and the two younger ones from a walk with their nurse and now burst into the room in wild spirits demanding dinner it was the first bright moment of the morning for their mother but her husband promptly spoilt her pleasure sit down at table he roared and dont let me hear another word from any of you a man comes home to be quiet and this is the kind of thing that awaits him the children shrank to their places abashed while their mother escaped to the kitchen to hurry the dinner the formor farceof grace was gone through before the meal commenced the children ate greedily but were obediently silent all the little confidences and remarks which it would have been so healthy for them to make and so good for their mother to hear had to be suppressed and the silence and constraint made everyone dyspeptic the dinner consisted of only one dish a hash which mrs caldwell had made because her husband had liked it so much the last time they had had it he turned it over on his plate now however ominously blaming the food for his own want of appetite mrs caldwell knew the symptoms and sighed i cant eat this stuff he said at last pushing his plate away from him theres a pudding coming his wife replied oh a pudding he exclaimed i know what our puddings are why arent women taught something sensible whats the use of all your accomplishments if you cant cook the simplest dish what a difference it would have made to my life if you had been able to make pastry even mrs caldwell thought of the time she had spent on her feet in the kitchen that morning doing her best and she also thought how easy it would have been for him to marry a woman who could cook if that were all he wanted but she had no faint glimmering conception that it was unreasonable to expect a woman of her class to cook her dinner as well as eat it one servant is not expected to do anothers work in any establishment but a mother on a small income the most cruelly tried of women is too often required to be equal to anything mrs caldwell said nothing however she belonged to the days when a wifes meek submission to anything a man chose to say made nagging a pleasant relaxation for the man and encouraged him to persevere until he acquired a peculiar ease in the art and spoilt the tempers of everybody about him the arrival of the family doctor put an end to the scene mrs caldwell told the children to run away and her husbands countenance cleared glad to see you gottley he said what will you have oh nothing thank you i cant stay a moment i just looked in to see how mrs caldwell was getting on oh shes all right her husband answered for her cheerfully how are you all especially miss bessie ha ha said the old gentleman sitting down by the table that reminds me im not on good terms with bessie this morning im generally careful you know but it seems i said something disrespectful about a christian brothera christian brother mind youand ive been had up before the family tribunal for blasphemy and condemned to everlasting punishment lordbut mark my words he exclaimed emphatically a time will come when every schoolgirl will see what my life is made a burden to me for seeing now the absurdity of the whole religious superstition o doctor mrs caldwell cried surely you believe in god god has not revealed himself to me madam i know nothing about him the old gentleman answered gently ah there you know you are wrong gottley mr caldwell chimed in and then he proceeded to argue the question the old doctor being in a hurry said little in reply and when he had gone mrs caldwell exclaimed with wifely tact well i think you had the best of that well i think i had poor old buffer her husband answered complacently his temper restored by the way ive brought in the last number of dickens shall i read it to you her face brightened yes do she rejoined one moment till jane has done clearing the table heres your chair and she placed the only easy one in the room for him in the best light these readings were one of the joys of her life he read to her often and read exceedingly well books were the bond of union between them the prop and stay of their married life poor as they were they always managed to find money for new ones which they enjoyed together in this way intellectuality balanced the morbid irritability of the husbands temperament and literature made life tolerable to them both as nothing else could have done as he read now his countenance cleared and his imaginary cares fell from him while his wifes very real ones were forgotten as she listened and there was a blessed truce to trouble for a time unfortunately however as the reading proceeded he came to a rasping bit of the story which began to grate upon his nerves the first part had been pleasurably exciting but when he found the sensation slipping from him he thought to stay it with a stimulant and went to the sideboard for the purpose mrs caldwells heart sank the whisky bottle was all but empty oh damn it he exclaimed banging it down on the sideboard and i suppose there is none in the house there never is any in the house no one looks after anything my comfort is never considered it is always those damned children henry his wife protested but she was too ill to defend herself further what a life for a man he proceeded stuck down in this cursed hole without a congenial soul to speak to in or out of the house that is a cruel thing to say henry she remonstrated with dignity well i apologise he rejoined ungraciously but you must confess that i have some cause to complain he was standing behind her as he spoke and she felt that he eyed her the while with disapproval of her appearance and anger at her condition she knew the look only too well poor soul and her attitude was deprecating as she sat there gazing up pitifully at the strip of level greyness above the houses opposite she said nothing however only rocked herself on her chair and looked forlornly miserable seeing which brought his irritation to a climax he flung the book across the room but even in the act his countenance cleared he was standing in the window and caught a glimpse of bessie gottley who was passing at the moment on the opposite side of the road and looked across at him smiling and nodding invitingly mrs caldwell saw the pantomime and her heart contracted with a pang when she saw how readily her husband responded it was hard that the evil moods should not be conquered for her as well as for bessie gottley bridget came in just then bringing the belated whisky oh you did order it he graciously acknowledged why didnt you say so he opened the bottle and poured some out for himself heres to the moonfaced bessie he said jocularly mrs caldwell went on with the mending her husband began to walk up and down the room in a good humour again he walked peculiarly more on his toes than his heels with an odd little spring in each step as if it were the first step of a dance this springiness gave to his gait a sort of buoyancy which might have seemed natural to him if exaggerated in his youth but had the air of an affectation in middle life as if it were part of an assumption of juvenility wont you go on with the reading his wife said at last his restlessness worried her no he answered i shall go out i want exercise when will you be back she asked wistfully oh hang it all dont nag me i shall come back when i like he left the room as he spoke slamming the door behind him mrs caldwell did not alter her attitude but the tears welled up in her eyes and ran down her haggard cheeks unheeded the children came in and finding her so quietly left the room all but the eldest girl who went and leant against her slipping her little hand through her mothers arm the poor woman kissed the child passionately then with a great effort recovered her selfcontrol put her work away gave the children their tea read to them for an hour and saw them to bed the front door was open when she came downstairs and she went to shut it a lady who knew her happened to be passing and stopped to shake hands i saw your husband just now sitting on the beach with bessie gottley she informed mrs caldwell pleasantly they were both laughing immoderately very likely mrs caldwell responded with a smile she amuses my husband immensely but wont you come in no thank you not tonight i am hurrying home glad to see you looking so well with which she nodded and went her way and mrs caldwell returned to the little diningroom holding her head high till she had shut the door when she burst into a tempest of tears she was a lymphatic woman ordinarily but subject to sudden squalls of passion when she lost all selfcontrol she would have sobbed aloud now when the fit was on her in the face of the whole community although the constant effort of her life was to keep up appearances she had recovered herself however before the servant came in with the candles and was sitting in the window looking out anxiously the greyness of the long june day was darkening down to night now but there was no change in the sultry stillness of the air summer lightning played about in the strip of sky above the houses opposite one of the houses was a butchers shop and while mrs caldwell sat there the butcher brought out a lamb and killed it mrs caldwell watched the operation with interest they did strange things in those days in that little irish seaport and being an englishwoman she looked on like a civilised traveller intelligently studying the customs of a savage people but as the darkness gathered the trouble of her mind increased her husband did not return and a sickening sensation of dread took possession of her where had he gone what was he doing doubtless enjoying himselfwhat bitterness there was in the thought she did not grudge him any pleasure but it was hard that he should find so little in her company why was there no distraction for her the torment of her mind was awful should she try his remedy she went to the sideboard and poured herself out some whisky but even as she raised it to her lips she felt it unworthy to have recourse to it and put the glass down untouched after that she went and leant against the windowframe it was about midnight and very few people passed whenever a man appeared in the distance she had a moment of hope but only to be followed by the sickening sensation of another disappointment the mental anguish was so great that for some time she paid no attention to physical symptoms which had now begun by degrees however these became importunate and oh the relief of it the trouble of her mind ceased when the physical pain became acute and therefore she welcomed it as a pleasant distraction she was obliged to think and be practical too there was no one in the house to help her the sleeping children were of course out of the question and the two young servants maidofallwork and nurse nearly as much so besides there was the difficulty of calling them she felt she must not disturb jane who was in the nursery for fear of rousing the children but should she ever get to bridgets room which was further off step by step she climbed the stairs clinging to the banister with one hand holding the candle in the other several times she sank down and waited silently but with contracted face till a paroxysm had passed at last she reached the door bridget was awake and had heard her coming holy mother she exclaimed startled out of her habitual sullenness by her mistresss agonised face yer ill maam let me help you to your bed fetch the doctor and the nurse bridget mrs caldwell was just able to gasp in the urgency and excitement of the moment there was a truce to hostilities bridget jumped up in nightdress and bare feet and supported her mistress to her room there she was obliged to leave her alone and so it happened that just as the grey dawn trembled with the first flush of a new and brighter day the child arrived unassisted and without welcome and sent up a wail of protest when the doctor came at last and had time to attend to her he pronounced her to be a fine child and declared that she had made a good beginning and would do well for herself which words the nurse declared to be of happy omen her father was not fit to appear until late in the day he came in humbly filled with remorse for that misspent night and was received with the feeble flicker of a smile which so touched and softened him that he made more of the new child and took a greater interest in her than he had done in any of the others at the time of their birth there was some difficulty about a name for her her father proposed to call her elizabethafter his sister he saidbut mrs caldwell objected elizabeth was miss gottleys name also a fact which she recollected but did not mention that she did not like the name seemed reason enough for not choosing it but her husband persisted and then there was a hot dispute on the subject above the babys cradle the dispute ended in a compromise the mother agreeing to have the child christened elizabeth if she were not called so and she would not have her called eliza elsie elspeth bessie betsy or bess either this left nothing for it but to call her beth and upon consideration both parents liked the diminutive her father because it was unaccustomed and her mother because it had no association of any kind attached to it for the first three months of her life beth cried incessantly as if bewailing her advent then one day she opened her eyes wide and looked out into the world with interest chapter ii it was the sunshine really that first called her into conscious existence the blessed heat and light up to the moment that she recognised these with a certain acknowledgment of them and consequently of things in general outside herself she had been as unconscious as a white grub without legs but that moment roused her calling forth from her senses their first response in the thrill of warmth and wellbeing to which she awoke and quickening her intellect at the same time with the stimulating effort to discover from whence her comfort came she could remember no circumstance in connection with this earliest awakening all she knew of it was the feeling of warmth and brightness which she said recurred to her at odd times ever afterwards and could be recalled at will some may see in this first awakening a foreshadowing of the fact that she was born to be a child of light and to live in it and certainly it was always light for which she craved the actual light of day however but nothing she yearned for ever came to her in the form she thought of and thus when she asked for sunshine it was grudgingly given fate often forcing her into dark dwellings but all the time that light which illumines the spirit was being bestowed upon her in limitless measure the next step in her awakening was to a kind of selfconsciousness she was lying on her nurses lap out of doors looking up at the sky and some one was saying oh you pretty thing but it was long years before she connected the phrase with herself although she smiled in response to the voice that uttered it then she found herself on her feet in a garden moving very carefully for fear of falling and everything about her was gigantic from jane nettles the nurse at whose skirt she tugged when she wanted to attract attention to the brown wallflower and the purple larkspur which she could not reach to pull there was a thin hedge at the end of the garden through which she looked out on a path across a field and a thick hedge on her left in which a thrush had built a nest at an immense height above her head jane lifted her up to look into the nest and there was nothing in it then jane lifted her up again and oh there was a blue egg there and jane lifted her up a third time and the egg had brown spots on it the mystery of the egg awed her she did not ask herself how it came to be there but she felt a solemn wonder in the fact and the colour caused a sensation of pleasure a positive thrill to run through her this was her first recognition of beauty and it was to the beauty of colour not of form that her senses awoke through life she had a keen joy and nice discrimination in colours and seemed to herself to have always known their names but those spots on the egg she was positive that they had come between her first and second peep which shows how defective her faculty of observation which became so exact under cultivation was to begin with beth also betrayed other traits with regard to the spots which she carried through lifethe trick of being most positive when she was quite in the wrong for one and want of faith in other people for another jane said did you see the spots that time dearie spots just comed beth declared no dearie spots always there jane answered spots comed beth maintained no dearie spots always there only you didnt see them spots comed now beth stamped and then because jane shook her head she sat down suddenly on the gravel and sent up a howl which brought her father out he chucked jane under the chin jane giggled then made a sign and there was mrs caldwell looking from one to the other to beths recollection it seemed as if she had rapidly acquired the experiences of this first period each incident that she remembered is apparently trifling in itself but who can say of what significance as an indication in those first few years had there been any there with intelligence to interpret they probably would have found foreshadowings of all she might be and do and suffer and that would have been the time to teach her to me therefore these earliest impressions are more interesting than much that occurred to her in after life and i have carefully collected them in the hope of finding some clue in them to what followed in several instances it seems to me that the impression left by some chance observation or incident on her baby mind made it possible for her to do many things in after life which she certainly never would have done but for those early influences it would be affectation therefore to apologise for such detail nothing can be trivial or insignificant that tends to throw light on the mysterious growth of our moral and intellectual being many a cramped soul that struggles on in after years vainly endeavouring to rise on a broken wing might had the importance of such seeming trifles in its development been recognised have won its way upward from the first untrammelled and uninjured it was a jesuit was it not who said give me the child until it is six years old after that you can do as you like with it that is the time to make an indelible impression of principles upon the mind in the first period of life character is a blossom that should be carefully touched in the second the petals fall and the fruit sets it is hard and acrid then until the third period when if things go well it will ripen on the bough and be sweet and wholesomeif ill it will drop off immediately and rot upon the ground beth was a combative child always at war with jane there was a great battle fought about a big black velvet bonnet that beth wanted to wear one day beth screamed and kicked and scratched and bit and finally went out in the bonnet triumphantly and found herself standing alone on the edge of a great green world dotted with yellow gorse a hot wide dusty road stretched miles away in front of her and at an infinite distance overhead was the blue sky flecked with clouds so white and dazzling that her eyes ached when she looked at them she had stopped a moment to cry wait for me jane walked on however taking no notice and beth struggled after her whimpering out of breath choked with dust scorched with heat parched with thirst tired to deathhow she suffered a heartless lark sang overhead regardless of her misery and she never afterwards heard a lark without recalling the long white road the heat and dust and fatigue she tore off the velvet bonnet and threw it away then began another despairing wait for me but in the midst of the cry she saw some little yellow flowers growing in the grass at the roadside and plumped down then and there inconsequently to gather them by that time jane was out of sight and at the moment beth became aware of the fact she also perceived an appalling expanse of bright blue sky above her and sat gazing upwards paralysed with terror this was her first experience of loneliness her first terrified sensation of immensity then the snowdrops and crocuses were out and the sky grew black and she sat on the nursery floor and looked up at it in solemn wonder flakes of snow began to fall a few at first then thicker and thicker till the air was full of them and jane said the scotch are picking their geese and immediately beth saw the scotch sitting in some vague scene picking geese in frenzied haste and throwing great handfuls of feathers up in the air which was probably the first independent flight of her imagination it is astonishing how little consciousness of time there is in these reminiscences the seasons are all confounded and it is as if things had happened not in succession but abreast there was snow on the ground when her brother jim was with her in the washhouse making horsehair snares to catch birds they made running loops of the horsehair and tied them on to sticks then went out and stuck them in the ground in the garden outside the washhouse window sprinkled crumbs of bread and crept carefully back to watch first came a robin with noiseless flight and lit on the ground with its head on one side but the children were too eager and in their excitement they made a noise and the robin flew away next came a sparrow saw the children saw the crumbs and with the habitual selfpossession of his race stretched in his head between the sticks picked out the largest piece of bread and carried it off in triumph immediately afterwards a blackbird flew down and hopped in among the snares unconsciously in a moment he was caught and with a wild shout of joy the children rushed out to secure their prize but when they reached the spot the blackbird had burst his bonds and escaped then beth threw a chunk of wood at her brother and cut his head open his cries brought out the household and beth was well shakenshe was always being shaken at this timeand marched off promptly to papas dressingroom and made to sit on a little chair in the middle of the floor where she amused herself by singing at the top of her voice all around sebastopol all around the ocean every time a gun goes off down falls a russian she wondered why her father and mother were laughing when they came to release her before they appeared however brother jim her victim had come to the door with his head tied up and peeped in and she knew that they were friends again because he shot ripe gooseberries at her across the floor as if they had been marbles there is a discrepancy here seeing that snow and ripe gooseberries are not in season at the same time it is likely however that she broke her brothers head more than once and the occasions became confounded in her recollection when the children went to bathe off the beach beth would not let jane dip her if kicking scratching and screaming could prevent it there used to be terrible scenes between them until at last one day somebody elses old scotch nurse interfered and persuaded beth to go into the water with her and consent to be dipped three times beth went like a lambinstead of having to be dragged in and pushed under given no time to recover her breath between each dip half choked with sand and salt water and finally dragged out exhausted by the struggle and certainly suffering more than she had benefited by the immersion the cold water came up about her and took her breath away as the old scotch nurse led her in and beth clung to her hand and panted wait as she nerved herself for the dip nurse had promised to wait until beth was ready and it was beths faith in her promise that gave her courage to go bravely through the ordeal the old scotch nurse never deceived her as jane had done and so beth learnt that there are people in the world you can depend on there was one painful circumstance in connection with those battles on the beach beth was such a tiny girl they did not think it necessary to give her a bathing dress and consequently she was marched into the water with nothing on and the agony of shame she suffered is indescribable but the worst of it was the shame wore off jim teased her about it and called her a little girl a dreadful term of reproach in those days when the boys were taught to consider themselves superior beings beth flew at him and fought him for it but was beaten and then she took off her things in the nursery and scampered up and down before them all with nothing on just to show how little she cared it is astonishing how small a part beths family play in these childish recollections her father took very little notice of the children he was out of health and irritable and only tried to save himself annoyance not to disturb him was the object of everybodys life probably he only appeared on the scene when beth was naughty and the recollection being painful was quickly banished she remembered him coming downstairs when she was standing in the hall one day when her mother was away from home he had a letter in his hand and asked her if she would send her love to mamma her heart bounded it seemed to her such a tremendous thing to be asked and she was dying to send her love but such an agony of shyness came upon her she could not utter a word she had a little hymnbook in her hand however which she held out to her father no that would not do he could not send the book only her love didnt she love mamma didnt she but not a word would come all through life she was afflicted with that inability to speak at critical times dumb always was she apt to be when her affections were concerned except occasionally in moments of strong excitement and in anger when she was driven to bay the intensity of her feelings would probably have made her dumb in any case in moments of emotion but doubtless the hardness of those about her at this impressionable period strengthened the defect it is impossible to escape from the hampering influences of our infancy among beths many recollections of these days there was not one of a caress given or received or of any expression of tenderness and so she never became familiar with the exquisite language of love and was long in learning that it is not a thing to be ashamed of and concealed later that day with a mighty effort she summoned up courage enough to go down to her father she was determined to send the message to mamma but when it came to the point she was again unable to utter a word on the subject her mother had gone to stay with her relations in england beth found her father in the diningroom and several other people were present he was standing by the sideboard mixing whiskyandwater so instead of sending her love to mamma beth exclaimed confidently and pleasantly if you drink whisky youll be drunk again a smart slap rewarded this sally beth turned pale and recoiled it was her first taste of human injustice to drink and to be drunk was to her merely the natural sequence of cause and effect and she could not conceive why she should be slapped and turned out of the room so promptly for uttering such a simple truth beth was present at many discussions between her father and mother and took much interest in them all the more perhaps because most of what was said was a mystery to her she wondered why any mention of the moonfaced bessie disturbed her mothers countenance jane nettles toowhen her mother was out her father used to come and talk to jane and they laughed a good deal he admired janes white teeth and the children used to make jane show them her teeth after that papa says janes got nice white teeth beth said to her mother one day and she never forgot the glance which mrs caldwell threw at her husband his eyes fell before it what even the servants henry mrs caldwell exclaimed and then she left the room beth learned what it all meant in after years the career of one of her brothers furnishing the clue like father like son it was after this that mrs caldwell went to visit her relations in england accompanied by two of the children it was in the summer and jane took beth to the castle hill that morning to see the steamer with her mother on board go by the sea was iridescent like molten silver the sky was high and cloudless and where sea and sky met and mingled on the horizon it was impossible to determine numbers of steamers passed far out they looked quite small and beth did not think there was room in any of them for her mother and brother and sister they did not therefore interest her much nor did the policeman who came and talked to jane but the castle hill and the little winding path up which she had come the green of the grass the brambles the ferns the ruined masonry against which she leant the union of sea and sky and shore the light the colour absorbed her and drew her out of herself her soul expanded it spread its wings it stretched out spiritual arms to meet and clasp the beloved nature of which it felt itself to be a part it was her earliest recognition of their kinship a glimpse of greatness a moment of ecstasy never to be forgotten the first stirring in herself of the creative faculty for in her joy she burst out into a little song far on the borders of the arcane it was as if the pleasure played upon her using her as a passive instrument by which it attained to audible expression for how should a child know a word like arcane it came to her as things do which we have known and forgottenthe whole song did in fact but she held it as a possession sacred to herself and never recorded it or told more than that one line although it stayed with her lingered on her lips and in her heart for the rest of her life it was a great moment for beth the moment when her further faculty first awoke on looking back to it in after years she fancied she found in it confirmation of an opinion which she afterwards formed genius to her was yet only another word for soul she could not believe that we all have souls or that they are at all equally developed even in those who have obtained them she was a child under six at this time jane nettles was a woman between twenty and thirty and the policemanshe could not say what age he was but she was the only one of the three that throbbed responsive to the beauty of the wonderful scene before them or felt her being flooded with the glory of the hour meanwhile what her parents would have called her education had begun she went with mildred her elder sister to a day school they used to run down the street together without a nurse and the sense of freedom was delicious to beth they had to pass the market where the great mealy specimen potatoes were displayed and mary lynchs shopshe was the vegetable woman who used to talk to mrs caldwell about the children when they went there and one or the other always called them poor little bodies upon which they commented afterwards among themselves mary lynch was a large redfaced woman and when the children wanted to describe a stout person they always said as fat as mary lynch one house which beth had to pass on her way to school made a strong impression on her imagination it was a gloomy abode with a broad doorstep and deep portico broken windows and a mudsplashed door from beneath which she always expected to see a slender stream of blood slowly trickling for a man called macgregor had murdered his wife therebeaten her brains out with a poker beth never heard the name macgregor in after life without a shiver of dislike much of her time at school was spent in solitary confinement for breaches of the peace with a face as impassive as a monkeys she would do the most mischievous things and was always experimenting in naughty tricks as on one occasion when miss deeble left the schoolroom for a minute but had to come hurrying back recalled by wild shrieks and found that beth had managed in that minute to tip up a form with four children on it throw their books out of the window and sprinkle ink all over the floor miss deeble marched her downstairs to an empty kitchen and left her sitting on a stool in the middle of it with an a b c in her hand but beth took no interest in the alphabet in those days and hunted blackbeetles with the bellows instead of learning it the hearthstone was the place of execution when she found a beetle she would blow him along to it with the bellows and there despatch him she had no horror of any creature in her childhood but as she matured her whole temperament changed in this respect and when she met a beetle on the stairs she would turn and fly rather than pass it and she would feel nauseated and shiver with disgust for hours after if she thought of it she knew the exact moment that this horror came upon her it happened when she was ten years old she found a beetle one day lying on its back and thinking it was dead she took it up and was swinging it by its antennae when the creature suddenly wriggled itself round and twined its prickly legs about her finger giving her a start from which she never recovered beth probably got as far as a b ab while she was at miss deebles but if she were backward with her book her other faculties began to be acute it was down in that empty kitchen that she first felt the enchantment of music some one suddenly played the piano overhead and beth listened spellbound again and again the player played and always the same thing practising it beth knew every note long afterwards she was trying some waltzes of chopins and came upon one with which she was quite familiar she knew that she had heard it all over and over again but could not think when or where presently however as she played it she perceived a smell of blackbeetles and instantly she was back in that disused kitchen of miss deebles listening to the practising overhead all beths senses were acute and from the first her memory helped itself by the involuntary association of incongruous ideas many peoples recollections are stimulated by the sense of smell but it is a rarer thing for the sense of taste to be associated with the past in the same way as it was in beths case there were many circumstances which were recalled by the taste of the food she had been eating at the time they occurred the children often dined in the garden in those early days and once a piece of appledumpling beth was eating slid off her plate on to the gravelled walk some one picked it up and put it on her plate again all covered with stones and grit and the sight of hot appledumpling made her think of gravel ever afterwards and filled her with disgust so that she could not eat it she had a great aversion to bread and butter too for a long time but that she got over it would have been too great an inconvenience to have a child dislike its staple food and in all probability she was forced to conquer her aversion and afterwards she grew to like bread and butter but still if by any chance the circumstances which caused her dislike to it recurred to her when she was eating a piece she was obliged to stop the incident which set up the association happened one evening when her father and mother were out beth was alone in the diningroom eating bread and butter and towie the cat came into the room with a mouse in her mouth the mouse was alive and towie let it run a little way and then pounced down upon it then gave it a pat to make it run again beth lying on her stomach on the floor watching these proceedings naturally also became a cat with a mouse at last towie began to eat her mouse beginning with its head which it crushed beth eating her bread and butter in imitation saw the white brains but felt no disgust at the moment the next time she had bread and butter however she thought of the mouses brains and felt sick and always afterwards the same association of ideas was liable to recur to her with the same result but even the description of anything horrifying affected her in this way one day when she was growing up her mother told her at dinner that she had been on the pier that morning and had seen the body of a man all discoloured and swollen from being in the water a long time towed into the harbour by a fishing boat beth listened and asked questions as she always did on these occasions with the deepest interest she was taking soup strongly flavoured with catsup at the moment and the story in no way interfered with her appetite but the next time she tried catsup and ever afterwards she perceived that swollen discoloured corpse and immediately felt nauseated it is curious that all these associations of ideas are disagreeable she had not a single pleasant one in connection with food chapter iii all of beth that was not eyes at this time was ears and her brain was as busy as a squirrel in the autumn storing observations and registering impressions it does not do to trust to a childs not understanding it may not understand at the moment but it will remember all the sameall the more perhaps because it does not understand and its curiosity will help it to solve the problem beth did humorous things at this time but she had no sense of humour she was merely experimenting her big eyes looked out of an impassive face solemnly no one suspected the phenomenal receptivity which that stolid mask concealed and because the alphabet did not interest her they formed a poor opinion of her intellect the truth was that she had no use for letters or figures the books of nature and of life were spread out before her and she was conning their contents to more purpose than any one else could have interpreted them to her in those days and as to arithmetic as soon as her father began to allow her a penny a week for pocketmoney she discovered that there were two halfpennies in it which was all she required to know she also mastered the system of debit and credit for when she found herself in receipt of a regular income and had conquered the first awe of entering a shop and asking for things she ran into debt she received the penny on saturday and promptly spent it in sweets but by monday she wanted more and the craving was so imperative that when miss deeble sent her down to the empty kitchen in the afternoon she could not blow blackbeetles with any enthusiasm and began to look about for something else to interest her it being summer the window was open but it was rather out of her reach she managed however with the help of her stool to climb on to the sill and there in front of her was the sea and down below was the streeta goodish drop below if she had stopped to think of it but beth dropped first and thought afterwards only realising the height when she had come down plump and looked up again to see what had happened to her surprised at the thud which had jarred her stomach and made her feet sting she picked herself up at once however and limped away not heeding the hurt much so delightful was it to be out alone without her hat by the time she got to mary lynchs she was jane nettles going on an errand an assumption which enabled her to enter the shop at her ease goodday she began give me a haporth of peardrops and a haporth of raspberrydrops mary lynch please ill pay you on saturday what are you doing out alone without your hat mary lynch rejoined beaming upon her im afraid youre a naughty little body no im not beth answered its my own money mary lynch laughed and helped her liberally adding some cherries to the sweets and to beths credit be it stated the money was duly paid and without regret she being her mother at the moment looking much relieved to be able to settle the debt which shows that even by this time beth had somehow become aware of moneytroubles and also that she learned to read a countenance long before she learned to read a book she straggled home with the sweets in her hand but did not eat them for now she was a lady going to give a party and must await the arrival of her guests she did not go in by the front door for obvious reasons but up the entry down which the open wooden gutterspout ran at a convenient height from the house into the street the washhouse was covered with delicious white roses which scented the summer afternoon beth concealed her sweets in the rosetree and then leant against the wall and buried her nose in one of the flowers loving it the maids were in the washhouse she heard them talking it was all about what he said and she said presently a torrent of dirty water came pouring down the spout mingling its disagreeable soapy smell with that of the flowers beth plucked some petals from the rose she was smelling set them on the soapy water and ran down the passage beside them until they disappeared in the drain in the street this delight over she wandered into the garden she was always on excellent terms with all animals and was treated by them with singular confidence towie the cat had been missing for some time but now to beths great joy she suddenly appeared from beth could not tell where purring loudly and rubbing herself against beths bare legs the sun poured down upon them and the sensation of the cats warm fur above her socks was delicious beth tried to lift her up in her arms but she wriggled herself out of them and began to run backwards and forwards between her and a gap in the hedge until beth understood that she wished her to follow her through it into the next garden beth did so and the cat led her to a little warm nest where to beths wild delight she showed her a tiny black kitten beth picked it up and carried it followed by the cat into the house in a state of breathless excitement shrieking out the news as she ran beth was immediately seized upon what was she doing at home when she ought to have been at school and without her hat too beth had no explanation to offer and was hustled off to the nursery and there shut up for the rest of the day she stood in the window most of the time a captive princess in the witchs palace waiting for the fairyprince to release her and catching flies the sky became overcast and a big gun was fired beths father had something to do with the firing of big guns and she connected this with the gathering gloom stories of god striking wicked people down with thunder and lightning for their sins and her own naughtiness and felt considerably awed presently a little boy was carried down the street on a bed his face looked yellow against the sheets he was lying flat on his back and had a little black cap on which was right out of doors but wrong in bed he smiled up at beth as they carried him under the window and she stretched out her arms to him with infinite pity she knew he was going to die they all died that family or had something dreadful happen to them jane nettles said there was a curse upon them and beth never thought of them without a shudder that boys sisters both died and one had something dreadful happen to her for they dug her up again and when they opened the coffin the corpse was all in a jelly and every colour of the rainbow according to jane nettles beth believed she had been present upon the occasion in a grassgrown graveyard by the wall of an old church beneath which steps led down into a vault the stones of the steps were mossy and the sun was shining there was a little group of people standing round with pale set solemn faces and presently something was brought up and they all pressed forward to look at it beth could not see what it was for the grownup people and never knew whether or not the whole picture had been conjured up by her imagination but as there was always a foundation of fact in the impressions of this period of her life it is not improbable that she really was present at the exhumation with the curious and indefatigable jane nettles opposite the nursery window on the other side of the road was the butchers shop in front of which the butcher made his shambles late in the evening he brought out a board and set it on trestles then he brought a sheep lifted it up by its legs and put it on its back on the board tied its feet and cut its throat beth watched the operation with grave interest but no other feeling she had been accustomed to see it all her life presently beths father and mother went out together and then beth stole downstairs and out to the washhouse to find the sweets in the white rosetree mildred and jim were doing their lessons in the diningroom and she burst in upon them with the sweets but mildred was cross and said dont make such a noise beth my head aches the next day was sunday beth knew it by the big black bonnet which played such a large part in her childish recollections she had a kind of sensation of having seen herself in it bobbing along to church a sort of kate greenaway child with a head out of all proportion to the rest of her body and feeling singularly satisfieda feeling however which was less a recollection than an experience continually renewed for a nice gown or bonnet was always a pleasure to her in church she sat in a big square pew on one side of the aisle and on the other side was another pew exactly like it in which sat a young lady whom beth believed to be miss augusta noble in the fairchild family augusta noble was very vain and got burnt to death for standing on tiptoe before the fire to look at herself in a new frock in the mirror on the mantelpiece beth thought it a suitable end for her and did not pity her at allperhaps because she went on coming to church regularly all the same after the service they climbed the castle hill and there was the grey of stonework against a bright blue sky and green of grass and trees against the grey and mountainous clouds of dazzling white hung over a molten sea and because of the beauty of it all beth burst into a passion of tears what is the matter with that child her father exclaimed impatiently its very odd other people can bring up their children properly caroline but you never seem to be able to manage yours whats the matter with you you tiresome child mrs caldwell exclaimed shaking beth by the arm beth only sobbed the more look said her mother pointing to a small lake left by the sea on the shore when the tide went out where the children used to wade kneedeep or bathe when it was too rough for them to go into the sea look theres the pond that bright round thing over there and look below near the castlethat great green mound is the giants grave when the giant died they buried him there and he was so big he reached all that length when they laid him in the ground and when he stood up where did he reach to said beth interested in a moment oh when he sat here i should think he could make a footstool of his own grave and when he stood up he could look over the castle beth with big dilated eyes and wet cheeks saw him do both and was oppressed to tears no more that day by delight and wonder of the beautiful but she was always liable to these paroxysms the outcome of an intensity of pleasure which was positive pain so from the first she was keenly susceptible to outdoor influences and it was now that her memory was stored with impressions which were afterwards of inestimable value to her for she never lived amongst the same kind of scenery again the children had the run of some gentlemans grounds which they called the walks there were banks of flowers and sidewalks where the london pride grew and water and great trees with hollows in them where the water lodged beth called these fairy wells and put her fingers in to see how deep they were and there were dead leaves in them and there on a memorable occasion she found her first skeleton leaf and told jane nettles she really didnt know before that there were such things once there was a wasps nest hanging from a branch and they met a young man coming away from it holding a handkerchief to his face he stopped to tell jane nettles how he had been stung and the children wandered off unheeded to look at the nest it was all grey and gossamer like cobwebs laid in layers beth was an indian scout inspecting it from behind a neighbouring tree and then she shelled it with sticks but did not wait to see it surrender they picked up horsechestnuts from under the trees in the season and hammered the green rind off with stones for the joy of seeing the beautiful shining slippery dark brown or piebald polished fruit within and also when there were wet leaves on the ground they gathered walnuts from out of the long tangled grass and stained their fingers picking off the covering which was mealygreen when it burst and smelt nice but the nut itself when they came to it was always surprisingly small there were horrid mahoganycoloured pieces of liver put about the walks on sticks sometimes jane nettles said they were to poison the dogs because they came in and destroyed the flowers beth wondered how it was people could eat liver if it poisoned dogs and was careful afterwards not to touch it herself most children would have worried the reason out of their nurse but jane nettles was not amiable and beth could never bring herself to ask a question of any one who was likely either to snub her for asking or to jeer at her for not knowing there are unsympathetic people who have a way of making children feel ashamed of their ignorance and rather than be laughed at a sensitive child will pretend to know beth was extraordinarily sensitive in this respect and so it happened that in later life she sometimes found herself in ignorance of things which less remarkable people had learnt in their infancy for the asking these were certainly days of delight to beth but the charm of them was due less to people than to thingsto some sight or scent of nature the smell of newmown hay from a waggon they had stood aside to let pass in a narrow lane a glimpse of a high bank on the other side of the roada high grassy bank covered and crowned with trees chiefly chestnuts on which the sun shone hawthorn hedgerows from which they used to pick the green buds children call breadandbutter and eat them and one privethedge in their own garden an impenetrable hedge on the other side of which as beth imagined all kinds of wonderful things took place the flowers of those early days were crocuses snowdrops white roses a little yellow flower they called ladies fingers seapinks and london prideparticularly london pride in the walks jane nettles used to teach her the wonderful rhyme of london bridge is broken down grand said the little dee london bridge is broken down fairladeee and so the rhyme london pride amongst the rockwork the ornamental water a rustic bridge shining laurel leaves mahoganycoloured liver warmth light and sweet airs all became mingled in one gracious memory people however as has been already shown also came into her consciousness but with less certainty of pleasing wherefore she remembered them less for it was always her habit to banish a disagreeable thought if she could one day she went into the garden with her spade and an old tin biscuitbox she put the box on the ground beside her with the lid off and began to dig byandby the kitten came crooning and sidling up to her and hopped into the box beth instantly put on the lid and the kitten was a corpse which must be buried she hurriedly dug its grave put in the box and covered it up with earth just as she had finished a gruff voice exclaimed what are ye doing there ye little divil and there was old krangle the gardener looking at her over the hedge dig it up again directly he said and beth much startled dug it up quicker than she had buried it the kitten had been but loosely covered and was not much the worse but had got some earth in its eye which was very sore afterwards people wondered what had hurt it and beth looked from one to the other and listened with grave attention to their various suppositions on the subject she said nothing however and krangle also held his peace which led to a very good understanding between them krangle had a cancer on his lip and beth was forbidden to kiss him for fear of catching it he had a garden of his own too and a pig and little boiled potatoes in his cottage the doctors brother died of cancer and beth supposed he had been naughty and kissed old krangle though she wondered he cared to as krangle had a very prickly chin the doctor often came to see papa he used to talk about the bible and then the children were sent out of the room once beth hid under the table to hear what he said it was all about god whom it appeared that he did not like he had a knob at the end of his nose and beth laughed at it in punishment of which as she used to believe her own nose developed a little knob at the end her mind was very much exercised about the doctor and his household he and his brother and sister used to live together but now he lived alone and on a bed in one of the rooms according to jane nettles there were furs and lovely silks satins and laces all being eaten by moths and destroyed because there was no one to look after them it seemed such a pity but whose were they where was the lady bridget used to come up to the nursery when the children were in bed to talk to jane nettles and look out of the window those gossips in the nursery were a great source of disturbance to beth when she ought to have been composing herself to sleep she recollected nothing of the conversations more corrupting than that ghastly account of how the girl was exhumed so it is likely that the servants exercised some discretion when they dropped their voices to a whisper as they often did but these whispered colloquies made her restless and cross and brought down upon her a smart order to go to sleep to which she used to answer defiantly i will if youll ask me a riddle one of the riddles was between two sticks between two stones between two old mens shinbones whats that the answer had something to do with a graveyard but beth could not remember what she used to suffer a small martyrdom in her little crib on those evenings from what she called snuff up her nose a hot dry burning sensation which must have been caused by a stuffy room and the feverish state she tossed herself into when she was kept awake after her regular hour for sleep sometimes she sat up in bed suddenly and cried aloud then jane nettles would push her down again on her pillow roughly and threaten to call mamma if she wasnt good directly occasionally mamma heard her and came up of her own accord and shook her by the shoulder and scolded her then beth would lie still sobbing silently and wretched as only a lonely uncomprehended and uncomplaining child can be no one had the faintest conception of what she suffered her naughtinesses were remembered against her but her latent tenderness was never suspected once the old doctor said thats a peculiarly sensitive highstrung nervous child you must be gentle with her and both parents had stared at him they were matteroffact creatures themselves comparatively speaking with a notion that such nonsense as nervousness should be shaken out of a child at dinner one day beth saw little creatures crawling in a piece of cheese she had on her plate and uttered an exclamation of disgust those are only mites you silly child her father said and then to her horror he took up the piece and ate it do look at that child caroline he exclaimed shes turned quite pale beth puzzled her head for long afterwards to know what it meant to turn pale little seeds of superstition were sown in her mind at this time and afterwards flourished she found a weddingring in her first piece of christmas cake and was told she would be the first of the party to marry which made her feel very important being so sensitive herself she was morbidly careful of the feelings of others and committed sins of insincerity without compunction in her efforts to spare them she and mildred were waiting ready dressed one day to go and pay a call with mamma beth had her big bonnet on and was happy and mildred also was in a high state of delight she said beths breath smelt of strawberries and wanted to know what her own smelt of raspberries beth answered instantly it was not true but beth felt that something of the kind was expected of her and so responded sympathetically when they got to the house they were shown into an immense room and wandered about it beth upset some cushions and had awful qualms expecting every moment to be pounced upon and shaken but she forgot her fright on approaching her hostess and discovering to her great surprise that she was busy doing black monkeys on a grey ground in woolwork she was astonished to find that it was possible to do such wonderful work and she wanted to be taught immediately but her mother made her ashamed of herself for supposing that she could do it silly little body they stayed dinner and beth cried with rage because the servant poured white sauce over her fish and without asking her too the fish was an island and beth was the hungry sea devouring it bit by bit of course if you put white sauce over it you converted it into a table with a white cloth on or something of that kind which you could not eat so the fish was spoilt she got into a difficulty too about miss deebles drawingroom which was upstairs overlooking the bay and you could only see the water from the window so there were watercolours on the wall her mother smilingly tried to explain but beth stamped and stuck to her point the water accounted for the watercolours on the way home beth found a new interest in life the mill had been burnt down and they went to see the smouldering embers and beth smelt fire for the first time the millers family had been burnt out and were sheltering in a shed one little boy had his fingers all crumpled up from the fire beths benevolence awoke she was all sympathetic excitement and wanted to do something for somebody the millers wife was lying on a mattress on the floor she had a little baby a new one a pudgy redlooking thing mrs caldwell fed the other children with breadandmilk and beth offered to teach them their letters mrs caldwell laughed at her you teach them their letters she exclaimed you had better learn your own properly and mildred also jeered beth subsided crimson with shame at being thus lowered in everybodys estimation she was deficient in selfesteem and required to be encouraged praise merely gave her confidence but her mother never would praise her she brought all her children up on the same plan regardless of their different dispositions it made mildred vain to praise her and therefore beth must not be praised and so her mother checked her mental growth again and again instead of helping her to develop it its no use your trying to do that beth you cant she would say when beth would have done it easily if only she had been assured that she could beth had a strange dream that night after the fire which made a lasting impression upon her dormans isle was a green expanse flat as a table and covered with the short grass that grows by the sea at high tide it was surrounded by water but when the tide was low it rested on great grey rugged rocks as the lid of a box rests upon its sides between the grey of the rocks and the green of the grass there was a fringe of seapinks that night she dreamt that she was under dormans isle and it was a great bare cave not very high and lighted by torches which people held in their hands there were a number of people and they were all members of her own family ancestors in the dresses of their day distant relationsnumbers of strange people whom she had never heard of as well as her own father and mother brothers and sisters she knew she was under dormans isle but she knew also that it was the dark space beneath the stage of a theatre when she entered the rest of the family were already assembled but they none of them spoke to each other and the doors kept opening and shutting and the people seemed to melt away until at last only three or four remained and they were just going she saw the shine on the paint of the doorposts and the smoke of the torches as they let themselves out then they had all gone and left her alone in a cave full of smoke vainly she struggled to follow them the doors were fast the smoke was smothering her and in the agony of a last effort to escape she awoke in after days when beth began to think she used to wonder how it was she knew those people were her ancestors and that the place was like any part of a theatre she had never heard either of ancestors or theatres at that time was it recollection or is there some more perfect power to know than the intellecta power lying latent in the whole race which will eventually come into possession of it but with which at present only some few rare beings are perfectly endowed beth had the sensation of having been nearer to something in her infancy than she ever was againnearer to knowing what it is the trees whisperwhat the murmur means the allpervading murmur which sounds incessantly when everything is hushed as at night nearer to the arcane of that evening on the castle hill when she first felt her kinship with nature and burst into song it may have been hereditary memory a knowledge of things transmitted to her by her ancestors along with their features virtues and vices but at any rate she herself was sure that she possessed a power of some kind in her infancy which gradually lapsed as her intellectual faculties developed she was conscious that the senses had come between her and some mysterious joy which was not of the senses but of the spirit there lingered what seemed to be the recollection of a condition anterior to this a condition of which no tongue can tell which is not to be put into words or made evident to those who have no recollection but which some will comprehend by the mere allusion to it all her life long beth preserved a half consciousness of this somethingsomething which eluded hersomething from which she gradually drifted further away as she grew oldersome sort of vision which opened up fresh tracts to her but whether of country or whether of thought she could not say only when it came to her all was immeasurable about her and she was aboveabove in a great calm through which she moved without any sort of effort that is known to us she just thought it and was there while humanity dwindled away into insignificance below one other strange vision she had which she never forgot with her intellect she believed it to have been a dream but her further faculty always insisted that it was a recollection she was with a large company in an indescribable hollow space bare of all furnishments because none were required and into this space there came a great commotion bright light and smoke without heat or sense of suffocation then she was alone making for an aperture struggling and striving with pain of spirit to gain it and when she had found it she shot through and awoke in the world she awoke with a terrible sense of desolation upon her and with the consciousness of having traversed infinite space at infinite speed in an interval of time which her mortal mind could not measure all through life when she was in possession of her further faculty and perceived by that meanswhich was only at fitful intervals doubtless because of unfavourable circumstances and surroundingsshe was calm strong and confident she looked upon life as from a height viewing it both in detail and as a whole but when she had only her intellect to rely upon all was uncertain and she became weak vacillating and dependent so that she appeared to be a singular mixture of weakness and strength courage and cowardice faith and distrust and just what she would do depended very much on what was expected of her or what influence she was under and also on some sudden impulse which no one herself included could have anticipated chapter iv up to this time beths reminiscences jerk along from incident to incident but now there come the order and sequence of an eventful period perfectly recollected the date is fixed by a change of residence her father who was a commander in the coastguard was transferred on promotion from the north of ireland to another appointment in the wild west and beth was just entering upon her seventh year when they moved captain caldwell went on in advance to take up his appointment and jim accompanied him mildred beth and bernadine the youngest who had arrived two years after beth being left to follow with their mother the elder children had been sent to england to be educated in their fathers absence mildred and bernadine were transferred to their mothers room jane nettles and bridget the sulky had disappeared and kitty slept in the nursery with beth beth had grown too long for her crib but still had to sleep in it and her legs were cramped at night and often ached because she could not stretch them out and the pain kept her awake mamma my legs do ache in bed she said one day beth you really are a whiny child you always have a grievance her mother complained but mamma they do ache well its only growing pains mrs caldwell replied with a satisfied air as if to name the trouble were to ease it and so beths legs ached on unrelieved and when they kept her awake kitty became the object of her contemplation the sides of the crib were like the seat of a canebottomed chair and beth had enlarged one of the holes by fidgeting at it with her fingers this was her lookout station a nightlight had been conceded to her nervousness at the instance of dr gottley when it became a regular thing for her to wake in the dark out of one of her vivid dreams and shriek because she could not see where she was the usual beating and shaking had been tried to cure her of her nonsense but this sensible treatment only seemed to make her worse she was such a tiresome child till at last when dr gottley threatened serious consequences the light was allowed a dim little float that burned on an inch of oil in a glass of water and made kitty look so funny when she came up to bed kitty began to undress and at the same time to mutter her prayers as soon as she got into the room and sometimes she would go down on her knees and beat her breast and sigh and groan to the blessed virgin beseeching her to help her beth thought at first she was in great distress and pitied her but after a time she believed that kitty was enjoying herself perhaps because she also had begun to enjoy these exercises beth had been taught to say her protestant prayers but not made to feel that she was addressing them to any particular personality that appealed to her imagination as kittys blessed lady did kitty kitty she cried one night sitting up in her crib with a great dry sob tell me how to do it i want to speak to her too kitty who was on her knees on the floor with her rosary clasped in her hands her arms and shoulders bare and her dark hair hanging down her back looked up considerably startled holy mother how you frightened me she exclaimed go to sleep but i want to speak to her beth persisted arrah be good now miss beth kitty coaxed still on her knees ill be good if youll tell me what to say beth bargained kitty rose from her knees went to the side of the crib and looked down at the child what do ye want to say to her at all she asked i dont know beth answered i just want to speak to her i just want to say holy mother come close i love you stay by me all night long and when the daylight comes dont forget me how would you say that kitty bless your purty eyes darlint said kitty just say it that way every time it couldnt be better said not by the praste himself an if the blessed mother ever hears anything from this world she added in an undertone shell hear that but turn over now an go to sleep honey see ill stand here till ye do and sing to you beth turned over on her left side with her face to the wall and settled herself to sleep contentedly while kitty stood beside her patting her shoulder gently and crooning in a low sweet voice look down o mother mary from thy bright throne above send down upon thy children one holy glance of love and if a heart so tender with pity flows not oer then turn o mother mary and smile on me no more as beth listened her little heart expanded and presently the blessed virgin stood beside her bed a heavenly vision like kitty with dark hair growing low on her forehead and hanging down her back blue eyes and an earnest guileless face beths little mouth drooping with dissatisfaction ordinarily curled up at the corners and so thoroughly tranquillised she fell happily asleep with a smile on her lips kitty bent low to look at her and shook her head several times coaxins better nor bating you anyway she muttered but what are they going to do wid ye at all she stood up and raised her clasped hands holy mother it ud be well maybe if yed take her to yourselfjust nowgod forgive me for saying it next morning mrs caldwell was sitting at breakfast with beth and mildred every moment she glanced at the window and at last the postman passed she listened but there was no knock and her heart sank beth will you stop drumming with your spoon she exclaimed irritably as she spoke however kitty came in with the expected letter in her hand and mrs caldwells countenance cleared i thought the postman had passed she exclaimed no mem kitty rejoined i was standin at the door an he gave me the letter mrs caldwell had opened it by this time but it was very short how often am i to tell you not to stand at the door letting in the cold air kitty she snapped and howd i sweep the steps mem if you plase when im not to stand at the door but mrs caldwell was reading the letter and again her countenance cleared papa wants us to go to him as soon as ever we can get ready was her joyful exclamation and oh theyve had such snow see mildred heres a sketch of the chapel nearly buried oh let me see too beth cried running round the table to look over mildreds shoulder did papa draw that how wonderful beth dont lean on me so mildred said crossly shaking her off the sketch which was done in ink on half a sheet of paper showed a little chapel with great billows of snow rolling along the sides and up to the roof after breakfast mildred sat down and began to copy it in pencil to beths intense surprise the possibility of copying it herself would never have occurred to her but when she saw mildred doing it of course she must try too she could make nothing of it however till mildred showed her how to place each stroke and then she was very soon weary of the effort and gave it up yawning drawing was not to be one of her accomplishments kitty was to accompany them to the west when the day of departure arrived a great coach and pair came to the door and the luggage was piled up on it beth with her mouth set and her eyes twice their normal size from excitement was everywhere watching everybody afraid to miss anything that happened her mothers movements were a source of special interest to her at the last moment mrs caldwell slipped away alone to take leave of the place which had been the first home of her married life she was a young girl when she came to it the daughter of a country gentleman accustomed to luxury but right ready to enjoy poverty with the man of her heart and poverty enough she had had to endure and sickness and sorrow tootroubles inevitablebesides some of those other troubles which are the harder to bear because they are not inevitable but still she had had her compensations and it was of these she thought as she took her last leave of the little place she went to the end of the garden first closely followed by beth and looked through the thin hedge out across the field she seemed to be seeing things which were farther away than beths eyes could reach then she went to an old garden seat touched it tenderly and stood looking down at it for some seconds many a summer evening she had sat there at work while her husband read to her it was early spring and the snowdrops and crocuses were out she gathered a little bunch of them when she had made the tour of the garden she returned to the house and went into every room beth following her faithfully at a safe distance in the nursery she stood some little time looking round at the bare walls and seeming to listen expectantly no doubt she heard ghostly echoes of the patter of childrens feet the ring of childrens voices as she turned to go she pressed her handkerchief to her eyes in her own room she lingered still longer going from one piece of furniture to another and laying her hand on each it was handsome furniture such as a lady should have about her and every piece represented a longer or shorter period of selfdenial both on her own part and on her husbands and a proportionately keen joy in the acquisition of it she remembered so well when the wardrobe came home and the dressingtable too and the mahogany drawers the furniture was to follow to the new home and each piece would still have its own history but once it was moved from its accustomed place new associations would have to be formed and that was what she dreaded she could picture the old home deserted and herself yearning for it and for the old days but she could not imagine a new home or a new chapter of life with any great interest or pleasure in it anything in fact but anxiety when at last she left the house she was quite overcome to find that a little crowd of friends of every degree had collected to wish her good speed she went from one to the other shaking hands and answering their words in kindly wise mary lynch gave beth a currantcake and lifted her into the coach though she could quite well have got in by herself then they were off and mrs caldwell stood at the door wiping her eyes and gazing at the little house till they turned the corner of the street and lost sight of it for ever the tide was out dormans green isle rested on its grey rocks the pond shone like a mirror on the shore and the young grass was springing on the giants grave but the branches were still bare and brown on the castle hill and the old grey castle stood out whitened by contrast with a background of dark and lowering sky beths highlystrung nerves already overstrained by excitement broke down completely under the oppression of those heavy clouds and she became convulsed with sobs kitty took her on her knee but tried in vain to soothe her before the currantcake and the motion of the coach had made her deadly sick after which she dozed off from sheer exhaustion the rest of the journey was a nightmare of nausea to her she was constantly being lifted out of the carriage and made to lie on a sofa somewhere while the horses were being changed or put to bed for the night and dragged up again unrefreshed in the early morning and consigned once more to misery sometimes great dark mountains towered above her filling her with dread and sometimes a long lonely level of bare brown bogs was all about her overwhelming her little soul with such a terrible sense of desolation that she cowered down beside kitty and clung to her shivering once her mother shook her for something and beth turned faint whats the matter with her kitty mrs caldwell exclaimed alarmed by her white face youve jest shook the life out of her mem i think kitty answered her tranquilly an yell not rare her that way im thinking mrs caldwell began to dislike kitty on the third day they drove down a delightful road with hedges on either hand footpaths and trees among which big countryhouses nestled the mountains were still in the neighbourhood but not near enough to be awesome on one side of the road was a broad shallow stream so clear you could see the brown stones at the bottom a salmonstream with weirs and waterfalls they were nearing a town and kitty began to put the things together beth became interested mamma looked out of the window every instant and at last she exclaimed in a tone of relief which somehow belied the words heres papa i knew he would come and there was a horse at the window and papa was on the horse looking in at them mammas face became quite rosy and she laughed a good deal and showed her teeth beth had not noticed them before what are you staring at beth mildred whispered mammas all pink beth said thats blushing said mildred whats blushing said beth getting pink what does she do it for she cant help it beth continued to stare and at last mrs caldwell noticed it and asked her what she was looking at youve got nice white teeth said beth mrs caldwell smiled have you only just discovered that papa asked through the window you never told me beth protested thinking herself reproached you said jane nettles had the smile froze on mammas lips and papas horse became unmanageable beth saw there was something wrong and stopped looking from one to the other intently mrs caldwell recovered herself what a stolid face she has she remarked presently by way of breaking an awkward pause beth wondered what stolid meant and who she was she doesnt look well papa observed shes jest had the life shook out of her sir kitty put in kitty how dare you mrs caldwell began its to the journey im alludin now mem kitty explained with dignity the child cant bear the travellin well it wont last much longer now said papa and then made some remark to mamma in italian which brought back her goodhumour they always spoke italian to each other because papa did not know french so well as mamma did beth supposed at that time that all grownup people spoke french or italian to each other and she used to wonder which she would speak when she was grown up they stopped at an inn for an hour or two for there was still another stage of this interminable journey mildred had a bag with a big doll in it and some almondsweets she left it on a windowseat when they went to have something to eat and when she thought of it again it was nowhere to be found they would steal the teeth out of your head in this godforsaken country captain caldwell exclaimed in a tone of exasperation an awful vision of igneous rocks with misshapen creatures prowling about amongst them instantly appeared to beth in illustration of a godforsaken country but she tried vainly to imagine how stealing teeth out of your head was to be managed when they set off again and had left the grey town with its green trees and clear rivulet behind the road lay through a wild and desolate region great dark mountains rolled away in every direction and were piled up above the travellers to the very sky the scene was most melancholy in its grandeur and beth gazing at it fascinated with big eyes dilated to their full extent became exceedingly depressed at one turn of the way in a field below they saw a gentleman carrying a gun and attended by a party of armed policemen thats mr burke going over his property captain caldwell observed to his wife hes unpopular just now and darent move without an escort his lifes not worth a moments purchase a hundred yards from his own gate and i expect hell be shot like a dog some day with all his precautions oh why does he stay mrs caldwell exclaimed just pluck her husband answered and he likes it it certainly does add to the interest of life o henry dont speak like that mrs caldwell remonstrated they cant owe you any grudge captain caldwell flipped a fly from his horses ear beth gazed down at the doomed gentleman and fairly quailed for him she half expected to see the policemen turn on him and shoot him before her eyes and a strange excitement gradually grew upon her she seemed to be seeing and hearing and feeling without eyes or ears or a body the carriage rocked like a ship at sea and once or twice it seemed to be going right over what a dreadfully bad road mrs caldwell exclaimed yes her husband rejoined the roads about here are the very devil this is one of the best do you see that one over there pointing with his whip to a white line that zigzagged across a neighbouring mountain its disused now thats gallows hill where a man was hanged beth gazed at the spot with horror i see him she cried see whom said her mother i see the man hanging oh nonsense mrs caldwell exclaimed why the man was hanged ages ago he isnt there now you must speak the truth young lady papa said severely beth put to shame by the reproof shrank into herself she was keenly sensitive to blame but all the same her great grey eyes were riveted on the top of the hill for there against the sky she did distinctly see the man dangling from the gibbet kitty she whispered dont you see him whisht darlint kitty said covering beths eyes with her hand i dont see him but ill not be after calling ye a liar because ye do for i guess ye see more nor most holy mother purtect us but whisht now you mustnt look at him any more the carriage came to the brow of the mountain and down below was their destination castletownrock a mere village consisting principally of one long steep street some distance below the village again the great green waves of a tempestuous sea broke on a dangerous coast the two races dont fuse papa was saying to mamma in this part of the country at all events theres an irish and an english side to the street the english side has a flagged footpath and the houses are neat and clean and welltodo on the irish side all is poverty and dirt and confusion just outside the village a little group of people waited to welcome themmr macbean the rector captain keene the three misses keene and jim the carriage was stopped and they all got out and walked the rest of the distance to the inn where they were to stay till the furniture arrived on the way down the street they saw their new home it made no impression on beth but she recognised the roman catholic chapel on the other side of the road from papas drawing only it looked different because there was no snow the gentleman and lady who kept the inn mr and mrs mayne with their two daughters met them at the door and shook hands with mamma and kissed the children then they went into the inn parlour and there was wine and plumcake and dr and mrs macdougall came with their little girl lucy who was eleven years old mildreds age mr macbean the rector who was tall and thin and had a brown beard that waggled when he talked drew beth to his side and began to ask her questions just when she wanted so much to hear what everybody else was saying too well and what have you been taught he began beth gazed at him blankly do you love god he proceeded putting his hand on her head beth looked round the room perplexed then fixed her eyes on his beard and watched it waggle with interest ask her if she knows anything about the other gentleman captain keene put in jocoselyheres to his health and he emptied his glass beths great eyes settled upon him with sudden fixity i suppose you never heard of the devil he proceeded oh yes i have was beths instant and unexpected rejoinder the devil is a bad road there was an explosion of laughter at this but you said so papa beth remonstrated indignantly my dear child i said just the reverse whats the reverse said beth picturing another personality there now that will do mrs caldwell interposed little bodies must be seen and not heard mr macbean stroked beths headthere is something in here i expect he observed not much im afraid mrs caldwell answered weve hardly been able to teach her anything ah mr macbean ejaculated reflecting on the specimen he had heard of the method pursued you must let me see what i can do chapter v in a few days all the bustle of getting into the new house began the furniture arrived in irregular batches some of it came and some of it did not come when a box was opened there was nothing that was wanted in it only things that did not go together and mamma was worried and papa was cross the workpeople were wild and ignorant and only trustworthy as long as they were watched they were unaccustomed to the most ordinary comforts of civilised life particularly in the way of furniture when the family arrived at the house one morning they found mrs caldwells wardrobe mahogany drawers and other articles of bedroom furniture set up in conspicuous positions in the sittingroom and the carpenter was much ruffled when he was ordered to take them upstairs shure its mad they are he remonstrated to one of the servants to have sich foine things put in a bedroom where nobodyll see thim the men came up from the coastguard station to scrape the walls and ellis the petty officer used the breadknife and broke it and papa bawled at him beth was sorry for ellis the house was built of stone and very damp there was a great deal of space in it but little accommodation on the groundfloor were a huge hall kitchen pantry and sittingroom all flagged the sittingroom was the only one in the house and had to be used as diningroom and drawingroom but it was large enough for that and to spare there was a big yard and a big garden too and riley was in the stable and biddy and anne in the kitchen and kitty in the nursery this increase of establishment which meant so much to the parents was accepted as a matter of course by the children kitty told riley and biddy and anne about what beth had seen on gallows hill and they often asked beth what she saw when she used to sit looking at nothing then beth would think things and describe them because it seemed to please the servants they used to be very serious and shake their heads and cross themselves with muttered ejaculations but all the time they liked it this encouraged beth and she used to think and think of things to tell them beth was exceedingly busy in her own way at this time her mind was being rapidly stored with impressions and nothing escaped her the four children and kitty were put all together in one great nursery an arrangement of which kitty with the fastidious delicacy of a strict catholic did not at all approve indeed mem she said im thinkin master jims too sharp to be in the nursery wid his sisters now nonsense kitty mrs caldwell exclaimed how can you be so evilminded master jims only a childa baby of ten och thin mem its an ouldfashioned baby he is said kitty and im thinkin its a bit of a screen or a curtain id like for dressin behind if hes to be wid us i have nothing of the kind to give you mrs caldwell rejoined and afterwards she made merry with papa about kittys prudishness but kitty was right as it happened jim had been left pretty much to his own devices during the time he had been alone with his father at castletownrock captain caldwells theory was that boys would look after themselves and the sooner you let em the sooner youd make men of em blood will tell sir your gentlemans son is a match for any ragamuffina theory which jim justified in many a free fight but during the suspension of hostilities he hobnobbed with the ragamuffins who took a terrible revenge for by the time mrs caldwell arrived jim was thoroughly corrupted kitty took precautions however she arranged the nurserylife so that master jim did not associate with his sisters more than was absolutely necessary she had him up in the morning bathed and sent off to school before she disturbed the little girls and at night she never left the nursery until he was asleep out of her slender purse she bought some print and fixed up a curtain for his sisters to dress behind and all else that she had to do for the children was done decently and in order she had almost entire charge of them their mother being engrossed with her husband whose health and spirits had already begun to suffer from overwork and exposure to the climate kitty was teaching her charges dainty ways mentally as well as physically when she had washed them at night she made them purge their little souls of all the sins of the day in prayer and in the morning she taught them how to fortify themselves with good resolutions beth took naturally to the catholic training and solemnly dedicated herself to the blessed virgin mildred conformed but without enthusiasm the fouryearold baby bernadine lisped little aves but jim in the words of captain keene the old buffalo as their father called him sneered at that sort of thing as only fit for women men drink whisky said jim puffing out his chest true for ye said kitty but ive been told that them as drinks whisky here goes dry in the next world well i shall drink whisky and kiss the girls all the same said jim and i wouldnt be a catholic now not to save me sowl i owe the catholics a grudge they insulted me how so asked kitty at the midnight mass last christmas father john got up and ordered all heretics out of the sacred house of god and pat fagan ses to me are ye a heretic and i ses i am pat fagan thin out ye go ses he and but for that id a bin a catholic so see what you lose by insulting a gentleman whats insulting beth asked jim slapped her face thats insulting he explained beth struck him back promptly and a scuffle ensued oh but its little divils yez are the lot of ye cried kitty as she separated them during fits of nervous irritability captain caldwell had a habit of pacing about the house for hours at a time one evening he happened to be walking up and down on the landing outside the nursery door which was a little way open and his attention was attracted by beths voice she was reciting a catholic hymn softly but with great feeling as if every word of it were a pleasure to her whats the meaning of this he demanded breaking in on her devotions what papistical abominations have you been teaching the child kitty shure sorr its jest a bit of a hymn said kitty bravely but her heart sank and the colour left her lips captain caldwell was furious caroline he called peremptorily going to the head of the stairs caroline come up directly mrs caldwell fussed up in hot haste do you know captain caldwell demanded that this woman is making idolaters of your children i heard this child just now praying to the virgin mary do you hear mrs caldwells pale face flushed with anger how dare you do such a thing you wicked woman she exclaimed i shall not keep you another day in the house pack up your things at once and go the first thing in the morning o mamma beth cried youre not going to send kitty away kitty kitty you wont go and leave me there you see captain caldwell exclaimed you see the influence shes got over the child already thats the jesuit all over an ignorant woman like you who can hardly read and write setting up to teach my children indeedhow dare you mrs caldwell stormed well mem i am an ignorant woman that can hardly read and write kitty answered with dignity but i could tell you some things yell not find out in all yer books and may be theyd surprise ye kitty yell not go and leave me beth repeated passionately troth an id stay for your sake if i could said kitty fur its a bad time im afraid yell be havin once im gone do you hear that captain caldwell exclaimed now you see what comes of getting people of this kind into the house shes going to make out that the child is illtreated one of my children illtreated mrs caldwell cried scornfully who would believe her then turning to beth if i ever hear you repeat a word that wicked woman has taught you ill beat you as long as i can stand over you kitty looked straight into mrs caldwells face and smiled sarcastically but uttered not a word how dare you stand there grinning at me in that impertinent way you low woman mrs caldwell exclaimed with great exasperation i believe you are a jesuit sent here to corrupt my children but go you shall tomorrow morning oh ill go mem kitty answered quietly she knew the case was hopeless there now said mrs caldwell turning to her husband do you see that shows you she doesnt care a bit beth was clinging to kitty but her mother seized her by the arm and flung her half across the room and was about to follow her but captain caldwell interfered that will do he said significantly its no use venting your rage on the child in future choose your nurses better then in future give me better advice when i consult you about them mrs caldwell retorted following him out of the room beth clung to kitty the whole night long and had to be torn from her in the morning screaming and kicking she stood in front of her mother her eyes and cheeks ablaze i shall pray to the blessed virgini shall pray to the blessed virginevery hour of my life she gasped and you cant prevent me beat me as long as you can stand over me if you like but ill only pray the harder for gods sake mem kitty cried clasping her hands let that child alone shure shes a sweet lamb if youd give her a chance but ye put the divil into her wid yer shakin an yer batin and mischiefll come of it sooner or later mark my words when kitty had gone mrs caldwell shut beth up in the nursery with baby bernadine beth threw herself on the floor and sobbed until she had exhausted her tears then she gathered herself together and sat on the floor with her hands clasped round her legs her chin on her knees looking up dreamily at the sky through the nursery window her pathetic little face was all drawn and haggard and hopeless but presently she began to sing ave maria mother of the desolate guide of the unfortunate hear from thy starry home our prayer if sorrow will await us tyrants vex and hate us teach us thine own most patient part to bear sancta maria when we are sighing when we are dying give to us thine aid of prayer as she sang comfort came to her and the little voice swelled in volume baby bernadine also sat on the floor opposite to beth and gazed at her much impressed when she had finished singing beth became aware of her sisters reverent attention and put out her tongue at her bernadine laughed then beth crisped up her hands till they looked like claws and began to make a variety of hideous faces bernadine thought it was a game and smiled at first but finally she ceased to recognise her sister and shrieked aloud in terror beth heard her mother hurrying up and got behind the door so that her mother could not see her as she opened it mrs caldwell hurried up to the babythe darling then what have they been doing to youand beth made her escape as she crossed the hall some one knocked at the front door beth opened it a crack captain keene was outside when she saw him she recollected something she had heard about his religious opinions and began to question him eagerly his answers were apparently exciting for presently she flung the door wide open to let him in then ran to the foot of the stairs and shouted at the top of her voice papa papa come down come directly heres old keene the old buffalo and he says there is no god captain caldwell descended the stairs hurriedly but on catching a glimpse of his countenance beth did not wait to receive him she had to pass through the kitchen to get into the yard it was the busy time of the day and biddy and anne and riley all without shoes or stockings were playing football with a bladder biddy tried to detain beth arrah bad luck to ye biddy beth cried imitating the brogue let me go dye hear holy mother preserve us biddy exclaimed crossing herself dont ye ever be afther wishin anybody bad luck miss beth shure yell bring it if ye do thin dont ye ever be afther stoppin me when i want to be going biddy beth rejoined stamping her foot or ill blast ye she added as she passed out into the sunlight fowls and ducks and jims pet pigeons were the only creatures moving in the yard beth stood among them watching them for a little then went to the cornbin in the stable and got some oats there was a shallow tub of water for the birds to drink beth hunkered down beside it and held out her hand full of corn the pigeons were very tame and presently a beautiful bluerock came up confidently and began to eat his eyes were a deep rich orange colour beth caught him and stroked his glossy plumage delighting in the exquisite metallic sheen on his neck and breast the colour gave her an almost painful sensation of pleasure which changed on a sudden into a fit of blind exasperation her grief for the loss of kitty had gripped her again with a horrid twinge she clenched her teeth in her pain her fingers closed convulsively round the pigeons throat and she held him out at arms length and shook him viciously till the nictitating membrane dropped over his eyes his head sank back his bill opened and he hung from her hand an inert heap of ruffled feathers then the tension of her nerves relaxed it was a relief to have crushed the life out of something she let the bird drop and stood looking at him as an animal might have looked with an impassive face which betrays no shade of emotion as she did so however the bird showed signs of life and suddenly quickening into interest she stooped down turned him over and examined him then sprinkled him with water and made him drink he rapidly revived and when he was able to stand she let him go and he was soon feeding among his companions as if nothing had happened beth watched them for a little with the same animallike expressionless gravity of countenance then moved off unconcernedly she never mentioned the incident to any one and never forgot it but her only feeling about it was that the pigeon had had a narrow escape chapter vi beth was a fine instrument sensitive to a touch and considering the way she was handled it would have been a wonder if discordant effects had not been constantly produced upon her hers was a nature with a wide range it is probable that every conceivable impulse was latent in her every possibility of good or evil exactly which would predominate depended upon the influences of these early years and almost all the influences she came under were haphazard there was no intelligent direction of her thoughts no systematic training to form good habits her brothers were sent to school as soon as they were old enough and so had the advantage of regular routine and strict discipline from the first but a couple of hours a day for lessons was considered enough for the little girls and for the rest of the time so long as they were on the premises and not naughty that is to say gave no trouble it was taken for granted that they were safe morally and physically neither of their parents seem to have suspected their extreme precocity and there is no doubt that beth suffered seriously in after life from the mistakes of those in authority over her at this period people admired her bright eyes without realising that she could see with them and not only that she could see but that she could not help seeing but even if they had realised it they would merely have scolded her for learning anything in that way which they preferred that she should not know they were not sufficiently intelligent themselves to perceive that it is not what we know of things but what we think of them which makes for good or evil beth was accordingly allowed to run wild and expected to see nothing but all the time her mind was being involuntarily stored with observations from which in time to come for want of instruction she would be forced to draw her ownoften erroneousconclusions kittys departure was beths first great grief and she suffered terribly the prop and stay of her little life had gone the comfort and kindness the order and discipline which were essential to her nature mrs caldwell was a good woman who would certainly do what she thought best for her children but she was exhausted by the unconscionable production of a too numerous family a family which she had neither the means nor the strength to bring up properly her husbands health too grew ever more precarious and she found herself obliged to do all in her power to help him with his duties which were arduous there was a good deal that she could do in the way of writing official letters and managing moneymatters tasks for which she was much better fitted than for the management of children but the children meanwhile had to be left to the care of othersnot that that would have been a bad thing for them had their mother had sufficient discrimination to enable her to choose the proper kind of people to be with them unfortunately for everybody however mrs caldwell had been brought up on the oldfashioned principle that absolute ignorance of human nature is the best qualification for a wife and mother and she was consequently quite unprepared for any possibility which had not formed part of her own simple and limited personal experience she never suspected for one thing that a servants conversation could be undesirable if her appearance and her character from her last mistress were satisfactory and therefore when kitty had gone she put anne in her place without misgiving annes principal recommendation being that she was a nicelooking girl and had pretty deferential manners anne came from one of the cabins on the irish side of the road where people pigs poultry with an occasional cow goat or donkey herded together indiscriminately the windows were about a foot square and were not made to open sometimes they had glass in them but were oftener stopped up with rags before the doors were heaps of manure and pools of stagnant water there was no regular footway but a mere beaten track in front of the cabins and this on wet days was ankledeep in mud the women hung about the doors all day long knitting the mens blue stockings and did little else apparently both men and women were usually in a torpid state the result doubtless of breathing a poisoned atmosphere and of insufficient food it took strong stimulants to rouse them love hate jealousy whisky battle murder and sudden death their conversation was gross and they were very immoral but it is hardly necessary to say so for with men women children and animals all crowded together in such surroundings and the morbid craving for excitement to which people who have no comfort or wholesome interest in life fall a prey immorality is inevitable it was the boast of the place that there were no illegitimate children it would have been a better sign if there had been mrs caldwell true to her training lived opposite to all this vice and squalor serenely indifferent to it anne therefore who knew nothing about the management of children and was not in any respect a proper person to have the charge of them had it all her own way in the nursery and her way was to do nothing that she could help she used to call the children in the morning and then leave them to their own devices the moment they were awake which was pretty soon for they were full of life they began to batter each other with pillows dance about the room in their nightdresses pitch tents with the bedclothes on the floor and make noise enough to bring their mother down upon them then anne would be summoned and come hurrying up and help them to huddle on their clothes somehow she never washed them but encouraged them to perform their own ablutions which they did with the end of a towel dipped in a jug the consequence was they were generally in a very dirty state they took their meals with their parents and papa would notice the dirt eventually and storm at mamma in italian when words would ensue in a tone which made the children quake then mamma would storm at anne for whom the children felt sorry and the result would be a bath which they bore with fortitude for fear of getting anne into further trouble they even made good resolutions about washing themselves which they kept for a few days then however they began to shirk again and had again to be scrubbed the resolutions of a child must be shored up by kindly supervision otherwise it is hardly likely that they will cement into good habits beth suffered from a continual sense of discomfort in those days for want of proper attention all her clothing fitted badly and were fastened on with anything that came to hand in the way of tape and buttons her hair was ill brushed and she was so continually found fault with that her sense of selfrespect was checked in its development and she lost all faith in her own power to do anything right or well the consequence was the most profound disheartenment endured in silence with the exquisite uncomplaining fortitude of a little child it made its mark on her countenance however in a settled expression of discontent which being mistaken for a bad disposition repelled people and made her many enemies people generally said that mildred was a dear but beth did not look pleasant and for many a long day to come very few troubled themselves to try and make her look so it cannot be said that beths parents neglected their children on the contrary her father thought much of their education and of their future it was the allimportance of the present that did not strike him and so with her mother neither parent was careless but their care stopped short too soon and it is astonishing the amount of liberty the children had they were sent out of doors as soon as they were dressed in the morning because sunshine and air are so essential to children if they went for a walk anne accompanied them but very often anne was wanted and then the children were left to loiter about the garden or stableyard where doubtless with the help of reasoning powers much in advance of her age beth had soon heard and seen enough to make her feel a certain contempt for her fathers veracity when he told her that she had originally been brought to the house in the doctors black bag after kittys departure beth had many a lonely hour and the time hung heavy on her hands mildred her senior by four years was of a simpler disposition and always able to amuse herself playing with the baby bernadine or with toys which were no distraction to beth mildred besides was fond of reading but books to be deciphered remained a wonder and a mystery to beth jim went to the national school the only one in the place with all the other little boys the master was a young curate who gave mildred and beth their lessons also when schoolhours were over beth used to yearn for lessontime just for the sake of being obliged to do something but lessons were disappointing for the curate devoted himself to mildred who was docile and studious and took no special pains to interest beth and consequently she soon wearied of the dull restraint and became troublesome sometimes she was boisterous and then the tutor had to spend half his time in chasing her to rescue his hat a book an inkbottle or some other article which she threatened to destroy and sometimes she was so depressed that he had to give up trying to teach her and just do his best to distract her in her eighth year she was able to follow the churchservice in the prayerbook and make out the hymns but that was all sundayschool was held in the church and was attended by all the unmarried parishioners mildred taught some of the tiny mites and beth was put into her class at first but beth had no respect for mildred and had consequently to be removed she was expected to learn the collect for the day and the verse of a hymn every sunday but never by any chance knew either no one ever thought of reading the thing over to her and fixing her attention on it by some little explanation and learning by heart from a book did not come naturally to her she learned by ear easily enough but not by sight the hymns and prayers which kitty had repeated to her she very soon picked up but kitty had true sympathetic insight to inform her of what the child required and all her little lessons were proper to some occasion and had comfort in them what beth learned now on the contrary often filled her with gloom some of the hymns such as when gathering clouds around i view and days are dark and friends are few made her especially miserable it was always a dark day to her when she repeated it with heavy clouds collecting overhead and herself a solitary little speck on the mountain side wandering alone chapter vii it is significant to note that church figures largely in beths recollection of this time but religion not at all there was in fact no connection between the two in her mind both captain and mrs caldwell protested strongly against what they called cant and they seemed to have called everything cant except an occasional cold reading aloud of the bible on sundays and the bald observance of the church service the bible they read aloud to the children without expounding it and the services they attended without comment displays of religious emotion in everyday life they regarded as symptoms of insanity and if they heard people discuss religion with enthusiasm and profess to love the lord they were genuinely shocked all that kind of thing they thought such cant and so like those horrid dissenters which made them extra careful that the children should hear nothing of the sort this from their point of view was right and wise in beths case especially for her unsatisfied soul was of the quality which soon yearns for the fine fulness of faith her little heart would have filled to bursting with her first glad conception of the love divine and her whole being would have stirred to speak her emotion even though speech meant martyrdom thanks to the precautions of her parents however she heard nothing to stimulate her natural tendency to religious fervour after kittys departure and gradually the image of our blessed lady faded from her mind and was succeeded by that of the god of her parents a deathdealing deity delighting in blood whom she was warned to fear and from whom she did accordingly shrink with such holy horror that when she went to church she tried to think of anything but him this was how it happened that church instead of being the threshold of the next world to her mind became the centre of this where she made many interesting observations of men and manners for in spite of her backwardness in the schoolroom beths intellect advanced with a bound at this period she had left her native place an infant on whose mind some chance impressions had been made and lingered she arrived at castletownrock with the power to observe for herself and even to reflect upon what she sawof course to a certain extent only but still the power had come and was far in advance of her years so far it was circumstances that had impressed her she knew one person from another but that was all now however she began to be interested in people for themselves apart from any incident in which they figured and most of her time was spent in a curiously close but quite involuntary study of those about her and of their relations to each other church was often a sore penance to the children it was so long and cold and dull but they set off on sunday happy in the consciousness of their best hats and jackets nevertheless and the first part of the time was not so bad for then they had sundayschool and the three misses keenemary sophia and lenoreand the two misses mayne honor and kathleen and mr and mrs small the vicar and his wife and the curate were all there talking and teaching beth remembered nothing about the teaching except that on one occasion mr macbean the rector tried to explain the meaning of the trefoil on the ends of the pews to mildred and herself but she could think of nothing but the way his beard wagged as he spoke and was disconcerted when he questioned her he had promised to be a friend to beth but he was a delicate man and not able to live much at castletownrock where the climate was rigorous so that she seldom saw him when sundayschool was over the children went up to the gallery their pew and the keenes roomy boxes took up the whole front of it mrs caldwell always sat up in the gallery with the children but captain caldwell often sat downstairs in the rectorypew to be near the fire when he sat in the gallery he wore a little black cap to keep off the draught he and mr ohalloran the squire and captain keene stood and talked in the aisle sometimes before the service commenced one sunday they kept looking up at the children in the gallery ill bet mildred will be the handsomest woman mr ohalloran was saying ill back beth captain keene observed if all the men in the place are not after her soon im no judge of her sex eh oh dont look at me said captain caldwell complacently i cant pretend to say but lets hope that theyll go off well at all events theyll have every chance i can give them of making good matches beth heard her father repeat this conversation to her mother afterwards but was too busy wondering what a handsome woman was to understand that it was her own charms which had been appraised but mildred understood and was elated mr ohalloran the squire had a red beard which was an offence to beth his wife wore bonnets about which everybody used to make remarks to mrs caldwell beth understood that mrs ohalloran was young and pretty and had three charming children but was not happy because of sophia keene just fancy she heard mrs small the vicars wife say to her mother once just fancy he was in a carriage with them at the races and stayed with sophia the whole time and poor mrs ohalloran left at home alone i call it scandalous but you know what sophia is mrs small concluded significantly mrs caldwell drew herself up and looked at mrs small but said nothing yet somehow beth knew that she too was unhappy because of sophia keene beth was not on familiar terms with her mother and would not have dared to embrace her spontaneously or make any other demonstration of affection but she was loyally devoted to her all the same and would gladly have stabbed sophia keene and have done battle with the whole of the rest of the family on her mothers behalf had occasion offered she was curled up among the fuchsias on the windowseat of the sittingroom one day unobserved by her parents who entered the room together after she had settled herself there and began to discuss the keenes you did not tell me henry you spent all your time with them before we came mrs caldwell said reproachfully why should i he answered with a jaunty affectation of ease it is not why you should his wife said with studied gentleness but why you should not it seems so strange making a mystery of it i described old keene to youthe old buffalo he replied and ill describe the girls now if you like mary is a gawk sophia is as yellow as a ducks foot and lenore is halfwitted the keenes were ignorant idle goodtempered young women and kind to the children whom they often took to bathe with them they were seldom able to go into the sea itself for it was a wild tempestuous coast but there were lovely clear pools on the rocky shore natural stone baths left full of water when the tide went out sheltered from the wind by tall dark precipitous cliffs and warmed by the sun and there they used to dabble by the hour together anne went with them and it was a pretty sight the four young women in white chemises that clung to them when wet and the three lovely childrenlittle white nudities with bright brown hairscampering over the rocks splashing each other in the pools or lying about on warm sunny slabs resting and chattering one day beth found some queer things in a pool and sophia told her they were barnacles they stick to the bottom of a ship she said and grow heavier and heavier till at last the ship can make no more way and comes to a standstill in a shining sea where the water is as smooth as a mirror you would think it was a mirror in fact if it did not heave gently up and down like your breast when you breathe and every time it heaves it flushes some colour blue or green or pink or purple and the barnacles swell and swell at the bottom of the ship till at last they burst in two with a loud report and then the sailors rush to the side of the ship and look over and there they see a flock of beautiful big white geese coming up out of the water and sometimes they shoot the geese but if they do a great storm comes on and engulfs the ship and they are all drowned but sometimes they stand stockstill amazed and then the birds rise up out of the air on their great white wings up up drifting along together till they look like the clouds over there then a gentle breeze springs up and the ship sails away safely into port and where do the geese go beth demanded with breathless interest they make for the shore too and in the dead of winter on stormy nights they fly over the land uttering strange cries and if you wake and hear them it means somebody is going to die beths eyes were staring far out beyond the great green atlantic rollers that came bursting in round the sheltering headland whitecrested with foam flying up the beach with a crash and scattering showers of spray that sparkled in the sunshine she could see the ships and the barnacles and the silent sea heaving great sighs and flushing with fine colour in the act and the geese and the sailors peering over the side and shooting at them and sinking immediately in a storm but also sailing into a safe haven triumphantly where the sun shone on white houses although at the same time it was dark night and overhead there were strange cries that made her cowerbeth cried sophia whats the matter with you child beth returned with a start and stared at heri know who it will be she said who whatll be miss beth anne asked in awe wholl die said beth you mustnt say beth youll bring bad luck if you do miss keene interposed hastily im not going to say beth answered dreamily but i know you shouldnt have told the child that story miss anne said shure ye know what she isshe sees anne nodded her head several times significantly i forgot said sophia shell forget too said mary philosophically i say beth she went on raising herself on her elbowshe was lying prone on a slab of rock in the sunwhat does your mother think of us beth roused herself i dont know she answered earnestly she never says but i know what papa thinks of you he says marys a gawk sophia is as yellow as a ducks foot and lenore is only halfwitted the effect of this announcement astonished beth the misses keene instead of being interested all looked at her as if they did not like her and anne burst out laughing when they got in anne told mrs caldwell who flushed suddenly and covered her mouth with her handkerchief yes mamma mildred exclaimed with importance beth did say so and mary tossed her head and sophia sneered what is sneered beth demanded importunately what is sneered o beth dont bother so mildred exclaimed irritably its when you curl up your lip beth how could you be so naughty mrs caldwell said at last from behind her handkerchief dont you know you should never repeat things you hear said a lady never repeats a private conversation whats a private conversation said beth mrs caldwell gave her a broad definition during which she lowered her handkerchief and beth discovered that she was trying not to smile this was beths first lesson in honour which was her mothers god and she felt the influence of it all her life later in the day beth was curled up on the windowseat among the fuchsias looking out behind the thatched cabins opposite the sombre mountains rolled up dark and distinct to the sky but beth would not look at them if she could help it they oppressed her it was a close afternoon and the window was wide open a barelegged woman in a short petticoat stood in an indolent attitude leaning against a doorpost opposite a young man in low shoes light blue stockings buff kneebreeches a bluetailed coat with brass buttons and a soft highcrowned felt hat came strolling up the street with his hands in his pockets hallo biddy he remarked as he passed the woman youre all swelled yes she answered tranquilly ive been drinking buttermilk well lets hope itll be a boy he rejoined the woman looked up and down the street complacently presently beth saw honor and kathleen mayne come out of the inn the maynes used to pet the children and play the piano to them when they were at the inn and had been very good to jim also when he was there alone with his father before the family arrived their manners were gentle and caressing and they did their best to win their way into mrs caldwells good graces but at first she coldly repulsed them which hurt beth very much the maynes however did not at all understand that they were being repulsed a kindly feeling existed among all classes in those remote irish villages the squires family the doctors clergymans drapers and innkeepers visited each other and shook hands when they met there was no feeling of condescension on the one hand or of pretension on the other but mrs caldwell had the strong class prejudice which makes such stupid snobs of the english it was not what people were but who they were that was all important to her and she would have bowed down cheerfully as whole neighbourhoods do and felt exhilarated by the notice of some stupid county magnate who had not heart enough to be loved head enough to distinguish himself or soul enough to get him into heaven she was a lady and mayne was an innkeeper his daughters might amuse the children but as to associating with mrs caldwell that was absurd the girls were not to be rebuffed however they persevered in their kindly attentions making excuses to each other for mrs caldwells manner explaining her coldness by the fact that she was english and flattering her until finally they won their way into her good graces and so effectually too that when they brought a young magpie in a basket for beth one day her mother graciously allowed her to accept it beth liked the maynes but now as they came up the road she slid from the windowseat she knew they would stop and talk if she waited and she did not want to talk she was thinking about something and it irritated her to be interrupted so she tore across the hall and through the kitchen out into the yard impelled by an imperative desire to be alone the magpie was the first pet of her own she had ever had and she loved it at night it was chained to a perch stuck in the wall of the stableyard on the other side of that wall was the yard of murphy the farrier the magpie soon became tame enough to be let loose by day and beth always went to release it the first thing in the morning and give it its breakfast it came hopping to meet her now and followed her into the garden the garden was entered by an archway under the outbuildings which divided it from the stableyard it was very long but narrow for its length on the right was a high wall but on the left was a low oneat least one half of it was lowand beth could look over it into the farriers garden next door the other half had been raised by captain caldwell on the understanding that if he raised one half the farrier would raise the other but the farrier had proved perfidious the wall was built without mortar of rough uncut stones captain caldwell had his half neatly finished off at the top with sods but murphys piece was still all broken down the children used to climb up by it on to the raised half and dance there at the risk of life and limb and jeer at murphy as he dug his potatoes calling his attention to the difference between the irish and english half of the wall till he lost his temper and pelted them this was the signal for a battle the children returned his potatoes with stones by way of interest and hit him as often as he hit them needless to say their parents were not in the garden at the time they had a great contempt for the farrier because he fought them and he used to go about the village complaining of them and their tratement of him the little divils spoilin the pace of the whole neighbourhood there was a high wall at the end of the garden and beth liked to sit on the top of it she went there now picked up her magpie and climbed up with difficulty by way of pat murphys broken bit immediately below her was a muddy lane beyond which the land sloped down to the sea and as she sat there the sound of the waves that dreamy soft murmur for which we have no word filled the interstices of her consciousness with something that satisfied she was not left long in peace to enjoy it that afternoon however for the farrier was at work in his garden below and presently he looked up and saw the magpie there ye are agin miss beth wi yer baste of a burrd bad luck to it he exclaimed crossing himself shure dont i tell ye ivery day uf your life its wan fur sorrow bad luck to yerself pat murphy beth rejoined promptly its a foine cheek ye have to be spakin to a gentlemans daughter an you not a man uv yer wurrd not a man o me wurrd what dye mane said murphy firing look at that wall beth answered didnt ye promise yed build it an so i will when yer father gives me the stones he promised me murphy replied its a moighty foine mon uv his wurrd he is is it my father yer maning pat murphy beth asked it is he said sticking his spade in the ground emphatically ye know yer lying said beth my father promised you no stones hes not a fool i niver met a knave that was pat observed turning over a huge spadeful of earth and then straightening himself to look up at her beths instinct was always to fight when she was in a rage words break no bones and she preferred to break bones at such times it was some seconds before she saw the full force of pats taunt but the moment she did she seized the largest loose stone within reach on the top of the wall and shied it at him it struck him full in the face and cut his cheek open thatll teach ye said beth blazing the man turned on her with a very ugly look put yer spade down she said im not afraid of you miss beth miss beth some one called from the end of the garden murphy stuck his spade in the ground and wiped his jaw yell pay for this ye divils limb he muttered yew an yours miss beth miss beth im coming beth rejoined irritably and slid from the wall to the ground regardless of the rough loose stones she scattered in her descent yell foind me ready to pay when ye send in yer bill pat she called out as she ran down the garden the children were to have tea at the vicarage that day and anne had been sent to fetch her in the drawingroom at the vicarage there was a big baywindow which looked out across a desolate stretch of bog to a wild headland against which the waves beat tempestuously in almost all weathers the headland itself was high but the giant breakers often dashed up far above it and fell in showers of spray on the grass at the top there was a telescope in the window at the vicarage and people used to come to see the sight and went into raptures over it beth standing out of the way unnoticed would gaze too fascinated but it was the attraction of repulsion the cruel force of the great waves agitated her and at the same time made her unutterably sad her heart beat painfully when she watched them her breath became laboured and it was only with an effort that she could keep back her sobs it was not fear that oppressed her but a horrible sort of excitement which so gained upon her on that afternoon in particular that she felt she must shriek aloud or make her escape if she showed any emotion she would be laughed at if she made her escape she would probably be whipped she preferred to be whipped so watching her opportunity she quietly slipped away at home the window of the sittingroom was still wide open and as she ran down the street she noticed some country people peeping in curiously and apparently astonished by the luxury they beheld beth who was picking up irish rapidly understood some exclamations she overheard as she approached and felt flattered for the furniture she ran up the steps and opened the front door good day to ye all she said sociably will ye not come in and have a look round now do she led the way as she spoke and the country people followed her all agape in the hall they paused to wonder at the cocoanut matting but when they stood on the soft pile carpet so grateful to their bare feet in the sittingroom and looked round they lowered their voices respectfully and this gave beth a sudden sensation of superiority she began to show them the things the pictures on the walls the subjects of which she explained to them the eggshell china which she held up to the light that they might see how thin it was and some eastern and western curios her father had brought home from various voyages she told them of tropical heat and canadian cold and began to be elated herself when she found all that she had ever heard on the subject flowing fluently from her lips the front door had been left open and the passersby looked in to see what was going on and then entered uninvited neighbours too came over from the irish side of the road so that the room gradually filled and as her audience increased beth grew excited and talked away eloquently lord one man exclaimed with a sigh on looking round the room its aisy to see why the likes of these looks down on the likes of us eh dear yes a woman with a petticoat over her head solemnly responded the durrty heretics a slouching fellow with a flat white face muttered under his breath but if they benefit here theyll burn hereafter holy jasus be praised will they said beth turning on him will they burrn hereafter bapfaced flanagan no they wont theyll hunt ye out of heaven as they hunted ye out o maclone oh the orange militia walked into maclone and hunted the catholics out of the town ri turen nuren nuren naddio right tur nuren nee she sang it out at the top of her shrill little voice executing a wardance of defiance to the tune and concluding with an elaborate curtsey as she recovered herself she became aware of her father standing in the doorway his lips were white and there was a queer look in his face oh so this is your party is it miss beth he said you ask your friends in and then you insult them i see beth was still effervescing she put her hands behind her back and answered boldly deed thin he insulted me papa it was bapfaced flanagan he said we were durrty heretics andandill not stand that its a free country captain caldwell looked round and the people melted from the room under his eye then anne appeared from somewhere anne do you teach the children partysongs he demanded shure they dont need taching yer honour said anne disconcerted miss beth knows em all and she shouts em at the top of her voice down the street till the men shake their fists at her why do you do that beth her father demanded i like to feel beth began gasping out each word with a mighty effort to express herselfi like to feelthat i can make them shake their fists her father looked at her again very queerly will i take her to the nursery sir anne asked beth turned on her impatiently and said something in irish which made anne grin beth did not understand her father in this mood and she wanted to see more of him whats that shes saying to you anne he asked ohsure shes just blessin me yer honour anne answered unabashed i believe you captain caldwell said dryly as he stretched himself on the sofa go and fetch a hairbrush while anne was out of the room he turned to beth ill give you a penny he said if youll tell me what you said to anne ill tell you for nothing beth answered i said yer soul to the devil for an interfering hussy captain caldwell burst out laughing and laughed till anne returned with the brush now brush my hair he said to beth and beth went and stood beside the sofa and brushed and brushed now with one hand and now with the other till she ached all over with the effort her father suffered from atrocious headaches and this was the one thing that relieved him there thats punishment enough for today he said at last beth retired to the foot of the couch and leant there looking at him solemnly with the hairbrush still in her hand thats no punishment she observed what do you mean he asked i mean i like it she said id brush till i dropped if it did you any good captain caldwell looked up at her and it was as if he had seen the child for the first time beth he said after a while would you like to come out with me on the car tomorrow deed then i would papa beth answered eagerly then there was a pause during which beth rubbed her back against the end of the couch thoughtfully and looked at the wall opposite as if she could see through it her father watched her for a little time with a frown upon his forehead from the pain in his head what are you thinking of beth he said at last ive got to be whipped tonight she answered drearily and i wish i hadnt i do get so tired of being whipped and shaken her little face looked pinched and pathetic as she spoke and for the first time her father had a suspicion of what punishment was to this childa thing as inevitable as disease a continually recurring torture but quite without effect upon her conductand his heart contracted with a qualm of pity what are you going to be whipped for now he asked we went to tea at the vicarage and i ran away home why because of the great green waves they rush up the rockswishstst she took a step forward and threw up her little arms in illustrationthen fall and roll back and gather and come rushing on again and i feel every timeevery timethat they are coming right at meshe clutched her throat as if she were suffocating and if i had stayed i should have shrieked and then i should have been whipped so i came away but you expect to be whipped for coming away yes but you see i dont have the waves as well and mamma wont say i was afraid were you afraid beth her father asked no beth retorted stamping her foot indignantly if the waves did come at me i could stand it its the comingcomingcomingi cant bear it makes me ache here she clutched at her throat and chest again captain caldwell closed his eyes he felt that he was beginning to make this childs acquaintance and wished he had tried to cultivate it sooner you shall not be whipped tonight beth he said presently looking at her with a kindly smile instantly an answering smile gleamed on the childs face transfiguring her and by the light of it her father realised how seldom he had seen her smile unfortunately for beth however while her countenance was still irradiated her mother swooped down upon her mrs caldwell had come hurrying home in a rage in search of beth and now mistaking that smile for a sign of defiance she seized upon her and had beaten her severely before it was possible to interfere beth dazed by this sudden onslaught staggered when she let her go and stretched out her little hands as if groping for some support it wasnt your faultit wasnt your fault she gasped her first instinct being to exonerate her father captain caldwell had started up and caught his wife by the arm thats enough he said harshly you are going altogether the wrong way to work with the child let this be the last time do you understand beth go to the nursery and ask anne to get you some tea a sharp pain shot through his head he had jumped up too quickly and now fell back on the sofa with a groan oh let me brush it again beth cried in an agony of sympathy her father opened his haggard eyes and smiled go to the nursery like a good child he said and get some tea beth went without another word but all that evening her mind was with her parents in the sittingroom wonderingwondering what they were saying to each other chapter viii next day beth jumped out of bed early and washed herself all over in an excess of grateful zeal because she was to be taken out on the car as soon as she had had her breakfast she ran into the yard to feed her magpie its perch was in a comfortable corner sheltered by the great turfstack which had been built up against the wall that divided the caldwells yard from that of pat murphy the farrier beth in wild spirits ran round the stack calling mag mag as she went but mag alas was never more to respond to her call he was hanging by the leg from his perch head downward wings outstretched and glossy feathers ruffled and below him on the ground some stones were scattered which told the tale of cruelty and petty spite beth stood for a moment transfixed but in that moment the whole thing became clear to herthe way in which the deed was done the man that did it and his motive she glanced up to the top of the high wall and then breathing thick through her clenched teeth in her rage she climbed up the turfstack with the agility of a cat and looked over into the farriers yard come out of that pat murphy ye blackhearted murthering villain she shrieked i see ye skulking there behind the stabledoor come out i tell ye and bad luck to you for killing my bird is it me miss pat murphy exclaimed appearing with an injured and innocent look on his face me kill yer burrd shure thin ye never thought such a thing uv me didnt i thin and i think it still beth cried say may i never see heaven if i kilt itor ill curse ye ah thin it isnt such bad language yed hev me be using and you a young lady miss beth said pat in a wheedling tone deed thin it is pat murphy but i know ye daresnt say it said beth oh bad luck to ye bad luck to ye every day ye see a wooden milestone and twice every day ye dont and if ye killed my bird may the devil attend ye to rob ye of what ye like best wherever ye are she slid down the stack when she had spoken and found her father standing at the bottom looking at the dead bird with a heavy frown on his dark face he must have heard beths altercation with murphy but he made no remark until mrs caldwell came out when he said something in italian to which she responded the cowardly brute beth took her bird and buried it deep in her little garden by which time the car was ready she had not shed a tear nor did she ever mention the incident afterwards which was characteristic for she was always shy of showing any feeling but anger captain caldwell had a wild horse called artless which few men would have cared to ride and fewer still have driven people wondered that he took his children out on the car behind such an animal and perhaps he would not have done so if he had had his own way but mrs caldwell insisted on it theyve no base blood in them she said and ill not have them allowed to acquire any affectation of timidity artless was particularly fresh that morning he was a red chestnut with a white star on his forehead and one white stocking when beth returned to the stableyard she found him fidgeting between the shafts with his ears laid back and the whites of his wicked eyes showing and riley struggling with his head in a hard endeavour to keep him quiet enough for the family to mount the car captain and mrs caldwell and mildred were already in their seats and beth scrambled up to hers unconcernedly although artless was springing about in a lively manner at the moment beth sat next her father who drove from the side of the car and then they were ready to be off as soon as artless would go but artless objected to leave the yard and riley had to lead him round and round running at his head and coaxing him while captain caldwell gathered up the reins and held the whip in suspense watching his opportunity each time they passed the gate to give artless a start that would make him bound through it round and round they went however several times with artless rearing backing and plunging but at last the whip came down at the right moment just the slightest flick riley let go his head and out he dashed in his indignation the battle ending in a wild gallop up the street with the car swinging behind him and the whole of the irish side of the road out cheering and encouraging to the childrens great delight but their ebullition of glee was a little too much for their fathers nerves these children of yours are perfect little devils caroline he exclaimed irritably mrs caldwell smiled as at a compliment she had been brought up on horseback herself and insisted on teaching the children to regard danger as a diversionnot that that was difficult for they were naturally daring she would have punished them promptly on the slightest suspicion of timidity only baseborn people were cowardly she scornfully maintained no lady ever shows a sign of fear once when they were crossing achen sands a wide waste innocent of any obstacle artless came down without warning and mildred uttered an exclamation who was it made that ridiculous noise mrs caldwell asked looking hard at beth beth could not clear herself without accusing her sister so she said nothing but sat consumed with fiery indignation and for long afterwards she would wake up at night and clench her little fists and burn again remembering how her mother had supposed she was afraid artless went at breakneck speed that day shied at the most unexpected moments bolted right round and stopped short occasionally but beth sat tight mechanically following her own fancies captain caldwell was going to inspect one of the outlying coastguard stations and they went by the glen road memorable to beth because it was there she first felt the charm of running water and found her first wild violets and tuft of primroses the pale purple of the violets and the scent of primroses warm with the sun were among the happy associations of that time but her delight was in the mountainstreams with their mimic waterfalls and fairy wells she loved to loiter by them to watch them bubbling and sparkling over the rocks to dabble her hands and feet in them or to lie her length upon the turf beside them in keen consciousness of the incessant delicate delicious murmur of the water a sound which conveyed to her much more than can be expressed in articulate speech at times too when she was tired of loitering she would look up and see the mountaintop just above her and begin to climb but always when she came to the spot there was the mountaintop just as far above her as before so she used to think that the mountain really reached the sky when they returned late that afternoon riley met them with a very serious face and told captain caldwell mysteriously that pat murphys horse was ill what a dd unfortunate coincidence captain caldwell muttered to his wife and beth noticed that her mothers face which had looked fresh and bright from the drive settled suddenly into its habitual anxious careworn expression beth loitered about the yard till her parents had gone in then she climbed the turfstack and looked over the sick horse was tied to the stabledoor and stood hanging his head with a very woebegone expression and groaning monotonously murphy was trying to persuade him to take something hot out of a bucket while bapfaced flanagan and another man known as tonykillthecow looked on and gave good advice beths fury revived when she saw murphy and she laughed aloud derisively all three men started and looked up then crossed themselves didnt i tell ye pat beth exclaimed ye may save yourself the trouble of doctoring him hes as dead as my magpie murphy looked much depressed shure miss beth the poor baste done ye no harm he pleaded no said beth nor my bird hadnt done you any harm nor the cow tony cut the tail off hadnt done him any harm i didnt kill yer burrd murphy asserted doggedly well see said beth when the horse dies well know who killed the bird then one of you skunks can try and kill me but id advise you to use a silver bullet and if you miss youll be damnedblast ye riley will ye let me alone riley hearing what was going on and having called to her vainly to hold her tongue had climbed the stack himself and now laid hold of her beth struck him in the face promptly whereupon he shook her and loosening her hold of the wall began to carry her downa perilous proceeding for the stack was steep and beth enraged at the indignity doubled herself up and scratched and bit and kicked the whole way to the ground ye little divil said riley setting her on her feet yell get us all into trouble wid that blasted tongue o yours whos afraid said beth shaking her tousled head and standing up to riley with her little fists clenched if the divil didnt put ye out when he gave up housekeeping i dunno where you come from riley muttered as he turned away and stumped off stolidly during the night the horse died and beth found when she went out next day that the carcass had been dragged down murphys garden and put in the lane outside she climbed the wall and discovered the farrier skinning the horse and was much disgusted to see him using his hands without gloves on in such an operation her anger of the day before was all over now and she was ready to be on the usual terms of scornful intimacy with murphy yell never be able to touch anything to eat again with those hands she said wont i thin he answered sulkily and without looking up he was as inconsequent as a child that resents an injury but can be diverted from the recollection of it by anything interesting only to return to its grievance however the moment the interest fails wont i thin just you try me wid a bit o breadanbutter this instant an see what ill do wid it beth always anxious to experiment tore indoors to get some breadandbutter and never did she forget the horror with which she watched the dirty man eat it with unwashed hands sitting on the horses carcass that carcass was a source of interest to her for many a long day to come she used to climb on the wall to see how it was getting on till the crows had picked the bones clean and the weather had bleached them white and she would wonder how a creature once so full of life could become a silent senseless thing not feeling not caring not knowing no more to itself than a stonestrange mystery and some day she would be like that just white bones she held her breath and suspended all sensation and thought time after time to see what it felt like but always immediately there began a great rushing sound in her ears as of a terrific storm and that she concluded was death coming when he arrived then all would be blotted out the country was in a very disturbed state and it was impossible to keep all hints of danger from the childrens sharp ears beth knew a great deal of what was going on and what might be expected but then a few chance phrases were already enough for her to construct a whole story upon and with wonderful accuracy generally her fine faculty of observation developed apace at this time and nothing she noticed now was ever forgotten she would curl up in the windowseat among the fuchsias and watch the people in the street by the hour together especially on sundays and marketdays when a great many came in from the mountains women in close white caps with goffered frills short petticoats and long blue cloaks and men in tailcoats and kneebreeches with shillalahs under their arms which they used very dexterously they talked irish at the top of their voices and gesticulated a great deal and were childishly quarrelsome one marketday when beth was looking out of the sittingroom window her mother came and looked out too and they saw halfadozen countrymen set upon a young castletownrock man in a moment their shillalahs were whirling about his head and he was driven round the corner of the house presently he came staggering back across the road blubbering like a child with his head broken and the blood streaming down over his face which was white and distorted with pain they had knocked him down and kicked him when he was on the ground oh the cowards the cowards mrs caldwell exclaimed beth felt sick but it was not so much what she saw as what she heard that affected herthe mans crying and the graphic description of the nature and depth of the wound which another man who had been present while the doctor dressed it stopping at the window kindly insisted on giving them mrs caldwell being obliged to listen courteously for fear of making herself unpopular the mans manner impressed beththere was such a solemn joy in it as of one who had just witnessed something refreshing there were two priests in the place father madden and father john captain caldwell said father madden was a gentleman he shook hands with everybody even with the curate and mr macbean but father john would not speak to a protestant and used to scowl at the children when he met them and then mildred would seize bernadines hand and drag her past him quickly because she hated to be scowled at but beth always stopped and made a face at him he used to carry a long whip and crack it at the people and on sunday mornings if they did not go to mass he would patrol the streets in a fury rating the idlers at the top of his voice and driving them on before him beth used to glance stealthily at the chapel as she went to church it had the attraction of forbidden fruit for her and of father johns exciting anticsnothing ever happened in church chapel she associated with the papists and not at all with kitty whose tender teaching occupied a separate compartment of her consciousness altogether there she kept the blessed mother and the dear lord for her comfort although she seldom visited them now terms of endearment meant a great deal to beth because no one used them habitually in her family in fact she could not remember ever being called dear in her life by either father or mother since the day when she had run away from the great green waves however her father had taken an interest in her he often asked her to brush his hair and laughed very much sometimes at things she said he used to lie on the couch reading to himself while she brushed read some to me papa she said one day he smiled and read a little not in the least expecting her to understand it but she soon showed him that she did and entreated him to go on so he gradually fell into the habit of reading aloud to her particularly the ingoldsby legends she liked to hear them again and again and would clamour for her favourites on one occasion when he had stopped and she had been sitting some time at the foot of the couch with the brush in her hand she suddenly burst out with a long passage from the executionthe passage that begins god tis a fearsome thing to see that pale wan mans mute agony captain caldwell raised his eyebrows as she proceeded and looked at his wife i thought a friend of ours was considered stupid he said people can do very well when they like mrs caldwell answered tartly but theyre too lazy to try when did you learn that beth i didnt learn it beth answered then how do you know it it just came to me beth said then i wish your lessons would just come to you i wish they would said beth sincerely mrs caldwell snapped out something about idleness and obstinacy and left the room the day was darkening down and presently captain caldwell got up lit a lamp at the sideboard and set it on the diningtable when he had done so he took beth and set her on the table too beth stood up on it laughing and put her arm round his neck look at us papa she exclaimed pointing at the window opposite the blinds were up and it was dark enough outside for them to see themselves reflected in the glass i think we make a pretty picture beth her father said putting his arm round her he had scarcely spoken when there came a terrific report and a crash something whizzed close to beths head and a shower of glass fell on the floor in a moment beth had wriggled out of her fathers arm slid from the table and scrambled up on to the windowseat scattering the flowerpots and slapping at her fathers hand in her excitement when he tried to stop her its bapfaced flanaganor tonykillthecow she cried i can seeo papa why did you pull me back now i shall never know the servants had rushed in from the kitchen and mrs caldwell came flying downstairs what is it henry she cried the dd scoundrels shot at me with the child in my arms he answered looking in his indignation singularly like beth herself in a stormy mood as he spoke he turned to the hall door and walked out into the street bareheaded for the love of the lord sir riley remonstrated keeping well out of the way himself but captain caldwell walked off down the middle of the road alone deliberately to the police station his wife standing meanwhile on the doorstep with the light behind her coolly awaiting his return pull down the blind in the sittingroom riley and keep miss beth there was all she said presently captain caldwell returned with a policeofficer and two men they immediately began to search the room the glass of a picture had been shattered at the far end riley pulled the picture to one side and discovered something imbedded in the wall behind which he picked out with his pocketknife and brought to the light it looked like a disc all bent out of shape he turned it every way examining it then tried it with his teeth i thought so he said significantly it wouldnt be yer honour theyd be afther wid a silver bullet i heard her tell em herself to try one and i said if they missed theyd be damned beth exclaimed triumphantly beth cried her mother seizing her by the arm to shake her how dare you use such a word i heard it in church said beth in an injured tone look here beth said her father rescuing her from her mothers clutches and setting her on the tablehe had been talking aside with the police officeri want you to promise something on your word of honour as a lady just to please me beths countenance dropped o papa she exclaimed its something i dont want to promise well never mind that beth he answered just promise this one thing to please me if you dont the people will try and kill you i dont mind that said beth but i doand your mother does beth gave her mother a look of such utter astonishment that the poor lady turned crimson and perhaps theyll kill me too captain caldwell resumed you see they nearly did tonight this was a veritable inspiration beth turned pale and gasped i promise not so fast her father said never promise anything till you hear what it is but now promise you wont say bad luck to any of the people again i promise beth repeated butshe slid from the table and nodded emphaticallybut when i shake my fist and stamp my foot at them itll mean the same thing it was found next morning that bapfaced flanagan and tonykillthecow had disappeared from the township but murphy remained and beth was not allowed to go out alone again for a long time not even into the garden all she knew about it herself however was that she had always either a policeman or a coastguardsman to talk to which added very much to her pleasure in life and also to annes chapter ix one of the interests of captain caldwells life was his garden he spent long hours in cultivating it and that summer his vegetables fruits and flowers had been the wonder of the neighbourhood but now autumn had come vegetables were dug fruits gathered flowers bedraggled and there was little to be done but clear the beds plant them with bulbs and prepare them for the spring now that captain caldwell had made beths acquaintance he liked to have her with him to help him when he was at work in the garden and there was nothing that she loved so much one day they were at work together on a large flowerbed her father was trimming some rosebushes and she was kneeling beside him on a little mat weeding im glad im not a flower she suddenly exclaimed after a long silence why beth flowers are very beautiful yes but they last so short a time id rather be less beautiful and live longer whats your favourite flower papa she had stopped weeding for the moment but still sat on the mat looking up at him captain caldwell clipped a little more then stopped too and looked down at her i dont get a separate pleasure from any particular flower beth they all delight me he answered beth pondered upon this for a little then she asked do you know which i like best hot primroses captain caldwell raised his eyebrows interrogatively when you pick them in the sun and put them against your cheek theyre all warm you know beth explained and then they are good and fuchsias are good too but it isnt the same good you know that one in the sittingroom window white outside and salmoncoloured inside and such a nice shapethe flowersand the way they hang down you have to lift them to look into them when i look at them long they make me feelohfeel you knowfeel that i could take the whole plant in my arms and hug it but fuchsias dont scent sweet like hot primroses and therefore they are not so good her father suggested greatly interested in the childs attempt to express herself they say that the scent is the soul of the flower the scent is the soul of the flower beth repeated several times then heaved a deep sigh of satisfaction i want to sing it she said i always want to sing things like that what other things like that do you know beth the song of the sea in the shell the swish of the grass in the breeze the sound of a faraway bell the whispering leaves on the trees beth burst out instantly who taught you that beth her father asked oh no one taught me papa she answered it just came to melike this you know i used to listen to the sea in that shell in the sittingroom and i tried and tried to find a name for the sound and all at once song came into my headthe song of the sea in the shell then i was lying out here on the grass when it was long before you cut it to make hay and you came out and said theres a stiff breeze blowing and it blew hard and then stopped and then it came again and every time it came the grass wentswishhh the swish of the grass in the breeze then you know that bell that rings a long way off you can only just hear it out herethe sound of a faraway bell then the leavesit was a long time before anything came that i could sing about them i used to try and think it but you cant sing a thing you think its when a thing comes you can sing it i was always listening to the leaves and i always felt they were doing something then all at once it came one day of course they were whisperingthe whispering leaves on the trees that was how they came papa at first i used to sing them by themselves but now i sing them all together you can sing them three different waysthe way i did first you know then you can put breeze first the swish of the grass in the breeze the whispering leaves on the trees the song of the sea in the shell the sound of a faraway bell or you can sing the sound of a faraway bell the whispering leaves on the trees the swish of the grass in the breeze the song of the sea in the shell which way do you think the nicest she had rattled all this off as fast as she could speak looking and pointing towards the various things she mentioned as she proceeded the sea the grass the trees the distance now she looked up to her father for an answer he was looking at her so queerly she was filled with alarm am i naughty papa she exclaimed oh no he said with a smile that reassured her i was just thinking i like to hear how things come to you you must always tell mewhen new things come by the way who told you that fuchsia was salmoncoloured i saw it was she said surprised that he needed to ask such a question i saw it one day when we had boiled salmon for dinner isnt it nice when you see that one things like another i have a pebble and its just the shape of a pearnow you know what shape it is dont you he nodded but if i said its thick at one end and thin at another you wouldnt know what shape it is a bit would you no i should not he answered beginning to prune again thoughtfully beth he said presently i should like to see you grow up shant i grow up said beth in dismay oh yesat least i should hope so butits not likely that i shall belooking on but beth i want you to remember this when you grow up i think you will want to do something that only a few other people can do wellpaint a picture write a book act in a theatre make musicit doesnt matter what if it comes to you if you feel you can do it just do it youll not do it well all at once but try and try until you can do it well and dont ask anybody if they think you can do it theyll be sure to say no and then youll be disheartenedwhats disheartened its the miserable feeling you would get if i said you would never be able to learn to play the piano youd try to do it all the same perhaps but youd do it doubtfully instead of with confidence whats confidence said beth you are listening to me now with confidence it is as if you said i believe you but i cant say i believe you to arithmetic if i want to do it no but you can say i believe i can do iti believe in myself is that confidence in myself beth asked light breaking in upon her thats it youre getting quite a vocabulary beth a vocabulary is all the words you know he added hastily anticipating the inevitable question beth went on with her weeding for a little and there is another thing beth i want to tell you her father recommenced never do anything unless you are quite sure it is the right thing to do it doesnt matter how much you may want to do it you mustnt if you are not quite quite sure it is right not even if i am just half sure no certainly not you must be quite quite sure beth picked some more weeds then looked up at him again but papa i shall never want to do anything i dont think right when im grown up shall i im afraid you will everybody does did you want to papa beth asked in amazement yes he answered and did you do it yes he repeated and what happened much misery were you miserable yes very but that wasnt the worst of it what was the worst of it the worst of it was that i made other people miserable ah thats bad said beth with perfect comprehension that makes you feel so horrid inside yourself well beth just you remember that you cant do wrong without making somebody else miserable be loyal be loyal to yourself loyal to the best that is in you that means be as good as your friends think you and better if you can tell the truth live openly and stick to your friends thats the whole of the best code of morality in the world now we must go in as they walked down the garden together beth slipped her dirty little hand into his and looked up at him papa she said solemnly when you want to be with somebody always more than with anybody else and want to look at him and want to talk to him and you find you can tell him lots of things you couldnt tell anybody else if you tried you know what does it mean it means you love him very much then i love you papa very much she said nestling her head against his arm and it does make me feel so nice inside but it makes me miserable too she added sighing how so when you have a headache you know i used only to be afraid youd be angry if i made a noise but now im always thinking how much it hurts you i wake up often and often at night and you are in my mind and i try and see you say its better or its quite well and what then beth her father asked in a queer voice then i dont cry any more you know she looked up at her father as she spoke and saw that his eyes were full of tears chapter x that was almost the last of those happy autumn days winter fell upon the country suddenly with nipping cold the mountains always sombre lowered in great tumbled masses from under the heavy clouds that seldom rose from their summits terrible gales kept the sea in torment and the voice of its rage and pain filled castletownrock without ceasing torrents of rain tore up the roads and rendered them almost impassable there was stolid endurance and suffering written on every face out of doors while within the people cowered over their peat fires a prey to hunger cold and depression draughts made merry through the large rooms and passages in captain caldwells house the wind howled in the chimneys rattled at the windows and whistled at the keyholes especially at night when beth would hide her head under the bedclothes to keep out the racket or in another mood lie and listen to it and imagine herself out in the storm till her nerves were strung to a state of ecstatic tension and her mind fairly revelled in the sense of danger when her father was at home in the evening she would sit still beside the fire in the sittingroom listening in breathless awe and excitement wholly pleasurable to the gale raging without but if captain caldwell had not returned as frequently happened now that the days were short and the roads so bad well knowing the risks he ran she would see the car upset a hundred times and hear the rattle of musketry in every blast that shook the house and so share silently but to the full the terrible anxiety which kept her mother pacing up and down up and down unable to settle to anything until he entered and sank into a seat often so exhausted that it was hard to rouse him to change his dripping clothes his duties always honourably performed whatever the risk to himself were far too severe for him and he was rapidly becoming a wrecknervous liverish a martyr to headache and a slave to stimulants although not a drunkardhe only took enough to whip him up to his work his digestion too had become seriously impaired and he had no natural appetite for anything he was fond of his children and proud of them but had hitherto been too irritable to contribute anything to their happiness on the contrary his name was a terror to them and hush papa has come in was enough at any time to damp their wildest spirits now however he suffered more from depression than from irritability and would cower over the fire on stormy days in a state of despondency which was reflected in every face taking no notice of any of them the children would watch him furtively in close silent sympathy sitting still and whispering for fear of disturbing him and if perchance they saw him smile and a look of relief came into their mothers anxious face their own spirits went up on the instant but everything was against him the damp came up from the flags in the sittingroom through the cocoanut matting and the thick carpet that covered it which it defaced in great patches close to the fire the wires of the piano rusted and had to be rubbed and rubbed every day or half the notes went dumb the paper a rare luxury in those parts began to drop from the walls great turffires were constantly kept up but the damp stole a march on them when they smouldered in the night and made mildewmarks upon everything good food and cooking would have helped captain caldwell but the food was indifferent and there were no cooks to be had in the country biddy had never seen such a thing as a kitchenrange before she took the situation and when she first had to use the oven she put the turf on the bottom shelf in order to heat the top one mrs caldwell made what were superhuman efforts to a woman of her training and constitution to keep the servants up to the mark and grew grey in the endeavour but mrs caldwell in the kitchen was like a racehorse at the plough and even if she had been a born housewife she could have done little with servants who would do nothing themselves except under her eyes and stole everything they could lay their hands on including the salt out of the saltcellars between meals if it were not locked up towards the end of january captain caldwell was ill in bed he had wet cloths on his head and seemed as if he could hardly speak beth hung about his door all day watching for opportunities to steal in mamma always sent her away if she could but if papa heard her he would whisper let the child come in and then mamma would let her in but would still look cross and beth sat at one side of the bed and mamma sat on the other and no one spoke except papa sometimes only you could seldom understand what he said and mamma cried but beth did not she ached too much inside for that you cant cry when you ache so much beth day after day sat with her hands folded on her lap and her feet dangling from a chair that was much too high for her watching her father with an intensity of silent anxiety that was terrible to witness in so young a child her mother might have beaten her to death but she could never have dislodged her from the room once she had her fathers leave to stay there mrs caldwell rarely beat her now however she generally ignored her so beth came and went as she chose she would climb up on to the bed when there was nobody in the room and kiss the curls of papas thick glossy black hair so softly that he never knew except once when he caught her and smiled his dark face grew grey in bed and his blue eyes sunken and haggard but he battled it out that time and slowly began to recover beth was sitting in her usual place beside her fathers bed one day when the doctor came and discovered her he was standing on the other side of the bed and exclaimed why its all eyes yes its a queer pixie her father said but its going to do something some day or im much mistaken its going to make a nuisance of itself if you put such nonsense into its head or im much mistaken mrs caldwell observed i shall not make a nuisance of myself beth indignantly protested i shall never be able to make you understand caroline captain caldwell exclaimed little pitchers are generally bad enough but when there is large intelligence added to the long ears theyre the devil before the doctor left he said to mrs caldwell we must keep our patient amused you know o doctor beth exclaimed clasping her hands in her earnestness do you think if sophie keene came the doctor burst into a shout of laughter in which captain caldwell also joined just stay here yourself beth he said when he had recovered himself for amusement neither sophie keene nor any one else i ever knew could hold a candle to you whats hold a candle to you beth instantly demanded and then there was more laughter in which even mrs caldwell joined and afterwards when the doctor had gone she actually patted beth on the back and stroked her hair which was the first caress beth ever remembered to have received from her mother now mamma she exclaimed with great feeling in the fulness of her surprise and delight now i shall forget that you ever beat me her mother coloured painfully her father muttered something about a noble nature and that was the child you never wanted at all slipped with a ring of triumph from mrs caldwell unawaresan interesting example of the complexity of human feelings captain caldwell soon went back to his dutyall too soon for his strength the dreadful weather continued day after day he returned soaking from some distant station to the damp and discomfort of the house and the illcooked unappetising food which he could hardly swallow and to all this was added great anxiety about the future of his family his boys were doing well at school by this time but he was not satisfied with the way in which the little girls were being brought up there was no order in their lives no special time for anything and he knew the importance of early discipline he tried to discuss the subject with his wife but she met his suggestions irritably theres time enough for that she said i had no regular lessons till i was in my teens but what answered with you may be disastrous to these children he ventured they are all unlike you in disposition more especially beth you spoil that child mrs caldwell protested and at any rate i can do no more i am run off my feet this was true and captain caldwell let the subject drop his patience was exemplary in those days he suffered severely both mentally and physically but never complained the shadow was upon him and he knew it but he met his fate with fortitude whatever his faults they were expiated in the estimation of all who saw him suffer now mrs caldwell never realised how ill he was but still she was uneasy and it was with intense relief that she welcomed a case of soups and other nourishing delicacies calculated to tempt the appetite which arrived for him one day from one of his sisters in england this is just what you want henry she said with a brighter look in her face than he had seen there for months i shall soon have you yourself again now captain caldwells spirits also went up in the evening they were all together in the sittingroom mrs caldwell was playing little songs for mildred to sing baby bernadine was playing with her bricks upon the floor and beth as usual was hanging about her father he had shaken off his despondency and was quite lively for the moment walking up and down the room and making merry remarks to his wife in italian at which she laughed a good deal come beth fetch ingoldsby we shall just come to my favourite and finish the book before you go to bed he said beth brought the book and then climbed up on his knee and settled there happily with her head on his shoulder as i laye athynkynge the golden sun was sinking o merrie sang that bird as it glitterd on her breast with a thousand gorgeous dyes while soaring to the skies mid the stars she seemd to rise as to her nest as i laye athynkynge her meaning was exprest follow follow me away it boots not to delay twas so she seemed to saye here is rest after he had read those last lines there was a moments silence and then beth burst into a tempest of tears o papapapa no no no she sobbed i couldnt bear it what is the matter with the child mrs caldwell exclaimed starting up the vision and the faculty divine i think her father answered leave her to me beth was awake when anne entered the nursery next morning to call the children get up and be good anne said your pas ill mrs caldwell came into the nursery immediately afterwards very much agitated she kissed beth and from that moment the child was calm but there settled upon her pathetic little face a terrible look of age and anxiety when she was dressed she ran right into her fathers room before any one could stop her he was moaningo my head my head o my head my head over and over again you mustnt stay here little womannot today the doctor said it will make your father worse if you do beth stole from the room and returned to the nursery there however she could still hear her father moaning and she could not bear it so she took her prayerbook by way of lifesaving apparatus and went down to the kitchen to see what the servants were thinkingher own significant expression they were all strangely subdued sit down miss beth biddy said kindly sit down in the window there wid your book if you want company its a sore heart youll be having or im much mistaken beth sat in the window the whole morning reading prayers to herself while she watched and waited the doctor sent riley down from the sickroom several times to fetch things and each time beth consulted his countenance anxiously for news but asked no questions biddy tried to persuade her to eat but the child could not touch anything late in the afternoon riley came down in a hurry is the master better pat biddy demanded deed thin he isnt riley replied and the doctors sending me off on the horse as hard as i can go for dr jamieson och thin if the doctors sending you for dr jamieson its all up hes niver sent for till the last the lord himself wont save him now beth shuffled over the leaves of her prayerbook hurriedly she had been crying piteously to god in her heart for hours to save her father and he had not heard now she remembered that the servants said if you read the lords prayer backwards it would raise the devil beth tried but the invocation was unavailing before riley could saddle the horse a message was sent down to stop him and then anne came for beth and took her up to her fathers room the dreadful sounds had ceased at last and there was a strange silence in the house mrs caldwell was sitting beside her husbands bed rocking herself a little as if in pain but shedding no tears mildred was standing with her arm round her mothers neck crying bitterly while baby bernadine gazed at her father wonderingly he was lying on his side with his arms folded his eyes were shut and there was a lovely look of relief upon his face i sent for you children their mother said to see your father just as he died you must never forget him ellis and rickards two of papas men were in the room and mrs ellis too and the doctor and riley and biddy and anne and there was a footbath with steaming hot water in it on the floor some mustard on the table and the fire burnt brightly these details impressed themselves on beths mind involuntarily as indeed did everything else connected with that time it seemed to her afterwards as if she had seen everything and felt nothing for the momentnothing but breathless excitement and interest her grief was entirely suspended mrs ellis and the doctor led mamma down to the sittingroom they didnt seem to think that she could walk and then mrs ellis made her some tea and stood there and coaxed her to drink it just as if mamma had been a child mrs caldwell sat on the big couch with her back to the window and mildred sat beside her with her arm round her crying all the time bernadine cried too but it was because she was hungry and no one thought of giving her anything to eat beth fetched her some breadandbutter and then she was good people began to arrivemr macbean captain and mrs keene the smalls the curatefather madden even he had heard the news out in the country and came hurrying back to pay his respects and offer his condolences to mrs caldwell and see if there was anything he could do he hoped it was not taking a liberty to come but indeed he came in the fulness of his heart and because he couldnt help it for he had known him well and a better man and truer gentleman never breathed the widow held out her hand to the priest and looked up at him gratefully beth opened the door for mrs small who exclaimed at once oh my dear child how is your poor mother does she cry at all i do hope she has been crying no beth answered nobody cries but mildred when mrs small went in mrs caldwell spoke to her quite collectedly he was taken ill at eight oclock this morning with a dreadful pain in his head she told her he had suffered fearfully from his head of late i sent for the doctor at once but nothing relieved him from ten oclock he got worse and worse and at four he was gone he always wished to die suddenly and be spared a lingering illness he has been depressed of late but this morning early he woke up quite brightly and last night he was wonderfully better after the children had gone to bed he read aloud to me as he used to do in the old days and he looked so much more like his old self again that i thought a happier time was coming and so it was but not for me poor lady mrs small whispered it has been a fearful shock mrs caldwell showed strength of character in the midst of the overwhelming calamity which had fallen upon her with such awful suddenness she had a nice sense of honour and her love was great and by the help of these she was enabled to carry out every wish of her dead husband with regard to himself he had had a fastidious horror of being handled after death by the kind of old women who are accustomed to lay out bodies and therefore mrs caldwell begged ellis and rickards to perform that last duty for him themselves when the children went to bed she took them to kiss their father the stillness of the chamber struck a chill through beth but she thought it beautiful the men had draped it in white and decorated it with evergreens there being no flowers in season papa was smiling and looked serenely happy years ago he was like that mamma said softly as if she were speaking to herself but latterly there has been a look of pain i am glad to see him so once more you are at peace nowdearest she stroked his dark hair and as she did so her hand showed white against it the children kissed him and then mrs ellis persuaded mamma to come and help her to put them to bed and mamma taught them to say yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me she told them to remember they had learnt it on the day their father died and asked them to say it always in memory of him beth believed for a long time that it was he who would walk with her through the valley of the shadow and in after years she felt sure that her mother had thought so too mrs ellis stayed all night and slept with the children when their mother left them beth could not sleep she had noticed how cold her father was when she kissed him and was distressed to think he had only a sheet to cover him the longer she thought of it the more wretched she became especially when she contrasted the warmth and softness of her own little bed with the hardness and coldness of the one they had made up for him and at last she could bear it no longer she sat up in bed and listened she could hear by their breathing that the other children were asleep but she was not sure about mrs ellis very stealthily therefore she slipped out of bed and pulled off the clothes she could only just clasp them in both arms but the nursery door was ajar and she managed to open it with her foot it creaked noisily and beth waited listening in suspense but nobody moved so she slipped out into the passage it was quite dark there and the floor felt very cold to her bare feet she stumbled down the passage tripping over the bedclothes as she went and dreading to be caught and stopped but not afraid of anything else the door was open when she reached it and there was a dim light in the room this was unexpected and she paused to peep in before she entered two candles were burning on a table at the foot of the bed their flames flickered in a draught and cast shadows on her fathers face so that it seemed as if he moved and breathed again her mother was kneeling beside the bed with her face hidden on her husbands breast her left arm round him while with the fingers of her right hand she incessantly toyed with his hair only last night she was saying only last night oh i cannot believe itperhaps i ought to be gladthere will be no more pain for youoh my darling i would have given my life to save you a moments painand i could do so littleso little oh if only you could come back to tell me that your life had ever been the better for me that i had not spoilt it utterly that i brought you some happiness she raised her head and looked into the tranquil face the flickering shadows flitted across it but did not deceive her she must ache on always for an answer nowalways for ever with a convulsive sob she crawled up closer on her knees and laid her cheek beside his but no tears came she had not wept at all that day beth stood for a long time in the doorway listening to her mothers rambling talk and watching her white fingers straying through her fathers hair she hugged the bedclothes close but she had forgotten why she came she felt no cold she held no thought her whole being was absorbed in the scene before her presently however something that her mother said aroused hercold she was murmuring so cold how you dreaded it too you were always delicate and suffering yet you did more than the strongest men for our sakes you never spared yourself what you undertook to do you did like an honourable gentleman neglecting nothing you have died doing your duty as you wished to die you have been dying all these monthsand i never suspectedi did not knowdyingkilled by exposureand anxietyand bad food you came home hungry and you could not eat what i had to give youcold and i could not warm youoh the cruel bitter cold beth slipped up to her noiselessly mamma mrs caldwell started beth held out the blanketsto cover him her mother caught her in her arms o my poor little child my poor little child she cried and then at last she burst into tears during the days that preceded her fathers funeral beth did not miss him it was as if he were somewhere else that was allaway in the mountainsand was himself thinking as beth did continually about the still cold smiling figure that reposed serenely indifferent to them all in his room upstairs one day what he had said about being laid out by old women came into her head and she wondered what he would have looked like when they laid him out that he should have objected so strongly to their seeing him she was near the deathchamber at the moment and went in no one was there and she stood a long time looking at the figure on the bed it was entirely covered but she had only to lift the sheet and learn the secret she turned it back from the placid face then stopped and whispered half in awe half in interrogation papa as she pronounced the word the inhuman impulse passed and was forgotten hours later mrs ellis found her sitting beside him as she had so often done during his illness on that same chair which was too high for her her feet dangling and her little hands folded in her lap gazing at him with a face as placidly set save for the eyes as his own the next day they had all to bid him the long farewell mrs caldwell stood looking down upon him not wiping the great tears that welled up painfully into her eyes lest in the act she should blot out the dear image and so lose sight of it for one last precious moment she was an undemonstrative woman but the lingering way in which she touched him his hair his face his waxen hands was all the more impressive for that in its restrained tenderness suddenly she uncovered his feet they were white as marble and beautifully formed ah i feared so she exclaimed they put them into hot water that day i knew it was too hot and i said so he seemed insensible but i felt him winceand see the scar of a scald proved that she had been right this last act due to the fear that he had been made to suffer an unnecessary pang struck beth in after years as singularly pathetic it was not until after the funeral that beth herself realised that she had lost her father when they returned the house had been set in order and made to look as usualyet something was missing the blinds were up the sun was streaming in the ingoldsby legends lay on the sofa in the sittingroom when beth saw the book her eyes dilated with a pang it lay there just as he had left it but he was in the ground he would never come back again suddenly the child threw herself on the floor in an agony of grief sobbing moaning writhing tearing her hair and calling aloud papa papa come back come back come back mrs caldwell in her fright would have tried her old remedy of shaking and beating but mrs ellis snatched the child up and carried her off to the nursery where she kept her for the rest of that terrible day rocking her on her knee most of the time and talking to her about her father in heaven living the life eternal yet watching over her still and waiting for her until she fired beths imagination and the terrible grave was forgotten that night however and for many nights to come the child started up out of her sleep and wept and wailed and tore her hair and had again to be nursed and comforted chapter xi just like the mountains all jumbled up together when you view them from a distance had beths impulses and emotions already begun to be in their extraordinary complexity at this period and even more like the mountains when you are close to them for then losing sight of the whole you become aware of the details and are surprised at their wonderful diversity at the heights and hollows the barren wastes fertile valleys gentle slopes and giddy precipicesheights and hollows of hope and despair barren wastes of misspent time fertile valleys of intellectual accomplishment gentle slopes of aspiration undefined and giddy precipices of passionate impulse and desperate revolt genius is sympathetic insight made perfect and it must have this diversity if it is ever to be effectualmust touch on every human experience must suffer and must also enjoy great therefore are its compensations it feels the sorrows of all mankind and is elevated by them whereas the pain of an individual bereavement is rather acute than prolonged genius is spared the continuous gnawing ache of the grief which stultifies instead of an everpresent wearing sense of loss that would dim its power it retains only those hallowed memories those vivid recollections which foster the joy of a great yearning tenderness and all its pains are transmuted into something subtle mysterious invisible neither to be named nor ignoreda fertilising essence which is the source of its own heaven and may also contain the salvation of earth so genius has no lasting griefs beth utterly rejected all thought of her father in his grave and even of her father in heaven when her first wild grief subsided he returned to her to be with her as those we love are with us always in their absence enshrined in our happy consciousness she never mentioned him in these days but his presence warm in her heart kept her little being aglow and it was only when people spoke to her and distracted her attention from the thought of him that she felt disconsolate while she could walk with him in dreams she cared for no other companionship it was a dreadful position for poor mrs caldwell left a widownot without friends certainly for the people were kindbut with none of her own kith and kin in that wild district embarrassed for want of money and broken in health but as is usual in times of great calamity many things happened showing both the best and the worst side of human nature after captain caldwells death old captain keene who had once held the appointment himself and was indebted to captain caldwell for much kindly hospitality went about the countryside telling people that captain caldwell had died of drink some officious person immediately brought the story to mrs caldwell mrs caldwell had the house on her hands but the officer who was sent to succeed captain caldwell would be obliged to take it as there was no other he arrived one day with a very fastidious wife who did not like the house at all there was no accommodation in it no china cupboard nothing fit for a lady she must have it all altered from the way she spoke it seemed to beth that she blamed her mother for everything that was wrong mrs caldwell said very little she was suffering from a great swelling at the back of her neckan anthrax the doctor called itand was not fit to be about at all but her indomitable fortitude kept her up mrs ellis had stayed to nurse her and help with the children she and mrs caldwell looked at each other and smiled when the new officers wife had gone shes a very fine lady indeed mrs ellis mrs caldwell said sighing wearily yes maam mrs ellis answered but people who have been used to things all their lives think less about them mrs ellis was very kind to the children and when wet days kept beth indoors she would stay with her and study her with interest she was thin precise lowvoiced quiet in her movements passionless loyal and every time she took a mouthful at table she wiped her mouth the doctor came every day to dress the abscess on mrs caldwells neck and every day he said that if it had not burst of itself he should have been obliged to make a deep incision in it in the form of a cross mildred and beth were always present on these occasions fighting to be allowed to hold the basin mrs ellis wanted to turn them out but mrs caldwell said let them stay poor little bodies they like to be with me the poor lady ill as she was had neither peace nor quiet the yard was full of great stones now and stonemasons hammered at them from early morning till late at night chipping them into shape for the alterations and additions to be made to the house the loft was full of carpenters preparing boards for flooring the yardgates were always open and people came and went as they liked so that there was no more privacy for the family mildred stayed indoors with her mother a good deal but beth followed by bernadine who had become her shadow was continually in the yard among the men listening questioning and observing to beth at this time the grownup people of her race were creatures with a natural history other than her own which she studied with great intelligence and interest and sometimes also with disgust for although she was so much more with the common people as she had been taught to call them than with her own class she did not adopt their standards and shrank always with innate refinement from everything gross no one thought of shooting her now she had not only lived down her unpopularity but by dint of her natural fearlessness her cheerful audacity of speech and quick comprehension had won back the fickle hearts of the people who weighed her words again superstitiously and made much of her the workmen with the indolent inconsequent irish temperament which makes it irksome to follow up a task continuously and easier to do anything than the work in hand would break off to amuse her at any time one young carpenterlean sallow and sulkywho was working for her mother interested her greatly he was making packingcases and the first one was all wrong and had to be pulled to pieces and the way he swore as he demolished it ripping out oaths as he ripped up the boards impressed beth as singularly silly there was another carpenter at work in the loft a little wizened old man he always brought a peculiar kind of yellow bread and shared it with the children who loved it and took as much as they wanted without scruple so that the poor old man must have had shortcommons himself sometimes he could draw all kinds of thingsfish with scales ships in full sail horses coaches peopleand beth often made him get out his big broad pencil and do designs for her on the new white boards when he was within earshot the people in the yard were particular about what they said before the children if they forgot themselves he called them to order and silenced them instantly which surprised beth because he was the smallest man there there was one man however whom the old carpenter could never suppress beth did not know how this man got his living he came from the village to gossip wore a tweed suit not like a workmans nor was it the national irish dress he had a red nose and a wooden leg and after she knew him for a long time she always expected a man with a wooden leg to have a red nose but somehow she never expected a man with a red nose to have a wooden leg this man was always cheery and very voluble he used the worst language possible in the pleasantest way and his impervious goodhumour was proof against all remonstrance what he said was either blasphemous or obscene as a rule but in effect it was not at all like the same thing from the other men because with them such language was the expression of anger and evil moods while with him it was the vehicle of thought from a mind habitually serene mrs caldwell was being hurried out of the house with indecent haste considering the state of her health and all the arrangements she had to make but she bore up bravely she was touched one day by an offer of help from beth and begged her to take charge of bernadine and be a little mother to her beth promised to do her best accordingly when bernadine was naughty beth beat her in dutiful imitation bernadine however invariably struck back when other interests palled beth would encourage bernadine to risk her neck by persuading her to jump down after her from high places she was nearly as good a jumper as beth the great difference being that beth always lit on her feet while bernadine was apt to come down on her head but it was this peculiarity that made her attempts so interesting the yard very soon became a sociable centre for the whole idle place any one who chose came into it in a friendly way and lounged about gossiping and inspecting the works in progress women brought their babies and sat about on the stones suckling them and talking to the mena proceeding which filled beth with disgust she thought it so peculiarly indelicate beth stood with her mother at the sittingroom window one day to see the last of poor artless as he was led away on a halter by a strange man his glossy chestnut coat showing dappled in the sunshine but his wild spirit much subdued for want of corn the first time they had seen him was on the day of their arrival when captain caldwell had ridden out on him to meet them mrs caldwell burst into tears at the recollection he was the first evidence of promotion and prosperity she said but the promotion has been to a higher sphere and i much fear that the prosperity like artless himself has departed for ever mrs caldwell had decided to return to her own people in england and a few days later they started she took the children to see their fathers grave the last thing before they left castletownrock and stood beside it for a long time in silence her gloveless hand resting caressingly on the cold tombstone her eyes full of tears and a pained expression in her face it was the real moment of separation for her she had to tear herself away from her beloved dead to leave him lonely and to go out alone herself unprotected unloved uncomforted into the cold world with her helpless children poverty was in store for her that she knew and doubtless she foresaw many another trouble and could she have chosen would gladly have taken her place there beside the one who with all his faults had been her best friend on earth her cold formal religion was no comfort to her in moments like these she was a pagan at heart and where she had laid her dead there to her mind he would rest for ever far from her the lonely grave on the wild west coast was the shrine towards which her poor heart would yearn thereafter at all times always she had erected a handsome tombstone on the hallowed spot and was going away in her shabby clothes the more at ease for the selfdenial she had had to exercise in order to beautify it the radical difference between herself and beth which was to keep them apart for ever was never more apparent than at this moment of farewell the other children cried but beth remained an unmoved spectator of her mothers emotion she hated the delay in that painful place and what was the use of it when her father would be with them just the same when they got into the yellow coach which was waiting at the gate to take them away beths beloved was a spirit near at hand always her mothers was a corpse in a coffin buried in the ground a little way out of castletownrock the coach was stopped and honor and kathleen mayne from the inn came up to the window we walked out to be the last to say goodbye to you mrs caldwell and to wish you good luck kathleen said we were among the first to welcome you when you came and weve brought a piece of music for miss mildred if she will accept it for a keepsake mrs caldwell shook hands with them but she could not speak and the coach drove on the days when she had thought the two miss maynes presumptuous for young women in their position seemed a long way off to her as she sat there sobbing but grateful for this last act of kindly feeling beth had been eager to be off in the yellow coach but they had not long started before she began to suffer the moving panorama of desolate landscape rocky coast rough sea moor and mountain with the motion of the coach and the smell of stale tobacco and beer in innparlours where they waited to change horses nauseated her to faintness her sensitive nervous system received too many vivid impressions at once the intense melancholy of the scenes they passed through the wretched hovels the halfclad people the lean cattle and all the evidences of abject poverty amid dreadful bogs under a gloomy sky got hold of her and weighed upon her spirits until at last she shrunk into her corner pale and still and sat with her eyes closed and great tears running slowly down her cheeks these were her last impressions of ireland and they afterwards coloured all her recollections of the country and the people but the travellers came to a railway station at last and left the coach there was a long crowded train just about to start and mrs caldwell dragging beth after her by the hand because she knew she would stand still and stare about her the moment she let her go hurried from carriage to carriage trying to find seats i saw some beth said youve passed them mrs caldwell turned and some distance back found a carriage with only two people in it a gentleman whom beth did not notice particularly and a lady doubtless a bride dressed in light garments and a white bonnet very high in front the space between the forehead and the top being filled with roses she sat upright in the middle of the compartment and looked superciliously at the weary worried widow and her helpless children in their shabby black when they stopped at the carriage door it was her cold indifference that impressed beth she could not understand why seeing how worn they all were and the fix they were in she did not jump up instantly and open the door overjoyed to be able to help them there were just four seats in the carriage but she never moved beth had looked up confidently into her face expecting sympathy and help but was repelled by a disdainful glance it was beths first experience of the wealthy world that does not care and she never forgot it that carriage is engaged her mother exclaimed and dragged her impatiently away in the hotel in dublin where they slept a night they had the use of a long narrow sittingroom with one large window at the end hung with handsome heavy dark green curtains quite new the valance at the top ended in a deep fringe of thick cords and at the end of each cord there was a bright ornamental thing made of wood covered with silks of various colours beth had never seen anything so lovely and on the instant she determined to have one they were high out of her reach but that was nothing if only she could get a table and chair under them and the coast clear fortune favoured her during the evening and she managed to secure one and carried it off in triumph and so great was her joy in the colour that she took it out of her pocket whenever she had a chance next day and gazed at it enraptured on their way to the boat mildred caught her looking at it and asked her where she got it beth explained exactly but its stealing mildred exclaimed is it said beth in pleased surprise she had never stolen anything before and it was a new sensation but dont you know stealing is very wicked mildred asked impressively beth looked disconcerted i never thought of that ill put it back how can you youll never be there again mildred rejoined youve done it now youve committed a sin beth slipped the bright thing into her pocket ill repent she said and seemed satisfied it was a lovely day and the passage from kingstown to holyhead was so smooth that everybody lounged about the deck and no one was ill beth was very much interested first in the receding shore then in the people about her there was one group in particular evidently of affluent people dressed in a way that made her feel ashamed of her own clothes for the first time in her life but what particularly attracted her attention were some bunches of green and purple grapes which the papa of the party took out of a basket and began to divide beth had never seen grapes before except in pictures and thought they looked lovely the old gentleman gave the grapes to his family but in handing them one little bunch fell on the deck he picked it up looked at it blew some dust off it then decided that it was not good enough for his own children and handed it to bernadine who was gazing greedily beth dashed forward snatched it out of her hand and threw it into the sea we are not beggars she cried well done little one a gentleman who was sitting near exclaimed wont pick up the crumbs that fall from the rich mans table eh thats a very proper spirit and who may you be my father was a gentleman beth answered hotly chapter xii uncle james patten sent a landau to meet his sister and her family at the station on their arrival from ireland mildred was the first to jump in she took the best seat and sat up stiff and straight i do love carriages and horses mamma she said as they drove through rainharbour the little northcountry seaside place which was henceforth to be their home i wonder which is to be our house there are several empty do you think it is that one she had singled out one of the largest in the place no said mrs caldwell rather bitterly more likely this and she indicated a tiny twostoried tenement wedged in between tall houses and looking as if it had either got itself there by mistake or had been put in in a hurry just to fill up that is the one beth said how do you know mildred snapped because were going to live in orchard street opposite the orchard and this is orchard street and theres the orchard and thats the only house empty im afraid the child is right mrs caldwell said with a sigh however she added pulling herself up it is exceedingly kind of uncle james to give us a house at all he might have given us something nicer mildred remarked disdainfully oh beth exclaimed hes given us the best he has i expect and its a dear little place with a little bowwindow on either side of a little front doorjust like the one where snowdrop found the empty beds when the bears were out dont talk nonsense beth mildred cried crossly but beth hardly heard she was busy peopling the quaint little town with the friends of her fancy and sat smiling serenely as she looked about her they had to drive right through rainharbour and about a mile out into the country on the other side to arrive at fairholm uncle james pattens place the sun had set and the quaintly irregular redbrick houses mellowed by age shone warm in tint against the gathering grey of the sky which rose like a leaden dome above them at one part of the road the sea came in sight great dark mountainous masses of cloud with flamecoloured fringes hung suspended over its shining surface in which they were reflected with what was to beth terrible effect she sat and shivered with awe so long as the lurid scene was in sight and was greatly relieved when the carriage turned into a country lane and sea and sombre sky were blotted out it was early spring buds were bursting in the hedgerows birds were building songsters sang among the branches and the air was sweet and mild fairholm lay all among fertile fields well wooded and watered it was a typical english home with surroundings as unlike the great bare bald mountains and wild atlantic seas beth had hitherto shuddered amongst as peace is unlike war certain natures are stimulated by the grandeur of such scenes but beth was too delicate an instrument to be played upon so roughly storms within reflected the storms without only too readily she was tempesttossed by temperament and in nature all her yearning was for repose so that now as they drove up the wellordered avenue to the house the tender tone of colour green against quiet grey and the easy air of affluence so soothing after the sorrowful signs of a hard struggle for life by which her feelings had hitherto been harrowed drew from her a deep sigh of satisfaction the halldoor stood open but no one was looking out for them they could hear the tinkle of a piano in the distance then a servant appeared followed by a stout lady who came forward to greet them in a hurried nervous way im glad to see you she said kissing mrs caldwell she spoke in a breathless undertone as if she were saying something wrong and was afraid of being caught and stopped before she had finished the sentence i should like to have gone to meet you but james said there were too many for the carriage as it was he says more than two in the carriage makes it look like an excursionparty but i was listening for you only i dont hear very well you know you remember me mildred this is beth i suppose and this is bernadine you dont know who i am i am your aunt grace mary james begs you to excuse him for a little caroline it is his halfhour for exercises so unfortunate if you had only come a little later but however the sooner the better for me come into the diningroom and see aunt victoria we must stay there until uncle james has finished practising his exercises in the drawingroom greataunt victoria bench was sitting bolt upright on a high chair in the diningroom tatting family portraits hung far too high all round the room seemed to have been watching her complacently until the travellers entered when they all turned instantly and looked hard at beth aunt victoria was a tall thin old lady with a beautiful delicate complexion an auburn front and white cap and a severely simple black dress she rose stiffly to receive mrs caldwell and kissed her on both cheeks with restrained emotion then she shook hands with each of the children i hope you had a pleasant journey she was beginning formally when mrs caldwell suddenly burst into tears what is the matter caroline aunt victoria asked oh nothing the poor lady answered in a broken voice only it does seem a sad homereturningalonewithout himyou know aunt grace mary furtively patted mrs caldwell on the back keeping an eye on aunt victoria the while however as if she were afraid of being caught all this time the tinkletinkletinkle of hamiltons exercises for beginners on the piano had been going on now it stopped aunt grace mary slipped into a chair and sat with a smile on her face aunt victoria became a trifle more rigid over her tatting and mrs caldwell hurriedly wiped her eyes then the door opened deliberately and there entered a great stout man with red hair sprinkled with grey large prominent lightcoloured eyes a nondescript nose a wide shapeless gash of a mouth and a red moustache with straight bristly hairs like the bristles of a broom how do you do caroline he said holding out his big fat white hand and kissing her coldly on the forehead he drawled his words out with a decided lisp and in a very soft voice which contrasted oddly with his huge bulk having greeted his sister he turned and looked at the children mildred went up and shook hands with him your sisters i perceive have no manners he observed beth had been beaming round blandly on the group but upon that last remark of uncle jamess the pleased smile faded from her face and she coloured painfully and offered him a small reluctant hand you are elizabeth i suppose he said i am beth she answered emphatically she and uncle james looked into each others eyes for an instant and in that instant she made a most disagreeable impression of fearlessness on the big mans brain i hope caroline he said precisely that you will not continue to call your daughter by such an absurd abbreviation that sort of thing was all very well in the wilds of ireland but here we must have something rational ladylike and recognised mrs caldwell looked distressed it would be so difficult to call her elizabeth she pleaded she is not at allelizabeth you may call me what you like mamma beth put in with decision but i shall only answer to beth that was the name my father gave me and i shall stick to it uncle james stared at her in amazement but beth unabashed stared back obstinately and so they continued staring until aunt grace mary made a diversion james she hurriedly interposed wouldnt they like some refreshment uncle james pulled the bellrope bring wine and cake he lisped when the servant answered then he returned to his seat crossed one great leg over the other folded his fat hands on his knee and inspected his sister you certainly do not grow younger caroline he observed mrs caldwell did not look cheered by the remark and there was a painful pause broken happily by the arrival of the cake and wine you will not take more than half a glass i suppose caroline at this time of the day uncle james said playfully as he took up the decanter and marsala not port i know what ladies are poor mrs caldwell was exhausted and would have been the better for a good glass of port but she meekly held her peace then uncle james cut the cake and gave each of the children a very small slice beth held hers suspended halfway to her mouth and gazed at her uncle what is that child staring at he asked her mother at last i think she is admiring you was mrs caldwells happy rejoinder no mamma i am not beth contradicted i was just thinking i had never seen anything so big in my life anything uncle james protested what does she mean caroline i dont mean this slice of cake beth chuckled come dearcome dear aunt grace mary hurriedly interposed come upstairs and seeand seethe pretty room youre to have come and take your things off like a good child beth rose obediently but before she followed her aunt out of the room she said here bernadine youd better have my slice youll howl if you dont get enough cakes are scarce and dear here i suppose aunt victoria had tatted diligently during this little scene now she looked up over her spectacles and inspected uncle james i like that child she said decidedly in which respect i should think you would probably find yourself in a very small minority uncle james lisped spreading his mouth into what would have been a smile in any other countenance but was merely an elongation of the lips in his mrs caldwell rocked herself forlornly mildred nestled close to her mother while baby bernadine with a slice of cake in each hand took a mouthful first from the right and then from the left impartially uncle james gazed at her i suppose that is an irish custom he said at length bernadine what are you doing mrs caldwell snapped and bernadine startled let both slices fall on the floor and set up a howl with her mouth full ah uncle james murmured tenderly little children are such darling things they make the sense of their presence felt the moment they enter a house it becomes visible also in the crumbs on the floor there is evidently nothing the matter with her lungs but i should have thought it would be dangerous to practise her voice like that with the mouth full perhaps she would be more at her ease upstairs mrs caldwell took the hint when the child had gone uncle james rang for a servant to sweep up the cake and crumbs and carefully stood over her superintending that will do he said at length so far as the cake and crumbs are concerned but i beg you to observe that you have brushed the pile of the carpet the wrong way meanwhile aunt grace mary had taken beth up a polished staircase through a softly carpeted airy corridor at the end of which was a large room with two great mahogany fourpost beds hung with brown damask the rest of the heavy oldfashioned furniture being to match all over the house there was a delicious odour of fresh air and lavender everything shone resplendent and all was orderly to the point of stiffness nothing looked as if it had ever been used this was your mammas room when she was a girl aunt grace mary confided to beth she used to fill the house with her girlfriends and that was why she had such big beds she used to be a very highspirited girl your dear mamma was you are all to sleep here how good it smells said beth ah thats the lavender i often burn lavender would you like to see me burn some lavender come to my room then and ill show you but take your things off first beth dragged off her hat and jacket and threw them aside they happened to fall on the floor my dear child aunt grace mary exclaimed look at your things beth looked at them but nothing occurred to her so she looked at her aunt inquiringly i always put mine awayat least i should you know if i hadnt a maid said aunt grace mary oh let your maid put mine away too beth answered casually but my dear child you must learn aunt grace mary insisted picking up beths things and putting them in a drawer as she spoke who puts your things away at home mamma beth answered laconically she says its less trouble to do things herself oh but you must save your mother the trouble dear said aunt grace mary in a shocked tone well i will next timeif i remember beth rejoined come and burn lavender for the next few days which happened to be very fine beth revelled out of doors everything was a wonder and a joy to her in this fertile land the trees especially after the bleak wild wastes to which she had been accustomed in the one stormy corner of ireland she knew leaves and blossoms were just bursting out and one day wandering alone in the grounds she happened unawares upon an orchard in full bloom and fairly gasped utterly overcome by the first shock of its beauty for a while she stood and gazed in silent awe at the white froth of flowers on the peartrees the tinted almond blossom and the pinktipped apple she had never dreamed of such heavenly loveliness but enthusiasm succeeded to awe at last and in a wild burst of delight she suddenly threw her arms around a gnarled treetrunk and clasped it close there was a large piece of artificial water in the grounds in which were three green islands covered with trees and shrubs beth was standing on the bank one morning in a contemplative mood admiring the water and yearning for a boat to get to the islands when round one of them unexpectedly a white wonder of a swan came gliding towards her in the sunshine oh oh mildred mildred oh the beautiful beautiful thing she cried mildred came running up why beth you idiot she exclaimed in derision its only a swan i really thought it was something is that a swan beth said slowly then after a moment she added in sorrowful reproach o mildred you had seen it and you never told me alas poor mildred she had not seen it and never would see it in beths sense of the word on wet days when they had to be indoors aunt grace mary waylaid beth continually and trotted her off somewhere out of uncle jamess way she would take her to her own room sometimes a large bright apartment spickandspan like the rest of the house and show her the picturespastels and watercolours chieflywith which it was stiffly decorated that was your uncle when he was a little boy she said pointing to a pretty pastel why he was quite a nice little boy beth exclaimed yes nice and plump aunt grace mary rattled off breathlessly and your grandmamma did those watercolours and those screens that lovely printing too can you guess how she did it with a camels hair brush she did indeed and she used to compose music she was a very clever woman you are very like her but i am not very clever said beth no dear no dear aunt grace mary rejoined pulling herself up hurriedly from this indiscretion but in the face you are very like her in appearance and you must try you must try to improve yourself your uncle is always trying to improve himself he reads doctor syntax aloud to us in the evening it is our custom to read aloud and converse an occasional phrase of uncle jamess would flow from aunt grace mary in this way with incongruous effect do you try to improve yourself beth asked yes dear how oh wellthat reminds me i must write a letter you shall stay and see me if you like but you mustnt move or speak beth deeply interested watched her aunt who began by locking the door then she slipped a pair of spectacles out of her pocket and put them on after glancing round apprehensively as if she were going to do something wrong then she sat down at a small bureau unlocked a drawer and took out a little dictionary unlocked another drawer and took out a sheet of notepaper in which she inserted a page of black lines then she proceeded to write a letter in leadpencil stopping often to consult the dictionary when she had done she took out another sheet of a better quality put the lines in it and proceeded to copy the letter in ink she blotted the first attempt but the next she finished she destroyed several envelopes also before she was satisfied but at last the letter was folded and sealed and then she carefully burnt every scrap of paper she had spoiled i was educated in a convent in france she said to beth if you were older you would know that by my handwriting it is called an italian hand but i learnt it in france i was there five years what else did you learn said beth ohreading noi could read before i went but music you know and french say some french said beth oh i cant aunt grace mary answered but i can read it a little you know i should like to hear you play said beth but i dont play aunt grace mary rejoined i thought you said you learnt music oh yes i had to learn music and i practised for hours every day but i never played aunt grace mary smiled complacently as she spoke took off her spectacles and locked up her writing materialsbeth the while thoughtfully observing her aunt grace marys hair was a wonderful colour neither red yellow brown nor white but a mixture of all four it was parted straight in the middle where it was thin and brought down in two large rolls over her ears she wore a black velvet band across her head like a coronet which ended in a large black velvet bow at the back long heavy gold earrings pulled down the lobes of her ears all her dresses were of rustling silk and she had a variety of deep lacecollars each one of which she fastened with a different brooch at the throat she also wore a heavy gold watchchain round her neck the watch being concealed in her bosom and jet bracelets by day but gold ones in the evening beth was deeply interested in her own family history and intelligently pieced together such fragments of it as she could collect from the conversations of the people about her she was sitting in one of the deep windowseats in the drawingroom looking out one day concealed by a curtain when her mother and greataunt victoria bench came into the room and settled themselves to chat and sew without observing her where is grace mary aunt victoria asked locked up in her own room writing a letter i believe mrs caldwell replied a long and mysterious proceeding we shall not see her again this morning i suppose ah well said aunt victoria considerately she writes a very beautiful hand james thought he was doing so well for himself too mrs caldwell interjected hed better have married the mother there was the making of a fine woman in grace mary if she had had a chance aunt victoria answered pursing up her mouth judicially it was the mother made the match when he came across them in switzerland lady benyon got hold of him and flattered him made him believe grace mary was only thirtyeight not too old for a sonandheir but much too old for a large family she was really about fifty but he never thought of looking up her age until after they were married however james got one thing he likes and more than he deserved for grace mary is amiable if shes ignorant and i should say had tact though some people might call it cunning but at any rate shes the daughter of one baronet and the sister of another whats a baronet beth demanded tumbling off the windowseat on to the floor with a crash as she spoke having lost her balance in peering round the curtain both ladies jumped quite contrary to their principles you naughty child how dare you mrs caldwell began beth picked herself up i want to know she interrupted youve been listening no ive not i was here first and you came and talked but that doesnt matter i shant tell whats a baronet aunt victoria explained and then turned her out of the room uncle james was crossing the hall at the moment he had a large bunch of keys in his hand and went through the doubledoors which led to the kitchen and offices beth followed him into the kitchen the cook an old servant came forward curtseying the remains of yesterdays dinner cold roast beef tongue chicken and plumpudding were spread out on the table uncle james inspected everything for luncheon he said the beef can remain cold on the sideboard also the tongue the chicken you will grill for one hot dish and do not forget to garnish with rolls of bacon the pudding you can cut into slices fry and sprinkle with a little sifted sugar mind i say a little for as the pudding is sweet enough already the sugar is merely an ornament to make it agreeable to the eye for the rest as usual yes sir and dinner sir here is the menu he handed her a paper i will give you out what is necessary he led the way down a stone passage to the storeroom door which he unlocked i am out of sifted sugar sir the cook said nervously what again uncle james sternly demanded this is only thursday and i gave you some out on saturday yes sir but only a quarter of a pound sir and i had to use it for the top of the ricepudding and the pancakes and the charlotte russe and the plumpudding how said uncle jamesthe plumpudding which is not yet fried beg pardon sir im all confused but however she added desperately the sugar is done well i suppose i must give you some more this time but do not let it occur again you may weigh out a quarter of a pound when that was done uncle james consulted a huge cookerybook which lay on a shelf in the window we shall require another cake for tea he said and then proceeded to read the recipe aloud keeping an observant eye upon the cook as she weighed out the various ingredients and the kitchen meals sir she asked as he locked up the storeroom make what you have do he said make what you have do but there is hardly meat enough to go round once sir you must make it do people are much healthier and happier when they do not eat too much this ceremony over he went to the poultryyard followed by beth who carefully kept in the background the yardboy and the poultrymaid who carried some corn in a sieve which she handed to her master when he stopped uncle james scattered a little corn on the ground calling chuck chuck chuck at the same time in a dignified manner chickens ducks turkeys and guineafowl collected about him and he stood gazing at them with large light prominent eyes blandly as if he loved themas indeed he did when they appeared like ladies at table dressed to perfection that guineafowl he decided after due consideration the yardboy caught it and gave it to the poultrymaid who held it while uncle james carefully felt its breast that will do he said quite a beauty the yardboy took it from the poultrymaid tied its legs together cut its throat and hung it on a nail that drake uncle james proceeded the same ceremony followed uncle james bearing his part in it without any relaxation of his grand manner when a turkeypoult had also been executed he requested the yardboy to fetch him his gun from the harnessroom we must have a pigeonpie he observed as he took it beth in great excitement stalked him to the orchard where there was a big pigeonhouse covered with ivy in front of it the pigeons had a good run enclosed with wire netting when they were shut in but they were often let out to feed in the fields the yardboy now reached up and opened a little door in the side of the house as he did so he glanced at uncle james somewhat apprehensively uncle james with a benign countenance suddenly lifted his gun and fired the yardboy dropped what is the matter said uncle james the yardboy gathered himself up with a very red face i thought you meant to shoot me sir uncle james smiled gently may i ask when it became customary for gentlemen to shoot yardboys he said beg pardon sir the boy rejoined sheepishly theres accidents sometimes the pigeons were wary after the shot and would not come out so the yardboy had to go into the house and drive them there was a shelf in front of the little door on which they generally rested a moment bewildered before they flew uncle james knew them all by sight and let several go as being too old for his purpose then standing pretty close he shot two one after the other as they stood hesitating to take flight while loading again he discovered beth but as he liked an audience when he was performing an exploit he was quite gracious nothing distinguishes a gentleman more certainly than a love of sport he observed blandly as he shot another pigeon sitting this entertainment over he looked at his watch he had the whole day divided into hours and halfhours each with its separate occupation or recreation and nothing short of a visit from some personage of importance was ever allowed to interrupt him in any of his pursuits for recreation he sometimes did a little knitting or a piece of berlin woolwork because he said a gentleman should learn to do everything so as not to be at a loss if he were ever wrecked on a desert island for the same reason he had also trained himself to sleep at odd times and in all sorts of odd places choosing by preference some corner where aunt grace mary and the maids would least expect to find him the consequence being wild shrieks and shocks to their nerves such as to use his own bland explanation might be expected from undisciplined females beth found him one day spread out on a large oak chest in the main corridor upstairs with two great china vases one at his head and one at his feet filled with reeds and bulrushes which appeared to be waving over him and looking in his sleep with his cadaverous countenance like a selfsatisfied corpse she had been on her way downstairs to dispose of the core of an apple she had eaten but as uncle jamess mouth was open she left it there uncle james was wont to deliver little lectures to the children for the improvement of their minds during luncheon which was their dinnerhour with regularity and practice you may accomplish great things he said on one occasion i myself always practise hamiltons exercises on the pianoforte for one hour every day from halfpast ten till eleven and from halfpast three till four i have done so now for many years beth sat with her spoon suspended halfway up to her mouth drinking in these words of wisdom and when will you be able to play she asked uncle james fixed his large light ineffectual eyes upon her but as usual this gaze direct only excited beths interest and she returned it unabashed in simple expectation of what was to follow so uncle james gave in and to cover his retreat he said culture cultivate the mind there is nothing that elevates the mind like general cultivation it is cultivation that makes us great good and generous then i suppose when your mind is cultivated uncle james you will give mamma more money beth burst out hopefully uncle james blinked his eyes several times running rapidly as if something had gone wrong with them beth you are talking too much go to your room at once and stay there for a punishment her mother exclaimed nervously beth innocent of any intent to offend looked surprised put down her spoon deliberately got off her chair took up her plate of pudding and was making off with it as she was passing uncle james however he stretched out his big hand suddenly and snatched the plate from her but beth in an instant doubled her little fist and struck the plate from underneath the concussion scattering the pudding all over the front of uncle james in the confusion which followed beth made her escape to the kitchen where she was already popular i say cook she coaxed give me something good to eat my puddings got upset all over uncle james the cook sat down suddenly and twinkled a glance of intelligence at horner the old coachman who happened to be in the kitchen give me a cheesecakei wont tell beth pleaded thats doubtful i should think horner said aside to the cook oh bless you she never do not she cook answered and then she fetched beth a big cheesecake from a secret store beth took it smiling and retired to the brown bedroom where she was left in solitary confinement until uncle james drove out with mamma in aunt grace marys ponycarriage to pay a call in the afternoon when they had gone aunt grace mary peeped in at beth and said with an unconvincing affectation of anger beth you are a naughty little girl and deserve to be punished say youre sorry then you shall come to my room and see me write a letter all right beth answered and aunt grace mary took her off without more ado it was a great encouragement to beth to find that aunt grace mary was obliged to take pains with her writing all the other grownup people beth knew seemed to do everything with such ease it was quite disheartening beth was allowed a pencil a sheet of paper and some lines herself now and aunt grace mary was taking great pains to teach her to write an italian hand beth was also trying to learn because there are such lots of things i want to write down she explained and i want to do it small like you because it wont take so much paper you know what kind of things do you want to write down beth aunt grace mary asked beth treated her quite as an equal so they chatted the whole time they were together unconstrainedly oh you knowthings likewell the day we came here there were great grey clouds with crimson caps hanging over the sea and you could see them in the water see their reflection you mean i suppose beth looked puzzled when you think of things isnt that reflection she asked yes and when you see yourself in the lookingglass thats your reflection too aunt grace mary answered oh then i suppose it was the seas thought of the sky i saw in the waterthat makes it nicer than i had it before beth said trying to turn the phrase as a young bird practises to round its notes in the spring the sea shows its thoughts the thought of the sea is the skyno that isnt right it never does come right all at once you know but thats the kind of thing what kind of thing aunt grace mary asked bewildered the kind of thing i am always wanting to write down you generally forget what were talking about dont youi say dont you want to drive your own ponies yourself sometimes no not when your dear uncle wants them dear uncle wants them almost always doesnt he horner ses as ow beth dont speak like that thats horner not me beth snapped impatient of the interruption how am i to tell you what he said if i dont say what he said horner ses as ow when lady benyon gev them there white ponies to er darter fur er own use squire e sells two on is orses an as used them ponies ever since squires a near un my word beth perceived that aunt grace mary looked very funny in the face youre frightened to death of uncle james arnt you she asked after sucking her pencil meditatively for a little no dear of course not i am not afraid of any one but the dear lord but uncle james is the lord nonsense child mildred says so she says hes lord of the manor mildred says its fine to be lord of the manor but it doesnt make me care a button about uncle james dont speak like that beth its disrespectful it was the lord in heaven i alluded to said aunt grace mary in her breathless way ah that is different beth allowed but im not afraid of him either i dont think im afraid of any one really not even of mamma though she does beat me id rather she didnt you know but one gets used to it the worst of it is beth added after sucking the point of her pencil a littlethe worst of it is you never know what will make her waxy today at luncheon you knownow what did i say oh said aunt grace mary vaguely you oughtnt to have said it you know now thats just like mamma she says dont and how dare you and naughty girl at the top of her voice and half the time i dont know what shes talking about when i grow up i shall explain to children do you know sometimes i quite want to be goodthis with a sigh but when im bad without having a notion what ive done why its difficult aunt grace mary do you know what neptune would say if the sea dried up aunt grace mary smiled and shook her head i havent an ocean beth proceeded you dont see it well i didnt at first you see an ocean and a notion sound the same if you say them sharp now do you see they call that a pun who told you that a gentleman in the train beth put her pencil in her mouth and gazed up at the sky i dont suppose hed be such a blackhearted villain as to break his word she said at last who aunt grace mary asked in a startled tone uncle jamesabout leaving jim the place you know why dont you know mamma is the eldest and ought to have had fairholm but she was away in ireland busy having me when grandpapa died and couldnt come so uncle james frightened the old man into leaving the place to him and mamma only got fifty pounds a year which wasnt fair who told you this beth mildred mamma told her and horner said the other day to cookill have to say it the way horner says it if i said it my way you know then it wouldnt be hornerhorner said to cook as ow captain caldwell ud a gone to law about it but squire e swore if ed let the matter drop ed make is nevee master jim as is also is godson is heir an so square it and captain caldwell as was a real genlmon an fond of the ladies tuk im at is word an furgiv im but lardie dont us know the worth o mr james pattens word aunt grace mary had turned very pale beth she gasped promise me you will never never never say a word about this to your uncle not likely said beth how do you remember these things you hear oh i just think them over again when i go to bed and then they stay beth answered i wouldnt tell you half i hear thoughonly things everybody knows if you tell secrets you know youre a tellpie and im not a tellpie now bernadine is shes a regular tellpie it seems as if she couldnt help it but then shes young beth added tolerantly were you ever young i wonder aunt grace mary muttered to herself chapter xiii meanwhile the english spring advanced in the beautiful gardens of fairholm and was a joy to beth blossoms showered from the fruittrees green leaves unfurled the birds were in full song and the swans curved their long necks in the sunshine and breasted the waters of the lake as if their own grace were a pleasure to them beth was enchanted every day she discovered some new wondernests in the hedgerows lambs in the fields a foal and its mother in the paddock a calf in the byremore living interests in one week than she had dreamt of in the whole of her little life for a happy interval the scenes which had oppressed herthe desolation the sombre colours of the great melancholy mountains the incessant sound of the turbulent sea the shock and roar of angry breakers warring with the rocks which had kept her little being all athrob braced to the expectation of calamitylapsed now into the background of her recollection and under the benign influence of these lovelier surroundings her mind began to expand in the most extraordinary way while her further faculty awoke and gave her glimpses of more delights than mortal mind could have shown her such nice things as she expressed it keep coming into my head and i want to write them down books she flung away impatiently but the woods and streams and the wild flowers the rooks returning to roost in the trees at sunset the horses playing in the paddocks the cows dawdling back from their pastures all sweet country scents and cheerful country sounds she became alive to and began to love there would be trouble enough in beth herself at times wherever she was it was hard that she could not have been kept in some such paradise always to ease the burden of her being one morning her mother told her that uncle james was extremely displeased with her because he had seen her pelting the swans he didnt see me pelting the swans beth asseverated i was feeding them with crusts and how did he see me any way he wasnt there he sees everything thats going on mrs caldwell assured her hes only pretending beth argued or else he must be god but she kept her eyes about her the next time she was in the grounds and at last she discovered him sitting in the little window of his dressingroom with a book before him and completely blocking the aperture she had never noticed him there before because the panes were small and bright and the shine on them made it difficult to see through them from below after this discovery she always felt that his eyes were upon her wherever she went within range of that window not that that would have deterred her had she wanted to do anything particularly but even a child feels it intolerable to be spied upon and as for a spy beth scorned the creature that day at luncheon uncle james made an announcement lady benyon is going to honour us with a visit he began in his most impressive manner there is no snob so inveterate as your snob of good birth and uncle james said lady as if it were a privilege just to pronounce the word she will arrive this afternoon at a quarter to four but you will be practising beth exclaimed the rites of hospitality must be observed he condescended to inform her lady benyon is my mother beth aunt grace mary put in irrelevantly i know beth answered your papa was a baronet uncle james loves baronets that was why he married you having thus disposed of aunt grace mary beth turned to the other end of the table and resumed but you went on practising when we arrived uncle james uncle james gazed at her blandly then looked at his sister with an agreeable smile lady benyon will probably like to see the children you do not dress them in the latest fashion i observe they are shabby mrs caldwell acknowledged with a sigh apologetically beth shovelled some spoonfuls of pudding into her mouth very quickly thats the money bother again she said and then she sang out at the top of her voice bryan olynn had no breeches to wear he bought a sheepskin for to make him a pair with the skinny side out and the woolly side in theyre warm in the winter said bryan olynn i suppose it would be quite impossible to suppress this child uncle james lisped with deceptive mildness i observe that she joins in the conversation always with great intelligence and her mouth full it might be better perhaps if she emptied her mouth however i suppose it would be impossible to teach her not at all beth answered for herself cheerfully im not too stupid to empty my mouth only just you tell me what it is you want dont bottle things up i expect ive been speaking with my mouth full ever since i came and youve been hating me for it but you never told me may i ask said uncle james politely by whom you were informed that i bottled things up ah that would be telling said beth and recommenced gobbling her pudding to the intense relief of some of the party greataunt victoria bench sitting upright opposite looked across the table at the child and a faint smile flickered over her wrinkled roseleaf cheek beth finished her pudding dropped her spoon on her plate with a clatter leant back in her chair and sighed with satisfaction she possessed a horrid fascination for uncle james almost everything she did was an offence to him yet he could not keep his eyes off her or let her alone pudding seems to be a weakness of hers he now observed i hope her voracity is satisfied i should say that it resembles the voracity of the caterpillar whats voracity aunt victoria beth asked greediness aunt victoria rejoined sententiously he means im greedy for pudding i just am id like to be a caterpillar for pudding caterpillars eat all day but then gods good to them he puts them on a tree with lots of leaves i wish hed put me in a pantry with lots of puddings my vorassvorwhat is it any way its satisfied now uncle james and if youll let me go ill wash myself and get ready for lady benyon rather than let her go when she wanted to however uncle james sat some time longer at table than he had intended it was he who always gave the signal to rise before he did so on this occasion he formally requested his sister to request beth to be silent during lady benyons visit lady benyon was a shrewd active little old woman with four dark curls laid horizontally on either side of her forehead she had bright black sparkling eyes that glanced about quickly and seemed to see everything before she arrived uncle james assembled his family in the drawingroom and set the scene as it were for her reception sit here facing the window caroline he said it will interest lady benyon to see how you have aged and aunt victoria this chippendale chair so stiff and straight is just like you i think so oblige me by sitting on it grace mary take this easy lounge it suits your yielding nature elizabethbeth who was perched on the pianostool looked up calmly at the clouds through the window opposite elizabeth he repeated sharply beth made no sign beth answer your uncle directly mrs caldwell exclaimed he has not yet addressed me beth rejoined in the manner of uncle james dont call your uncle he you naughty girl you know your name is elizabeth yes and i know i said i wouldnt answer to it and im not going to break me oath me oath uncle james ejaculated beth looked disconcerted it irked her horribly to be jeered at for making a mistake in speaking and uncle james seeing she was hurt rested satisfied for the moment and arranged mildred and bernadine together in a group leaving beth huddled up on the pianostool frowning when lady benyons carriage stopped at the door uncle james stood bareheaded on the steps ready to receive her so glad to see you mamma he lisped as he handed her out do take my arm but the little old lady waved him aside unceremoniously and hobbled in with the brisk stiffness of age gracious she exclaimed when she saw the party arranged in the drawingroom you all look as if you were having your likeness takenall except puck there on the pianostool when uncle james had manoeuvred lady benyon into the seat of honour he intended her to take in order to complete the picture she frankly inspected each member of the group ending with beth and who may you be she asked beth smiled and shrugged her shoulders why dont you speak beth made another gesture goodness lady benyon cried is the child an idiot beth answer lady benyon directly mrs caldwell angrily commanded uncle james requested mamma to request me not to speak when you were present beth explained suavely the old lady burst out laughing well thats droll she saidrequested mamma to request mewhy its james patten all over and who may you be you monkey i am elizabeth caldwell but i only answer to beth papa called me beth good said the little old lady and whats ireland like great dark mountains beth rattled off with big eyes dilated and fixed on space as if she saw what she described long long long black bogs all the poor people starving and the sea roughjust like hell you know but without the fire oh now this is delightful the old lady chuckled im to enjoy myself today it seems you didnt prepare me for this treat james patten uncle james simpered as though taking to himself the credit of the whole entertainment so you hate ireland said lady benyon no i love it said beth its me native country and they dont give you little bits of cake there the size of sixpence what they have youre welcome to long live ireland good lady benyon ejaculated then turned to mildred and are you another naughty little patriot she asked no im not naughty mildred answered piously beths naughty said bernadine im sure i dont know what beth is not the old lady declared turning to beth again riley said i was one of the little girls the devil put out when he gave up housekeeping beth remarked casually beth mrs caldwell remonstrated he did mamma he said it the day that perjured villain pat murphy killed my magpie and rileys a good man you said so yourself you can hear that the young lady has been in ireland i suppose mamma uncle james observed i hear she can imitate the irish lady benyon rejoined bluntly and not the irish only she added with a chuckle beth was still sitting on the musicstool opposite the window and presently she saw some one cross the lawn oh do look at the lovely lady she cried enthusiastically shes just like the princess blueeyesandgoldenhair lady benyon glanced over her shoulder why its my maid she said beths countenance dropped then cleared again even a maid might be a princess in disguise lady benyon was going to stay all night and at her special request mildred and beth were allowed to sit up to late dinner and prayers she expected beth to amuse her but beth was busy the whole time weaving a romance about the lovely ladysmaid and scarcely spoke a word when the servants came in to prayers she sat and gazed at her heroine and forgot to stand or kneel she noticed however that uncle james read the evening prayers with peculiar fervour when beth went to bed she found bernadine who slept with her fast asleep beth was not at all sleepy her intellect had been on the alert all day and would not let her rest now she must do something to keep up the excitement she pulled the blind aside and looking out of the window discovered an enchanted land all soft shadow and silver sheen and above it an exquisite moon in an empty sky floated serenely oh to be out in the moonlight she sighed to herself the fairyfolkthe fairyfolk for a little her mind was a blank as she gazed then words came tripping a measure the fairyfolk are calling me are calling me are calling me they come across the stormy sea to play with me to play with me beths vague longing crisped itself into a resolution she looked at the big fourpost bed the curtains were drawn on one side of it should she draw them on the other on the chance of her mother not looking in no she must wait because of mildred mildred was undressing and would say her prayers presently beth waited until she knelt down then slipped her nightdress on over her clothes and got into bed without disturbing bernadine now she must wait for her mother but mrs caldwell came up very soon uncle james having hurried every one off to bed unusually early that evening mrs caldwell was a long time undressing as it seemed to beth but in the meantime mildred had fallen asleep and very soon after her mother got into bed she too began to breathe with reassuring regularity then beth got up opened the door very gently and slipped out into the dark passage the fairyfolk are calling me are calling me are calling me they come across the stormy sea to play with me to play with me the words set themselves to a merry tune and carried beth on with them all was dark in the hall the front door was locked and bolted and the shutters were up in all the rooms how was she to get out she felt for the green baize doubledoor which shut off the kitchen from the other parts of the house opened it and groped her way down the passage as she did so she saw a faint glimmer of light at the far endnot candlelight moonlightand at the same moment she became aware of some one else moving at the end of the passage she was in there was a little door leading out into a garden if that were open all would be easy she had stopped to listen certainly some one else was moving quite close to her what was she near oh the storeroom something grated like a key in a locka door was opened a match struck a candle lighted and there was mrs cook in the storeroom itself hurriedly filling paperbags with tea sugar raisins currants and other groceries from uncle jamess carefully guarded treasure and packing them into a small hamper with a lid when the hamper was full she blew out the candle came out of the storeroom locked the door after her and went into the kitchen without discovering beth she left the kitchen door open the blind was up and beth could see a man whom she recognised as the cooks son standing in the moonlight is there much this time mother he asked a goodish bit cook replied handing him the hamper e asnt ad is eyes about im much o late then oh e allus as is eyes about im but e doant see much youll get me what ye can i will so her son replied and kissed cook as she let him out of the backdoor which she fastened after him then she went off herself up the backstairs to bed when all was quiet again beth thought of the gardendoor at the end of the passage to her relief she found it ajar the gleam of light she had seen in that direction was the moonlight streaming through the crevice she slipped out cautiously but the moment she found herself in the garden she became a wild creature revelling in her freedom she ran jumped waved her arms about threw herself down on the ground and rolled over and over for yards walked on all fours turned head over heels embraced the trunks of trees and hailed them with the eastern invocation o tree give me of thy strength for a good hour she rioted about the place in this way working off her superfluous energy by that time she had come to the stackyard there among the great stacks she played hideandseek with the fairyfolk for a little very cautiously she would steal round in the black shadows stalking her imaginary playfellows and then would go flying out into the moonlight pursued by them in turn and looking herself with her white nightdress over her clothes and her tousled hair the weirdest little elfin figure in the world finally to escape capture she ran up a ladder that had been left against a haystack blocks of hay had been cut out leaving a square shelf half way down the stack on to which beth scrambled from the ladder there was room enough for her to lie at her ease up there and recover her breath the hay and the nightair smelt deliciously sweet the stack she was on was one of the outer row beneath was the road along which the waggons brought their loads in harvest time and this was flanked by a low wall on the other side of which was a meadow bordered with elms beth pulled up the hay about her covered herself with it and nestled amongst it luxuriously the moon shone full upon her but she had quite concealed herself and would probably have fallen asleep after her exertions had it not been that just when drowsiness was coming upon her she was startled by the sound of a hurried footstep and a girl in a light dress with a shawl about her shoulders came round the stack and stood still looking about her as if she expected some one beth recognised her as harriet elvidge the kitchenmaid and presently russell one of the grooms came hurrying to meet her from the other direction they rushed into each others arms thoust laate the girl grumbled ah bin waatin ower yoner this good bit he answered putting his arm round her and drawing her to the wall on which they sat leaning against each other and whispering happily the moon was low and her great golden disk illumined the sky against which the two dark figures stood out silhouetted distinctly the effect gave beth a sensation of pleasure and she racked her brains for words in which to express it presently the lovers rose and strolled away together then for a little it was lonely and beth thought of getting down but before she had made up her mind two other people appeared strolling in the moonlight whom beth instantly recognised as uncle james and the beautiful princess blueeyesandgoldenhair the princess had both her hands clasped round uncle jamess arm and every now and then she nestled her face against his shoulder lovingly what will jimmiewimmie give his jennypenny she was saying as they approached first what will jennypenny give her jimmiewimmie uncle james cooed first a nicesweetkiss duckiedearie jimmiewimmie gurgled ecstatically taking the kiss with the playful grace of an elephant gambolling beth on the haystack writhed with suppressed merriment until her sides ached but jimmiewimmie and jennypenny passed out of sight like harriet and russell before them the moon was sinking rapidly a sudden gust of air blew chill upon beth she was extremely sensitive to sudden changes of temperature and as the night grew dull and heavy so did her mood and she began to be as anxious to be indoors again as she had been to come out the fairyfolk had all vanished now and ghosts and goblins would come in their stead and pounce upon her as she passed if she were not quick beth scrambled down from the haystack and made for the sidedoor in hot haste and was halfway upstairs when it suddenly occurred to her that if she locked the door jimmiewimmie and jennypenny would not be able to get in so she retraced her steps accomplished her purpose slipped back to bed and slept until she was roused in the morning by a shrill cry from bernadinesee mummy see mummy lazy beth is in bed with all her clothes on beth sat up and slapped bernadine promptly whereupon mrs caldwell slapped beth such is life said beth in imitation of aunt grace mary and mrs caldwell smiled in spite of herself later in the day beth complained to mildred of a bad cold in her head oh dear mildred exclaimed i expect uncle james will talk at that cold as long as it lasts i know beth said grace mary dearor aunt victoriahave you observed that children always have colds and never have pockethandkerchiefs uncle james however had a bad cold himself that morning and described himself as very much indisposed i went out of doors last night before retiring he explained at luncheon tempted by the glorious moonlight and the balmy air but before i returned the night had changed and become chilly and unfortunately the sidedoor had shut itself and every one was in bed so i could not get in i threw pebbles up at grace marys window but failed to rouse her she being somewhat deaf i also knocked and rang but no one answered so i was obliged to shelter in the barn harriet however appeared finally sheergets the mens breakfasts anderthe kitchenwindow but here uncle james was seized with a sudden fit of sneezing and the connection between the mens breakfasts and the kitchenwindow was never explained she is an extremely good girl is harriet he proceeded as soon as he could speak up at four oclock every morning i wish to goodness my trollop was said lady benyon she gets later every day where did you go last night ohi had been loitering among the tombs so to speak he answered largely beth was eating cold beef stolidly but without much appetite because of her cold and also because there was hot chicken and uncle james had not given her her choice uncle james kept looking at her he found it hard to let her alone but she gave him no cause of offence for some time her little nose was troublesome however and at last she sniffed uncle james looked at lady benyon have you observed he said that when a child has a cold she never has a pockethandkerchief beth produced a clean one with a flourish and burst out laughing whats the matter puck lady benyon asked beaming already in anticipation oh nothing only i said uncle james would say that if i sniffed didnt i mildred but mildred too wary to support her looked down demurely puck said lady benyon youre a character there are good characters and there are bad characters uncle james moralised arrah thin it isnt a bad character youd be afther givin your own niece beth blarneyed and then she turned up her naughty eyes to the ceiling and chanted softly what will jimmiewimmie give his duckiedearie to be good a nicesweetkiss uncle jamess big white face became suddenly empurpled gracious hes swallowed wrong lady benyon exclaimed in alarm drink something you really should be careful a great fat man like you uncle james coughed hard behind his handkerchief then began to recover himself beths eyes were fixed on his face her chaunt had been a sudden inspiration and its effect upon the huge man had somewhat startled her but clearly uncle james was afraid she was going to tell how funny she ejaculated uncle james gasped again what is the matter puck lady benyon asked oh i was just thinkingthinking i would ask uncle james to give mildred some chicken why of course my dear child uncle james exclaimed to everybodys astonishment and have some yourself beth no thank you beth answered im full beth her mother was beginning when she perceived that uncle james was laughing now that child is really amusing he saidreally amusing no one else thought this last enormity a happy specimen of her wit and they looked at uncle james who continued to laugh in amazement beth he said when luncheon is over i shall give you a picturebook beth accordingly had to stay behind with him after the others had left the diningroom beth he began in a terrible voice as soon as they were alone together trying to frighten her beth what were you doing last night i was meditating among the tombs she answered glibly but i never heard them called by that name before you bad child i shall tell your mamma oh for shame said beth telltale and if you tell i shall i saw you kissing jennypenny uncle james collapsed he had been prepared to explain to beth that he had met the poor girl with some rustic lover and was lecturing her kindly for her good and making her go in which would have made a plausible story had it not been for that accursed kissing of course he could insist that beth was lying the child was known to be imaginative but then against that was the emotion he had shown lady benyon had no very high opinion of him he knew and once she obtained a clue she would soon unravel the truth no the only thing was to silence beth beth he said i quite agree with you my dear child i was only joking when i said i would tell your mamma nothing would induce me to tell tales out of school beth smiled up at him frankly nor me neither i dont believe youre such a bad old boy after all uncle james winced how he would have liked to throttle her he controlled himself however and even managed to make a smile as he got up to leave the room i say though beth exclaimed seeing him about to depart wheres that picturebook oh he ejaculated i had forgotten but no beth it would never do if i give it to you now it would look like a bribe and im sure you would never accept a bribe i should think not said beth and it was long years before she understood the mean adroitness of this last evasion chapter xiv there are those who maintain that a man can do everything better than a woman can do it this is certainly true of nagging when a man nags he shows his thoroughness his continuity and that love of sport which is the special pride and attribute of his sex when a man nags he puts his whole heart into the effort a woman only nags as a rule because the heart has been taken out of her the nagging woman is an overtasked creature with jarred nerves whose plaint is an expression of pain a cry for help in any interval of ease which lasts long enough to relax the tension she feels remorse and becomes amiably anxious to atone with the male nag it is different he is usually sleek and smiling a joyous creature fond of good living whose selfsatisfaction bubbles over in artistic attempts to make everybody else uncomfortable this was the kind of creature uncle james patten was he loved to shock and jar and startle people especially if they were powerless to retaliate of two ways of saying a thing he invariably chose the more disagreeable and when he had bad news to break it added to his interest in it if the victim felt it deeply and showed signs of suffering one morning at breakfast it might have been suspected that there was something unpleasant toward uncle james had read prayers with such happy unction and showed such pleased importance as he took his seat aunt victoria he lisped i have just observed in yesterdays paper that money matters are in a bad way there has been a crisis in the city and your investments have sunk so low that your income will be practically nil what said aunt victoria incredulously the shares you advised me to buy those are the ones yes he answered but theni fear you have lost money too she exclaimed oh no thank you he assured her in a tone which implied reproach i never speculate james patten said aunt victoria quietly am i to understand that you advised me to buy stock in which you yourself did not venture to speculate welleryou see he answered with composure as speculation was against my principles i could not take advantage of the opportunity myself but that seemed to me no reason why you should not try to double your income it may have been an error of judgment on my part i am far from infalliblefar from infallible but i think i may claim to be disinterested i did not hope to benefit myself during my lifetime aunt victoria suggested in the same tone of quiet selfrestraint i see my modest fortune would not have been much in itself to a man of your means but it would have been a considerable sum if doubled yes doubles or quits doubles or quits said uncle james beaming on aunt victoria as if he were saying something reassuring alas the family failing it is a new departure however for the familyto gamble at other peoples expense said aunt victoria alas poor human nature uncle james philosophised shaking his head you never knowyou never know aunt victoria looked him straight in the eyes but made no further show of emotion except that she sat more rigidly upright than usual perhaps and the rosetint faded from her delicate face leaving it waxenwhite beneath her auburn front uncle james ate an egg with a pious air of thankfulness for the mercies vouchsafed him and where will you live now aunt victoria he asked at last with an affectation of as much concern as he could get into his fat voice for many years he had insisted that fairholm was the proper place for his mothers sister but then she had had money to leave do not desert us altogether he pursued you must come and see us as often as your altered circumstances will admit greataunt victoria bench bowed expressively aunt grace mary grew very red in the face mrs caldwell seemed to be controlling herself with difficulty there will be a spare room in my cottage aunt victoria she said i hope you will consider it your own and make your home with me thank you kindly caroline the old lady answered but i must consider it would be a most proper arrangement uncle james genially decided and you would have our dear little beth of whom you approve you know for an interest in life beth left her seat impulsively and going round to the old lady nestled up to her slipped her little hand through her arm and glared at uncle james defiantly the old ladys face quivered for a moment and she patted the childs hand but no more was said on the subject in beths hearing only later she found that aunt victoria was going to live with them uncle james had suddenly become quite anxious that mrs caldwell should be settled in her own little house he said it would be so much more comfortable for her the little house was aunt grace marys property by the wayrent ten pounds a year but as it had not been let for a long time and it did houses no good to stand empty uncle james had graciously lent it to his sister when she was so settled in it that it would be a great inconvenience to move he asked for the rent during the next week he drove every day to the station in aunt grace marys ponycarriage to see if mrs caldwells furniture had arrived from ireland and when at last it came he sent every available servant he had to set the house in order so that it might be ready for immediate occupation he also persuaded harriet elvidge his invaluable kitchenmaid to enter mrs caldwells service as maidofallwork there is reason to believe that this arrangement was the outcome of uncle jamess peculiar sense of humour but mrs caldwell never suspected it it will be nice for you to have some one i know all about uncle james insisted and with a knowledge of cooking besides and how glad you will be to sleep under your own roof tonight he added in a tone of kindly congratulation and how glad you will be to get rid of us said beth thus early giving voice to what other people were only daring to think as soon as they were settled in the little bowwindowed house it became obvious that there would be differences of opinion between mamma and greataunt victoria bench they differed about the cooking about religion and about the education of children aunt victoria thought that if you cooked meat a second time it took all the goodness out of it mrs caldwell liked stews and she said if the joints were underdone at first as they should be recooking did not take the goodness out of the meat but aunt victoria abominated underdone joints more than anything the education of the children was a more serious matter howevera matter of principle in fact as opposed to a matter of taste mrs caldwell had determined to give her boys a good start in life in order to do this on her very limited income she was obliged to exercise the utmost selfdenial and even with that there would be little or nothing left to spend on the girls this however did not seem to mrs caldwell to be a matter of much importance it is customary to sacrifice the girls of a family to the boys to give them no educational advantages and then to jeer at them for their ignorance and silliness mrs caldwells own education had been of the most desultory character but such as it was she was content with it the method has answered in my case she complacently maintained without the slightest suspicion that the assertion proved nothing but extreme selfsatisfaction accordingly as she could not afford to send her daughters to school as well as the boys she decided to educate them herself everybody who could read write and cipher was supposed to be able to teach in those days and mrs caldwell undertook the task without a doubt of her own capacity but aunt victoria was not so sanguine i hope religious instruction will be a part of their education she said when the subject was first discussed they shall read the bible from beginning to end mrs caldwell answered shortly that i should think would be hardly desirable aunt victoria deprecated gently and i shall teach them their catechism and take them to church mrs caldwell proceeded that is the way in which i was taught we were instructed in doctrine and taught to order our conduct on certain fixed principles which were explained to us aunt victoria ventured indeed yes i dare say mrs caldwell observed politely so there the subject had to drop but aunt victoria was far from satisfied she shook her head sadly over her nieces spiritual state and determined to save the souls of her greatnieces by instructing them herself as occasion should offer what is education mamma beth asked why learning things of course mrs caldwell replied with a smile at the childs simplicity i know that beth snapped irritated by her mothers manner then why did you ask mrs caldwell wished to know the child has probably heard that that is not all said aunt victoria learning things is but one item of educationif you mean by that the mere acquisition of knowledge a wellordered day for instance is an essential part of education education is a question of discipline of regular hours for everything from the getting up in the morning to the going to bed at night no mind can be properly developed without routine teach a child how to order its time and its talents will do the rest get out your books children said mrs caldwell and aunt victoria hurriedly withdrew beth put a large bible colensos arithmetic a french grammar and pinnock an oldfashioned compilation of questions and answers on the table and looked at them despondently then she took a slate set herself the easiest addition sum she could find in colenso and did it wrong her mother told her to correct it i wish you would show me how mamma beth pleaded you must find out for yourself her mother answered this was her favourite formula she had no idea of making the lessons either easy or interesting to the children teaching was a duty she detested a time of trial both to herself and to her pupils to be got over as soon as possible the whole proceeding only occupied two or three dreadful hours of the morning and then the children were free for the rest of the day and so was she after lessons they all went out together to the north cliffs where aunt victoria and mrs caldwell walked to and fro on a sheltered terrace while the children played on the sands below it was a still day when beth first saw the sands and the lonely level and the tranquil sea delighted her on her left white cliffs curved round the bay like an arm on her right was the grey and solid old stone pile and behind her the mellow red brick houses of the little town scrambled up an incline from the shore irregularly silver sparkles brightened the hard smooth surface of the sand in the sunshine the tide was coming in and tiny waves advanced in irregular curves and broke with a merry murmur joy got hold of beth as she gazed about her feeling the beauty of the scene with the infinite charity of childhood she forgave her mother her trespasses against her for that day and her little soul was filled with the peace of the newly shriven she flourished a little wooden spade that aunt victoria had given her but did not dig the surface of the sand was all unbroken no disfiguring foot of man had trodden the long expanse and beth hesitated to be the first to spoil its exquisite serenity her heart expanded however and she shouted aloud in a great uncontrollable burst of exultation a man with a brown beard and moustache short crisp curly hair and deepset glittering dark grey eyes came up to her from behind he wore a blue pilotcoat blue trousers and a peaked cap the dress of a merchantskipper dont desecrate this heavenly solitude with discordant cries he exclaimed beth had not heard him approach and she turned round startled when he spoke i thought i was singing she rejoined dont dig and disfigure the beautiful bare brown bosom of the shore he pursued i did not mean to dig beth said looking up in his face and then looking round about her in perfect comprehension of his moodthe beautiful bare brown bosom of the shore she slowly repeated delighting in the phrase its the kind of thing you can sing you know yes said the man suddenly smiling it is pure poetry and i make you a present of the copyright but beth objected the shore is not brown ive been thinking and thinking what to call it its the colourthe colour ofthe colour of tarnished silver she burst out at last triumphantly well observed he said then i make you a present of the copyright beth answered readily thank you he said but it will not scan what is scan it wont fit into the verse you know the beautiful bare colouroftarnishedsilver bosom of the shore she sang out glibly then agreed with a wise shake of her head that the phrase was impossible and recurred to another point of interest as was her wontwhat is copyright before he could answer however mrs caldwell had swooped down upon them she had seen him from the cliff talking to beth and hastened down the steps in her hottempered way determined to rebuke the man for his familiarity and heedless of aunt victoria who had made an effort to stop her may i ask why you are interfering with my child sir she demanded the man in the sailorsuit raised his hat and bowed low excuse me madam he said i could not possibly have supposed that she was your child mrs caldwell coloured angrily as at an insult although the words seemed innocent enough when he had spoken he turned to beth with his hat still in his hand and addedgoodbye little lady we must meet again you and ion the beautiful bare brown bosom of the shore beths sympathy shone out in a smile and she waved her hand confidingly to him as he turned away mrs caldwell seized her arm and hurried her up the steps to aunt victoria who stood on the edge of the cliff blinking calmly imagine beth scraping acquaintance with such a commonlooking person mrs caldwell cried you must never speak to him or look at him againdo you hear i wonder what taste you will develop next it is a pity that you are so impetuous caroline aunt victoria observed quietly that gentleman is the count gustav bartahlinsky who may perhaps be considered eccentric here where noblemen of great attainments and wealth are certainly not numerous but is hardly to be called commonlooking beth saw her mothers countenance drop then i may speak to him she decided for herself whats a copyright mamma oh dont bother beth mrs caldwell exclaimed irritably when they went home bernadine clamoured for food and her mother gave her a piece of bread they were to have dinner at four oclock but no luncheon for economys sake beth was hungry too but she would not confess it what she had heard of their poverty had made a deep impression on her and she was determined to eat as little as possible aunt victoria glanced at bernadine and the bread as she went up to her room and beth fancied she heard her sigh was the old lady hungry too she wondered and her little heart sank this was beths first exercise in selfdenial but she had plenty of practice for the scene was repeated day after day the children being free had to amuse themselves as best they could and went out to play in the little garden at the back of the house mrs caldwells own freedom was merely freedom for thought most of the day she spent beside the diningroom table making and mending her only distraction being an occasional glance through the window at the boughs of the appletrees which showed above the wall opposite or at the people passing even when teaching the children she made mended and pursued her own thoughts mapping out careers for her boys making brilliant matches for mildred and bernadine and even building a castle for beth now and then she made and mended as badly as might be expected of a woman whose proud boast it was that when she was married she could not hem a pockethandkerchief and she did it all herself she had no notion of utilising the motivepower at hand in the children as her own energy had been wasted in her childhood so she wasted theirs letting it expend itself to no purpose instead of teaching them to apply it she was essentially a creature of habit all that she had been taught in her youth she taught them but any accomplishment she had acquired in later life she seemed to think that they also should wait to acquire she had always dressed for dinner so now at halfpast three every day she put away her work went into the kitchen for some hot water which she carried upstairs herself called the children and proceeded to brush her own hair carefully and change her dress she expected the children to follow her example but did not pay much attention to their proceedings and they childlike constantly and consistently shirked as much of the ceremony as possible if their mother caught them with unwashed hands and halfbrushed hair she thumped them on the back and made them wash and brush but she was generally thinking about something else and did not catch them the rite however being regularly although imperfectly performed resulted in a good habit there was another thing too for which beth had good reason to be grateful to her mother during winter when the days were short or when bad weather made it impossible to go out on summer evenings mrs caldwell always read aloud to the children after tea till bedtime most mothers would have made the children read but there was a great deal of laxity mixed with mrs caldwells harshness she found it easier to do things herself than to make the children do them for her they objected to read and liked to be read to so she read to them and as fortunately she had no money to buy childrens books she read what there were in the house beths ear was still quicker than her eye and she would not read to herself if she could help it but before she was fourteen thanks to her mother she knew much of scott jane austen dickens thackeray bulwer lytton and even some of shakespeare well besides such books as the woman in white the dead secret loyal heart or the trappers the scalp hunters and many more all of which helped greatly to develop her intelligence chapter xv during the next two years beth continued to look on at life with eyes wide open deeply interested her mind at this time acting without conscious effort was a mere photographic apparatus for the registration of impressions on the brain every incident stored and docketed itself somewhere in her consciousness for future use and it was upon this hoard that she drew eventually with such astonishing effect rousseau in emile chose a common capacity to educate because he said genius will educate itself but even genius would find its labours lightened by having been taught the use of some few tools such as are supplied by the rudiments of a conventional education beth was never taught anything thoroughly very few girls were in her day a woman was expected at that time to earn her livelihood by marrying a man and bringing up a family and so long as her face was attractive the fact that she was ignorant foolish and trivial did not in the estimation of the average man at all disqualify her for the task beths education at this most impressionable period of her life consisted in the acquisition of a few facts which were not made to interest her and neither influenced her conduct nor helped to form her character she might learn in the morning for instance that william the conqueror arrived but the information did not prevent her being as naughty as possible in the afternoon one cannot help speculating on how much she lost or gained by the haphazard of her early training but one thing is certain had the development of her genius depended upon a careful acquisition of such knowledge as is to be had at school it must have remained latent for ever as it was however being forced out into the lifeschool of the world she there matriculated on her own account and so perhaps saved her further faculty from destruction for theoretical knowledge would have dulled the keenness of her insight probably confused her point of view and brought in accepted commonplaces to spoil the originality of her conclusions it was from practical experience of life rather than from books that she learnt her work she saw for herself before she came under the influence of other peoples observations and this was doubtless the secret of her success but it involved the cruel necessity of a hard and strange apprenticeship from the time of their arrival in rainharbour she lived three lives a daythe life of lessons and coercion which was forced upon her an altogether artificial and unsatisfactory life the life she took up the moment she was free to act for herself and a life of endless dreams which mingled with the other two unwholesomely for the rich soil of her mind left uncultivated was bound to bring forth something and because there was so little seed sown in it the crop was mostly weeds when we review the march of events which come crowding into a life seeing how few it is possible to describe no one can wonder that there is talk of the difficulty of selection who for instance could have supposed that a good striped jacket jim had outgrown and mrs caldwells love of grey would have had much effect upon beths career and yet these trifles were epochmaking mrs caldwell thought grey a ladylike colour and therefore bought beth a carmelite dress of a delicate shade for the summer for the first few weeks the dress was a joy to beth but after that it began to be stained by one thing and another and every spot upon it was a source of misery not only because she was punished for messing the dress but also because she had messed it for she was beginning to be fastidious about her clothes and every time she went out she was conscious of those unsightly stains and fancied everybody was looking at them she had to wear the frock however for want of another and in the autumn when the days began to be chilly a castoff jacket of jims was added to the affliction mrs caldwell caught her trying it on one day and after shaking her for doing so she noticed that the jacket fitted her and the bright idea of making beth wear it out so that it might not be wasted occurred to her to do her justice mrs caldwell had no idea of the torture she was inflicting upon beth by forcing her to appear in her soiled frock and a boys jacket the poor lady was in great straits at the time and had nothing to spend on her daughters because her sons were growing up and beginning to clamour for pocketmoney their mother considered it right that they should have it too and so the tender delicate sensitive little girl had to go dirty and ashamed in order that her brothers might have the wherewithal to swing a cane smoke drink beer play billiards and do all else that makes boys men in their own estimation at an early age rainharbour was little more than a fishing village in those days though it became a fashionable wateringplace in a very few years when mrs caldwell first settled there a whole codfish was sold for sixpence fowls were oneandninepence a pair eggs were almost given away and the manners of the people were in keeping with the low prices the natives had no idea of concealing their feelings and were in the habit of expressing their opinions of each other and things in general at the top of their voices in the open street they were as conservative as the chinese too and thought anything new and strange ridiculous consequently when a little girl appeared amongst them in a boys jacket they let her know that they resented the innovation shes getten a lads jacket on oh oh shes getten a lads jacket on the children called aloud after her in the street while their mothers came to the cottagedoors wiping soapsuds from their arms and stood staring as at a show and even the big bland sailors lounging on the quay expanded into broad grins or solemnly winked at one another beth flushed with shame but her courageous little heart was instantly full of fight what ignorant people these are she exclaimed haughtily turning to bernadine who had dropped behind out of the obloquy what ignorant people these are they know nothing of the fashions the insinuation stung her persecutors but that only made them the more offensive and wherever she went she was jeered atopenly if there were no grownup person with her covertly if there were but always so that she understood after that first explosion she used to march along with an air of calm indifference as if she heard nothing but she had to put great constraint upon herself in order to seem superior while feeling deeply humiliated and all the time she suffered so acutely that at last she could hardly be induced to go out at all mrs caldwell who never noticed the common people enough to be aware of their criticism would not listen to anything beth had to say on the subject and considered that her objection to go out in the jacket was merely another instance of her tiresome obstinacy punishments ensued and beth had the daily choice whether she should be scolded and beaten for refusing to go out or be publicly jeered at for wearing a lads jacket sometimes she preferred the chance of public derision to the certainty of private chastisement but oftener she took the chastisement this state of things could not last much longer however hitherto her mother had ruled her by physical force but now their wills were coming into collision and it was inevitable that the more determined should carry her point go and put your things on directly you naughty obstinate child her mother screamed at her one day beth did not move do you hear me mrs caldwell exclaimed beth made no sign and suddenly mrs caldwell realised that if beth would not go out she could not make her she never thought of trying to persuade her all that occurred to her was that beth was too big to be carried or pulled or pushed that she might be hurt but could not be frightened and that there was nothing for it therefore but to let her have her own way very well then said mrs caldwell i shall go without you but youll be punished for your wickedness some day youll see and then youll be sorry mildred had gone to be educated by a rich sister of her fathers by this time aunt victoria and bernadine usually went out with mrs caldwell so it came to pass that beth began to be left pretty much to her own resources of which harriet elvidge in the kitchen was one and a considerable one harriet was a woman of wellmarked individuality and brilliant imagination she could never separate fact from fiction in any form of narrative and narrative was her speciality she was always recounting something beth used to follow her from room to room as she went about her work listening with absolute faith and the deepest interest to the stream of narrative which flowed on without interruption no matter what harriet was doing sometimes when she was dusting the drawingroom mantelpiece she would pause with a china cup in one hand and her duster in the other to emphasise a thrilling incident or make a speech impressive with suitable gesticulation and sometimes for the same purpose she would stop with her hand on the yellowstone with which she was rubbing the kitchenhearth and her head in the grate almost often too beth in her eager sympathy would say let me do that and harriet would sit in an armchair if they were in the drawingroom and resign the dusteror the dishcloth if they were in the kitchenand continue the recital while beth showed her appreciation and encouraged her to proceed by doing the greater part of her work for her mrs caldwell never could make out why beths hands were in such a state they are all cracked and begrimed she would exclaim as if the child had to do dirty work like a servant and it was a good thing for beth that she did it for otherwise she would have had no physical training at all and would have suffered as her sister mildred did for want of it mildred unlike beth held her head high and never forgot that she was a young lady by right of descent with an hereditary aptitude for keeping her inferiors in their proper place she only went into the kitchen of necessity and would never have dreamed of dusting sweeping bedmaking or laying the table to help the servant however much she might have been overtasked neither would harriet have dared to approach her with the familiar pleading i say miss elp uz im that done to which beth so readily responded mildred was studious she had profited by the good teaching she had had while her father was alive and was able to make things out for herself but she cultivated her mind at the expense of her body she was one of those delicate nervous sensitive girls whose busy brains require the rest of regular manual exercise and for want of it she lived upon books and very literally died of them eventually she was naturally so to speak an artificial product of conventional ideas beth on the contrary was altogether a little human being but one of those who answer to expectation with fatal versatility she liked blacking grates and did them well because harriet told her she could she hated writing copies and did them disgracefully because her mother beat her for a blot and said she would never improve for the same reason long before she could read aloud to her mother intelligibly she had learnt all that harriet could teach her not only of the housework but of the cooking from cleaning a fish and trussing a fowl to making barleybroth and puffpastry harriet was a good cook if she had the things as she said herself having picked up a great deal when she was kitchenmaid in uncle jamess household harriet was the daughter of a labourer her people lived at a village some miles away and every saturday morning a carrier with a covered cart brought her a letter from home and a little parcel containing a cheesecake or some other dainty beth took a lively interest both in the cheesecake and the letter whats the news from home today she would ask hows annie and what has mother sent whereupon harriet would share the cheesecake with her and read the letter aloud work being suspended as long as possible for the purpose harriet was about twentyfive at this time she had very black silky hair straight and heavy parted in the middle drawn down over her ears and gathered up in a knot behind her face was oval forehead high eyebrows arched and delicate nose straight and she had large expressive dark grey eyes rather deeply set with long black lashes and a mouth that would have been handsome of the sensual fulllipped kind had it not been distorted by a burn which had disfigured her throat and chin as well she had set her pinafore on fire when she was a child and it had blazed up under her chin causing irreparable injury before the flames could be extinguished but for that accident she would have been a singularly goodlooking woman of a type which was common in books of beauty at the beginning of this reign she could read and write after a fashion and was intelligent but ignorant deceitful superstitious and hysterical mrs caldwell continually lectured beth about going into the kitchen so much but she only lectured on principle really young ladies could not be allowed to associate with servants as a rule but an exception might be made in the case of a good steady sober sort of person such as mrs caldwell believed harriet to be who would keep the troublesome child out of mischief and do her no harm harriet as it happened delighted in mischief and was often the instigator but mrs caldwell might be excused for not suspecting this as she only saw her on her best behaviour when the children were safe in bed and miss victoria bench who was an early person had also retired harriet would put on a clean apron and appear before mrs caldwell in the character of a respectable vigilant domestic more anxious about her mistresss interests than her own and she would then make a report in which beth figured as a fiend of a child who could not be trusted alone for a moment and harriet herself as a conscientious custodian but for whom nobody knows what might have happened when harriet had no particular incident to report at these secret conferences she would tell mrs caldwell her dreams and describe signs and portents of coming events which she had observed during the day and mrs caldwell would listen with interest superstition is a subject on which the most classproud will consult with the lowest and the wickedest it is a mighty leveller downwards but the poor lady had a lonely life it was not mrs caldwells fault but the fault of her day that she was not a noble woman she belonged to early victorian times when every effort was made to mould the characters of women as the homes of the period were built on lines of ghastly uniformity the education of a girl in those days was eminently calculated to cloud her intelligence and strengthen every failing developed in her sex by ages of suppression mrs caldwell was a plastic person and her mind had been successfully compressed into the accustomed groove until her husband came and helped it to escape a little in one or two directionswith the effect however of spoiling its conventional symmetry without restoring its natural beauty if the mind be tightlaced long enough it is ruined as a model just as the body is and throwing off the stays which restrained it merely exposes its deformities without remedying them so that there is nothing for the old generation but to remain in stays mrs caldwell with all her deformities was just as heroic as she knew how to be she lived for her children to the extent of denying herself the bare necessaries of life for them and bore poverty and obscurity of a galling kind without a murmur she scarcely ever saw a soul to speak to uncle james patten and the benyon family did not associate much with the townspeople and were not popular in the county so that mrs caldwell had very few visitors of course it was an advantage to be known as a relation of the great people of the place although the great people had a bad name but then she was evidently a poor relation which made it almost a virtue to neglect her in a community of christians who only professed to love the lord himself for what they could get you must worship god because he can give you everything was what they taught their children even the vicar of the parish would not call on anybody with less than five hundred a year he kept a school for boys which paid him more than cent per cent but did nothing for his parishioners except preach sermons an hour long on sundays selfdenial and morality were his favourite subjects he had had three wives himself and was getting through a fourth as fast as one baby a year would do it mrs caldwell left to herself found her evenings especially long and dreary it was her habit to write her letters then and read particularly in french and italian which she had some vague notion helped to improve her mind but she often wearied for a word and began to hear voices herself in the howling winter winds and to brood upon the possible meaning of her own dreams and to wonder why a solitary rook flew over her house in particular and cawed twice as it passed little things naturally become of great importance in such a life and harriet kept up the supply she being the connecting link between mrs caldwell and the outer world she knew all that was happening in the place and she claimed to know all that was going to happen and by degrees the mistress as well as the maid fell into the way of comparing events with the forebodings which had preceded them and often established a satisfactory connection between the two mrs caldwell always made coffee in the kitchen for breakfast in the morning and while she was so engaged harriet busy making toast would begindid you ear a noise last night mem no harrietat leastwas it about ten oclock yes mem just abouta sort of scraping rattling noise like a lot of people walking over gravel i did hear something of the kind i wonder what it was mrs caldwell would rejoin well mem i think it means there are people coming to the ouse for i remember it appened the night before your brother come mem unexpected and the lawyer if nobody came during the day the token would be supposed to refer to some future period and so by degrees signs and portents took the place of more substantial interests in mrs caldwells dreary life such things were in the air for the little seaside place was quite out of the world at the time and the people still had more faith in an incantation than a doctors dose if an accident happened or a storm decimated the fishingfleet signs innumerable were always remembered which had preceded the event if you asked why nobody had profited by the warning people would shake their heads and tell you it was to be and if you asked what was the use of the warning then they would say to break the blowin which idea there seemed to be some sense when they told toms wife e was drownded shed a dropped down dead erself and left the children if she adnt a knowed it all along harriet explained to beth eh lass you mark my words warnins comes for one thing and warnins comes for another but they always comes for good an youre forced to take notice an act on em or youre forced to leave em alone just as is right an ye cant elp it yerself choose ow theres mrs pettinger she dreamed one night er husbands boat was lost an next mornin e was to go out fishin but she wouldnt let im no enery john she ses youll not go not if ah as to old you ses she an e was that mad e struck er an knocked er down an broke er arm an then needs must e ad to fetch the doctor to set it an by the time that was done the boat ad gone wiout im the other men thought e was drunke often wasan they wouldnt wait well that boat never came back and did he beat his wife again beth asked oh as to that ow could it make any difference harriet answered beth was fascinated by the folklore of the place and soon surpassed harriet herself in the interpretation of dreams and the reading of signs and tokens she began to invent methods of divination for herself too such as if the boards dont creak when i walk across the room i shall get through my lessons without trouble this morning a trick which soon became a confirmed habit into which she was apt to lapse at any time and so persistent are these early impressions that to the end of her days she would always rather have seen two rooks together than one alone rooks being the birds of omen in a land where magpies were scarce mrs caldwell knew nothing of beths proficiency in the black arts she would never have discussed such a subject before the children and took it for granted that harriet was equally discreet while beth on her part with her curious quick sense of what was right and proper believed her mother to be above such things harriet was a person of varied interests all of which she discussed with beth impartially she had many lovers according to her own account and was stern and unyielding with them all and so particular that she would dismiss them at any moment for nothing almost if she went out at night she had always much to tell the next morning and beth would hurry over her lessons watch her mother out of the way and slip into the kitchen or upstairs after harriet and question her about what she had said and he had said and if she had let him kiss her even once well last night harriet said on one occasion in a tone of apology for her own weakness and goodnature last night i couldnt elp it e just put is arm round me and well there i was sorry for im why dont you say he and him and his harriet i do no you dont you say e and im and is well thats what you say beth shouted the aspirates at her for answer but in vain with all the will in the world to talk fine as she called it harriet could never acquire the art for want of an ear to hear she could not perceive the slightest difference between him and im even at this age beth had her own point of view in social matters and frequently disconcerted harriet by a word or look or inflection of the voice which expressed disapproval of her conduct harriet had been at home on one occasion for a weeks holiday a charwoman having done her work in her absence and on her return she had much to relate of charles russell the groom at fairholm who continued to be an ardent admirer of hers but not an honourable one because he did not realise what a very superior person harriet was he thought she was no better than other girls and when they were sitting up one night together in her mothers cottage the rest of the family having gone to bed he made her a proposal which harriet indignantly rejected and ah ses to im charles russell ah ses to im not was it ever so ah ses to imshe was proceeding emphatically when beth interrupted her did you say you sat up with him alone all night she asked yes theres no arm you know harriet answered on the defensive without precisely knowing why well what did he say beth rejoined without comment but harriet put out of countenance omitted the details and brought the story to an abrupt conclusion another of harriets interests in life was the family herald which she took regularly and as regularly read aloud to beth to the best of her abilityfrom the verses to violet or my own love on the first page to the random readings on the last they laughed at the jokes tried to guess the riddles were impressed with the historical anecdotes and words of wisdom and became so hungry over the recipes for good dishes that they frequently fried eggs and potatoes or a slice stolen from the joint roasting at the fire and feasted surreptitiously beth tried in after years to remember what the stories in the family herald had been about but all she could recall was a vague incident of a falling scaffold of a heroine called margaret taking refuge in the dark behind a hoarding and of a fascinating hero whom harriet called ug miller long afterwards it dawned upon beth that his name was hugh when mildred went to her aunt beth and bernadine became of necessity constant companions and it was a curious kind of companionship for their natures were antagonistic like rival chieftains whose territories adjoin they professed no love for each other and were often at war but were intimate nevertheless and would have missed each other because there was no one else with whom they could so conveniently quarrel harriet took the liveliest interest in their squabbles which under her able direction rapidly developed from the usual little girls scrimmages into regular standup fights one day beth pulled bernadines hair passionately and bernadine retaliated by clawing beths face and then howled as a further relief to her feelings mrs caldwell rushed to see what accident had happened to the dear child and harriet came to see the sport mamma beth pulled my hair bernadine whined mrs caldwell immediately thumped beth who seldom said a word in her own defence harriet was neutral till her mistress had disappeared and then she supported beth just you wait till after dinner she said come into the kitchen when your mas asleep and fight it out dont you be put upon by tellpietits whats the use of my going into the kitchen beth rejoined bernadine doesnt fight fair shes a horrid low little coward am i bernadine howled just you wait till after dinner im as brave as you are and as strong though you are the biggest which was true bernadine was sallow thin wiry and muscular beth was soft and round and white she had height age and weight on her side bernadine had strength agility and cunning phewww beth jeered mimicking her whine youd tell mamma if you got a scratch i wont beth if youll fight bernadine protested well see after dinner harriet put in significantly and then returned to her work after the four oclock dinner during the dark winter months mrs caldwell dozed for halfanhour in her chair by the fire this was the childrens opportunity they were supposed to sit still and amuse themselves quietly while their mother slept and until she slept they would sit motionless watching her the greater their anxiety to get away the more absolute their silence mrs caldwell looked as if she were being mesmerised to sleep by the two pairs of bright eyes so resolutely and patiently fixed upon her the moment her breathing showed she was sound asleep the children stole to the kitchen shutting the doors after them softly and instantly set to work it was a gruesome sight those two children with teeth set and clenched fists battering each other in deadly earnest but with no noise save the fizzle of feet on the brick floor an occasional thump up against a piece of furniture or the thud when they fell they were afraid to utter a sound lest aunt victoria up in her room should hear them and come down interfering or their mother should wake and come out and catch them they bruised and blackened and scratched each other and were seldom without what they considered the honourable scars of these battles sometimes when bernadine was badly mauled she lost her temper and threatened to tell mamma but beth could always punish her and did so by refusing to fight next time although without that recreation life were a blank harriet always cleared away obstacles to give them room and then sat down to eat her dinner and watch the fight she had the tastes and some of the habits of a roman empress and encouraged them with the keenest interest for a long time but when she had finished her dinner she usually wearied of the entertainment and would then stop it i say yer mas comin i can ear er she would exclaim elp us to wash up or i shant be done for the reading when harriet wanted help bernadine usually slipped away helping anybody not being much in her line but beth set to work with a will beth always sociable had persuaded her mother to let harriet come to the reading and harriet accordingly in a clean cap and apron with a piece of sewing was added to the party so long as she sat on a high chair at a respectful distance and remembered that she was a servant her being there rather gratified mrs caldwell than otherwise once she had yielded to beths persuasion and saw the practical working of the experiment it made her feel as if she were doing something to improve the lower classes it was a pity she did not try to improve beth and bernadine by finding some sewing for their idle hands to do during the reading dear little bernadine so good and affectionate always would sit on the floor beside her mother whose pocket she often picked of a penny or sixpence to vary the monotony when she did not understand the book beth also sat idle listening intently and watching her sister if the reading had been harrowing or exciting she would fight bernadine for the sixpence when they went to bed there were lively scenes during the readings they all wept at the pathetic parts laughed loudly when amused and disputed about passages and incidents at the top of their voices mrs caldwell forgot that harriet was a servant harriet forgot herself and the children unaccustomed to wordy warfare forgot their fear of their mother and flew at each others throats when the story was very interesting mrs caldwell read until she was hoarse and then went on to herselfdipping the children called it it was a point of honour with them not to dip and they would remonstrate with their mother loudly when they caught her at it their feeling on the subject was so strong that she was ashamed to be seen dipping at last she used to put the book away until they were safe in bed and then gratify her curiosity but they suspected her because once or twice they noticed that she was unaffected by an exciting part so one night they came down in their nightdresses and caught her and after that the poor lady had to be careful she might thump the children for coming downstairs but she could not alter the low opinion they had of a person who dipped chapter xvi beths brain began to be extraordinarily busy she recorded nothing but her daily doings were so many works of her imagination she was generally somebody else in these days seldom herself and people who did not understand this might have supposed that she was an exceedingly mendacious little girl when she was merely speaking consistently in the character which she happened to be impersonating she would spend hours of the afternoon alone in the drawingroom standing in the window looking out while she wove her fancies and she soon began to go out also by the backdoor when the mood was upon her without asking anybodys leave she had wandered off in this way on one occasion to the south side whither her people rarely went at the top of the cliff where the winding road began which led down to the harbour a paralysed sailor was sitting in a wickerwork wheeled chair looking over the sea beth knew the man by sight he had been a yachtsman in the service of one of her greatuncles and she had heard hints of extraordinary adventures they had had together it filled her with compassion to see him sitting there so lonely and helpless and as she approached she resolved herself into a beneficent being able and willing to help she had a book under her arm a costly volume which mrs caldwell had borrowed to read to the children beth had been looking at the pictures when the desire to go out suddenly seized upon her and had carried the book off inadvertently how are you today tom she said going up to the invalid confidently im glad to see you out we shall soon have you about again as well as ever i knew a man in ireland much worse than you are he couldnt move his hands and arms legs are bad enough but when its hands and arms as well you know its worse well now you couldnt tell thered ever been anything the matter with him and what cured im tom asked with interest oh he just thought hed get well you know youve got to set yourself that way dont you see if mountains can be moved by faith you can surely move your own legs that sounds reasonable any way tom ejaculated do you like reading said beth yes i read a bit at times well ive brought you a book beth proceeded handing him the borrowed volume youll find it interesting im sure its a great favourite of mine youre mighty good the sailor said oh not at all beth answered largely then she wished him goodbye but she often visited him again in the same character and the stories she told that unhappy invalid for his comfort and encouragement were amazing when the book was missed and her mother bothered about it she listened serenely and even helped to look for it beth strolled homewards when she left her protege and on the way she became norna of the fitful head she tried minna and brenda first but these characters were too insipid for her taste norna was different she did things you know and made charms and talked poetry and people were afraid of her beth believed in her thoroughly shed be norna and make charms but she had no lead norna looked about her she knew by magic that cleveland was coming to consult her and she had no lead there was a border of lead however over the attic window outside all she had to do was to steal upstairs climb out of the window on to the roof and cut a piece of the lead off it was now the mystic moment to obtain lead but she must be wary she strolled through the kitchen in a casual way harriet was busy about the grate and paid no attention to her so she secured the carvingknife without difficulty went up to the attic and opened the window she was now on the dangerous pinnacle of a temple risking her life in order to obtain the materials for a charm which would give her priceless power on the other side of the street there lived in the orchard house another widowwoman with three daughters she let lodgings and was bringing up her children to honest industry in that state of life she and mrs caldwell took a kindly interest in each others affairs mrs davy happened to be changing the curtains in front that afternoon when beth crept out of the attic window on to the roof and she was paralysed with horror for a moment expecting to see the child roll off into the street she was a sensible woman however and quickly recovering herself she ran across the road with her spectacles on and rapped at mrs caldwells door beth hacking away at the lead with the carvingknife did not heed the rap presently however she heard hurried footsteps on the stairs and climbed back into the attic incontinently putting her spoils in her pocket when mrs davy her mother and harriet all agitated burst open the door she was standing at the window looking out tranquilly what were you doing on the roof beth her mother demanded nothing beth answered mrs davy says she saw you get out of the window beth was silent youre a bad girl giving your mother so much trouble mrs davy exclaimed looking at her under her spectacles sternly if you was my child id whack you i would beth was instantly a lady sneering at this common woman who was taking a liberty which she knew her mother would resent as much as she did and what were you doing with the carvingknife miss beth cried harriet spying it on the floor and picking it up criminals are only clever up to a certain point beth had forgotten to conceal the carvingknife oh dear oh dear if you avent acked it all the way along oh dear oh dear mrs caldwell echoed it was her best carvingknife and beth would certainly have been beaten if mrs davy had not suggested it as it was however mrs caldwell controlled her temper and merely ordered her to go downstairs immediately in the management of her children she would not be dictated to by anybody this was beths first public appearance as a disturber of the peace and the beginning of the bad name she earned for herself in certain circles eventually but she was let off lightly for it mrs caldwells punishments were never retrospective she was thunder and lightning in her wrath a flash and then a bang and it was all over if she missed the first movement the culprit escaped she could no more have punished one of her children in cold blood than she could have cut its throat beth ran down to the actingroom so called because the boys had brought home the idea of acting in the holidays and they had got up charades there on a stage made of boxes with an old counterpane for a curtain and farthing candles for footlights it was a long narrow room over the kitchen with a sloping roof three steps led down into it there was a window at one end a small lattice with an iron bar nailed to the outside vertically beth swung herself out round the bar dropped on to the backkitchen roof crept across the tiles to the chimney at the far corner stepped thence on to the top of the old wooden pump and from the top to the spout from the spout to the stone trough and so into the garden then she ran round to the kitchen and got a candle a canister and some water in a pail all of which she took up to the actingroom by way of the backkitchen roof the canister happened to contain allspice but this was not to be considered when she wanted the canister so she emptied it from the roof on to harriets head as she happened to be passing and so got some good out of it for harriet displayed strong feeling on the subject both at the moment and afterwards when she was trying to get the stuff out of her hair which interested beth who in some such way often surprised people into the natural expression of emotions which she might never otherwise have discovered bernadine had been playing alone peaceably in the garden but beth persuaded her to come upstairs she found beth robed in the old counterpane with her hair dishevelled and the room darkened beth was norna now in her cell on the fitful head and bernadine was the shrinking but resolute minna come to consult her beth made her sit down drew a magic circle round her with a piece of chalk and in a deep tragic voice warned her not to move if she valued her life for there were evil spirits in the room the pail stood on a box draped with an old black shawl and round this she also drew a circle then she put some lead in the canister melted it over the candle dropped it into the water and muttered like snakes the molten metal hisses curses come instead of kisses she plunged her hand into the water i search a harp for harmony but daggers only do i see i search a heart for love and hope but find a ghastly hangmans rope woe woe three times round the pail she went moaning groaning writhing her body and wringing her hands woe woe thy courage will be sorely tried thou shalt not be the pirates bride at this bernadine whose nerves were completely shaken set up such a howl that harriet came running to see what was the matter she soon let light into the actingroom mrs caldwell and aunt victoria had gone to see aunt grace mary so harriet was in charge of the children and to save herself further trouble she took them up to a blackhole there was without a window at the top of the house and locked them in the place was quite empty so that they could do no harm and they did not seem to mind being locked up harriet intended to give them a little fright and then let them out but being busy she forgot them and when at last she remembered it was so dark she had to take a candle and great was her horror on opening the door to see both children stretched out on the bare boards side by side apparently quite dead one glance at their ghastly faces was enough for harriet she just looked and then fled shrieking with the candle alight in her hand right out into the street several people who happened to be passing at the time stopped to see what was the matter harriets talent for fiction furnished her with a selfsaving story on the instant she said the children had shut themselves up and got smothered wed better go and see if theres nothing can be done a respectable workman suggested harriet led the way about a dozen people following all awestricken and silent when they came to the door they peeped in over each others shoulders at the two poor children stretched out stiff and stark the colour of death their jaws dropped their glazed eyes shining between the halfclosed lids a piteous spectacle just lets see the candle a moment the workman said he took it from harriet and entered stoopingthe place was a mere closet just under the roof and he could not stand upright in it he peered into the childrens faces then knelt down beside them and felt their arms and chests suddenly he burst out laughing you little devils he said what a ye done this for beth sat up harriet locked us in to give us a fright so we thought wed frighten harriet she said the walls were whitewashed and the children had made themselves ghastly by rubbing their faces all over with the whitening youve getten yer ands full wi them two im thinkin missis the workman remarked to harriet as he went off chuckling did you hear beth bernadine complained he called us little devils all right beth answered casually but bernadine was disgusted she was one of those pious children who like to stand high in the estimation of the grownup people and she disapproved of beths conduct when it got her into trouble she was like the kind of man who enjoys being vicious so long as he is not found out by any one who will think the less of him for it when he is found out he excuses himself and blames his associates bernadine never resisted beths eloquent persuasions nor the luring fascination of her schemes but when she had had her full share of the pleasures of naughtiness and was tired and cross her conscience smote her and then she told mamma this did her good and got beth punished which made bernadine feel that she had expiated her own naughtiness and been forgiven and also made her feel sorry for betha nice kind feeling which she always enjoyed beth despised her for her conscientious treachery and retaliated by tempting her afresh one day she lured her out on to the tiles through an attic window in the roof at the back of the house it would be such fun to sit astride on the roofridge and look right down into the street she said and across mrs davys orchard to the fields on that side and out to sea on the other and things will come into our minds up theresuch lovely things she proceeded beguiling bernadine to distract her attention as she helped her up when they were securely seated bernadine began to grumble things dont come into my mind she whined dont they why i was just thinking if we were to fall we should certainly be killed beth answered cheerfully we should come down thump and that would crack our skulls and our brains would roll out on the pavement ough wouldnt they look nasty just like a sheeps and mamma and aunt victoria would rush out and harriet and mrs davy and theyd have to hold mamma up by the arms then theyd pick us up and carry us in and lay us out on a bed and say they were beautiful in their lives and in death they were not divided and when they shut the house up at night and it was all still mamma would cry shed be always crying especially for you bernadine because youre not such a trouble as i am and when you were buried and the worms were eating you she would give all the world to have you here again this sad prospect was too much for the sensitive bernadine dont beth she whimpered you frighten me oh you mustnt be frightened said beth encouragingly when people up on a height like this get frightened they always roll off do you feel as if the roof were moving she exclaimed suddenly clutching hold bernadine fell down flat on her face with a dismal howl lets be cats now said beth ill say miewowow and you ooooowlhissssss dont beth i want to go back come along then said beth i cant i darent move oh nonsense said beth just follow me i shall go and leave you if you dont you shouldnt have come up if you were afraid you made me bernadine whimpered with her eyes shut of course it was me said beth on her way back to the skylight you havent a will of your own i suppose you arent leaving me beth bernadine cried in an agony dont go im frightened help me down ill tell mamma then there youll sit tellpietit beth chanted as she let herself down through the skylight presently she appeared on the other side of the street and performed a wardance of delight as she looked up at her sister prone upon the roofridge you do look so funny bernadine she cried your petticoats are nohow and you seem to have only one leg and it is so long and thin bernadine howled aloud mrs caldwell was not at home but the cry brought mrs davy out in her spectacles when she saw the childs dangerous predicament she seized beth and shook her emphatically oh thank you said beth what a you bin doin now you bad girl said mrs davy hold on missy she called up to bernadine well soon ave ye down youre all right youll not take no arm harriet now came running out wringing her hands and uttering hysterical exclamations shut up you fool said mrs davy doors opened all the way down the street and a considerable crowd had soon collected beth quite detached from herself leant against the orchardwall and watched the people with interest how to get the child down was the difficulty as there was no ladder at hand long enough to reach up to the roof ill go and fetch her down if you like said beth i should think so and then thered be two of you said mrs davy i dont see how youll manage it then said beth there isnt foothold for a man to get out of the atticwindow having spoken she strolled off with an air of indifference and disappeared she was a heroine of romance now going to do a great deed and before she was missed the horrified spectators saw her climbing out of the front atticwindow smiling serenely the people held their breath as they watched her go up the roof on the slippery tiles at a reckless rate to her sister come along bernadine she whispered such fun theres a whole crowd down there watching us just let them see youre not afraid bernadine peeped it was gratifying to be an object of such interest come along dont be an idiot said beth just follow me and dont look at anything but the tiles thats the way i learnt to do it bernadines courage revived slowly she slid from the roofridge beth helping her carefully it looked fearfully dangerous and the people below dared not utter a sound when they got to the atticwindow beth herself on the edge of the roof guided her sister past her and helped her in she was following herself when some tiles gave way beneath her and fell with a crash into the street fortunately she had hold of the sill but for a moment her legs hung over then she pulled herself through and falling head first on to the floor disappeared from sight the people below relieved their feelings with a faint cheer eh but shes a bad un said mrs davy who was trembling all over well shes a rare plucky un at any rate said a man in the crowd admiringly crowds constantly collected at the little house in orchard street in those days when mrs caldwell had to go out alone she was always anxious not knowing what might be happening in her absence coming home from lady benyons one summer evening she found the whole street blocked with people and the roadway in front of her own house packed so tight she could not get past beth had dressed herself up in a mask and a russian sheepskin cloak which had belonged to her father and sat motionless in the drawingroom window on a throne made of an armchair set on a box while bernadine played scotch airs on the piano a couple of children passing had stopped to see what on earth the thing was then a man and woman had come along and stopped too then several girls some sailors the bellman and many more until the street was full harriet was enjoying the commotion in the background but when mrs caldwell appeared she gave the signal the piano stopped and the strange beast roared loudly and fled but beth had her human moments they generally came on in wet weather which depressed her she would then stand in the drawingroom window by the hour together looking out at the miserable street thinking of the poor people all cold and wet and hungry she longed to do something for them and one day she stopped a little girl who was going with a jug for some beer to the shining star a quiet little publichouse on the same side of the street i suppose you are a very ignorant little girl said beth severely aw whats your name emily bean do you learn lessons naw dear me how dreadful said beth you ought to be taught you know would you like to be taught ah should well you come here every afternoon at two oclock and ill teach you ah mon jest ass mother first said emily yesid forgotten that beth rejoined well you come if she lets you emily nodded and was going on her errand but stopped did you ass yer own mother if you might she wanted to know no i didnt think of that either beth rejoined but i will will she let you i dont knowrather doubtfully i expect she will if you wait until shes in a good humour the child of the people sagely suggested all right you come at any rate beth answered boldly mrs caldwell consented she came of a long line of lady patronesses and thought it natural and becoming that her child should wish to improve the common people punctually to the moment emily arrived next day and beth sat down with her in the kitchen and taught her a b ab and b a d bad then she repeated a piece of poetry to her and read her a little story harriet was busy in the back kitchen and bernadine was out with her mother and aunt victoria so beth and her pupil had the kitchen to themselves the next day however harriet wanted to clean the kitchen so they had to retire to the actingroom this was beths first attempt to apply such knowledge as she possessed and in her anxiety to improve the child of the people she improved herself in several respects she began to read better became less afraid of writing and spelling mastered the multiplication table and found she could make out how to do easy sums from the book this gave her the first real interest she had ever had in schoolwork and inspired her with some slight confidence in herself she felt the dignity of the position of teacher too and the responsibility she never betrayed her own ignorance nor did anything to shake emilys touching belief in her superiority and she never shook emily she knew she could have done better herself if there had been less thumping and shaking and she had the wisdom to profit by her mothers errors of judgment alreadynot that emily ever provoked her the child was apt and docile and the lessons were a sort of improving game how to impart religious instruction was the thing that troubled beth most she used to lie awake at night thinking out the problem she found that emily had learnt many texts and hymns in the sundayschool to which she went regularly and beth made her repeat them and soon knew them all by heart herself but she did not think that she taught emily enough one day in church however she thought of a way to extend her teaching bernadine had joined her class for fun and was playing at learning too and now beth proposed that they should fit up a chapel in the actingroom and resolve themselves occasionally into a clergyman and congregation a chair with the bottom knocked out was the pulpit and a long narrow box stood on end was the readingdesk beth was the parson of course in a white sheet filched from the soiledclothes bag and changed for a black shawl for the sermon she read portions of scripture standing she read prayers on her knees she led a hymn and then she got into the black shawl and preached what these discourses were about she could not remember in after years but they must have been fascinating for the congregation listened unwearied so long as she chose to go on emily was a disappointment in one way she had no imagination beth pretended to take her photograph one day after the manner of the photographers on the sands now this is the picture she said showing her a piece of glass but there isnt no picture on it said emily staring hard at the glass how stupid you are said beth disgusted look again there isnt emily protested just you show it to bernadine you should say miss bernadine that young lady admonished her a few minutes afterwards emily corrected bernadine for not saying miss to beth and herself beth tried to explain but emily could not see why she should say miss to them if they did not say miss to her and to each other poor mrs caldwell was in great straits for want of money at this time she had scarcely enough to pay for their meagre fare and her own clothes and the childrens were almost beyond patching and darning beth surprised her several times sitting beside the diningtable with the everlasting mending on her lap fretting silently and the childs heart was wrung there was some legal difficulty and letters which added to her mothers trouble came to the house continually the same faculty made beth either the naughtiest or the best of children the difference depended on her heart if that were touched she was all sympathy but if no appeal was made to her feelings her daily doings were the outcome of so many erratic impulses acted on without consideration merely to vary the disastrous monotony of those long idle afternoons the day after she had surprised her mother fretting over her letters another packet arrived beth happened to be early up that morning and opened the door to the postman she would like to have given the packet back to him but that being impossible she carried it up to the actingroom and hid it in the roof when her mother came down however she found to her consternation that the fact of there being no letter at all that morning was a greater trouble if anything than the arrival of the one the day before so she boldly brought it down and delivered it quite expecting to be whipped but for once mrs caldwell asked for an explanation and the childs motive was so evident that even her mother was more affected by her sympathy than enraged by the inconvenient expression of it the next day she was playing on the pier with bernadine her mother and aunt victoria were walking up and down not paying much attention to the children first they swung on a chain that was stretched from post to post down the middle of the pier to keep people from being washed off in stormy weather but bernadine tumbled over backwards and hurt her head and was jeered at besides by some rude little street children who could not understand why the little caldwells who were as shabby as themselves should look down on them and refuse to associate with them it was not beths nature to be exclusive she had no notion of differences of degree any pleasant person was her equal she was as much gratified by friendly notice from the milkman the fishwoman and the sweep as from lady benyon or count bartahlinsky and very early thought it contemptible to jeer at people for want of means and defects of education she never talked of the common people after she found that harriet was hurt by the phrase and she would have been on good terms with all the street children had it not been for what mrs caldwell called bernadines superior selfrespect bernadine told if beth spoke to one of them and as beth had no friends amongst them as yet she did not feel that their acquaintance was worth fighting for but the street children resented the attitude of the two shabby little ladies and were always watching for opportunities to annoy them accordingly when bernadine tumbled off the chain headoverheels backwards there was a howl of derision oh my aint she getten thin legs ah say julia did you see that big ole i her stockin naw but ah seed the patch on er petticoat ehan shes ony getten one on an it isnt flannel an thems ladies bernadines pride came to her rescue on these occasions at home she howled when she was hurt but now she affected to laugh and both sisters strolled off with their little heads up and an exasperating air of indifference to the enemy the tide was out and they went down into the harbour and found a large oyster among the piles of the wooden jetty when they got home the difficulty was how to open it but they managed to make it open itself by holding it over the kitchen fire on the shovel when it began to lift its lid beth sent bernadine for a fork and while she was getting it beth ate the oyster but bernadine could not see the joke and her rage was not to be appeased even by the oystershell which beth said she might have the whole of the battle came off after dinner that evening but it was a day of disaster harriet was out of temper and mrs caldwell appeared mysteriously just as beth knocked bernadine down and sat on her stomach they were reading a story of french life at that time and something came into it about snailbroth as a cure for consumption and snailoil as a remedy for rheumatism the next day there was a most extraordinary smell all over the house mrs caldwell aunt victoria harriet and bernadine went sniffing about but could find nothing to account for it beth sat at the diningtable with a book before her taking no notice at last harriet had occasion to open the oven door and just as she did so there was a loud explosion and the kitchen wall opposite was bespattered with boiling animal matter beth had got up early and collected snails enough in the garden to fill a blackingbottle corked them up tight and put them into the darkest corner of the oven her idea being to render them into oil as harriet rendered suet into fat and go and rub rheumatic people with it as usual however her motive was ignored while a great deal was made of the mess on the kitchen wallwhich disheartened her especially as several other philanthropic enterprises happened to fail about the same time emily appeared with a bad toothache one day and finding a remedy for it gave beth a momentary interest in life she told emily she had a cure for toothache and emily never doubting let her put some soft substance into the tooth with the end of a match it wont taste very nice said beth but you mustnt mind that you just go home and youll find it wont ache any more when emily returned next day she gratefully proclaimed herself cured and her mother wanted to know whatever the stuff was soap said beth oh you mucky thing emily exclaimed she resented the application of such a substance to the inside of her person her plebeian mind was too narrow to conceive a second legitimate use for soap and from that day beths influence declined emilys attendance became irregular then gradually ceased altogether not however before beths own interest in the lessons was over and her mind much occupied with other things chapter xvii the dowerhouse of the benyon family stood in a street which was merely an extension of orchard street and could be seen from mrs caldwells windows lady benyon having produced a huge family and buried her husband had done her days work in the world as it were and now had full leisure to live as she liked so she lived well and in the intervals of living otherwise eating she sat in the big bowwindow of her sittingroom digesting and watching her neighbours from her large oldfashioned house she commanded a fine view down the wide irregular front street to the sea with a diagonal glimpse down two other streets which ran parallel with the front street while on the left she could see up orchard street as far as the church so that everybody came under her observation sooner or later and to beth it always seemed that she dominated the whole place most of the day her head could be seen above the wireblind but as she seldom went out her acute old face and the four dark sausageshaped curls laid horizontally on either side of it were almost all of her that was known to the inhabitants mrs caldwell went regularly to see lady benyon and sometimes took the children with her on one occasion when she had done so lady benyon made her take a seat in the window where she was sitting herself so that they could both look out beth and bernadine sat in the background with a picturebook in which they seemed so absorbed that the conversation flowed on before them with very little constraint beths ears were open however as usual after twentytwo children lady benyon remarked one cannot expect to be as active as one was no indeed mrs caldwell answered cheerfully i have only had as good as fourteen and im quite a wreck i dont know what it is to pass a day free from pain but however it is so ordered and i dont complain if only they turn out well when they do come thats everything ah youre right there lady benyon answered you know my trial mrs caldwell pursuedbeths face instantly became a blank i am afraid she cares for no one but herself it shows what spoiling a child does her father could never make enough of her well i suppose shes naughty lady benyon rejoined with a laugh but shes promising all the sameand not only in appearance the things she says you know oh well yes mrs caldwell allowed she certainly says things sometimes but thats not much comfort when you never know what shell be doing now mildred has never given me a moments anxiety in her life except on account of her delicate health poor little body and bernadine is a dear sweet little thing she is the only one who is thoroughly unruly and selfish beths blood boiled at the accusation how does the old aunt get on lady benyon asked presently oh she seems to be very well dont you find it rather a trial to have her about always mrs caldwell shrugged her shoulders with an air of resignation oh you know she means well she replied and there really was nothing else for it but i must say i have no patience with cant beth in opposition still smarting from her mothers accusation of selfishness determined at once to inquire into aunt victorias religious tenets with a view to approving of them well james patten played a mean part in that business lady benyon observed but i always say beware of a man who does his own housekeeping when they keep the money in their own hands and pay the bills themselves dont trust them that sort of man is a cur at heart you may be sure and as for a man who takes possession of his wifes money and doles it out to her a little at a time i know one suchwithout a penny of his own mind you he gives his wife a cheque for five pounds a month the rest goes on other women and she never suspects it hes one of those plausible gentlemen whos always looking for a post that will pay him and never gets ityou know the kind of thing here the old lady caught beths eye you take my advice she said dont ever marry a man who does his own housekeeping hes a crowing hen that sort of man you may be sure i warn you against the man who does a womans work and if a woman does a mans work said the intelligent beth it is often a very great help mrs caldwell put in with a quick mental survey of the reams of official letters she had written for her husband lady benyon pursed up her mouth aunt victoria was one of those forlorn old ladies who have nobody actually their own to care for them although they may have numbers of relations and acquire odd habits from living much alone she was a great source of interest to beth who would sit silently watching her by the hour together her bright eyes steady and her countenance a blank the intentness of her gaze fidgeted the old lady who would look up suddenly every now and then and ask her what she was staring at nothing aunt victoria i was only thinking beth always answered and then she affected to occupy herself until the old lady returned to her work or her book when beth would resume her interrupted study but she liked aunt victoria the old lady was sharp with her sometimes but she meant to be kind and was always just and beth respected her she had more faith in her too than she had in her mother and secretly became her partisan on all occasions she had instantly detected the tone of detraction in the allusions lady benyon and her mother had made to aunt victoria that afternoon and stolidly resented it when they went home she ran upstairs and knocked at aunt victorias door it was immediately opened and beth seeing what she took for an old gentleman in a short black petticoat and loose red jacket with short thick stubbly white hair standing up all over his head started back but it was only aunt victoria without her cap and front when she saw beths consternation the old lady put her hand up to her head i had forgotten she muttered then she added severely but you should never show surprise beth at anything in anybodys appearance it is very illbred i dont think i shall ever be surprised again beth answered quaintly but i want you to tell me aunt victoria what do you believe in what do you mean child oh you know about god and the bible and cant and that sort of thing beth answered evenly come in and sit down said aunt victoria beth sat on a classical piece of furniture that stood in the window a sort of stool or throne with ends like a sofa and no back it had belonged to aunt victorias father and she valued it very much beths feet as she sat on it did not touch the ground aunt victoria stood for a moment in the middle of the room reflecting and as she did so she looked with her short thick stubbly white hair more like a thin old gentleman in a black petticoat and loose red jacket than ever i believe beth she said solemnly i believe in god the father almighty i believe that if we do his holy will here on earth we shall when we die be received by him into bliss everlasting but if we do not do his holy will then he will condemn us to the bad place where we shall burn for ever but what is his holy will beth asked it is his holy will that we should do right and that we should not do wrong but this is a big subject beth and i can only unfold it to you bit by bit but will you unfold it i will as best i can if you will listen earnestly i am always in earnest beth answered sincerely no one can teach you god aunt victoria pursued he must come to you light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright of heart the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament showeth his handiwork day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard lift up your heads o ye gates and be ye lifted up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the lord strong and mighty beth in a burst of enthusiasm jumped down from her perch clasped her hands to her chest and criedo aunt victoria that isthat isshe tore at her hairi want a wordi want a word it is grand beth grand grand beth shouted yes it is grand beth said aunt victoria emphatically remember that you are a christian child and not a dancingdervish if you do not instantly calm yourself i shall shake you and if i ever see you give way to such wild excitement again i shall shake you for your own good calm is one of the first attributes of a gentlewoman teachers of religion do not always practise what they preach up to this moment although beth had done her best to teach emily she had had no idea of being religious herself but now on a sudden there came upon her that great yearning tenderness towards god and desire for goodness which some sects call conversion and hold to be the essential beginning of a religious life this was the opportunity aunt victoria had prayed for and from that time forward she began to instruct beth systematically in religious matters the subject fascinated beth and she would make opportunities to be alone with her aunt and go to her room willingly whenever she asked her for the pleasure of hearing her aunt victoria often moved about the room and dressed as she talked and beth while listening did not fail to observe the difficulty of keeping stockings up on skinny legs when you wore woollen garters below the knee and also that it looked funny to have to tuck up your dress to get your purse out of a pocket in your petticoat at the back but when aunt victoria sat down and read the bible aloud beth became absorbed and would even read whole chapters again to herself in order to remember how to declaim the more poetical passages as aunt victoria didall of which she relished with the keenest enthusiasm unfortunately for beth however aunt victoria was strongly calvinistic and dwelt too much on death and the judgment for her mental health the old lady deeply as she sympathised with beth and loved her did not realise how morbidly sensitive she was and accordingly worked on her feelings until the fear of god got hold of her just at this time too mrs caldwell chose the pilgrims progress for a sunday book and read it aloud to the children and this together with aunt victorias views operated only too actively on the childs vivid imagination a great dread seized upon hernot on her own account strange to say she never thought of herself but of her friends and of the world at large she was in mortal dread lest they should be called to judgment and consigned to the flames while the sun was out such thoughts did not trouble her but as the day declined and twilight sombrely succeeded the sunset her heart sank and her little being was racked with one great petition offered up to the lord in anguish that he would spare them all the season was beginning the little place was already full of visitors and beth used to stand at the diningroom window while mrs caldwell was reading aloud on sunday evenings and watch the congregation stream out of the church at the end of the road and suffer agonies because of the torments that awaited them all including her mother brothers and sisters harriet in the kitchen and mrs davy at orchard house oppositeeverybody indeed except aunt victoriain a future state out on the cliffs in the summer evenings when great dark masses of cloud tinged with crimson were piled to the zenith at sundown and coldly reflected in the dark waters of the bay she saw the destination of the world she heard cries of torment too in the plash of breaking waves and the unceasing roar of the sea and as she watched the visitors lounging about in bright dresses laughing and talking careless of their doom she could hardly restrain her tears night after night when she went to bed she put her head under the clothes that bernadine might not hear and her chest was torn with sobs until she fell asleep at that time she devised no more tricks she took no interest in games and would not fight even bernadine did not know what to make of her all day she was recovering from the lassitude caused by the mental anguish of the previous evening but regularly at sunset it began again and the more she suffered the less able was she to speak on the subject at first she had tried to discuss eternal punishment with harriet bernadine and aunt victoria and each had responded characteristically harriets imagination dwelt on the particular torments reserved for certain people she knew which she described graphically bernadine listened to beths remarks with interest then accused beth of trying to frighten her and said she would tell mamma aunt victoria discoursed earnestly on the wages of sin the sufferings of sinners the glories of salvation the peace on earth from knowing you are saved and the pleasures of the world to come but the more beth heard of the joys of heaven the more she dreaded the horrors of hell still however she was too shy to say anything about her own acute mental misery and no one suspected that anything was wrong until one day something dejected in the childs attitude happened to catch aunt victorias attention beth was sitting on an african stool her elbow on her knee her chin resting on her little hand her grey eyes looking up through the window at the summer sky what could the child be thinking of aunt victoria wondered and surely she was looking thin and palequite haggard why dont you get something to do beth the old lady asked its bad for little girls to idle about all day i wish i had something to do beth answered im so tired does your head ache child aunt victoria asked speaking sharply because her mind was disturbed no you should answer politely and say no thank you no thank you aunt victoria was the docile rejoinder aunt victoria resolved to speak to mrs caldwell and resumed her knitting she was one of those people who can keep what they have to say till a suitable occasion offers her mind was never so full of any one subject as to overflow and make a mess of it she would wait a week watching her opportunity if necessary and she did not therefore although she saw mrs caldwell frequently during the day speak to her about beth until the children had gone to bed in the evening when she was sure of her effect then she began abruptly caroline that child beth is ill mrs caldwell was startled it was very inconsiderate of aunt victoria she knew she was nervous about her children how could she be so unfeeling what made her think beth ill look at her said aunt victoria she eats nothing she has wasted to a skeleton she has no blood in her face at all and her eyes look as if she never slept i am sure she sleeps well enough mrs caldwell answered inclined to bridle i feel quite sure caroline aunt victoria said solemnly that if you take a candle and go upstairs this minute you will find that child wide awake mrs caldwell felt that she was being found fault with and was indignant she went upstairs at once with her head held high expecting to find beth in a healthy sleep the relief however of finding that the child was well would not have been so great at the moment as the satisfaction of proving aunt victoria in the wrong but beth was wide awake petitioning god in an agony to spare her friends when mrs caldwell entered she started up o mamma she exclaimed im so glad youve come ive been so frightened about you what is the matter with you beth mrs caldwell asked not overgently what are you frightened about nothing beth faltered shrinking back into herself oh thats nonsense her mother answered its silly to be frightened at nothing and cowardly to be frightened at all lie down and go to sleep like a good child come turn your face to the wall and ill tuck you in beth obeyed and her mother left her to her fears and returned to aunt victoria in the drawingroom well aunt victoria asked anxiously she was awake mrs caldwell acknowledged she said she was frightened but didnt know what of i expect shed been dreaming and im sure there is nothing the matter with her shes been subject to queer fits of alarm at night ever since she was a baby its the dark i think it makes her nervous at one time the doctor made us have a nightlight for her which was great nonsense i always said but her father insisted when it suits her to play in the dark shes never afraid it was at this time that rainharbour set up a band of its own beth was always peculiarly susceptible to music her ear was defective she rarely knew if any one sang flat but the poorest instrument would lay hold of her and set high chords of emotion vibrating beyond the reach of words the first time she heard the band she was completely carried away it was on the pier and she happened to be close beside it when it began to play and stood still in astonishment at the crash of the opening bars her mother after vainly calling to her to come on snatched impatiently at her arm to drag her away and beth in her excitement set her teeth and slapped at her mothers handor rather at what seemed to her the importunate thing that was trying to end her ecstasy of course mrs caldwell would not stand that so beth victim of brute force was hustled off to the end of the pier and then slapped shaken and reviled for the enormity of her offence until in an acute nervous crisis she wrenched herself out of her mothers clutches and sprang over into the harbour it was highwater happily and count gustav bartahlinsky who was just going out in his yacht saw her drop and fished her out with a boathook look here young woman he said what do you mean by tumbling about like this i shall have the trouble of turning back and putting you on shore no dont no dont beth pleaded take me along with you he looked at her an instant considering then went to the side of the yacht and called up to her frantic mother shes all right ill have her dried and bring her back this afternoonwith which assurance mrs caldwell was obliged to content herself for the yacht sailed on not that she would have objected beth and count gustav were sworn allies by this time and mrs caldwell knew that beth could not be in better hands beth had seen count gustav passing their window a few days after their first meeting and had completed her conquest of him by tearing out and running down orchard street after him with nothing on her head to ask what copyright was and since then they had often met and sometimes spent delightful hours together sitting on the cliffs or strolling along by the sea he had discovered her talent for versemaking and given her a book on the subject full of examples which was a great joy to her when the yacht was clear of the harbour he took her down to the saloon and got out a silk shirt im going to leave you he said and when im gone you must take off all your things and put this shirt on then tumble into that berth between the blankets and ill come back and talk to you beth promptly obeyed she was an illused heroine now in the hands of her knightly deliverer and thoroughly happy when count gustav returned he was followed by gard a tall dark handsome sailor a descendant of black dane settlers on the coast and for that reason commonly called black gard he brought sandwiches cakes and hot tea on a tray for beth she had propped herself up with pillows in the berth and was looking out of an open porthole opposite listening enraptured to the strains of the band which mellowed by distance floated out over the water what a radiant little face the count thought as he handed her the tea and sandwiches beth took them voraciously did you have any breakfast the count asked smiling yes beth answered what did you have milk and hot water and dry toast i made the toast myself no butter no the butters running short so i wouldnt take any when do you lunch oh we dont lunch cant afford it you know the boys have got to be educated and uncle james patten wont help though jims his heir count gustav looked at her little delicate hand lying on the coverlet and then at the worn little face youve been crying he said ah that was only last night after i went to bed beth answered it makes you cry when people arent saved doesnt it are you saved if youre not it will be awful for me why cos it would hurt so here to think of you burning in hellbeth clasped her chest it always begins to ache herein the eveningfor the people who arent saved and when i go to bed it makes me cry who told you about being saved and that aunt victoria she lives with us you know shes going away now to pay a visit because the boys are coming home and mildred for the holidays and there wouldnt be room for her im dreadfully sorry but i shall go to church and read the bible just the same when shes away count gustav sat down on the end of the saloontable and reflected a little then he saidi wouldnt read anything if i were you while aunt victorias away just play about with mildred and the boys and come out fishing with me sometimes god doesnt want you to save people he does that himself i expect hes very angry because you cry at night he thinks you dont trust him all he wants you to do is to love him and trust him and be happy thats the creed for a little girl do you think so beth gasped then she began to reflect and her big grey eyes slowly dilated while at the same time a look of intense relief relaxed the muscles of her pinched little face do you think so she repeated then suddenly she burst into tears count gustav somewhat disconcerted hurriedly handed her a handkerchief another gentleman came into the saloon at the moment and raised inquiring eyebrows only a little martyr momentarily released from suffering enjoying the reaction count gustav observed come on deck and let her sleep do you hear little lady go to sleep beth docile to a fault when gently handled nestled down among the blankets shut her eyes and prepared to obey the sound of the water rippling off the sides of the yacht as it glided on smoothly over the summersea both soothed and cheered her heavenly thoughts came crowding into her mind then sleep surprised her with the tears she had been shedding for the sufferings of others still wet upon her cheek when she awoke her clothes were beside her ready to put on she jumped up instantly dressed and went on deck the yacht was almost stationary and the two gentlemen attended by the black dane gard were fishing away to starboard the land lay like a silver mist in the heat of the afternoon beth turned her sorrowful little face towards it are you homesick beth count gustav asked no sick of home beth answered but i suppose i shall have to go back and what then mamma will punish me for jumping into the harbour i expect jumping in he ejaculated and then a great gravity settled upon him and he cogitated for some time why did you jump in he said at last because mammabecause mamma her chest heaved she was ashamed to say count gustav exchanged glances with the other gentleman and said no more but he took her home himself in the evening and had a long talk with mamma and aunt victoria and after he had gone they were both particularly nice to beth but very solemn that night too aunt victoria did not mention death and the judgment but talked of heaven and the mercy of god until beths brow cleared and she was filled with hope it was the next day that aunt victoria left them to make room for mildred and the boys beth went with her mother to see the old lady off at the station on account of their connections the little party attracted attention and mrs caldwell feeling her importance expected the officials to be obsequious which they were and in return she also expected aunt victoria to make proper acknowledgment of their attentions she considered that sixpence at least was necessary to uphold the dignity of the family on such occasions but to her horror when the moment came aunt victoria after an exciting fumble drew from her reticule a tract entitled the man on the slant and in the face of everybody handed it to the expectant porter mrs caldwell assured lady benyon afterwards that she should never forget that moment beth used to wonder why chapter xviii the end of the holidays found beth in a very different mood jim had come with the ideas of his adolescence and mildred had brought new music and these together had helped to take her completely out of herself the rest from lessons toofrom her mothers method of making education a martyrdom and many more hours of each day than usual spent in the open air had also helped greatly to ease her mind and strengthen her body so that even in the time which was only a few weeks she had recovered her colour shot up and expanded most of the time she had spent with jim whom she had studied with absorbing interest his point of view was so wholly unexpected and even in these early days she showed a trait of character for which she afterwards became remarkable that is to say she learned the whole of the facts of a case before she formed an opinion on its meritslistened and observed uncritically without prejudice and without personal feeling until she was fully informed life unfolded itself to her like the rules of arithmetic she could not conjecture what the answer would be in any single example from a figure or two but had to take them all down in order to work the sum and her object was always not to prove herself right in any guess she might have made but to arrive at the truth she was eleven years old at this time but looked fourteen it was when she went out shooting with jim that they used to have their most interesting discussions jim used to take her to carry things but never offered her a shot because she was a girl she did not care about that however because she had made up her mind to take the gun when he was gone and go out shooting on her own account and she abstracted a certain amount of powder and shot from his flasks each day to pay herself for her present trouble and also to be ready for the future uncle james had given jim leave to shoot provided he sent the game he killed to fairholm and sometimes they spent the day wandering through the woods after birds and sometimes they sat on the cliffs which skirted the property potting rabbits jim expected beth to act as a keeper for him and also to retrieve like a welltrained dog and when on one occasion she disappointed him he had a good deal to say about the uselessness of sisters and the inferiority of the sex generally women he always maintained were only fit to sew on buttons and mend socks but is it contemptible to sew on buttons and mend socks beth asked one day when they were sitting in a sandy hollow waiting for rabbits its not a mans work said jim a trifle disconcerted beth looked about her the great sea the vast tract of sand and the blue sky so high above them made her suffer for her own insignificance and feel for the moment that nothing was worth while but in the hollow where they sat it was cosy and the grass was green miniature cliffs overhung the rabbitholes and the dry soil was silvered by sun and wind and rain there was a stiff breeze blowing but it did not touch them in their sheltered nook they could hear it making its moan however as if it were vainly trying to get at them and there also ascended from below the ceaseless sound of the sea beth turned her back on the wild prospect and watched the rabbitholes theres one on the right she said at last softly jim raised his gun aimed and fired the rabbit rolled over on its back and beth rose in a leisurely way fetched it carrying it by its legs and threw it down on the bag and when all the buttons are sewed on and all the socks mended what is a girl to do with her time she asked dispassionately when she had reseated herself the things only come home from the wash once a week you see oh theres lots to be done jim answered vaguely theres the cooking a mans life isnt worth having if the cookings bad but a gentleman keeps a cook beth observed oh yes of course jim answered irritably you would see what i mean if you werent a girl girls have no brains they scream at a mouse we never scream at mice beth protested in surprise bernadine catches them in her hands ah but then youve had brothers you see said jim it makes all the difference if youre taught not to be silly then why arent all girls taught and why arent we taught more things because youve got no brains i tell you but if we can be taught one thing why cant we be taught another how can you tell weve no brains if you never try to teach us now look here miss beth said brother jim in a tone of exasperation i know what youll be when you grow up if you dont mind youll be just the sort of longtongued shrew always arguing that men hate do you say that men hate or whom men hate beth interrupted there you are said jim devilish sharp at a nag thats just what im telling you now you take my advice and hold your tongue then perhaps youll get a husband and if you do make things comfortable for him men cant abide women who dont make things comfortable well said beth temperately i dont think i could abide a man who didnt make things comfortable jim grunted as though that point of view were a different thing altogether by degrees beth discovered that sisters did not hold at all the same sort of place in jims estimation as the girls the girls were other peoples sisters to whom jim was polite and whom he even fawned on and flattered while they were present but made most disparaging remarks about and ridiculed behind their backs to his own sisters on the contrary he was habitually rude but he always spoke of them nicely in their absence and even boasted about their accomplishments your brother jim says you can act anything charlotte hardy the doctors daughter told beth and you recite wonderfully although youve never heard any one recite and you talk like a grownup person beth flushed with surprise and pleasure at this but her heart had hardly time to expand before she observed the puzzling discrepancy between what jim said to her and what he had been saying to other people and found it impossible to reconcile the two so as to have any confidence in jims sincerity before the end of the holidays she had learned to enjoy jims companionship but she had no respect for his opinions at all he had taught her a good deal however he had taught her for one thing the futility of discussion with people of his capacity the small intellect should be treated like the small childwith tenderest consideration it must not hear too much of anything at a time and there are certain things that it must never be told at all simple familiar facts with obvious little morals are the right food for it and constant repetition of what it knows is safe but such heavy things as theories opinions and arguments must be kept carefully concealed from it for fear of causing congestion or paralysis or worse still that parlous condition which betrays itself in distressing symptoms such as one sees daily in society or sits and shudders at in ones own friends when the victim swelling with importance makes confident misstatements draws erroneous conclusions sums up and gives advice so fatuous that you blush to be a biped of the same species there was an hotel in rainharbour called the united kingdom where jim spent much of his time playing billiards drinking beer and smoking pipes he had to coax money out of his mother continually for these pursuits its the kind of thing a fellow must do you know mamma he said you cant expect him to stick at home like a girl he must see life or hell be a muff instead of a man of the world how shall i get on at fairholm when i come in for the property if im not up to things this was said at breakfast one morning and mrs caldwell sitting opposite the window raised her worn face and looked up at the sky considering what else there was that she could do without do you learn how to manage estates at the united kingdom beth put in innocently now look here beth just you shut up said jim youre always putting your oar in and its deuced impertinent of a child like you when im talking to my mother she knows what im talking about and you dont but youll be teaching her next i expect youre far too cheeky i only wanted to know beth protested that will do said mrs caldwell impatiently she was put out by jims demand for money which she had not got to spare and found it a relief to expend some of her irritation on beth jim is quite right and i wont have you hanging about always listening to things you dont understand and rudely interrupting i thought we were at breakfast beth exclaimed furious at being unjustly accused of hanging about be good enough to leave the table said mrs caldwell and you shall have nothing but bread and water for the rest of the day it will be a dinner of herbs with contentment then if i have it alone said beth for which impertinence she was condemned to be present at every meal having extracted the money from his mother jim went off to the united kingdom and came back in the afternoon somewhat the worse for beer but mrs caldwell did not perceive it he complained of the poor dinner the cooking and beths shabby appearance how can you go out with me like that he said why cant you dress properly look at my things im decent so should i be said beth without malice her eyes shining with mortification so should i be if anybody bought me decent clothes she did not think it unfair however that she should go shabby so that jim might be well dressed nor did she feel it wrong when the holidays were over and the boys had gone that she should be left idly drumming on the windowpane that they should have every advantage while she had none and no prospect but the uncertain chance of securing a husband if she held herself well and did as she was tolda husband whom she would be expected to obey whatever he might lack in the way of capacity to order it is suffering which makes these things plain to a generous woman but usually by the time she has suffered enough to be able to blame those whom it has been her habit to love and respect and to judge of the wrong they have done her it is too late to remedy it even if her faculties have not atrophied for want of use all that should have been cultivated lies latent in her she has nothing to fall back upon and her life is spoilt beth stood idly drumming on the windowpane for long hours after the boys had gone then she got her battered old hat walked out to fairholm and wandered over the ground where she had been wont to retrieve for jim when she came to the warren the rabbits were out feeding and she amused herself by throwing stones at them with her left hand she had the use of both hands and would not have noticed if her knife had been put where her fork should have been at table but she threw stones bowled batted played croquet and also tennis in after years with her left hand by preference and she always held out her left hand to be handed from a carriage she succeeded in killing a rabbit with a stone to her own surprise and delight and carried it off home where it formed a welcome addition to the meagre fare she skinned and cleaned it herself boiled it carved it carefully so that it might not look like a cat on the dish covered it with good onionsauce and garnished it with little rolls of fried bacon and sent it to table where the only other dish was cold beefbones with very little meat on them where did it come from mrs caldwell asked looking pleased from fairholm beth answered i must thank your uncle said mrs caldwell it was not my uncle beth answered laughing and youre not to send any thanks oh very well said mrs caldwell still more pleased for she supposed it was a surreptitious kindness of aunt grace marys she ate the rabbit with appetite and beth as she watched her determined to go hunting again and see what she could get for her beth would not have touched a penny of uncle jamess but from that time forward she did not scruple to poach on his estate and bring home anything she could catch she had often prayed to the lord to show her how to do something to help her mother in her dire poverty and when this idea occurred to her she accepted it as a direct answer to her prayer mrs caldwell and the three girls slept in the largest bedroom in the house it was at the back looking into the little garden and out to the east the early morning sun making black bars of the windowframe on the white blind often awoke beth and she would lie and count the white spaces between the bars where the windowpanes werethree six nine twelve or two four six eight ten twelve one morning after jim left she was lying awake counting the windowpanes when harriet knocked at the door with the hot water mildred had not yet gone back to her aunt and was sleeping with beth bernadine being with her mother come get up children said mrs caldwell as she got out of bed herself mamma maynt i have breakfast in bed said bernadine in a wheedling tone no no my little body mrs caldwell answered but mamma whined the little body ive got such a headache she very often had when she ought to have been getting up cry baby cry sang out beth mamma give me my stockings mrs caldwell picked them up off the floor and gave them to her beth began to put them on in bed and diverted herself as she did so by making diabolical grimaces at the malingering imp opposite mamma bernadine whined again beths teasing me beth how often am i to tell you that i will not allow you to tease the child mrs caldwell exclaimed beth solemnly gartered her stockings then she gave mildred a dig in the ribs with her heel and growled get up mamma beth is teasing me now said mildred promptly well i dont see why i should be obliged to do all the getting up for the family said beth her mother turned from the lookingglass with her hairbrush in her hand and gazed at her sternly beth hummed a tune but kept at a safe distance until she was dressed then made her escape going straight to the kitchen where harriet was cutting bread to toast thats all the bread there is she said and it wont be enough for breakfast if you eat any all right then i havent any appetite beth answered casually what did you dream last night i dreamt about crocodiles harriet averred a crocodiles a reptile said beth and a reptile is trouble and an enemy you always dream nasty things i expect its your inside whats that to do wi it said harriet everything said beth dont you know the stuff that dreams are made of pickles pork and plumcake dreams is sent for our guidance harriet answered portentously shaking her head at beths flippancy well im glad of it said beth for i dreamt i was catching uncle jamess trout in a most unsportsmanlike way and i guess the dream was sent to show me how to do it when i have that kind of dream i notice it nearly always comes true but wheres the dream book ook it said harriet eres your ma as the other little bodies had their breakfasts in bed beth had to face her lessons alone that morning and mrs caldwell was not in an amiable mood but she was absent as well as irritable so beth did some old work over again and as she knew it thoroughly she got on well until the music began beth had a great talent as well as a great love for music when they were at fairholm aunt grace mary gave her uncle jamess instruction book for beginners one wet day to keep her quiet and she learnt her notes in the afternoon and began at once to apply them practically on the piano she soon knew all the early exercises and little tunes and was only too eager to do more but her mother hated the musiclesson more than any of the others and was so harsh that beth became nervous and only ventured on the simplest things for fear of the consequences when her mother went out however she tried what she liked and if she had heard the piece before she could generally make something satisfactory to herself out of it one day aunt victoria found her sitting on the musicstool solemnly pulling at her fingers one after the other as though to stretch them what are you doing child she said o aunt victoria beth answered in a despairing way heres such a lovely thing and my head will play it only my fingers are not long enough mildred had brought a quantity of new music home with her these holidays she promised to play well also and her aunt was having her properly taught beth listened to her enraptured when she first arrived and then to mildreds surprise and admiration tried the pieces herself and in a few weeks knew all that it had taken mildred six months to learn that morning as illluck would have it when she was waiting at the piano for her mother to come and give her her lesson beth began to try a piece with a passage in it that she could not play do show me how to do this she said when mrs caldwell came oh you cant do that mrs caldwell exclaimed it is far too difficult for you but i do so want to learn it beth ventured oh very well her mother answered but i warn you beth began and got on pretty well till she came to the passage she did not understand and there she stumbled what are you doing mrs caldwell exclaimed beth tried again nervously thats not right her mother cried what does that sign mean now what is it just think beth with a flushed face was thinking hard but nothing came of it will you speak her mother said angrily you are the most obstinate child that ever lived now say something its not a shake beth ventured a shake her mother exclaimed giving her a hard thump on the back with her clenched fist now no more obstinacy tell me what it is at once i dont know that sign beth faltered in desperation oh you dont know it her mother said now fairly fuming and accompanying every word by a hard thump of her clenched fist then ill teach you ive a great mind to beat you as long as i can stand over you beth was a piteous little figure crouched on the pianostool her back bent beneath her mothers blows and every fibre of her sensitive frame shrinking from her violence but she made no resistance and mrs caldwell carried out her threat when she could beat beth no longer she told her to sit there until she knew that sign and then she left her beth clenched her teeth and an ugly look came into her face there had been dignity in her endurancethe dignity of selfcontrol for there was the force in her to resist had she thought it right to resist what she was thinking while her mother beat her was i hope i shall not strike you back harriet had heard the scolding and when mrs caldwell had gone she came and peeped in at the door shes bin thumpin you again as she she said with a grin wot a ye bin doin now what business is that of yours said beth defiantly it was bad enough to be beaten but it was much worse to have harriet peeping in to gloat over her humiliation harriet was not to be snubbed however she went up to the piano and looked at the music its precious hard i should think she remarked its not hard beth answered positively if anybody tells you what you dont know and cant make out for yourself i always remember when im told or shown how to do it but whats the use of staring at a sign youve never seen before just you look at that can you make anything out of it harriet approached and after staring at the sign curiously for some time shook her head of course not said beth snatching up her music and throwing it on the floor and neither can anybody else it isnt fair bernadine had begun her lessons by this time in the next room and mrs caldwell suddenly began to scold again oh that awful voice beth groaned aloud her racked nerves betraying her shes catchin it now said harriet after listening with interest she seemed to derive some sort of gratification from the childrens troubles but dont you bother any more miss bethyour mall ave forgotten all about it by goinout timeor shell pertend she as to save erself trouble come and elp us wi the beds beth rose slowly from the pianostool and followed harriet upstairs to the bedroom at the back of the house she was at once attracted to the open window by an uproar of voicesthe voices of children in happy play there was a girls dayschool next door kept by the misses granger miss granger had called on mrs caldwell as soon as she was settled in her house to beg for the honour of being allowed to educate her three little girls and beth had assisted at the interview with serious attention it would have been the best thing in the world for her had she been allowed to romp and learn with that careless happy healthyminded crew of respectable little plebeians but mrs caldwell would never have dreamt of sending any of her own superior brood to associate with such people even if she could have afforded it she politely explained to miss granger that she was educating her children herself for the present and it was then with a sickening sense of disappointment that beth rejected her mothers social standard with its vulgar exclusiveness once for all she hung out of the window now heedless of harriets appeals to be elped wi the beds and watched the games going on in the next garden with pathetic gravity the girls were playing rounders among the old fruittrees on the grassplot with a loud accompaniment of shrieks and shouts of laughter they tumbled up against the trees continually and shook showers of autumn leaves down upon themselves and then tiring of the game they began to pelt each other with the leaves and laughed and shrieked still louder some of them looked up and made faces at beth but she did not acknowledge the discourtesy she knew that they were not ladies but did not feel as her mother did that this was a fault for which they should be punished but a misfortune rather for which she pitied them and she would have liked to have made it up to them by knowing them suddenly she remembered that aunt victoria was coming back that day which was something to look forward to she took harriets duster and went to see if the old ladys room was all in order for her and arranged as she liked it then she returned to the drawingroom and sat down on the pianostool and rage and rebellion uprose in her heart the piece of music still lay on the floor and she stamped her foot on it as she did so her mother came into the room do you know your lesson she demanded no i do not said beth and then she doubled her fist and brought it down bang on the keyboard how dare you mrs caldwell exclaimed startled by the vehemence of the blow and jarred by the discordant cry of the poor piano i felt i musti felt i must make something suffer said beth in a deep chestvoice and with knitted brows twisting her fingers and rising to face her mother as she spoke and if i had not struck the piano i should have struck you mrs caldwell could not have been more taken aback if beth had struck her the colour left her face a chill succeeded the heat of temper and her right mind returned as to a drunken man suddenly sobered she noticed that beths eyes were almost on a level with her own and once again she realised that if beth chose to rebel she would be powerless to control her for some seconds they looked at each other without a word then beth stooped picked up the piece of music smoothed it out and put it on the stand and then she shut up the piano deliberately but remained standing in front of it with her back to her mother mrs caldwell watched her for a little in silence its your own fault beth she said at last you are so conceited you try to play things that are too difficult for you and then you get into trouble it is no pleasure to me to punish you beth remained with her back turned immovable and her mother looked at her helplessly a little longer and then left the room when she had gone beth sat down on the pianostool her shabby shoes had holes in them her dress was worn threadbare and her sleeves were too short for her she had no collar or cuffs and her thin hands and long wrists looked hideous to her as they lay in her lap great tears gathered in her eyes so conceited indeed what had she to be conceited about every one despised her and she despised herself here the tears overflowed and beth began to cry at last and cried and cried for a long time very bitterly that afternoon after aunt victoria had arrived lady benyon and aunt grace mary called mrs caldwell had recovered her goodhumour by that time and was all smiles to everybody including beth when she came sauntering in languid and heavyeyed with half a sheet of notepaper in her hand what have you there puck said lady benyon catching sight of some hieroglyph drawn on the paper beth gave it to her and she turned it this way and that but could make nothing of it mamma will tell us what it is said beth taking it to her mother mrs caldwell still smiling looked at the drawing its an astronomical sign surely she ventured no it is not beth said then i dont know what it is her mother rejoined oh but you must know mamma said beth look again but i dont know beth mrs caldwell insisted couldnt you make it out if aunt victoria beat you beth suggested mrs caldwell changed countenance that is what you expect me to do at all events beth pursued now you see you cant do it yourself and i ask you was it fair to expect me to make out a strange sign by staring at it she set her mouth hard when she had spoken and looked her mother straight in the face mrs caldwell winced whats the difficulty puck lady benyon asked the difficulty is between me and mamma beth answered with dignity and then she left the room sauntering out as she had come in with an utterly dispirited air the next morning she went to practice as usual but mrs caldwell did not come to give her her musiclesson beth thought she had forgotten it and went to remind her no beth i have not forgotten said mrs caldwell but after your conduct yesterday i do not know how you can expect me to give you another musiclesson are you not going to give me any more beth exclaimed no certainly not her mother answered beths heart sank she stood for some little time in the doorway looking at her mother who sat beside the table sewing and pointedly ignored her then beth turned and went back to the drawingroom slowly and carefully practised the usual time with great tears trickling down her cheeks it did not seem to make much difference what happened whether she was on her best behaviour or her worst the tears were bound to come but beth had a will of her own and she determined to learn music she said no more on the subject to her mother however but from that day forward she practised regularly and hard and studied her instruction books and listened to other people playing when she had a chance and asked to have passages explained to her until at last she knew more than her mother could have taught her chapter xix but wellsprings mortal and immortal were beginning to bubble up brightly in beth despite the hard conditions of her life she sharpened her wits involuntarily on the people about her she gathered knowledge where she listed her further faculty flashed forth fine rays at unexpected intervals to cheer her and her hungry heart also began to seek satisfaction for beth was by nature wellbalanced there was to be no atrophy of one side of her being in order that the other might be abnormally developed her chest was not to be flattened because her skull bulged with the big brain beneath rather the contrary for mind and body acted and reacted on each other favourably in so far as the conditions of her life were favourable such congenial intellectual pursuits as she was able to follow by tranquillising her helped the development of her physique while the healthy condition of her body stimulated her to renewed intellectual effortand it was all a pleasure to her at this time she had a new experience an experience for which she was totally unprepared but one which helped her a great deal and delighted as much as it surprised her there were high oak pews in the little church at the end of the road which the caldwells attended on sunday in the rows on either side of the main aisle the pews came together in twos so that when beth sat at the end of theirs as she always did the person in the next pew sat beside her with only the wooden partition between one sunday when she was on her knees drowsing through the litany with her cheek on her prayerbook she became aware of a boy in the next pew with his face turned to her in exactly the same attitude he had bright fair hair curling crisply a ruddy fair fat face and round blue eyes clear as glass marbles beth was pleased with him and smiled involuntarily he instantly responded to the smile and then they both got very red and in their delicious shyness they turned their heads on their prayerbooks and looked in opposite directions this did not last long however the desire for another look seized them simultaneously and they turned their faces to each other and smiled again the moment their eyes met all through the service they kept looking at each other and looking away again and beth felt a strange glad glow begin in her chest and spread gradually all over her it continued with her the whole day she was conscious of it throughout the night and directly she awoke next morning there it was again and she could think of nothing but the applecheeked boy with bright blue eyes and curly fair hair and as she dwelt upon his image she smiled to herself and kept on smiling there came upon her also a great desire to please with sudden energy which made all effort easy to her so that instead of being tiresome at her lessons she did them in a way that astonished her mothersuch a wonderful incentive is a little joy in life she would not go out when lessons were over however but stood in the drawingroom window watching the people pass harriet came and worried her to help with the dusting go away you chattering idiot said beth she had found harriet out in many meannesses by this time and had lost all respect for her dont you see im thinking if you dont bother me now ill help you byandby perhaps on the other side of the road in the same row as the benyon dowerhouse but well within sight of the window was the mansionhouse collegiate day and boarding school for the sons of gentlemen beth kept looking in that direction and presently the boys came pouring out in their mortarboards and among them she soon discovered the one she was thinking of she discovered him less by sight than by a strange sensation in herself a pleasure which shot through her from top to toe for no reason she stepped back from the window and looked in the opposite direction towards the church but she could see him when he came bounding past with his satchel of books under his arm and she also knew that he saw her he ran on however and going round the corner where orchard row turned off at an angle out of orchard street was out of sight in a moment but beth was satisfied indeed she was more than satisfied she ran into the kitchen and astonished harriet by a burst of hilarious spirits and a wild demand for food for a duster for a scrubbingbrush she wanted to do a lot and she was hungry youre fond ah think said harriet dryly youre fond too beth cried were all fond the fonder the better and i must have something to eat well theres nothing for you but bread i must have meat said beth rob the joint and ill not take any at dinner ahd tak it weniver ah could get it if ah was you harriet advised if you was or were me youd do as i do said beth and i wont cheat if i say i wont take it i wont im entitled to meat once a day and ill take my share now please but i wont take more than my share youll be ungry again by dinnertime i know said beth but that wont make any difference she got out the sirloin of beef which was to be roasted for dinner deftly cut some slices off it fried them with some cold potatoes and ate them ravenously helped by harriet when dinnertime came beth was ravenous again but she was faithful to her vow and ate no meat harriet scoffed at her for her scrupulousness the next day at the same time beth was again in the window waiting for her boy to come out of the mansionhouse school when he appeared the most delightful thrill shot through her her first impulse was to fly but she conquered that and waited watching him he made straight for the window and stopped in a businesslike way and then they laughed and looked into each others faces what are you doing there he asked as if he were accustomed to see her somewhere else i live here she said i live in orchard row last house he rejoined old lees beth inquired yes hes my grandfather im sammy lee hes a licensed victualler retired beth repeated drawing upon her excellent verbal memory yes said sammy whats yours i havent one whats your father hes dead too what was he he was a gentleman a retired gentleman no said beth an officer and a gentleman oh said sammy my fathers dead too he was a retired gentleman whats a retired gentleman beth asked dont you know sammy exclaimed i thought everybody knew that when you make a fortune you retire from business then youre a retired gentleman but gentlemen dont go into business beth objected what do they do then sammy retorted they have professions or property its all the same said sammy it isnt beth contradicted yah you dont know said sammy laughing and then he ran on being late for his dinner the discussion had been carried on with broad smiles and when he left her beth hugged herself and glowed again and was glad in the thought of him but it was not his conversation so much as his appearance that she dwelt uponhis round blue eyes his bright fair curly hair his rosy cheeks he is beautiful he is beautiful she exclaimed then added upon reflection and i never thought a boy beautiful before the next day she was making rhymes about him in the actingroom and forgot the time so that she missed him in the morning but when he left school in the afternoon she was at the window and she saw him trotting up the street as hard as his little legs could carry him where were you at dinnertime he said how funny she exclaimed in surprise and delight whats funny he demanded looking about him vaguely you were wanting to see me who told you so sammy asked suspiciously you did yourself just now beth answered her eyes dancing i didnt you did sammy youre a liar said sammy lee sammy thats rude she exclaimed and its not the way to speak to a young lady and i wont have it well but i did not tell you i wanted to see you at dinnertime sammy retorted positively yes you did stupid said beth you asked where i was at dinnertime and then i knew you had missed me and you wouldnt have missed me if you hadnt wanted to see me but sammy repeated with sulky obstinacy unable to comprehend the delicate subtilty of beths perceptionbut i did not tell you didnt you want to see me then beth said coaxingly waiving the other point with tact but sammy feeling shy at the question and vaguely aggrieved looked up and down the street and kicked the pavement with his heel instead of answering i shall go then said beth after waiting for a little no dont he exclaimed his countenance clearing i want to ask youonly you put it out of my headgels do talk so gels beth exclaimed derisively i happen to be a girl sammy looked at her with a puzzled expression and forgot what he was going to say she diverted his attention however by asking him how old he was eleven sammy answered promptly so am i when were you eleven the twentieth of february oh then youre older than memarch april may junefour months my birthdays in june what do you do at school lets see your books i wish i went to school shu said sammy whats the use of sending a gel to school gels cant learn so jim says beth rejoined with an absence of conviction that roused sammy all boys say so he declared all boys are silly said beth whats the use of saying things that doesnt make them true youre as bad as jim whos jim sammy interrupted jealously jims my brother sammy relieved kicked his heel on the pavement which is tallest he asked presently you or me im tallest i think beth answered but never mind youre the fattest ive grown long and youve grown broad youre mighty sharp said sammy youre mighty blunt said beth and youll be mighty late for tea too look at the churchclock sammy glanced up then fled precipitately and beth turning to leave the window discovered harriet standing in the background grinning so youve getten a sweetheart she exclaimed theres nothing like beginning early so youve been listening again beth answered hotly bad luck to you a few days later mrs caldwell was sitting with lady benyon who was in the bowwindow as usual looking out if i am not mistaken said lady benyon suddenly there is a crowd collecting at your house what again mrs caldwell groaned jumping up if im not mistaken lady benyon repeated mrs caldwell hurried off without even waiting to shake hands on getting into the street however she was relieved to find that lady benyon had been mistaken there was no crowd collecting in orchard street but as she approached her own house she became aware of a small boy at the drawingroom window talking to some one within whom she presently discovered to be beth what are you doing there beth she demanded severely who is this boy beth started sammy lee she gasped mr lees grandson at the end of orchard row why are you talking to him her mother asked harshly i wont have you talking to him who will you scrape acquaintance with next then she turned to sammy who stood shaking in his shoes with all the rosy colour faded from his fair fat cheeks too frightened to stir go away said mrs caldwell youve no business here talking to my daughter and i wont allow it sammy sidled off not daring to turn his back full till he was at a safe distance lest he should be seized from behind and shaken he was not a heroic figure in retreat but beth in her indignation noted nothing but the insult that had been offered him for several days when her mother was out she watched and waited for him anxious to atone but sammy kept to the other side of the road and only cast furtive smiles at her as he ran by it never occurred to beth that he was less valiant than she was or less willing to brave danger for her sake than she was for his she thought he was keeping away for fear of getting her into trouble and she beckoned to him again and again in order to explain that she did not care but he only fled the faster then beth wrote him a note it was the first she had ever written voluntarily and she shut herself up in the actingroom to compose it in imitation of aunt grace mary whose beautiful delicate handwriting she always did her best to copywith very indifferent success however for the connection between her hand and her head was imperfect she could compose verses and phrases long before she could commit them to paper intelligibly and it was not the composition of her note to sammy that troubled her but her bad writing she made a religious ceremony of the effort praying fervently lord let me write it well every day she presented a miscellaneous collection of petitions to the lord offering them up as the necessity arose being in constant communication with him when she wanted to go out she asked for fine weather when she did not want to go out she prayed that it might rain she begged that she might not be found out when she went poaching on uncle jamess fields that she might be allowed to catch something that new clothes might be sent her from somewhere she felt so ashamed in her dirty old shabby ones she asked for boots and shoes and gloves and for help with her lessons and when she had no special petition to offer she would ejaculate at intervals lord send me good luck but however great the variety of her daily wants one prayer went up with the others always lord let me write well meaning let me write a good hand yet her writing did not improve and she was much disheartened about it she took the lord into her confidence on the subject very frankly when she had been naughty and was not found out and punished she thanked him for his goodness but why would he not let her write well she asked him the question again and again lifting her grey eyes to the grey sky pathetically and all the time though she never suspected it she was learning to write more than well but in a very different sense of the word her note to sammy was as follows dear sammycome and talk to me do not be afrade i do not mind rows being always in them and she cant do anything to you i miss you i want to tell you things such nice things keep coming to me they make me feel all comfortable inside i looked out of the window in the dark last night there was a frost the sky was dark dark blue like sailors suits only bright and the stars looked like holes bored in the floor of heaven to let the light through it was so white and bright it must have been the light of heaven i never saw such light on earth sunshine is more buffy do come sammy i want you so beth ps i cant stop right yet but im trying it seems rather difficult to stop but nobody can write without stops i always look at stops in books when i read but sometimes you put a coma and sometimes a semicollon i expect you know but i dont so you must teach me its so nice writing things down come to the back gait tonight when the letter was written in queer crabbed characters on one side of a halfsheet of paper then folded so that she could write the address on the other side because she had no envelopeshe wondered how she should get it delivered there was a coolness between her and harriet beth resented the coarse insinuation about having a sweetheart and shrank from hearing any more remarks of a like nature on the subject and she couldnt send the letter by post because she had no stamp should she lay it on his doorstep no somebody else might get it how then she was standing on her own doorstep with the letter in her pocket when she asked herself the question and just at the moment sammy himself appeared coming back from school quick as thought beth ran across the road whipped out the letter and gave it to him sammy stood still in astonishment with his mouth open gazing at it when he found it in his hand as if he could not imagine how it got there as soon as it was dark beth stationed herself at the back gate which looked out into orchard street and waited and waited but sammy did not come he had not been able to get out that was itshe was sure of it yet still she waited although the evening was very cold her mother and aunt victoria had gone to dine with lady benyon she did not know what harriet was doing but she had disposed of bernadine for some time to come by lending her her best picturebook to daub with paint so it was pretty safe to wait and at first the hope of seeing sammy come running round the corner was pleasure enough as the time went on however she became impatient and at last she ventured a little way up the street then a little farther and then she ran on boldly into orchard row as she approached the lees backgate she became aware of a round thing that looked like a cannonball glued to the top and her fond heart swelled for she knew it must be sammys head o sammy why didnt you come she cried i didnt like said sammy ive been waiting for hours beth expostulated with gentle reproach so have i and its cold said sammy disconsolately come now shes out beth coaxed so she was the other day sammy reminded her but well go into the garden she cant catch us there its too dark sammy half persuaded ventured out from the gateway then hesitated but is it very dark he said not so very when youre used to it beth answered but its nice when its dark you can fancy you see things come run she seized his hand as she spoke and set off and sammy overborne by the stronger will kept pace with her but i dont want to see things he protested trying to hold back when they came to the dark passage which led into the garden dont be a fool sammy said beth dragging him on i believe youre a girl im not said sammy indignantly then come and sit on the seesaw oh have you a seesaw he asked immediately diverted yesthis wayunder the peartree its a swing you know tied to the branch and i put this board across it i pulled the board up out of the floor of the woodhouse do you like seesawing yes said sammy with animation catch hold then said beth tipping up the board at her end what are you doing butterfingers she cried as sammy failed to catch hold im sorry i said you were a girl youre much too clumsy she held the board until sammy got astride of it at one end then she bestrode it herself at the other and started it with a vigorous kick on the ground up and down they went shaking showers of leaves from the old tree and an occasional winter pear which fell with a thud being hard and heavy golly this is fine sammy burst out i say beth what a jolly sort of a girl you are do you think so said beth amply rewarded for all her trouble yes and you can write a letter my what a time it must a took you but i say its all rot about stops you know stops is things in books youd never learn stops how do you know beth demanded bridling men write books said sammy proud of his sex not women let alone gels thats all you know about it then cried beth better informed women do write books and girls too jane austen wrote books and maria edgeworth wrote books and fanny burney wrote a book when she was only seventeen called evelina and all the great men read it oh said sammy jeering so youre as clever as they are i suppose sammy was up in the air as he spoke the next moment he came down bump on the ground there said beth thatll teach you you be rude again if you dare ill not come near you again spitcat cried sammy picking himself up i know you wont beth rejoined you darent youre afraid whos afraid said sammy blustering sammy lee said beth oh sammy lees afraid of me riding the seesaw under the tree i say beth said sammy much impressed did you make that yourself make what myself make you afraid yes i did no you didnt said sammy plucking up spirit im not afraid then dont be a fool said beth fool yourself sammy muttered but not very valiantly the churchclock struck nine they were standing about beth not knowing what to do next and sammy waiting for her to suggest something and in the meantime the night became colder and the darkness more intense i think id better take you home beth said at last here give me your hand she dragged him out of the garden in her impetuous way and they scampered off together to orchard row and when they reached the lees house they were so warmed and cheered by the exercise that they parted from each other in high goodhumour ill come again said sammy do said beth giving him a great push that sent him sprawling up the passage this was the kind of attention he understood so he went to bed satisfied there was only one great interest in life for the people at rainharbour their religion gave them but cold comfort their labour was arduous and paid them poorly they had no books no intellectual pursuits no games to take them out of themselves nothing to expand their hearts as a community there were the races the fair and the hirings for excitement but of pleasure such as satisfies because it is soulsustaining and continuous enough to be part of their lives they knew nothing the upper classes were idle selfsatisfied selfish and sensual the lower were industrious enough but ignorant superstitious and depressed the gentry gave themselves airs of superiority really as if their characters were as good as their manners but they did not impose upon the people who despised them for their veneer each class displayed its contempt for the other openly when it could safely do so but was ready to cringe when it suited its own convenience the workers for employment and the gentry for political purposes but human beings are too dependent on each other for such differences to exist without detriment to the whole community society must cohere if it is to prosper individuals help themselves most in the long run when they consider each others interests at rainharbour nothing was done to promote general good fellowship the kind of christianity that was preached there made no mention of the matter and society was disintegrated and would have gone to pieces altogether but for the one great interest in lifethe great primitive interest which consists in the attraction of sex to sex the subject of sweethearts was always in the air the minds of boys and girls youths and maidens men and women were all full of it but it was not often openly discussed as a pleasant topicin fact not much mentioned at all except for faultfinding purposes for it was the custom to be censorious on the subject and naturally those were most so who knew most about it like the vicar who had married four times he was so rabid that he almost went the length of denouncing men and maidens by name from the pulpit if he caught them strolling about together in pairs his mind was so constituted that he could not believe their dalliance to be innocent and yet he did not try to introduce any other interest or pleasure into their lives to divert them from the incessant pursuit of each other it was the grownup people who were so nasty on the subject of sweethearts the boys and girls never could understand why their own inclination was to go about together openly in the most public places that was how they understood sweethearting part of the pleasure of it consisted in other people seeing them and knowing that they were sweethearts and smiling upon them sympathetically this however the grownup people never did on the contrary they frowned and jeered and so the boys and girls kept out of their way and sought secret sympathy from each other any little boy at the mansionhouse school who secured a sweetheart enjoyed a proud distinction and sammy soon found that his acquaintance with beth placed him in quite an enviable position he therefore let his fear of mrs caldwell lapse and did his best to be seen with beth as much as possible and to her it was a surprise as well as a joy to find him hanging about waiting to have a word with her her mothers treatment of her had so damaged her selfrespect that she had never expected anybody to care for her particularly and sammys attentions therefore were peculiarly sweet she did not consider the position at all however there are subjects about which we think and subjects upon which we feel and the two are quite distinct and different beth felt on the subject of sammy the fact of his having a cherubic face made her feel nice inside her chestset up a glow there which warmed and brightened her whole existencea glow which never flickered day or night except in sammys presence when it went out altogether more often than not only to revive however when the real sammy had gone and the ideal sammy returned to his place in her bosom for sammy adored at a distance and sammy within range of criticism were two very different people sammy adored at a distance was allready response to beths fine flights of imagination but sammy on the spot was dull he was seldom on the spot however so that beth had ample leisure to live on her love undisturbed and her mind became extraordinarily active verse came to her like a recollection on halfholidays they sometimes went for a walk together over the wild wide waste of sand when the tide was out and she would rhyme to herself the whole time but she seldom said anything to sammy so long as he was silent he was a source of inspirationthat is to say her feeling for him was inspiring but when she tried to get anything out of him they generally squabbled beth lived her own life at this time almost entirely since that startling threat of rebellion her mother had been afraid to beat her lest she should strike back scolding only made her voluble and mrs caldwell never thought of trying to manage her in the only way possible by reasoning with her and appealing to her better nature there was therefore but one thing for her mother to do in order to preserve her own dignity and that was to ignore beth accordingly when the perfunctory lessons were over in the morning beth had her day to herself she began it generally by practising for at least an hour by the churchclock and after that she had a variety of pursuits which she preferred to follow alone if sammy were at school because then there was no one to interrupt her thoughts when the larder was empty she became loyal heart the trapper and would wander off to fairholm to set snares or catapult anything she could get near the gun she had found impracticable because she was certain to have been seen out with it her snares if they were found were supposed to have been set by poachers she herself was known to every one on the estate and was therefore sure of respect no matter who saw her even uncle james himself would have let her alone had they met as he was of her mothers opinion that it was safer to ignore her than to attempt to control her the snares although of the most primitive kind answered the purpose the great difficulty was how to get the game home but that she also managed successfully generally by returning after dark her mother concluding that she owed whatever came to aunt grace marys surreptitious kindness said nothing on the subject except to beth whom she supposed to be aunt grace marys agent but she very much enjoyed every addition to her monotonous diet especially when beth did the cooking in fact had it not been for loyal heart the family would have pretty nearly starved that winter because of jim who had contracted debts like a man which his mother had to pay with regard to beths cooking it is remarkable that although mrs caldwell herself had suffered all through her married life for want of proper training in household matters she never attempted to have her own daughters better taught on the contrary she had forbidden beth to do servants work and objected most strongly to her cooking until she found how good it was and even then she thought it due to her position only to countenance it under protest the extraordinary inefficiency of the goodoldfashionedwomanly woman as a wife on a small income the silly pretences which showed her want of proper selfrespect and the illadjusted balance of her undeveloped mind which betrayed itself in petty inconsistencies fill us with pity and surprise us yet encourage us too by proving how right and wise we were to try our own experiments if we had listened to advice and done as we were told the womanssphereishome would have been as ugly and comfortless a place for us today as it used to be when beth was forced by the needs of her nature to poach for diversion cook for kindness and clean and fight and pray and lie and love in her brave struggle against the hard and stupid conditions of her lifeconditions which were not only retarding the development but threatening utterly to distort if not actually to destroy all that was best most beautiful and most wonderful in her character beth rather expected to get into difficulties eventually about the game but she calculated that she would have a certain time to run before her head was snapped off and during that time her mother would enjoy her good dinners and be the better for them and she herself would enjoy the sportfacts which no amount of anger afterwards could alter since mrs caldwell had washed her hands of beth they were beginning to be quite good friends sometimes her mother talked to her just as she would to anybody else that is to say with civility she would say and what are you going to do today beth quite pleasantly as though speaking to another grownup person and beth would answer politely and tell the truth if possible instead of making some sulky evasion as she had begun to do when there was no other way of keeping the peace she was fearlessly honest by nature but as she approached maturity she lost her nerve for a time and during that time she lied on occasion to escape a harrowing scene she always despised herself for it however and therefore as she grew stronger she became her natural straightforward self again only if anything all the more scrupulously accurate for the degrading experience for she soon perceived that there is nothing that damages the character like the habit of untruth the man or woman who makes a false excuse has already begun to deteriorate if a census could be taken to establish the grounds upon which people are considered noble or ignoble we should find it was in exact proportion to the amount of confidence that can be placed first of all in their sincerity and then in their accuracy sincerity claims respect for character accuracy estimation for ability no highminded person was ever insincere and no fool was ever accurate when the close season began beth left the plantations and took to fishing in the sea she would sit at the end of the pier in fine weather baiting her hooks with great fat lobworms she had dug up out of the sands at low tide and watching her lines all by herself or if it were rough she would fish in the harbour from the steps up against the wooden jetty where the sailors hung about all day long with their hands in their pockets when the boats were in some of them would sit with her all in a row fishing too and they would exchange bait with her and give her good advice while others stood behind looking on and listening and as of old in ireland she had fascinated the folk so here again these great simple bearded men listened with wondering interest to her talk and never answered at all as if they were speaking to a child beth heard some queer things sitting down there by the old wooden jetty fishing for anything she could catch and she said some queer things too when the mood was upon her sometimes when she wanted to be alone and think she would go off to the rocks that appeared at lowwater down behind the south pier and fish there she loved this spot it was near to nature yet not remote from the haunts of man she sat there one afternoon holding her line and dreamily watching the fishing boats streaming across the bay with their brown sails set to catch the fitful breeze which she could see making catspaws on the water far out but could not feel being sheltered from it by the old stone pier the sea was glassy smooth and lapped up the rocks heaving regularly like the breast of a tranquil sleeper beth gazed at it until she was seized with a great yearning to lie back on its shining surface and be gently borne away to some bright eternity where sammy would be and all her other friends the longing became imperative she rose from the rock she was sitting on she raised her arms her eyes were fixed then it was as if she had suddenly awakened the impulse had passed but she was all shaken by it and shivered as if she were cold fortunately the fish were biting well that day she caught two big dabs four whitings a small plaice and a fine fat sole the sole was a prize indeed and mamma and aunt victoria should have it for dinner as she walked home carrying the fish on a string she met sammy where did you get those fish he asked caught them she answered laconically what all by yourself no i dont believe it i did all the same she answered and now im going to cook themsome of them at least yourself cook them yourself no he cried in admiration cooking was an accomplishment he honoured if youll come out after your tea ill leave the backgate ajar and you can slip into the woodhouse and ill bring you a whiting on toast all hot and brown with such an inducement sammy was in good time beth found him sitting contentedly on a heap of sticks waiting for the feast she had brought the whiting out with a cover over it hot and brown as she had promised and sammys mouth watered when he saw it what a jolly girl you are beth he exclaimed but beth was not so much gratified by the praise as she might have been the vision and the dream were upon her that evening her nerves were overwrought and she was yearning for an outlet for ideas that oppressed her she stood leaning against the doorpost biting a twig restless dissatisfied but not knowing what she wanted when sammy had finished the whiting he remembered beth and asked what she was thinking about im not thinking exactly she answered frowning intently in the effort to find expression for what she had in her consciousness things come into my mind but i dont think them and i cant say them they dont come in words its more like seeing them you know only you dont see them with your eyes but with something inside yourself do you know what it is when you are fishing off the rocks and there is no breaking of waves only a rising and falling of the water and it comes swelling up about you with a sort of sob that brings with it a whiff of fresh air every time and makes you take in your breath with a sort of sob too every timeand at last you seem to be the sea or the sea seems to be youits all one but you dont think it sammy looked at her in a blank bewildered way i like it best when you tell stories beth he said under the impression that all this incomprehensible stuff was merely a display for his entertainment come and sit down beside me and tell stories stories dont come to me tonight said beth with a tragic face do you remember the last time we were on the sandsoh i keep feelingit was all sopeaceful that was it ive been wondering ever since what it was and that was itpeaceful the quiet people the old church steeple the sandy reaches of wreckstrewn beaches who made that up said sammy suspiciously i did beth answered offhand at least i didnt make it up it just came to me when i make it up itll most likely be quite different its like the stuff for a dress you know when you buy it you get it made up and its the same stuff and its quite different too in a way youve got it put into shape and its good for something i dont believe you made it up said sammy doggedly youre stuffing me beth youre always trying to stuff me beth still leaning against the doorpost clasped her hands behind her head and looked up at the sky things keep coming to me faster than i can say them tonight she proceeded paying no heed to his remark not things about you though because nothing goes with sammy but jammy clammy mammy and those arent nice i want things to come about you but they wont i tried last night in bed and what do you think came again and again yes yes that was his cry while the great clouds went sailing by flashes of crimson on colder sky like the thoughts of a summers day colourd by love in a life which else were grey but that isnt you you know sammy then when i stopped trying for something about you there came such a singing what was it it seems to have goneand yet its here you know its all here she insisted with one hand on the top of her head and the other on her chest and her eyes straining and yet i cant get it beth dont get on like that sammy remonstrated you make me feel all horrid make you feel beth cried in a deep voice clenching her fists and shaking them at him exasperated because the verses continued to elude her dont you know what im here for im here to make you feel if you dont feel what i feel then you shall feel horrid if i have to kill you shut up said sammy beginning to be frightened i shall go away if you dont go away then said beth youre just an idiot boy and im tired of you sammys blue eyes filled with tears he got down from the heap of sticks intent on making his escape but beth changed her mind when she felt her audience melting away where are you going she demanded im going home he said deprecatingly i cant stay if you go on in that foolfashion it isnt a foolfashion beth rejoined vehemently its you thats a fool i told you so before if you wasnt a girl id punch your ead said sammy half afraid i believe you beth jeered but youre not a girl anyway she flew at him as she spoke caught him by the collar kicked his shins slapped his face and drubbed him on the back sammy overwhelmed by the sudden onslaught made no effort to defend himself but just wriggled out of her grasp and ran home with great tears streaming down his round red cheeks and sobs convulsing him beths exasperation subsided the moment she was left alone in the woodhouse she sat down on the sticks and looked straight before her filled with remorse what shall i do what shall i do she kept saying to herself oh dear oh dear sammy sammy hes gone ive lost him this is the most dreadful grief i have ever had in my life the moment she had articulated this fullblown phrase she became aware of its importance she repeated it to herself reflected upon it and was so impressed by it that she got up and went indoors to write it down by the time she had found pencil and paper she was the sad central figure of a great romance full of the most melancholy incidents in which troubled atmosphere she sat and suffered for the rest of the evening but she did not think of sammy again till she went to bed then however she was seized anew with the dread of losing him for ever and cried helplessly until she fell asleep for days she mourned for him without daring to go to the window lest she should see him pass by on the other side of the road with scorn and contempt flashing forth from his innocent blue eyes in the evening however she opened the backgate as usual and waited in the woodhouse but he never came and at first she was in despair then she became defiantshe didnt care not she then she grew determined hed have to come back if she chose shed make him but how oh she knew shed just sit still till something came she was sitting on a heap of beech branches opposite the doorway picking off the bronze buds and biting them the blanched skeleton of sammys whiting sad relic of happier moments grinned up at her from the earthen floor outside the old peartree on the left leafless now and motionless showed distinctly in silhouette against the nightsky its bare branches made black bars on the face of the bright white moon which was rising behind it what a strange thing time is day and night day and night week and month spring summer autumn winter always coming and going again while we only come once go and return no more it was getting on for christmas now another year had nearly gone the years slip away steadilyday by daywinter spring winter so cold and wet march all clouds and dustcomes in like a lion goes out like a lamb then april is bright the year slips away steadily slips round the steady year days come and gono no days dawn and disappear winters and springssprings rings sings no leave that winter with cold and rainpain march storms and clouds and pain till april once again light with it brings beth jumped down from the beech boughs ran round to the old wooden pump clambered up by it on to the backkitchen roof and made for the actingroom window it was open and she screwed herself in round the bar and fastened the door it was quite dark under the sloping roof but she found the end of a tallow candle smuggled up there for the purpose lighted it and stuck it on to the top of the rough deal box which formed her writingtable she had a pencil sundry old envelopes carefully cut open so as to save as much of the clean space inside as possible margins of newspapers precious but rare halfsheets and any other scrap of paper on which she could write all carefully concealed in a hole in the roof from which she tore the whole treasure now in her haste winter summer sammy she kept saying to herself autumn autumntinted woodsmy kingministering childrenministeringking moon noon story glory ever never endeavour oh i can do it i can i can slips round the steady year it took her some days to do it to her satisfaction but they were days of delight for the whole time she felt exactly as she had done when first she found sammy she had the same warm glow in her chest the same sort of yearning half anxious half pleasant wholly desirable it was late in the evening when she finished and she had to put her work away in a hurry because her mother sent harriet to tell her she must go to bed but all night long she lay only half asleep and all the time conscious of joy to come in the morning she was up early but had too much selfrestraint to go to the actingroom till lessons were over she was afraid of being disturbed and so having her pleasure spoilt as soon as she could safely lock herself up however she took her treasure out it was written on the precious halfsheets in queer little crabbed characters very distinctly slips round the steady year days dawn and disappear winters and springs march storms and clouds and rain till april once again light with it brings then comes the summer song birds in the woods prolong day into night hot after tepid showers beats down this sun of ours upward the radiant flowers look their delight o summer scents at noon o summer nights and moon season of story labour and love for ever strengthen each hard endeavour now climb we up or never upward to glory winter and summer past autumn has come at last hope in its keeping beauty of tinted wood beauty of tranquil mood harvest of earned good ripe for the reaping thus on a torrid day slipped my fond thoughts away book from thy pages seasons of which i sing are they not like my king thine own lifes ministring in all its stages first in the spring i ween were all thy powers foreseen storms sowed renown then came thy summer climb then came thy goldenprime then came thy harvesttime bringing thy crown when beth had read these lines she doubled the half sheets on which they were written and put them in her pocket deliberately she was sitting on the actingroom floor at the moment near the window now she exclaimed folding her delicate nervous hands on her lap and looking up at the strip of sky above her now i shall be forgiven it was dark at this time when the boys left school in the evening and beth stood at the backgate waiting to waylay sammy he came trotting along by himself and saw her as he approached but did not attempt to escape on the contrary he stopped but he had nothing to say the relief of finding her friendly again was too great for words had she looked out she might have seen him any day since the event brighteyed and rosycheeked as usual prowling about anxious to obtain a reassuring smile from her on his way to and from school it was not likely that he would lose the credit of being beth caldwells sweetheart if he could help it just because she beat him already he had suffered somewhat in prestige because he had not been seen with her so often lately and he had been quite as miserable in his own way under the impression that she meant to cast him off as she had in hers come in sammy she cried catching hold of his hand come in ive something to show you but its too cold to sit in the woodhouse and we cant have a light there either come up by the pump to the actingroom ive fastened the door inside and nobody can get in come ill show you the way sammy followed her obediently and in silence although somewhat suspiciously as usual but she piloted him safely and once in the actingroom with the candle lighted he owned that it was jolly sammy i have been sorry beth began ive been quite miserable aboutyou know what it was horrid of me i told you scratchcats were horrid said sammy solemnly but ive done something to atone beth proceeded something came to me all about you you shall have it sammy to keep just listen and ill read it sammy listened with his mouth and eyes open but when she had done he shook his head you didnt make that up yourself he said decidedly o sammy yes i did beth protested taken aback and much pained no i dont believe you said sammy you got it out of a book youre always trying to stuff me up im not stuffing you sammy said beth suddenly flaming i made it myself every word of it i tell you it came to me its my own youve got to believe it sammy looked about him there was no escape by the door because that led into the house and beth was between him and the window with her brown hair dishevelled and her big eyes burning well he said a politic desire to conciliate struggling with an imperative objection to be stuffed of course you made it yourself if you say so but its all rot anyway the words slipped out unawares and the moment he uttered them he ducked his head but nothing happened then he looked up at beth and found her gazing hard at him and as she did so the colour gradually left her cheeks and the light went out of her eyes slowly she gathered up her papers and put them into the hole in the roof then she sat on one of the steps which led down into the room but she said nothing sammy sat still in a tremor until the silence became too oppressive to be borne then he fidgeted then he got up and looked longingly towards the window i shall be late he ventured beth made no sign when shall i see you again he recommenced deprecatingly will you be at the backgate tomorrow no she said shortly its too cold to wait for you then how shall i see you he asked with a blank expression beth reflected oh just whistle as you pass she said at last in an offhand way and ill come out if i feel inclined the next evening mrs caldwell was taking her accustomed nap after dinner in her armchair by the fire in the diningroom and beth was sitting at the table dreaming when she was suddenly startled by a long loud shrill whistle another and another of the most piercing quality followed in quick succession swiftly but cautiously she jumped up and slipped into the drawingroom which was all in darkness there were outside shutters to the lower windows but the drawingroom ones were not closed so she looked out and there was sammy standing with his innocent fat face as close to the diningroom shutters as he could hold it with his fingers in his mouth uttering shrill whistles loud and long and hard and fast enough to rouse the whole neighbourhood beth impatient of such stupidity returned to the diningroom and sat down again leaving sammy to his fate presently mrs caldwell started wide awake what is that noise beth she exclaimed it seems to be somebody whistling outside beth answered in deep disgust then her exasperation got the better of her selfcontrol and she jumped up and ran out to the kitchen harriet she said between her clenched teeth go out and send that silly fool away harriet hastened to obey but at the opening of the front door sammy bolted the next evening he began again however as emphatically as before but beth could not stand such imbecility a second time so she ran out of the backgate and seized sammy what are you doing there she cried shaking him why you told me to whistle sammy remonstrated much aggrieved did i tell you to whistle like a railway engine beth demanded scornfully youve no sense at all sammy go away oh do lets come in beth sammy pleaded ive something to tell you what is it said beth ungraciously ill tell you if youll let me come in well come then beth answered impatiently and led the way up over the roof to the actingroom what is it she again demanded when she had lighted a scrap of candle and seated herself on the steps i dont believe its anything yes it is so there said sammy triumphantly but ill lay you wont guess what it is mrs barnes has got a baby mrs barnes was the wife of the headmaster of the mansionhouse school and all the little boys feeling that there was more in the event than had been explained to them were vaguely disgusted i dont call that anything beth answered contemptuously lots of people have babies well said sammy i wouldnt have thought it of him thought what of whom beth snapped in a tone which silenced sammy he ventured to laugh however dont laugh in that gigantic way sammy she exclaimed still more irritated when you throw back your head and open your mouth so wide i can see you have no wisdomteeth youre always nasty now beth sammy complained which was true love waning becomes critical beths own feeling for sammy had been a strong mental stimulant at first and in her enjoyment of it she had overlooked all his shortcomings there was nothing in him however to keep that feeling alive and it had gradually died of inanition his slowness and want of imagination first puzzled and then provoked her and littleboylike he had not even been able to respond to such tenderness as she showed himnot that she had ever showed him much tenderness for they were just like boys together she had kissed him however once or twice after a quarrel to make it up but she did not like kissing him little boys are rank his pretty colouring was all that he had had to attract her and that alas had lost its charm by this time for a little longer she looked out for him and troubled about him then let him go graduallyso gradually that she never knew when exactly he lapsed from her life altogether chapter xx for two years after beth was outlawed by her mother greataunt victoria bench was her one link with the civilised world the intimacy had lapsed a little while sammy was the prevailing human interest in beths life but gradually as he ceased to be satisfactory she returned to the old lady and hovered about her seeking the sustenance for which her poor little heart ached on always and for want of which her busy brain ran riot and the old lady who had not complained of beths desertion welcomed her back in a way which showed that she had felt it for greataunt victoria bench was lonely in the days of her poverty and obscurity since the loss of her money there had been a great change in the attitude of most of her friends towards her and such attentions as she received were of a very different kind from those to which she had been accustomed mrs caldwell had been the most generous to her for at the time that she had offered aunt victoria a home in her house she had not known that the old lady would be able to pay her way at all fortunately aunt victoria had enough left for that but still her position in mrs caldwells house was not what it would have been had she not lost most of her means mrs caldwell was not aware of the fact but her manner had insensibly adjusted itself to aunt victorias altered circumstances her care and consideration for her being as much reduced in amount as her income and aunt victoria felt the difference but said nothing slowly and painfully she learnt to realise that it was for what she had had to bestow and not for what she was that people used to care they had served her as they served their god in the hope of reaping a rich reward like many other people with certain fine qualities of their own aunt victoria knew that there was wickedness in the outside world but never suspected that her own immediate circle the nice people with whom she talked pleasantly every day could be tainted and the awakening to find that her friends cared less disinterestedly for her than she did for them was a cruel disillusion her first inclination was to fly far from them all and spend the rest of her days amongst strangers who could not disappoint her because she would have nothing to expect of them and who might perhaps come to care for her really long hours she sat and suffered shut up in her room considering the matter yearning to go but restrained by the fear that as an old woman she would be unwelcome everywhere in aunt victorias day old people were only too apt to be selfish tyrannical narrow and ignorant a terror to their friends and they were nearly always ill the old men from lives of selfindulgence and the old women from unwholesome restraint of every kind now we are beginning to ask what becomes of the decrepit old women there are so few to be seen this is the age of youthful grandmothers capable of enjoying a week of their lives more than their own grandmothers were able to enjoy the whole of their declining years their vitality is so much greater their appearance so much better preserved their knowledge so much more extensive their interests so much more varied and their hearts so much larger aunt victoria nowadays would have struck out for herself in a new direction she would have gone to london joined a progressive womens club made acquaintance with work of some kind or another and never known a dull moment for she would have been a capable woman had any one of her faculties been cultivated to some useful purpose but as it was she had nothing to fall back upon she was just like a domestic animal like a dog that has become a member of the family and is tolerated from habit even after it grows old and because remarks would be made if it were put out of the way before its time and she had been content with the position so long as much was made of her now however all too late a great yearning had seized upon her for an object in life for some pursuit some interest that would remain to her when everything else was lost and she prayed to god earnestly that he would show her where to go and what to do or give her somethingsomething which at last resolved itself into something to live for then one day there came a little resolute tap at the door and beth walked in without waiting to be asked and seeing in a moment with that further faculty of hers into the old ladys heart that it was sad she went to her impulsively and laid her unkempt brown head against her arm in an awkward caress which touched the old lady to tears beth was lonely too thought aunt victoria a strange lonely little being neglected illused and misunderstood and the question flashed through the old ladys mind if she left the child what would become of her the tangled brown head warm against her arm nestled nearer and aunt victoria patted it protectingly do you want anything beth she asked no aunt victoria i just wanted to see you i was lying on the seesaw board looking up through the leaves and i suddenly got a fancy that you were here all by yourself and that you didnt like being all by yourself i feel like that sometimes so i came to see you thank you beth said aunt victoria with her hand still on beths head as if she were blessing her and when she had spoken she looked up through the window and silently thanked the lord this was the sign he had committed beth to her care and affection and she was not to think of herself but of the child whose need was certainly the greater of the two have you nothing to do beth she said after a pause no aunt victoria beth answered drearilyat least there are plenty of things i could do but everything i think of makes me shudder i feel so sometimes do you there isnt a single thing i want to do today ive tried one thing after the other but i cant think about what im doing sometimes i like to sit still and do nothing but today i dont even like that i think i should like to be asked to do something if i could do something for you nowsomething to help you well you can beth aunt victoria answered after sitting rigidly upright for a moment blinking rapidly help me to unpick an old gown i am going to make another like it and want it unpicked for a pattern can you make a gown beth asked in surprise aunt victoria smiled then she took down an old black gown that was hanging behind the door and handed it to beth with a pair of sharp scissors ill undo the body part beth said and that will save your eyes i dont think this gown owes you much i do not understand that expression beth said aunt victoria dont you said beth working away with the scissors cheerfully harriet always says that when shes got all the good there is to be got out of anythingthe dusters you know or the dishcloth i once did a piece of unpicking like this for mamma and she didnt explain properly or somethingat all events i took out a great deal too much so she dont call your mamma she she is the cat mamma then mamma beat me dont say she beat you i said mamma well dont talk about your mamma beating you that is not a nice thing to talk about its not a nice thing to do either said beth judicially and i never used to talk about it didnt like to you know but now shemammadoesnt beat me any moreat least only sometimes when she forgets ah then you have been a better girl no not betterbigger you see if i struck her back again she wouldnt like it beth beth strike your mother that was the danger said beth in her slow distinct imperturbable way one day she made me so angry i very nearly struck her and i told her so that made her look queer i can tell you and shes never struck me sinceexcept in a halfhearted sort of way or when she forgot and that didnt count of course but i think i know now how it was she used to beat me i did just the same thing myself one day i beat sammy who is sammy said aunt victoria looking over her spectacles sammy lee you know aunt victoria recollected and felt she should improve the occasion but was at a loss for a moment what to say she was anxious above everything that beth should talk to her freely for how could she help the child if she did not know all she had in her mind it is upon the things they are never allowed to mention that children brood unwholesomely i thought that you were not allowed to know sammy lee she finally observed no more i was beth answered casually yet you knew him all the same aunt victoria ventured reproachfully aunt victoria said beth did the lord die for sammy yeyes said aunt victoria hesitating not because she doubted the fact but because she did not know what use beth would make of it then why cant i know him beth asked oh bebecause sammy does not live as if he were grateful to the lord if he did would he be a gentleman beth asked yes aunt victoria answered decidedly beth stopped snipping and looked at her as if she were looking right through her and out into the world beyond then she pursed up her mouth and shook her head that wont hold water she said if a man must live like the lord to be a gentleman what is uncle james and if living like the lord makes a man a gentleman why dont we call on old job fisher aunt victoria began to fear that the task she had undertaken would prove too much for her it is hard very hard she muttered well never mind said beth resuming her work when i grow up i mean to write about things like that but what were we talking about oh beating sammy i did feel bad after i beat him and i vowed id never do it again however tiresome he was and i never did it makes it easier if you vow its just as if your hands were tied then id like to tell mamma to try it only shed be sure to get waxy you tell her aunt victoria aunt victoria made some reply which was lost in the noise of vehicles passing in the street followed by the tramp of many feet and a great chattering an excursion train had just arrived and the people were pouring into the place beth ran to the window and watched them more confounded trippers she ejaculated they spoil the summer swarming everywhere beth i wish to please me you would make another vow dont say confounded trippers all right aunt victoria jim says it but i know all the bad words in the language were made for the men i suppose because they have all the bad thoughts and do all the bad things i shall say objectionable excursionists in future she went to the door im just going to get something she said you wont go away now will you i shall be a minute or two but i want you to be here when i come back i shall be wild if youre not she banged the door after her and ran downstairs aunt victoria looked round the room it no longer seemed the same place to her beths cheerful chatter had already driven away the evil spirit of dejection and taken the old lady out of herself untidy child she had left her work on the floor her scissors on the bed disarranged the windowcurtain and upset a chair if she would not do any more unpicking when she returned she must be made to put things straight there was one little easychair in the room aunt victoria sat down in it a great piece of selfindulgence for her at that time of day folded her hands and closed her weary old eyes just to give them a rest while a nice little look of content came into her face which it was good to see there when she opened her eyes again beth was setting a tray on a tiny table beside her i think youve been having a nap miss greataunt victoria bench she said now have some tea and buttered toast o beth cried the old lady beaming how could youat this time of day well to please you it is quite delicious so refreshing what another piece of toast must i take another you must take it all said beth i made it for you i do like doing things for you aunt victoria it makes me feel nice all over ill just unpick a little more then ill tidy up youre a good child to think of that said aunt victoria i did not think you would didnt you said beth how funny but i like things tidy i often tidy up ii suppose harriet says tidy up the old lady observed gently not liking to be censorious at this happy moment of relaxation but still anxious to do her duty beth understood her perfectly and smiled i like you to tell me when i say things wrong she said and i like to know how harriet talks too you cant write if you dont know how every one talks what are you going to write aunt victoria asked taking up another piece of buttered toast oh books beth answered casually write something soulsustaining then beth said aunt victoria try to make all you say soulsustaining and never use a word you would be ashamed to hear read aloud you mean like those things they read in church said beth i dont think i ever could use such words when mr richardson comes close to them i get hot all over and hate him but i promise you aunt victoria i will never write anything worse than there is in the bible theres a man called ruskin who writes very well they say and he learnt how to do it from reading the bible his mother taught him when he was a little boy just as you taught me i always read the biblesearch the scripturesevery day you say its a sacred book dont you aunt victoria harriet says its smutty says what aunt victoria exclaimed sitting bolt upright in her horror what does she mean by such an expression oh she just means stories like joseph and potiphars wife david and bathsheba susanna and the elders my dear child aunt victoria gasped well aunt victoria theyre all in the bible at least susanna and the elders isnt thats in the apocrypha aunt victoria sat silent a considerable time at last she said solemnly beth i want you to promise me one thing solemnly and that is that all your life long whatever may be before you whatever it may be your lot to learn you will pray to god to preserve your purity what is purity said beth aunt victoria hesitated its a condition of the mind which keeps us from ever doing or saying anything we should be ashamed of she finally decided but what kind of things beth asked unfortunately aunt victoria was not equal to the occasion she blinked her eyes very hard sipped some tea and left beth to find out for herself according to custom we must only talk about nice things she said well i shouldnt care to talk nastily about people as lady benyon does sometimes beth rejoined but my dear child that is not a nice thing to say about lady benyon isnt it said beth then added oh dear how funny things are meaning how complicated where did you get this tea beth said aunt victoria it is very good and i feel so much the better for it i thought you wanted something said beth your face went all queer that means people want something i got the tea out of the storecupboard it has a rotten lock if you shake it it comes open but what does your mamma say oh she never notices or if she does she thinks she left it open herself harriet has a little sometimes she takes it because she says mamma should allow her a quarter of a pound of dry tea a week so it isnt stealing and i took it for you because you pay to live here so youre entitled to the tea i dont take it for myself of course but im afraid i oughtnt to have told you about harriet im so sorry it slipped out it wasnt sneaking but i trust to your honour aunt victoria if you sneaked on harriet i could never trust you again now could i she got up as she spoke folded her work picked up the chair arranged the windowcurtain moved the tray and put the table back in its place at the same time remarking i shall take these things downstairs now and go for a run she left aunt victoria with much to reflect upon the glimpse she had accidentally given the old lady of harriets turpitude had startled her considerably mrs caldwell had always congratulated herself on having such a quiet respectable person in the house as harriet to look after beth and now it appeared that the woman was disreputable both in her habits and her conversation the very last person whom a girl even of such strongly marked individuality as beth should have been allowed to associate with intimately but what ought miss victoria to do if she spoke to mrs caldwell beth would never forgive her and the important thing was not to lose beths confidence but if she did not speak to mrs caldwell would she be doing right of course if mrs caldwell had been a different sort of person her duty would have been clear and easy but as it was aunt victoria decided to wait the next day beth returned of her own accord to finish the unpicking she wanted to know what soulsustaining meant and in ten minutes she had crossquestioned aunt victoria into such a state of confusion that the old lady could only sit silently praying to heaven for guidance at last she got up and took a little packet out of one of her trunks she had to live in her boxes because there was no closet or wardrobe or chest of drawers in the room see beth she said here is some tea and sugar i dont think it nice of you to go to your mothers cupboard without her leave thats rather a servants trick you know and not honest so give it up like a dear child and let us have tea together you and i up here when we want it i very much enjoy a good cup of tea it is so refreshing and you make it beautifully beth changed colour and countenance while aunt victoria was speaking and she sat for some time afterwards looking fixedly at the empty grate then she said you always tell me things nicely aunt victoria thats what i like about you ill not touch the cupboard again i vow and if you catch me at any other servants tricks just you let me know the old ladys heart glowed the lord was showing her how to help the child but the holidays were coming on she would have to go away to make room for the boys and she dreaded to leave beth at this critical time lest she should relapse just as she was beginning to form nice feminine habits for beth had taken kindly to the sewing and teadrinking and long quiet chats it was a delight to her to have some one to wait on and help and talk to im so fond of you aunt victoria she said one day i even like you to snap at me and if we lived quite alone together you and i i should do everything for you would you like to come away with me these holidays said aunt victoria seized suddenly with a bright idea oh wouldnt i said beth but then the expense i think i can manage it if your mamma has no objection said aunt victoria nodding and blinking and nodding again as she calculated i should think mamma would be only too glad to get rid of me said beth hopefully and she was not mistaken chapter xxi the next few weeks in their effect upon beths character were among the most important of her life she did not know until the day before where she was to go with aunt victoria it was the habit of the family to conceal all such arrangements from the children and indeed from each other as much as possible aunt victoria observed that caroline was singularly reticent and mrs caldwell complained that aunt victoria made a mystery of everything it was a hard habit which robbed beth of what would have been so much to her something to look forward to since she knew that she was to go somewhere however she had lived upon the idea her imagination had been busy trying to picture the unknown place and her mind full of plans for the comfort of aunt victoria it was after breakfast one day while her mother and aunt victoria were still at table that the announcement was made you need not do any lessons this morning children mrs caldwell said beth is going to harrowgate with aunt victoria tomorrow and i must see to her things and get them packed aunt victoria looked round at beth with a carefully restrained smile expecting some demonstration of joy beth was standing in the window looking out and turned with a frown of intentness on her face when her mother mentioned harrowgate as if she were trying to recall something harrowgate she said slowly harrowgate beth do not frown so mrs caldwell exclaimed irritably youll be all wrinkled before youre twenty beth gazed at her solemnly without seeing her then fixed her eyes upon the ground as if she were perusing it and began to walk slowly up and down with her head bent her hands clasped behind her her curly brown hair falling forward over her cheeks and her lips moving what is it youre muttering child aunt victoria asked im trying to think beth rejoined twas in the prime of summer time an evening calm and cool two sudden blows with a ragged stick and one with a heavy stone and yet i feared him all the more for lying there so still i took the dreary body up ah i knowi have it she exclaimed joyfully and with a look of relief harrowgateknaresborothe cave there two sternfaced men set out from lynn through the cold and heavy mist and eugene aram walked between with gyves upon his wrist my dear child said aunt victoria sternly what is it you are trying to say and how often are you to be told not to work yourself up into such a state of excitement about nothing dont you know about eugene aram aunt victoria beth rejoined with concern as if not to know about eugene aram were indeed to have missed one of the great interests of life then she sat down at the table with her elbows resting on it and her delicate oval face framed in her slender hands and gave aunt victoria a graphic sketch of the story from bulwer lytton dear me caroline said aunt victoria greatly horrified is it possible that you allow your children to read such books i read such books to my children myself when i see fit mrs caldwell rejoined i may be allowed to judge what is good for them i suppose good for them aunt victoria ejaculated accounts of murder theft and executions but why not aunt victoria beth put in why not read about eugene aram as well as about barabbas aunt victoria looked so shocked however at the mention of barabbas in this connection that beth broke off and hastened to add for the relief of the old ladys feelingsonly of course barabbas was a sacred sort of thief and that is different on the journey next day a casual remark let fall by a stranger made a curious impression upon beth they were travelling secondclass and aunt victoria talking to another lady in the carriage happened to mention that beth was twelve years old a gentleman the only other passenger who was sitting opposite to beth looked up at her over his newspaper when her age was mentioned and remarkedare you only twelve i should have thought you were older rather nicelooking too only freckled beth felt her face flush hotly and then she laughed nicelooking nicelooking she repeated the words to herself again and again and every time they recurred to her she lost countenance in spite of herself and laughed and flushed being strangely surprised and pleased it was that remark that first brought home to beth the fact that she had a personal appearance at all hitherto she had thought very little of herself the world without had been and always would be much more to her than the world within she was not to be one of those narrow selfcentred morbid beings whose days are spent in introspection and whose powers are wasted in futile efforts to set their own little peculiarities forth in such a way as to make them seem of consequence she never at any time studied her own nature except as a part of human nature and in the hope of finding in herself some clue which would help her to a sympathetic understanding of other people greataunt victoria bench in these days of her poverty lodged with an old servant of the family who gave her for ten shillings a week a bedroom at the top of the house and a little sunny sittingroom on the groundfloor at the back looking out into an oldfashioned garden full of flowers such as knights in olden times culled for their ladies the little sittingroom was furnished with chippendale chairs and a little chippendale sideboard with drawers and a bookcase with glass doors above and a cupboard below in which aunt victoria used to keep her stores of tea coffee sugar and currants in mustardtins beth heard with surprise that the hearthrug was one which aunt victoria had worked herself as a present for prentice when she married prentice was now mrs pearce but aunt victoria always called her prentice the hearthrug was like a turkey carpet only softer deeper and richer aunt victoria had sat on chippendale chairs in her youth and she was happy amongst them when she sat down on one she drew herself up disdaining the stiff back and smiled and felt young again while her memory slipped away to pleasant days gone by and mrs pearce would come and talk to her standing respectfully and reminding her of little things which aunt victoria had forgotten or alluding with mysterious nods and shakings of the head to other things which beth was not to hear about when this happened beth always withdrew she was becoming shy of intruding now and delicate about overhearing anything that was not intended for her and when she had gone on these occasions the two old ladies would nod and smile to each other prentice in respectful approval and aunt victoria in kindly acknowledgment prentice wore a cap and front like aunt victoria but of a subdued brown colour as became her humble station beth took charge of the housekeeping as soon as they arrived made tea arranged the groceries in the cupboard and put the key in her pocket and aunt victoria who was sitting upright on a high chippendale chair knitting and enjoying the dignity of the old attitude after her journey looked on over her spectacles in pleased approval before they went to bed they read the evening psalms and lessons together in the sittingroom and aunt victoria read prayers when they went upstairs they said their private prayers kneeling beside the bed and aunt victoria made beth wash herself in hot water and brush her hair for halfanhour aunt victoria attributed her own slender youthful figure and the delicate texture of her skin to this discipline she said she had preserved her figure by never relaxing into languid attitudes and her complexion by washing her face in hot water with fine white soap every night and in cold water without soap every morning she did not take her fastidious appetite into consideration nor her simple regular life nor the fact that she never touched alcohol in any shape or form nor wore a tight or heavy garment nor lost her selfcontrol for more than a moment whatever happened but beth discovered for herself as she grew older that these and that elevated attitude of mind which is religion whatever the form preferred to express it are essential parts of the discipline necessary for the preservation of beauty in the morning beth made breakfast and when it was over if crusts had accumulated in the cupboard she steeped them in hot milk in a piedish beat them up with an egg a little butter sugar currants and candied peel and some nutmeg grated for a breadpudding which prentice took out to bake for dinner remarking regularly that little miss promised to be helpful to which aunt victoria as regularly responded yes she hoped miss beth would become a capable woman some day after breakfast they read the psalms and lessons together verse by verse and had some good talk as beth called it then aunt victoria got out an old french grammar and phrasebook a copy of telemaque and a pocketdictionary treasured possessions which she always carried about with her and had a kind of pride in french had been her speciality but these were the only french books she had and she certainly never spoke the language she would have shrunk modestly from any attempt to do so thinking such a display almost as objectionable as singing in a loud professional way instead of quietly like a wellbred amateur and showing a lack of that dignified reserve and general selfeffacement which she considered essential in a gentlewoman but she was anxious that beth should be educated and therefore the books were produced every morning mrs caldwell had tried in vain to teach beth anything by rule such as grammar beths memory was always tricky anything she cared about she recollected accurately but grammar which had been presented to her not as a means to an end but as an end in itself failed to interest her and if she remembered a rule she forgot to apply it until aunt victoria set her down to the old french books when simply because the old lady looked pleased if she knew her lesson and disturbed if she did not she began at the beginning of her own accord and worked with a willtoilsomely at first but by degrees with pleasure as she proceeded and felt for the first time the joy of mastering a strange tongue you learnt out of this book when you were a little girl aunt victoria didnt you she said looking up on the day of the first lesson she was sitting on a highbacked chair at one end of the table trying to hold herself as upright as aunt victoria who sat at the other and opposite end to her pondering over her knitting i suppose you hated it no i did not beth aunt victoria answered severely i esteemed it a privilege to be well educated our mother could not afford to have us all instructed in the same accomplishments and so she allowed us to choose french or music or drawing and painting i chose french then how was it grandmamma learned drawing and painting and playing and everything beth asked mamma knows tunes she composed your dear grandmamma was an exceedingly clever girl aunt victoria answered stiffly as if beth had taken a liberty when she asked the question and she was the youngest and desired to learn all we knew so we each did our best to impart our special knowledge to her i taught her french how strange said beth and out of this very book and she is dead and now you are teaching me the feeling in the childs voice and the humble emphasis on the pronoun me touched the old lady something familiar too in the tone caused her to look up quickly and kindly over her spectacles and it seemed to her for a moment as if the little longlost sister sat opposite to hergreat grey eyes delicate skin bright brown hair expression of vivid interest and all strange strange she muttered to herself several times i am supposed to be like grandmamma am i not said beth as if she read her thoughts you are like her aunt victoria rejoined but you can be a plain likeness of a goodlooking person i suppose beth said tentatively certainly you can miss victoria answered with decision and the spark of pleasure in her own personal appearance which had recently been kindled in beth instantly flickered and went out their little sittingroom had a bowwindow down to the ground the front part of which formed two doors with glass in the upper part and wood below leading out into the garden on fine days they always stood wide open and the warm summer air scented with roses streamed in both beth and aunt victoria loved to look out into the garden from where beth sat to do her french at the end of the table she could see the soft green turf a bright flowerborder and an old brick wall mellowed in tone by age behind it and a little to the left a high thick screen of tall shrubs of many varieties set so close that all the different shades of green melted into each other the irregular roof of a large house standing on lower ground than the garden with quaint gables and old chimneys rose above the belt of shrubs the tiles on it lay in layers that made beth think of a wasps nest only that they were darkred instead of grey but she loved the colour as it appeared all amongst the green trees and up against the blue sky she often wondered what was going on under that roof and used to invent stories about it she did not write anything in these days however but stored up impressions which were afterwards of inestimable value to her the smooth grey boles of the beeches the green down on the larches the dark bluegreen crown which the scotch fir held up as if to accentuate the light blue of the sky and the wonderful ruddygold tones that shone on its trunk as the day declined these things she felt and absorbed rather than saw and noted but because she felt them they fired her soul and resolved themselves into poetic expression eventually they dined early and on the hot afternoons they sat and worked together after dinner beth sewing and aunt victoria knitting until it was cool enough to go out aunt victoria was teaching beth how to make some new underclothing for herself to beths great delight all of her old things that were not rags were patches and the shame of having them so was a continual source of discomfort to her but aunt victoria when she discovered the state of beths wardrobe bought some calico out of her own scanty means and set her to work during these long afternoons they had many a conversation that beth recollected with pleasure and profit she often amused and interested the old lady and sometimes she drew from her a serious reprimand or a solemn lecture for both of which she was much the better aunt victoria was severe but she was sympathetic and she was just she seldom praised but she showed that she was satisfied and that was enough for beth and she never scolded or punished only spoke seriously when she was displeased and then beth was overwhelmed one very hot day when they were working together aunt victoria sitting on a highbacked chair with her back to the open doors because the light was too much for her eyes and beth sitting beside her on a lower seat but so that she could look up at her and also out into the garden it occurred to her that once on a time long ago aunt victoria must have been young and she tried artfully to find out first if aunt victoria remembered the fact and secondly what little girls were like at that remote period was your mamma like mine aunt victoria she asked aunt victoria had just made a mistake in her knitting and answered shortly no child when you were all children beth pursued did you play together not much aunt victoria answered grimly did you quarrel my dear child what could put such a notion into your head what did you do then said beth you couldnt have been all the time learning to sit upright on a highbacked chair and i am trying so hard to think what your home was like i wish you would tell me it was not at all like yours aunt victoria replied with emphasis we were most carefully brought up children our mother was an admirable person she lived by rule if one of her children was born at night it was kept in the house until the morning and then sent out to nurse until it was two years old if it was born by day it was sent away at once and didnt greatgrandmamma ever go to see it yes of course twice a year i think said beth reflecting i should like to keep my babies at home i should want to put their little soft faces against mine and kiss them you know your greatgrandmamma did her duty said aunt victoria with grim approval she never let any of us loll as you are doing now beth she made us all sit up as i always do and as i am always telling you to do and the consequence was our backs grew strong and never ached and were you happy beth said solemnly aunt victoria gazed at her vaguely she had never asked herself the question then beth sat with her work on her lap for a little looking up at the summer sky it was an exquisite deep blue just then with filmy white clouds drawn up over it like gauze to veil its brightness the red roofs and gables and chimneys of the old house below the shrubs the dark scotch fir the copperbeech the limes and the chestnut stood out clearly silhouetted against it and beth felt the forms and tints and tones of them all although she was thinking of something else mammas back is always aching she observed at last returning to her work yes that is because she was not so well brought up as we were aunt victoria rejoined she says it is because she had such a lot of children said beth did you ever have any children aunt victoria miss victoria bench let her knitting fall on her lapmydearchild she gasped holding up both her hands in horror oh i forgot said beth only married ladies have children servants have them though sometimes before they are married harriet says and then they call them bad girls grandmamma wasnt as wise as greatgrandmamma i suppose but perhaps greatgrandmamma had a good husband grandpapa was an awful old rip you know aunt victoria stared at her aghast he used to drink beth proceeded lowering her voice and glancing round mysteriously as the old servants at fairholm did when they discussed these things and grandmamma couldnt bear his ways or his language and used to shut herself up in her own room more and more and they never agreed and at last she went quite mad so the saying came true did you never hear the saying why you know her fathers crest was a raven and grandpapas crest was a bee and for generations the families had lived near each other and never been friends and it was said if the blood of the bees and the ravens were ever put in the same bowl it wouldnt mingle do you say if it were or if it was aunt victoria mamma says if it were we were taught to say if it was aunt victoria answered stiffly but your mamma may know better beth thought about this for a minute then set it aside for further inquiry and dispassionately resumed that was a mean trick of uncle jamess but it was rather clever too i should never have thought of it i mean with the fly you know when grandpapa died uncle james got his will and altered it so that mamma mightnt have any money and he put a fly in grandpapas mouth and swore that the will was signed by his hand while there was life in him my dear child said aunt victoria sharply who told you such a preposterous story oh i heard it about the place beth answered casually everybody knows it she took another needleful of thread and sewed on steadily for a little and aunt victoria kept glancing at her meanwhile with a very puzzled expression but what i want to know is why did grandmamma stay with grandpapa if he were or was such a very bad man beth said suddenly because it was her duty said aunt victoria and what was his duty i think beth said the old lady you have done sewing enough for this afternoon run out into the garden beth knew that this was only an excuse not to answer her but she folded her work up obediently observing as she did so however with decision if i ever have a bad husband i shall not stay with him for i cant see what good comes of it your grandmamma had her children to think of said aunt victoria but what good did she do them beth wanted to know she devoted herself to uncle james but she didnt make much of a man of him and she had no influence whatever with mamma mamma was her fathers favourite and he taught her to despise grandmamma because she couldnt hunt and shrieked if she saw things killed i think thats silly myself but its better than being hard of course mamma is worth a dozen of uncle james but beth shrugged her shoulders then added temperately you know mamma has her faults aunt victoria its no use denying it so what good did grandmamma do by staying she just went mad and died if shed gone away and lived as you do she might have been alive and well now ah my dear child said the old lady sorrowfully that never could have been for i have observed that no woman who marries and becomes a mother can ever again live happily like a single woman she has entered upon a different phase of being and there is no return for her there is a weight of meaning in that expression the ties of home it is the ties of home that restrain a loving woman however much she suffers there are the little daily duties that no one but herself can see to and there is always some one who would be worse off if she went there is habit too and there are those small possessions each one with an association of its own perhaps that makes it almost a sacred thing but above all there is hopethe hope that matters may mend and fearthe fear that once she deserts her post things will go from bad to worse and she be to blame in your grandmammas day such a thing would never have been thought of by a good woman and even now when there are women who actually go away and work for themselves if their homes are unhappy aunt victoria pursed up her lips and shook her head it may be respectable of course she concluded magnanimously but i cannot believe it is either right or wise and certainly it is not loyal loyal beth echoed that was my fathers word to me be loyal weve got to be loyal to others but he also said that we must be loyal to ourselves aunt victoria had folded up her knitting and now rose stiffly and went out into the garden with an old parasol and sat meditating in the sun on the trunk of a tree that had been cut down she often sat so under her parasol and beth used to watch her and wonder what it felt like to be able to look such a long long way back and have so many things to remember chapter xxii aunt victoria was surprised herself to find how kindly beth took to a regular life how exact she was in the performance of her little housekeeping duties and how punctual in everything she had never suspected that beths whole leaning was towards law and order nor observed that even in her most lawless ways there was a certain system that she fished and poached and prowled fought bernadine and helped harriet as regularly as she dined and went to bed habits good or bad may be formed in an incredibly short time if they are congenial the saints by nature will pray and the sinners sin as soon as the example is set them and beth accordingly fell into aunt victorias dainty fastidious ways which were the ways of a gentlewoman at once and without effort and ever afterwards was only happy in her domestic life when she could live by the same rule in an atmosphere of equal refinementan honest atmosphere where everything was done thoroughly and every word spoken was perfectly sincere of course she relapsed many timesit was her nature to experiment to wander before she settled to see for herself but it was by intimacy with lower natures that she learned fully to appreciate the higher by the effect of bad books upon her that she learned the value of good ones by the lowering of her whole tone which came of countenancing laxity in others and by the discomfort and degradation which follow on disorder that she was eventually confirmed in her principles the taste for the higher life once implanted is not to be eradicated and those who have been uplifted by the glory of it once will strive to attain to it again inevitably it was through the influence of this time that the most charming traits in beths character were finally developedtraits which but for the tender discipline of the dear old aunt might have remained latent for ever it would be misleading however to let it be supposed that beths conduct was altogether satisfactory during this visit on the contrary she gave miss victoria many an anxious moment for although she did all that the old lady required of her she did many other things besides things required of her by her own temperament only she had to climb the great tree at the end of the lawn for instance in order to peep into the nest near the top and also to see into the demesne beyond the belt of shrubs where the redroofed house stood peopled now by friends of her fancy this would not have been so bad if she had come down safely but a branch broke and she fell and hurt herself which alarmed miss victoria very much then miss victoria used to send her on errands to develop her intelligence but beth invariably lost herself at first if she only had to turn the corner she could not find her way back aunt victoria tried to teach her to note little landmarks in her own mind as she went along such as the red pillarbox at the corner of the street where she was to turn and the green shutters on the house where she was to cross and beth noticed these and many more things carefully as she went and could describe their position accurately afterwards but by the time she turned the vision and the dream would be upon her as a rule and she would walk in a world of fancy utterly oblivious of red pillarboxes green shutters or anything else on earth until she was brought up wondering by a lamppost tree or some unoffending person with whom she had collided in her abstraction then she would have to ask her way but she was slow to find it by direction and all the time she was wandering about aunt victoria would be worrying herself with fears for her safety until she was quite upset beth was rebellious too about some things there was a grocery shop at one end of the street kept by a respectable woman but beth refused to go to it because the respectable woman had a fussy little pomeranian dog and allowed it to lick her hands and face all over which so disgusted beth that she could not eat anything the woman touched it was in this shop that beth picked up the moribund black beetle that kicked out suddenly and set up the horror of crawling things from which she ever afterwards suffered this was another reason for not going back to the shop but aunt victoria could not understand it and insisted on sending her beth was firmly naughty in the matter however and would not go greatly to the old ladys discomposure one means of torture unconsciously devised by aunt victoria tried beth extremely aunt victoria used to send her to church alone on sunday afternoons to hear a certain eloquent preacher and required her to repeat the text and tell her what the whole sermon was about on her return beth did her best but if she managed to remember the text by repeating it all the time she could not attend to the sermon and if she attended to the sermon she invariably forgot the text it was another instance of the trickishness of her memory she could have remembered both the text and sermon without an effort had she not been afraid of forgetting them but the thing that gave her aunt most trouble of mind was beths habit of making acquaintance with all kinds of people it was vain to warn her and worse than vain for the reasons aunt victoria gave her for not knowing people only excited her interest in them and she would wait about watching to see for herself studying their habits with the patient pertinacity of a naturalist the drawingroom floor was let to a lady whose husband was at sea a mrs crome she was very intimate with a gentleman who also lodged in the house a friend of her husbands she said who had promised to look after her during his absence their bedrooms adjoined and beth used to see their boots outside their doors every morning when she went down to breakfast and wonder why they got up so late out again together nearly all last night prentice remarked to aunt victoria one morning and then they shook their heads but agreed that there was nothing to be done from this and other remarks however beth gathered that mrs crome was going to perdition and from that time she had a horrid fascination for beth who would gaze at her whenever she had an opportunity with great solemn eyes dilated as if she were learning her by heartas indeed she wasinvoluntarily for future reference for mrs crome was one of a pronounced type as beth learnt eventually when she knew the world better an example which helped her to recognise other specimens of the kind whenever she met them she scraped acquaintance with mrs crome on the stairs at last and was surprised to find her as kind as could be and was inclined to argue from this that prentice and aunt victoria must be mistaken about her but one evening mrs crome tempted her into the drawingroom the gentleman was there smoking a cigar and drinking whiskyandwater and there was something in the whole aspect and atmosphere of the room that made beth feel exceedingly uncomfortable and wish she was out of it immediately arent you very dull with that old lady said mrs crome i suppose she never takes you to the theatre or anything no said beth she does not approve of theatres then i suppose she doesnt approve of me mrs crome observed goodnaturedly no said beth solemnly she does not mrs crome burst out laughing and so did the gentleman this is rich really he said what a quaint little person oh but shes sweet said mrs crome and then she kissed beth and beth noticed that she had been eating onions and for long afterwards she associated the smell with theatres frivolous talk and a fairhaired woman smiling fatuously on the brink of perdition aunt victoria retired early to perform her evening ablutions and on this occasion she had gone up just as usual with a little bell which she rang when she was ready for beth to come in the midst of the talk and laughter in the drawingroom the little bell suddenly sounded emphatically and beth fled she found aunt victoria out on the landing in her petticoat and dressingjacket and without her auburn front a sign of great perturbation she had heard beths voice in the drawingroom and proceeded to admonish her severely but beth heard not a word for the sight of the old ladys stubbly white hair had plunged her into a reverie and already when the vision and the dream were upon her no indian devotee absorbed in contemplation could be less sensitive to outward impressions than beth was aunt victoria had to shake her to rouse her what are you thinking of child she demanded riding to the rescue beth answered dreamily dont talk nonsense said aunt victoria beth gazed at her with a blank look she was saving souls just then and could attend to nothing else beths terror of the judgment never returned but after she had been away from home a few weeks she began to have another serious trouble which disturbed her towards evening in the same way the first symptom was a curious lapse of memory which worried her a good deal she could not remember how much of the garden was to be seen from her mothers bedroom window at home and she longed to fly back and settle the question then she became conscious of being surrounded by the country on every side and it oppressed her to think of it she was a seachild living inland for the first time and there came upon her a great yearning for the sight and sound of moving waters she sniffed the landbreeze and found it sweet but insipid in her nostrils after the tonic freshness of the seaair she heard the voice of her beloved in the sough of the wind among the trees and it made her inexpressibly melancholy her energy began to ebb she did not care to move about much but would sit silently sewing by the hour together outwardly calm inwardly all an ache to go back to the sea she used to wonder whether the tide was coming in or going out wonder if the fish were biting how the sands looked and who was on the pier she devoured every scrap of news that came from home in the hope of finding something to satisfy her longing bernadine wrote her an elaborate letter in large hand which beth thought very wonderful harriet sent her a letter also chiefly composed of moral sentiments copied from the family herald with a view to producing a favourable impression on miss victoria and mrs caldwell wrote regularly once a week a formal dutyletter but a joy to beth to whom letters of any kind were a new and surprising experience she had never expected that any one would write to her and in the first flush of her gratitude she responded with enthusiasm sending her mother in particular long descriptions of her life and surroundings which mrs caldwell thought so good she showed them to everybody in replying to beth however she expressed no approval or pleasure on the contrary she put beth to shame by the way she dwelt on her mistakes in spelling which effectually checked the outpourings and shut beth up in herself again so that she mourned the more during the day she kept up pretty well but towards twilight always her time of trial the yearning for home for mamma for harriet for bernadine began again the most gloomy fears of what might be happening to them in her absence possessed her and she had great difficulty in keeping back her tears aunt victoria noticed her depression but mistook it for fatigue and sent her to bed early which beth was glad of because she wanted to be alone and cry but one evening when she was looking particularly sad the old lady asked if she did not feel well yes i feel quite well thank you aunt victoria beth answered with a great sigh but i know now what you meant about hometies they do pull strong ah said aunt victoria enlightened you are homesick are you and from that day forward when she saw beth moping she took her out of herself by making her discuss the subject and so relieved her but beth continued to suffer although less acutely until her return chapter xxiii rainharbour was not yet deserted by summer visitors although it was late in the autumn when beth and aunt victoria returned it had been such a lovely season that the holiday people lingered loath to leave the freshness of the sea and the freedom of the shore for the stuffy indoor duties and the conventional restrictions of their town lives on the day of their arrival beth looked about her in amaze she had experienced such a world of change in herself since she went away that she was surprised to find the streets unaltered and yet although they were unaltered they did not look the same it was as if the focus of her eyes had been readjusted so as to make familiar objects seem strange and change the perspective of everything which gave the place a different air a look of having been swept and garnished and set in order like a toytown but the people they passed were altogether unchanged and this seemed stranger still to beth there they had been all the time walking about as usual wearing the same clothes thinking the same thoughts they had had no new experiences and what was worse they were not only unconscious of any that she might have had but were profoundly indifferent and to beth on the threshold of life all eager interest in everything caring greatly to know and ready to sympathise this vision of the selfcentred with shrivelled hearts was terrible it gave her the sensation of being the one living thing that could feel in a world of automata moved by machinery bernadine and her mother had met them at the station but beth was so busy looking about her collecting impressions she had hardly a word to say to either of them mrs caldwell set this down as another sign of want of proper affection but aunt victoria grumped that it was nothing but natural excitement the first thing beth did after greeting harriet who stood smiling at the door was to run upstairs to her mothers bedroom to settle the question of how much of the garden was visible from the window and then she rushed on up to the attic dragged a big box under the skylight in hot haste and climbed up on it to look at the sea it was the one glimpse of it to be had from the house just a corner where the water washed up against the white cliffs that curved round an angle of the bay beth flung the skylight open and gazed then drew in her breath with a great sigh of satisfaction the sea the sea even that glimpse of it was refreshing as a long cool drink to one exhausted by heat and cruelly athirst while she was away beth had made many good resolutions about behaving herself on her return aunt victoria had talked to her seriously on the subject beth could be good enough when she liked she did all that her aunt expected of her why could she not do all that her mother expected beth promised she would and was beginning already to keep her promise faithfully by being as troublesome as possible which was all that her mother ever expected of her whether or not thoughts are things which have power to produce effects there are certainly people who answer to expectation with fatal facility and beth was one of them eventually she resisted with all her own individuality but at this time she acted like an instrument played upon by other peoples minds this peculiar sensitiveness she turned to account in after life using it as a key to character she had merely to make herself passive when she found herself reflecting the people with whom she conversed involuntarily and not as they appeared on the surface but as they actually were in their inmost selves in her childhood she unconsciously illustrated the thoughts people had in their minds about her aunt victoria believed in her and trusted her and when they were alone together beth responded to her good opinion mrs caldwell expected her to be nothing but a worry and was not disappointed when beth was in the same house with both aunt and mother she varied answering to the expectation that happened to be strongest at the moment that afternoon aunt victoria was tired after her journey and did not think of beth at all but mrs caldwell was busy in her own mind anticipating all the trouble she would have now beth was back and beth standing on the box under the attic skylight with her head out straining her eyes to seaward was seized with a sudden impulse which answered to her mothers expectation that first day she ought to have stayed in unpacked her box exhibited her beautiful needlework got ready for dinner in good time and proved her affection for her mother and sister by making herself agreeable to them but instead of that she stole downstairs slipped out by the backgate and did not return until long after dinner was over she did not enjoy the scamper however her homesickness was gone but her depression returned nevertheless as the day declined only in another form she had still that curious sensation of being the only living thing in a world of figures moved by mechanism she stood at the top of the steps which led down on to the pier where the sailors loitered at idle times and was greeted by those she knew with slow smiles of recognition but she had nothing to say to any of them the tide was going out and had left some of the ships in the harbour all canted to one side cobles and pleasureboats rested in the mud a cocklegatherer was wading about in it with his trousers turned up over his knees and his bare legs so thickly coated it looked as if he had black leggings on beth went to the edge of the pier and stood for a few minutes looking down at him she was facing west but the sun was already too low to hurt her eyes on her right the redroofed houses crowded down to the quay irregularly fishingnets were hanging out of some of the windows here and there down in the harbour the rich brown sails had been hoisted on some of the cobles to dry there were some yachts at anchor and beth looked at them eagerly hoping to find count bartahlinskys seagull amongst them it was not there but presently she became conscious of some one standing beside her and on looking up she recognised black gard the counts confidential man he was dressed like the fishermen in drab trousers and a dark blue jersey but wore a blue cloth cap with the name of the yacht on it instead of a souwester has your master returned she said no miss he answered hes still abroad hell be back for the hunting though i doubt it said beth resentful of that vague abroad which absorbed him into itself the greater part of the year when she had spoken she turned her back on gard and the sunset and wandered off up the cliffs she had noticed a sickly smell coming up from the mud in the harbour and wanted to escape from it but somehow it seemed to accompany her it reminded her of somethingno that was not it what she was searching about in her mind for was some way not to name it but to express it she felt there was a formula for it within reach but for some time she could not recover it then she gave up the attempt and immediately afterwards she suddenly said to herself the smell of death came reeking from those spicy bowers and man the sacrifice of man mingled his taint with every breath upwafted from the innocent flowers she did not search for any occult meaning in the lines nor did they convey anything special to her but they remained with her for the rest of the day haunting her in among her other thoughts and forcing themselves upon her attention with the irritating persistency of a catchy tune on the cliffs she paused to look about her it was a desolate scene the tide was so far out by this time it looked as if there were more sand than sea in the bay the water was the cloudy grey colour of flint with white rims where the waves broke on the shore the sky was low level and dark where it met the water there was a heavy bank of cloud from which an occasional flash of summer lightning dimmed by daylight shot along the horizon the air was peculiarly clear so that distant objects seemed nearer than was natural the sheltering headland on the left which formed the bay stood out bright white with a crown of vivid green against the sombre sea and sky while on the right the old grey pier which shut in the view in that direction and the redroofed houses of the town crowding down to it showed details of design and masonry not generally visible to the naked eye from where beth stood there were neither ships nor boats in the bay but a few cobles with their redbrown sails flapping limp against their masts rocked lazily at the harbourmouth waiting for the tide to rise and float them in beth heard the men on them shouting an occasional remark to one another and now and then one of them would sing an uncouth snatch of song but the effort was spiritless and did not last leaving the harbour behind beth walked on towards the headland presently she noticed in front of her the dignified and pathetic figure of an old man a roman catholic priest canon hunter who sacrificing all worldly ease or chance of advancement had come to minister to the neglected fisherfolk on the coast most of whom were roman catholics he led the life of a saint amongst them living in dire poverty his congregation being all of the poorest with the exception of one lady in the neighbourhood married to a man whose vices were too expensive to leave him much to spare for his wifes charities she managed however to raise enough money for the rent of the top room in the public hall which they used as a chapel and so kept the flickering flame of the old religion alight in the place but it was a severe struggle it was whispered indeed that more of the gentry in the neighbourhood sympathised with the catholics than was supposed and would have helped them but for the discreditdid help them in fact when they dared but no one outside the communion knew how true this report might be and the fisherfolk loyally held their peace it was natural that beth as she grew up should be attracted by the mystery that surrounded the roman catholics and anxious to comprehend the horror that protestants had of them she knew more of them herself than any of the people whom she heard pass uncharitable strictures upon them and knew nothing for which they could justly be blamed for the old priest himself she had a great reverence she had never spoken to him but had always felt strongly drawn towards him and now when she overtook him her impulse was to slip her hand into his less on her own account however than to show sympathy with him he seemed so solitary and so suffering with his slow step and bent back and so good with his beautiful calm face as she approached lost in her own thoughts she gazed up at him intently what is it my child he asked with a kindly smile can i do anything for you i was thinking of the beauty of holiness beth answered and passed on the old man looked after her too surprised for the moment to speak and by the time he had recovered himself she had turned a corner and was out of sight after beth went home that evening and had been duly reproached by her mother for her selfish conduct she stole upstairs to aunt victorias room and found the old lady sitting with her big bible on her knee looking very sad and serious beth she said severely have you had any food it is long past your dinnertime and it does not do for young girls to fast too long ill go and get something to eat aunt victoria beth answered meekly overcome by her kindness i forgot she went down to the pantry and found some cold pie which she took into the kitchen and ate without appetite the heat was oppressive all the doors and windows stood wide open but there was no air and wherever beth went she was haunted by the sickly smell which she had first perceived coming up from the mud in the harbour and by the lines which seemed somehow to account for it the smell of death came reeking from those spicy bowers and man the sacrifice of man mingled his taint with every breath upwafted from the innocent flowers when she had eaten all she could she went back to aunt victoria shall we read the psalms she said yes dear the old lady answered i have been waiting for you a long time beth aunt victoria i am very sorry beth protested i didnt think ah beth the old lady said sorrowfully how often is that to be your excuse you are always thinking but it is only your own wild fancies that occupy you when will you learn to think of others i try always beth answered sincerely but what am i to do when wild fancies come crowding in spite of me and all i ought to remember slips away pray aunt victoria answered austerely prayer shapes a life and those lives are the most beautiful which have been shaped by prayer prayer is creative it transposes intention into action and makes it inevitable for us to be and to do more than would be possible by any other means there was a short silence and then miss victoria began the psalm it was a joy to beth to hear her read she read so beautifully and it was from her that beth herself acquired the accomplishment for which she was afterwards noted verse by verse they read the psalms together as a rule and beth was usually attentive but that evening before the end her attention became distracted by a loud ticking and the last word was scarcely pronounced before she exclaimed looking about heraunt victoria what is that ticking i see no clock the old lady looked up calmly but she was very pale you do hear it then she replied it has been going on all day beths heart stood still an instant and in spite of the heat her skin crisped as if the surface of her body had been suddenly sprayed with cold water the death watch she ejaculated the ticking stopped a moment as if in answer to the words and then began again a horrible foreboding seized upon beth oh nono not that she exclaimed shuddering and then all at once she threw herself upon her knees beside aunt victoria clasped her arms round her and burst into a tempest of tears and sobs beth beth my dear child the old lady cried in dismay control yourself it is only a little insect in the wood it may mean nothing it does mean something beth interrupted vehemently i knowi always know the smell of death has been about me all the afternoon but i did not understand although the words were in my mouth when things mean nothing they dont make you feel queerthey dont impress you nine times running you may see a solitary crow or spill the salt or sit down thirteen to table and laugh at all superstitious nonsense then the sign was not for you but the tenth time something will come over you and you wont laugh then be warned and beware i sometimes feel as if i were listening but not with my ears and waiting for things to happen that i know about but not with my head and i try always to understand when i find myself listening but not with my ears and something surely comes and so also when i am waiting for things to happen that i know about but not with my head they do happen only most of the time i know that something is coming but i cannot tell what it is in order to be able to tell exactly i have to hold myself in a certain attitudenot my body you know myselfhold myself in suspense as it were or suspend something in myself stop something push something asidei cant get it into words i cant always do it but when i can then i know who taught you this aunt victoria asked as if she were startled oh no one taught me beth answered i just found myself doing it then i tried to notice how it was done i wanted to be able to do it myself when i liked and it was just as if there were two doors and one had to be shut before i could look out of the otherthe one that is my nose and eyes and ears when that is shut then i know i look out of the other do things come to you so aunt victoria the old lady had taken beths hand and was stroking it and looking at her very seriously no she said shaking her head no things do not come to me like that but although i have only one set of faculties myself my outlook is not so limited by them that i cannot comprehend the possibility of something beyond there are written records of people in olden times who must have possessed some such powersome further faculty such as you describe it may be that it lies latent in the whole race awaiting favourable conditions to develop itself and some few rare beings have come into possession of it already we are complex creaturesbody soul and spirit says the saint and there is spiritual power beth lay hold of that which you perceive in yourself cherish it cultivate it live the life necessary to develop it for be sure it is a great giftit may be a divine one when the old lady stopped beth raised her head and looked about her as if she had just awakened from sleep what were we talking about before that she said oh i knowthe death watch it has stopped the equinoctial gales set in early that year and severely great seas washed away the silver sands which had been the delight of the summer visitors leaving miles of clay exposed at low water to add to the desolation of the scene the bay was full of stormstayed vessels all headed to the wind close reefed and straining at their anchors there were days when the steamers had to steam full speed ahead in order to keep at their berths and then the big sailing ships would drag their anchors and come drifting drifting helplessly towards the shore and have to fly before the gale if they could or take their chance of stranding if the water were low or being battered to bits against the cliffs if the tide were in many a time beth stood among the fishermen watching waiting praying her whole being centred on some hapless crew making for the harbour but almost certain to be carried past there was a chain down the middle of the pier in the winter to prevent people from being washed off and she had stood clinging to this and seen a great ship with one ragged sail fluttering from a broken mast carried before the wind right on to the pierhead which it struck with a crash that displaced great blocks of granite as if they had been spongecakes and when it struck the doomed sailors on its decks sent up an awful shriek to which those on the pier responded then there was a pause beth held her breath and heard nothing but she saw the ship slip back backdown amongst the mountainous waves which sported with it once or twice tossed it up and sucked it down tossed it again then suddenly engulfed it on the water afterwards there were ropes and spars and dark things bobbing like corks but she knew they were men in mortal agony and she found herself shouting encouragement telling them to hold on bravely help was comingthe lifeboat the lifeboat she joined in the sob of excitement too and the cheers of relief when it returned with its crew complete and five poor wretches rescuedonly five out of fifteen but still blessed be god said the old priest for those whom he has received into glory and blessed be his holy name for those whom he deigns to let live beth standing beside him heard the words and wonderingly contrasted him with parson richardson who remained shut up with his fourth wife in his fat living making cent per cent out of his school and heedless of the parish while one so old and feeble as canon hunter stood by his people at all times careless of himself enduring hardship braving danger a man among men in spite of age and weakness by reason of great love the pinch of poverty was severely felt again that winter in the caldwell household beth who was growing rapidly became torpid from excessive selfdenial she tried to do without enough to make it as if there were one mouth less to feed and the privation told upon her her energy flagged when she went out she found it difficult to drag herself home and the exuberant spirit of daring which found expression in naughty enterprises suddenly subsided she poached on principle still for the benefit of the family but the cool confidence born of a sort of inward certainty which is a premonition of success if it is not the power that compels it was wanting and it was as if her own doubts when she set the snares released the creatures from the fascination that should have lured them so that she caught but little the weather too was very severe every one in the house including beth was more or less ill from colds and coughs and aunt victoria suffered especially but none of them complained not even to themselves they just endured they felt for each other however mamma dont you think aunt victoria should have a fire in her room beth said one day i do my dear child mrs caldwell answered tartly but i cant afford the fuel and she cant afford it either i wish i had known that said beth i wouldnt have let her afford to take me away in the summer spending all her money for nothing what a grateful and gracious child you are her mother exclaimed beth went frowning from the room the snow was several feet deep on the ground already and was still falling heavily beth put on her things and stole out her idea being to gather sticks to make a fire for the old lady but after a weary trudge she was obliged to return emptyhanded wet weary and disheartened the sticks were deep down under the snow there were none to be seen o god beth prayed as she stumbled home raising her pinched face to the sombre sky o god save aunt victoria all suffering dont let her feel the cold dear lord dont let her feel it aunt victoria herself was stoical she came down to breakfast every morning and sat up stiffly at the end of the table away from the fire her usual seat eating little and saying little but listening with interest when the others spoke beth watched her waited on her and lay awake at night fretting because there was nothing more to be done for her one stormy night in particular beth could not sleep there was a great gale blowing it came in terrific gusts that shook the house rattled the windows and made the woodwork creak then died away and was followed by an interval of comparative quiet broken by strange mysterious sounds to which beth listened with strained attention unable to account for them one moment it was as if trailing garments swept down the narrow stairs heavy woollen garments that made a soft sort of muffled sound but there was no footfall as of some one walking then there came stifled voices whisperings as of people talking eagerly yet cautiously then there were heavy steps distinct yet slow followed after an interval by the tramp of shuffling feet like those of people carrying an awkward burden and stumbling under it but always before beth could think what the noise meant the gust came again racking her nerves rattling the windows making the doors creak then dying away to be followed by more mysterious sounds but of another character if only there were timeif only they would last long enough i should knowi should understand beth thought full of foreboding she was not frightened only greatly excited something was coming something was going to happen and these were the warnings of that she was certain it was as if she were sensitive to some atmosphere that surrounds an event and becomes perceptible to those whom it concerns if they are of the right temperament to receive the impression when the blast struck the house blotting out the strange sounds which puzzled beth it released her strained attention and had the effect of silence upon her after noise in one of these pauses she wondered if her mother and bernadine in the next bed were asleep mamma she said softly mamma there was no response the gale dropped then beth heard some one coughing hard mamma she said again mamma whats the matter mrs caldwell answered awaking with a start aunt victoria is coughing well my dear child im very sorry but i cant help it and it is hardly enough to wake me for mrs caldwell answered she settled herself to sleep again and the gale raged without but beth remained resting on her elbow not listening so much as straining her attention out into the darkness in an effort to perceive with her further faculty what was beyond the range of her limited senses mamma she exclaimed once more aunt victoria is moaning nonsense beth mrs caldwell rejoined you couldnt possibly hear her if she were there was another little interval then beth jumped out of bed crying as she did so mamma aunt victoria is calling me beth mrs caldwell said rousing herself and speaking sternly get into bed again directly and lie down and go to sleep it is the gale that is making you so nervous put the bedclothes over your head and then you wont hear it beth had been huddling on the first thing she laid hold of in the dark a thick woollen dressinggown of her mothers while she was speaking i shall go and see for myself she replied oh very well said mrs caldwell it wouldnt be you if you didnt upset the whole house for your fancies when you have awakened your aunt and spoilt her night for nothing as you have spoilt mine youll be satisfied beth opened the door and stepped down into darkness unrelieved by the slightest glimmer of light she had to descend some steps and go up some others to get to aunt victorias room and after the first step she felt as if she were floating in some new element not moving of her own accord but borne along confidently without seeing and without feeling her way and as she went she found that the long thick garment she wore was making the same soft muffled sound she had already heard and also that there was no footstep audible she went into aunt victorias room without knocking it struck beth as being intensely cold a candle was burning on the little table beside the bed the old lady was sitting propped up uncomfortably with two thin pillows and a hassock she was breathing with difficulty and showed no surprise when she saw beth enter her lips were moving and beth could see she was mumbling something but she could distinguish no word until she went quite close when she heard her say comfort ye comfort ye my people several times aunt victoria are you ill beth said the old lady looked at her with dim eyes then stretched out her hand to her beth clasped it it was deadly cold i shall light the fire beth said with determination and i shall make you some tea to ease your cough you wont mind if i take the candle a moment to go downstairs and get the things beth was practical enough now the vision and the dream had passed and she was wide awake again using her eyes and requiring a candle before she went downstairs she fetched extra pillows from the spare room and propped aunt victoria up more comfortably then she set to work to light the fire and soon had the kettle boiling as the room began to warm aunt victoria revived a little and smiled on beth for the first time with perfect recognition beth had made her some tea and was giving it to her in spoonfuls is that nice she said delicious the old lady answered the gale was all on the other side of the house so that here in front it was comparatively quiet besides the wind was dying away as the day approached beth put the teacup down when aunt victoria had taken the little she could and sat on the side of the bed holding the old ladys hand and gazing at her intently and as she watched she saw a strange change come over her the darkness was fading from the sky and the light from aunt victorias face beth had seen nothing like this before and yet she had no doubt of what was coming she had known it for days and days she seemed to have known it always shall i go for mamma she asked at last the old lady shook her head beth felt strangely benumbed she thought of rousing harriet to fetch the doctor but she could not move all feeling was suspended except the sensation of waiting this lasted awhile then a lump began to mount in her throat and she had to gulp it down several times poor little girl aunt victoria muttered looking at her in her kindly way beth melted oh what shall i do she whimpered you have been so very good to me youve taught me all the good i know and i have done nothing for younothing but bother you but i love you aunt victoria stay do stay i want to do everything you would like the old lady faintly pressed her hand then made a last great effort to speak bless you beth my dear child she managed to say with great difficulty be comforted you have helped me more than you know in my sore need i was not left comfortless neither will you be may the lord bless you and keep you always amen her head sank upon her breast she seemed to settle down in the bed as if her weight had suddenly grown greater the sombre dawn had broken by this time and by its light beth saw the shadow of death come creeping over the delicate patient face aunt victoria she gasped breathlessly like one in haste to deliver a message before it is too late shall i say lift up your heads o ye gates that was the first thing you taught me the old lady spoke no more but beth saw that she understood the faint flicker of a smile a pleased expression came into her face and settled there beth feeling the full solemnity of the moment got down from the bed and stood beside it holding fast still to the kind old hand that would nevermore caress or help her as if she could keep the dear one near her by clinging to her who shall ascend into the hill of the lord or who shall stand in his holy place she began with a strange vibration in her voice he that hath clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul to vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessing from the lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation lift up your heads o ye gates and be ye lifted up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in beths voice broke here but with a great effort she began again fervently lift up your heads o ye gates even lift them up ye everlasting doors there she stopped for at the words the dear good kind old lady with a gentle sigh as of relief passed from the scene of her sufferings out of this interval of time into the measureless eternity chapter xxiv aunt victoria bench died of failure of the heart the medical man decided and he might have added if the feelings of the family had not had to be considered that the disease was accelerated by privation and cold for days after the event beth was not to be roused she would sit in the tenantless room by the hour together with the dear old aunts great bible on her knee open at some favourite passage thinking of all that ought to have been done to save her and suffering the ache and rage of the helpless who would certainly have done all that could have been done had they had their way again and again her mother fetched her down to the diningroom where there was a fire and tried to reason with her or scolded her for her persistent grief when reasoning produced no effect you must begin your lessons again beth she said to her at last one morning in despair giving you a holiday is doing you no good at all beth went upstairs without a word and brought down the old aunts french books and sat at the diningtable with one of them open before her but the sight of it recalled the happy summer days in the bright little parlour looking out on the trees and flowers and the dear old lady with her delicate face sitting at the end of the table placidly knitting while beth prepared her lesson and the tears welled up in her eyes once more and fell on the yellow pages beth said her mother emphatically you must not go on like this why are you so selfish dont i feel it too yet i control myself you dont feel it as i do beth answered doggedly she was not so much to you when she was here how can you miss her so much now she has gone but you have others to love mrs caldwell remonstrated she was not your nearest relation no but she was the dearest beth replied i may have others to love but she was the one who loved me she never said i had no affection for any one she never said i was selfish and thought of nothing but my own interests if she had to find fault with me she did it so that she made me want to be better she was never unkind she was never unjust and now ive lost her i have no one it is your own fault then said mrs caldwell apt as usual to say the kind of thing with which fatuous parents torment the geniuschild you are so determined not to be like other people that nobody can stand you i am not determined to be unlike other people beth exclaimed turning crimson with rage and pain i want to be like everybody else and i am like everybody else and i am always ready to care for people too if they will let me it isnt my fault if they dont like me it is your fault mrs caldwell rejoined you have an unhappy knack of separating yourself from every one look at your uncle james he can hardly tolerate you hes a fool so that doesnt matter said beth who always dealt summarily with uncle james i cant tolerate him but you cant say i separate myself from aunt grace mary she likes me and shes kind but shes silly and when im with her any time it makes me yawn is that my fault and did i separate myself from kitty did i separate myself from papa do i separate myself from count bartahlinsky have i separated myself from aunt victoriaand who else is there you gave aunt victoria plenty of trouble while she was here mrs caldwell rejoined drily well that is true at all events beth answered in a broken voice and then she bowed her head on the old french grammar and sobbed as if her heart would break mrs caldwell looked up from her work at her from time to time frowning but she was too much ruffled by some of beths remarks to say anything consoling and beth absorbed in her grief lost all consciousness of everything outside herself at last however a kindly hand was laid on her head and some one stroked her hair that is the way she goes on and i dont know what to do with her mrs caldwell was saying come beth rouse yourself she added sharply beth looked up and found that it was aunt grace mary who was stroking her hair poor little body said aunt grace mary as if she were speaking to an infant then added in a sprightly tone come dear come dear wipe your eyes mamma will be here directlymy mammaand uncle james and mr watson what are they coming for said beth oh your mamma knows aunt grace mary answered archly mr watson was poor dear aunt victorias lawyer and he has brought her will and is going to read it to us am i to be sent out of the room beth asked of course said mrs caldwell it isnt a matter for you at all everything is a matter for me that concerned aunt victoria beth rejoined and if lady benyon is to be here i shall stay before mrs caldwell could reply lady benyon herself was ushered into the little room with great deference by uncle james they were followed by a little old gentleman dressed in black with spectacles and a pair of badlyfitting black kid gloves he shook hands with mrs caldwell and then with beth whom he looked at over his spectacles shrewdly uncle james also shook hands and kissed his sister this is a solemn occasion he said with emotion in his voice then he looked at beth and added had she not better go beth sat down beside aunt grace mary with her mouth obstinately set and mrs caldwell afraid of a scene merely shrugged her shoulders helplessly meanwhile the lawyer was blowing his nose wiping his spectacles taking papers out of a pocket at the back of his frockcoat and settling himself at the table you would like this young lady to retire i suppose said uncle james blandly by no means the little old gentleman answered looking up at him over his spectacles and then at beth by no means let the young lady remain aunt grace mary put her arm round beth the lawyer broke the seal unfolded the will and remarked by way of preface the document is in the handwriting of the deceased ahem instantly into every face there came the expression that people wear in church mr watson proceeded to read but in a dry distinct matteroffact tone devoid of all emotion a lawyer reading a will aloud is sure of the interest of his audience and on this occasion it was evident that each member of the little group listened with strained attention but with very different feelings what they gathered was that miss victoria bench spinster being of sound mind did will and bequeath everything of which she might die possessed to her beloved greatniece elizabeth caldwell commonly called beth should beth marry the money was to be settled upon her for her exclusive use the present income from the property about fifty pounds a year was to be devoted to the education of the said elizabeth caldwell commonly called beth uncle jamess jaw dropped during the reading but he stammered when it was over if the investments recover then miss elizabeth caldwell commonly called beth will have an income of between six and seven hundred a year at least said the lawyer smiling aunt grace mary clasped beth close in a spasm of congratulation mrs caldwell burst into tears beth herself with an unmoved countenance perceived the disgust of uncle james her mothers emotion and something like amusement in lady benyons face and she also perceived but at a great distance as it were that there was a dim prospect of some change for the better in her life poor little body said aunt grace mary caressing her rich little body said lady benyon come and kiss me puck and let me congratulate you it is very nice for you beth i am sure said mrs caldwell plaintively holding out her hand to beth as she passed beth accepted this also as a congratulation and stooped and kissed her mother then the lawyer got up and shook hands with her and thereupon uncle james feeling forced for decencys sake to do something observed pointedly i suppose miss victoria bench was quite sane when she made this bequest i should say that your supposition was correct said the lawyer miss victoria bench always seemed to me to be an eminently sane person there was no allusion whatever to uncle james in aunt victorias will she thanked her niece caroline caldwell kindly for the shelter she had given her in her misfortune and hoped that by providing for beth she would relieve her mothers mind of all anxiety about the child to whom she proceeded to state she left all she had in proof of the tender affection she felt for the child and in return for the disinterested love and duty she had received from beth aunt victoria wished beth to have her room when she was gone in order that beth might as she grew up have proper privacy in her life with undisturbed leisure for study reflection and prayer she added that she considered beth a child of exceptional temperament that peculiar care and kindness would be necessary to develop her character but miss victoria hoped prayed and believed that with the help of the excellent abilities with which she had been endowed beth would not only work out her own salvation eventually but do something notable to the glory of god and for the good of mankind beths heart glowed when she heard this passage and ever afterwards when she recalled it she felt strangely stimulated after the last solemn words of the will had been read and the little scene of congratulation had been enacted there was a pause in the proceedings then uncle james remarked in his happiest manner the importance which old ladies attach to their little bequests is only to be equalled by the strength of their sentiments and the grandeur of the language in which they are expressed one would think a principality was being bequeathed to a princess instead of a few pounds to an obscure little girl to judge by the tone of the whole document well well beth looked at him then drew down the corners of her mouth impertinently there is one thing i can console you with uncle james she said you may be quite sure that when i do come into my kingdom i shall carefully conceal the fact that i am any relation of yours later in the day beth found her mother sitting in her accustomed place by the diningtable rocking herself sideways over her work and with a worried expression of countenance as if she were uneasy in her mind arent you pleased mamma said beth that i should be left the money why yes of course my dear child mrs caldwell rejoined her tone to beth had altered very much since the morning even in a few short hours beth had been made to feel that mere money was making her a person of more importance than she had ever before been considered her mother had stopped short but beth waited and mrs caldwell recommenced i am delighted on your account only i was just thinking the money is of no use to you just now and it would have made all the difference to jim he ought to be making friends now who will last him his life and help him on in his career but he can do nothing without an allowance and i cannot make him one there is no hurry for your education in fact i think it would be better for your health if you were not taught too much at present but you shall have your aunts room beth to study in if you like you may even sleep there although i shall feel it when you leave mine it will be breaking up the family that remark in the will about proper privacy seems to me great nonsense and you know i am not legally bound to give you a room to yourself however it was the dear old ladys last request to me and that makes it sacred so it shall be carried out to the letter the room is yours and i hope you will enjoy your privacy oh i shall beth exclaimed with uncomplimentary fervour mrs caldwell sighed and sewed on in silence for a little the dear old lady left you the money because she believed you would do some good with it she resumed for the good of mankind those are her own words and i do think that is rather your line beth and what greater good can you do to begin with than help your brother on in the world to spend the money on him instead of on yourself would really be a fine unselfish thing to do beths great grey eyes dilated the prospect was alluring i suppose there would not be enough for both of us she ventured tentativelyenough for me to be taught some few things properly you knowenglish music french on fifty pounds a year my dear child her mother exclaimed sorrowfully fifty pounds goes no way at all beth sighed besides mrs caldwell pursued i can teach you all these things youve got beyond your childish tiresomeness now and have only to ask and then i will tell you all you dont know it would be a pleasure and an occupation for me and indeed beth i have very little pleasure in life the days are long and lonely beth looked up with sudden sympathy but if you will let me give you the lessons and earn the money i could send it to jim and that would comfort me greatly and add also to your happiness i should think it was not in beth to resist such an appeal she always forgot herself at the first symptom of sorrow or suffering in another and never considered her own interests if she could help somebody else by sacrificing them it would add to my happiness she answered brightly and if you will just explain to me mamma when i dont understand things i shall remember all right and not be a bother to you will you be kind to me and not scold me and jeer at me and make my life a burden to me when you do that i hate you mrs caldwell stopped short with her needle up in the air in the act of drawing the thread through her work she was inexpressibly shocked hate your mother beth she gasped i know its abominable said beth filled with compunction but i cant help it its the devil i suppose he gets hold of us both and makes you torment me and makes menot like you for it mrs caldwell quietly resumed her sewing she was too much startled by this glimpse of herself from beths point of view to say another word on the subject and a long silence ensued during which she saw herself as a sadly misunderstood mother she determined however to try and manage beth on a new principle i should like to help you to make the best of yourself beth she burst out again abruptly and i think i can you are a tall girl for your age and are beginning to hold yourself well already your poor dear aunt was very particular to teach you that and you have the complexion of the bench family if you will take care of it you should wash your face in buttermilk at night after being out in the sun ill get you some and ill get you a parasol for the summer your hands are not nearly so coarse as they used to be and they would really be quite nice if you attended to them properly all your fathers people had good hands and feet i must see to your gloves and boots i dont know what your waist is going to be but you shall have some good stays a fine shape goes a long way with your prospects you really ought to make a good match so do not slouch about any more as if you had no selfrespect at all you can really do a great deal to make yourself attractive in appearance your uncle william caldwell had a very ugly nose but he pinched it and pinched it every day to get it into shape until at last he made it quite a good one bernadine came into the room in time to hear this story and was so impressed by it that she tried the same experiment on her own nose without asking if it were ugly or not and pinched it and rubbed it so diligently that by the time it was formed she had thickened it and changed it from a good ordinary nose into something quite original this was the kind of thing that happened to ladies in the days when true womanliness consisted in knowing nothing accurately and always taking advice efforts to improve themselves in some such way were common enough among marriageable maidens and their mothers helped them to the best of their ability with equally happy hints because small feet were a beauty therefore feet already in perfect proportion must be squeezed to reduce their size till they were all deformed and because slenderness was considered elegant therefore naturally wellformed women must compress their bodies till they looked like cylinders or hourglasses and lace till their noses swelled and their hair fell out never having heard of proportion all their ambition was to reduce themselves to something less than they were designed to be those were the days when women had no nonsense about them sir i tell you none of those newfangled ideas about education and that it was a new notion to beth that she could do anything to make herself attractive and she took a solemn interest in it she listened with absolute faith to all that her mother said on the subject and determined to be highprincipled and make the most of herself when her mother talked to her in this genial friendly way instead of carping at her or ignoring her beths heart expanded and she was ready to do anything to please her lessons on the new method went on without friction beth never suspected that her mother was unequal to the task of educating her in any true sense of the word her mother never suspected it neither did anybody else and beth had it all her own way if she were idle her mother excused her if she brought a lesson only halflearnt her mother prompted her all through if she asked questions her mother answered them pleasantly so that they got on very well together and everybody was satisfiedespecially jim who was benefiting by aunt victorias bequest to the extent of being able to keep up with the best of his barloafing acquaintances chapter xxv when she did what aunt victoria approved beth felt that she was making aunt victoria happy her dead were never far from her never beyond recall she conquered her pride for aunt victorias sake and began to go out again with her mother for the morning walk that winter unasked but mrs caldwell seemed indifferent to the attention she let beth walk beside her day after day but remained absorbed in her own reflections and made no effort to talk to beth and take her out of herself so that beth very soon found the duty intolerably irksome it irritated her too when she caught her mother smiling to herself and on asking what was amusing her mrs caldwell replied still smiling never you mind with beths temperament it was not possible that the sense of duty would long survive such snubs gradually she began to wander off by herself again leaving her mother pacing up and down the particular sheltered terrace overlooking the sea on which she always walked at that hour and bernadine playing about the cliffs or the desolate shore the whole place was desolate and melancholy at that time of the year the windswept streets were generally deserted and the few people who ventured out looked cold and miserable in their winter wraps when a gleam of sunshine enlivened the sky the sailors would stand at the top of the steps that led down on to the pier with their hands in their trouserspockets chewing tobacco and straining their eyes out seaward as if they were watching for something special and beth would stand there among them and look out tooout far beyond the range of their mental vision eastwards to summer lands whence the swallows came where the soft air was perfumed with flowers and there was brightness and warmth and ease and the sea itself so full of complaint down below there raged no more neither lamented but sang and there aunt victoria would be sitting somewhere out of doors under the trees with good things books and work and fruit and flowers piled up on a little table beside her and every wish of her heart gratified looking serenely happy and smiling and nodding and beckoning to beth but following fast upon the vision aunt victoria would be beside her in the bitter wind wearing her old brown dress with white spots that was far too thin and making believe that she did not shiver then they had returned from the morning walk and aunt victoria was pausing a moment at the bottom of the stairs to look up as if measuring her strength and the distance before she took hold of the bannister and began to mount wearily but never once trusting herself to glance towards bernadine and the bread lest something should be seen in her face which she chose to conceal from that vision beth would fly down the steps to the sands and escape it in a healthy race with the turgid waves that came cresting in and broke on the barren shore then one day suddenly as it seemed a bird sang the winter was over spring was upon the land again and beth looked up and smiled the old peartree in the little garden at the back was a white wonder of blossom and in front in the orchard opposite the appletrees blushed with a tinge of pink beth seeing them one morning very early from her bed in aunt victorias room arose at once rejoicing and threw the window wide open beth might have used the same word to express the good and the beautiful as the greeks did so inseparably were the two associated in her mind at this stage of her development she felt very literally the heavens are telling the glory of god the wonder of his works displays the firmament o lord how wondrous are thy works she chanted to herself softly as she gazed awestricken at the loveliness of the rosetinged foam on the fruittrees and her whole being was thrilled with gratitude for the beauty of earth she took deep draughts of the sweet morning air and like the indian devotee she breathed a sacred word with every breath but passive ecstasy was not enough for beth her fine feelings strove for expression always in some fine act and as she stood at the window she made good resolutions her life should be ordered to worthy purposes from morning till night she would in future begin the day by getting up to greet the dawn in an ecstasy of devotion not a minute later than daybreak would do for her all beths efforts aimed at an extreme she idled most of that day away in contemplation of her project and she was as dilatory and troublesome as she could be doing nothing she ought to have done because her mind was so full of all the things she was going to do what she feared was that she would never be able to wake herself in time and she went to bed at a preposterously early hour and sat long in her nightdress thinking how to manage it at last it occurred to her that if she tied her great toe to the bedpost with a piece of string it would give her a jerk when she moved and so awake her the contrivance answered only too well she could not sleep for a long time and when at last she dropped off she was almost immediately awakened by a pitiless jerk from the string she had aunt victorias old watch under her pillow and lighted a match to see the time it was only twelve when would the day break she turned and tossed and fidgeted the string on her toe was very uncomfortable but nothing would have induced her to be so weak as to take it off one two three she heard the churchclock strike but it was still pitch dark then she dozed off again but in a minute as it seemed to her she was rearoused by the string she gave a great weary sigh and opened her eyes it was all grey daylight in the room beth was out of bed as soon as she could get the string off her toe the water was very cold and she shivered and yawned and stretched over it but washed herself with exaggerated conscientiousness all the same then huddled on her clothes and stood awhile not knowing quite what to do next she had slept with the window open and now she drew up the blind under the leaden sky the appletrees showed no tinge of colour and it was as if white sheets had been spread out over them for the night beth thought of curlpapers and rooms all covered up from the dust when harriet was sweeping and felt no enthusiasm she was on the west side of the house and could not therefore see the sun rise but she must see the sunrisesunrisesunrise she had never seen the sunrise the sea was east it would rise over the sea the sea at sunrise the very thought of it took her breath away she put on her things and slipped into the actingroom her mother took the frontdoor key up to her room with her when she went to bed at night so that the only way out was by the actingroom window beth swung herself round the bar crept cautiously down the tiles to the pump jumped to the ground then ran up the entry and let herself out by the backgate into the street there she was seized upon by a great feeling of freedom she threw up her arms filled her lungs with a deep breath and ran there was not a soul to be seen the town was hers she made for a lonely spot on the cliff where a stream fell in a cataract on to the sand and there was a rustic seat with a lovely view of the bay beth dropped on to the seat out of breath and looked curiously about her the tide was high the water smooth sullen swollen and weary broke on the shore in waves so small that it seemed as if the sea tired of its endless task were doing dispiritedly as little as it dared and murmuring at that the curving cliffs on the left looked like white curtains closely drawn the low grey sky was unbroken by cloud or rift except low down on the horizon where it had risen like a blind drawn up a little to admit the light it was a melancholy prospect and beth shivered and sighed in sympathy then a sparrow cheeped somewhere behind her and another bird in the hedge softly fluted a little roulade beth looked round to see what it was and at that moment the light brightened as if it had been suddenly turned up she looked at the sea again the rift in the leaden sky had lengthened and widened and the first pale primrose of the dawn showed beyond a faint flush followed and then it seemed as if the night sky slowly rolled itself up and was put away leaving a floor of silver deepening to lilac for the first bright beam to disport itself upon then the sea smiled and the weariness of it back and forth back and forth passed into animation its smooth surface became diapered with light airs and moved with a gentle roll the sullen murmur rose to a morning song and a boat with bare mast at anchor in the bay the only one in sight rocked to the tune a great seabird sailed by gazing down into the depths with piercing eyes and a grey gull flew so close to the water it seemed as if his wings must dip at every flap the sky by this time was all a riot of colour at which beth gazed in admiration but without rapture her intellect acknowledged its loveliness but did not delight in itheart and soul were untouched the spirit of the dawn refused to speak to her she had exhausted herself in her effort to induce the intoxication of devotion which had come to her spontaneously the day before the great spirit does not want martyrs joy in beauty and goodness comes of a pure and tranquil mind not of a tortured body the faces of the holy ones are calm and their souls serene a little farmhouse stood back from the road just behind the seat where beth was sitting and a tall gaunt elderly man with a beard on his chin came out presently and stood staring grimly at the sunrise then he crossed the road deliberately sat down at the other end of the seat and stared at beth youre early out he said at last beth detected something hostile in the tone and fixed her big fearless grey eyes upon him defiantly its a free country she said free or not he answered drily it isnt fit fur no young gell to be out alone at sechun a time ye should be indoors gettin the breakfast thank you said beth ive no need to get the breakfast well it makes it all the worse he rejoined fur if yere by way o bein a lady it not ony means that yere out wi no one to tak care of ye but that yeve niver been taught to tak care o yerself lady he ejaculated pride and patches tak my advice lady go back to yer bed get yer meed o sleep wak up refreshed and set to work he spat on the grass in a selfsatisfied way when he had spoken and contemplated the sunrise like a man who has done his duty and earned the right to repose beth got up and walked home despondently she climbed in at the actingroom window and went to her own room the sun was shining on the appleblossom in the orchard opposite and she looked for the charm of yesterday but finding only the garish commonplace of fruittrees in flower with the sun on them she drew down the blind then she took off her hat and jacket threw herself on her bed and fell into a heavy sleep with her brow puckered and the corners of her mouth drooping discontentedly the next night she determined to take her meed of sleep and did not tie the string to her toe it had been a long lonely day filled with great dissatisfaction and vague yearnings for companionship but when she fell asleep she had a happy dream so vivid that it seemed more real than anything she had seen in her morning ramble it was eight oclock in the evening she dreamt and there was some one waiting for her under the peartree in the garden the night air was fresh and fragrant the moonlight shone on the white blossoms overhead which clustered so close that no ray penetrated to the ground beneath so that there all was shadowy but still she could see that there was some one standing in the shade and she knew that he was waiting for her she had never seen him before yet she knew him well and hurried to meet him and he took her in his arms and kissed her and his kisses thrilled her with a thrill that remained with her for many a day she got up the moment she awoke and looked about her in a kind of amaze for everything she saw was transfigured it was in herself however that the light burned which made the world so radiant as the old appletrees warmed by the sun suddenly blossomed into bridal beauty in the spring so in the silent night between sundown and daydawn while she slept yet another petal of her own manifold nature had unfolded and in the glow of its loveliness there was nothing of commonplace aspect for a new joy in life was hers which helped her to discover in all things a hitherto unsuspected charm beths little life had been full of childish irregularities the little duties being continually slurred and neglected that the little pleasures might be indulged in the sooner she was apt to regard bathing hairbrushing dressing and lessons as mere hindrances to some of the particular great businesses of life which specially occupied herversemaking for instance pianoplaying poaching or praying whichever happened to be the predominant interest of the moment but now on a sudden the care of her person became of extraordinary importance all the hints good and bad she had had on the subject recurred to her and she began to put them into practice systematically she threw the clothes back from her bed to air it the moment she got up that it might be fresh and sweet to sleep in her little bath had hitherto been used somewhat irregularly but now she fetched hot and cold water for herself and bathed every day she brushed her hair glossy and tightened her stays to make her waist small and she was sorely dissatisfied because her boots did not pinch her feet she began to take great care of her hands too and would do no dusting without gloves on or dirty work of any kind that was calculated to injure them she used a parasol when she could and if she got sunburnt bathing or boating she washed her face in buttermilk at night fetched from fairholm regularly for the purpose the minds and habits of the young are apt to form themselves in this way out of suggestions let fall by all kinds of people the worst and most foolish as well as the wisest and best beth longed that morning for something new and smart to wear her old black things looked so rusty in the spring sunshine she could not satisfy herself with anything she had all aunt victorias possessions were hers and she examined her boxes looking for something to enliven her own sombre dress and found some lace which she turned into a collar and cuffs and sewed on when she saw herself in the glass with this becoming addition to her dress her face brightened at the effect she knew that aunt victoria would have been pleased to see her look like thatshe was always pleased when beth looked well and now when beth recollected her sympathy all the great fountain of love in her brimmed over and streamed away in happy little waves to break about the dear old aunt somewhere on the foreshore of eternity and to add perhaps who knows how or what to her bliss when beth went down to breakfast she was very hungry but there was only one little bloater which must be left for mamma to divide with bernadine there was not much butter either so beth took her toast nearly dry and her thin coffee with very little milk and no sugar in it also for economical reasons but the coffee was hot and she was happy her happiness bubbled up in bright little remarks which brightened her mother too mamma said beth taking advantage of her mood its a poor heart that never rejoices lets have a holiday you and i to celebrate the summer but the summer hasnt come mrs caldwell objected smiling but summer is coming is coming beth chanted and i want to make a song about it you make a song bernadine exclaimed why you cant spell summer beth made a face at her i know you want a holiday mamma she resumed come confess i work you to death and theres church today at eleven and i want to go well if you want to go to church said mrs caldwell relieved beth did not wait to hear the end of the sentence she went to the drawingroom first and sat down at the little rosewood piano with a volume of moores lalla rookh open before her from the mountains warbling fount i come she chanted with her eyes fixed on the words but she played as if she were reading notes she wove all the poems she loved to music in this way and played and sang them softly to herself by the hour together the lenten service in the church at the end of the road was but poorly attended there were not more than a dozen people present but beth seated beside the door enjoyed it she was all fervour now and every emotional exercise was a pleasure after the service she strolled down the quaintly irregular front street which was all red brick houses with small windowpanes three to the width of the window except where an aspiring tradesman had introduced plateglass and a vulgar disguise of stucco which converted the warmtoned bricks into commonplace colourless greyness it was on one side of this street that the principal shops were and beth stood for some time gazing at a print in a stationers windowa lovely little composition of waves lapping in gently towards a sheltered nook on a sandy beach beth wafted there instantly heard the dreamy murmur and felt the delicious freshness of the sea yet the picture did not satisfy her i should want somebody she broke out in herself i should want somebodysomebody to lay my head against ah dear lord how i hate to be alone old lady benyon at her post of observation in the big bowwindow at the top of the street saw beth standing there and speculated gracious how that child grows she exclaimed shell be a woman directly as beth went on down the street she began to suffer from that dull irresolute feeling which comes of a want of purpose she wanted a companion and she wanted an object presently she met a young man who looked at her intently as they approached each other and as he looked his face brightened beths pulse quickened pleasurably and her colour rose her steps became buoyant she held up her head and glowed with animation but was unaware of the source of this sudden happy stimulant nor did she try to discover it she was living her experiences then byandby she would reflect upon them then inevitably she would reproduce them and all without intention as the sun rises as the birds build so would she work when the right time came talent may manufacture to order but works of genius are the outcome of an irresistible impulse a craving to express something for its own sake and the pleasure of expressing it with no thought of anything beyond it is talent that thinks first of all of applause and profits and only works to secure themworks for the result for the end in viewnever for love of the work beths heart had no satisfaction at home she had no friend of her own sex to fill it as most girls have and a nature like hers rich in every healthy possibility was bound to crave for love early it was all very well for her mother and society as it is constituted to ignore the needs of nature by beth herself they would not be ignored in most people whether the senses or the intellect will have the upperhand is very much a matter of early training because she was a girl beths intellect had been left to stagnate for want of proper occupation or to run riot in any vain pursuit she might happen upon by accident while her senses were allowed to have their way unrestrained by any but the vaguest principles thanks to her free roving outdoor habits her life was healthy if it were not happy and she promised to mature early youth and sex already began to hang out their signalsclear skin slim figure light step white teeth thick hair bright eyes she was approaching her blossoming time the end of her wintry childhood the beginning of a promising spring it was natural and right that her pulses should quicken and her spirits rise when a young man met her with a friendly glance her whole being was suffused with the glory of love and her mind held the vision but it was of an abstract kind as yet not inspired by man it was in herself that the emotion arose in happy exuberance and bubbled over expending itself in various forms of energy until it should find one object to concentrate itself upon there comes a time to all healthy young people when nature says mate my children and be happy if the impulse come prematurely it is not the young people but the old ones that are to blame they should have seen to it that the intellect which acts as a curb on the senses when properly trained and occupied developed first beth was just at the age when the halfeducated girl has nothing to distract her but her own emotions her religion and the young men who are beginning to make eyes at her interest her then about equally and in much the same way she owes to each a pleasurable sensation if she can combine the two under one roof as in church they suffice and her happiness is complete it cannot be said however that the senses awoke before the intellect in beth but because of the irregularities of her training the want of discipline and order they took possession of her first passing a shopwindow beth caught a reflection of herself in the polished pane and saw that her skirt hung badly it dipped too much behind she stopped to gauge the length that she might alter it when she went in and then she noticed the pretty light summer things displayed in the window and ached to possess some she was miserably conscious of her old illcut skirt more especially of the invisible dirt on it and she did so yearn for something new and sweet and clean her mother had a bill at that shopshould sheshould she just go in and ask about prices no she could not in that horrid old frock the shopman would not respect her she had intended to go down to the sands and sit by the sea and wait for things to come to her by which she meant ideas but the discomfort of mind set up by that glimpse of her uncouth clothes and the horrible sense of their want of freshness gained upon her and drove her in hurriedly beth would have expressed the dainty refinement of her mind in her dress had she had the means but it is difficult to be dainty on nothing a year the rest of the day she spent in her room sewing she found that one of aunt victorias summer silks would fit her with very little alteration and set to work to make a sunday frock of it as she worked she thought of the dear old lady and of the hours they had sat there together sewing and of their teas and talks she would not have known how to alter that dress but for aunt victoria it made her both sad and glad to remember how much she owed her later in the day after dinner when the sun had set and the darkness was beginning to gather beth became aware of a curious sensation it was as if she were expecting something delightful to happen and yet at the same time was all aching with anxiety then suddenly she remembered her dream the old peartree was a pyramid of blossom should she go and see the white foamflowers by moonlight the moon had risen she stole out into the garden anxious above everything to go alone her heart throbbed curiously what did she expect the young moon hung in an indigo sky and there were some white stars the air was fresh and fragrant as it had been in her dream but there was less light she had to peer into the shade beneath the peartree to seeto see what if there were any one there of course there was no one there how could there be she did not trust herself closer however until she was quite sure that there was nothing to encounter but the trunk of the tree then she went bravely and reclined on the seesaw board looking up through the black branches to the clustering blossoms that shone so white on the topmost twigs in the moonlight and presently she began to glow with a great feeling of exultation it began in her chest and spread as from a centre all over her the details of her dream recurred to her the close clasp the tender kiss and she thrilled again at the recollection but for the present the recollection was enough chapter xxvi on sunday morning beth went down to breakfast dressed in aunt victorias light lavender silk remodelled to suit her and very becoming she had made it but mrs caldwell called it an absurd costume for a girl of her age and said she looked ridiculously overdressed so beth went back to her room disheartened and reappeared at churchtime with drooping mouth in the old black frock she usually wore on sundays vainly she tried to rouse herself to any fervour of worship during the first part of the service she felt illdressed uncomfortable dissatisfied and would have been glad to quarrel with anybody then suddenly during the singing of a hymn she ceased to be selfconscious all the trouble left her and was succeeded by that curious thrill of happy expectation which came to her continually at this time she looked about her and saw friendly faces where before she had seen nothing but criticism and disdain of her shabby clothes those were the days of pewletting the nearer you sat to the pulpit the higher the price of the pew and the better your social position mrs caldwell was obliged to content herself with a cheap seat in one of the side aisles near the door so the vicar had never called on her he only called on a few front rows his own pew was high in the chancel where all the parish could gaze at his exhausted wife and her increasing family his pupils used to sit in the pew opposite but the bishop having received complaints from the neglected parish had lately interfered and stopped the school and henceforth mr richardson was only to be allowed to have one pupil mr richardson determined to make him profitable from where she sat beth could see the vicars pew in the chancel and she had noticed a tall slender youth sitting at the far end near the vestry door but he did not interest her at first now however she looked at him again and wondered who he was and presently she found that he was gazing at her intently then their eyes met and it was as if a spark of fire had kindled a glow in her chest high up near the throat where the breath catches she looked down at her book but had no thought on the subject at allshe was all one sensation light had come to her a wondrous flood of amber light that blotted out the common congregation and all besides but him and her yet she could hardly sit through the service and the moment it was over she fled her great desire was to be alone if that could be called solitude which contained all the satisfaction of the closest companionship all the time that she was flying however she felt that she was being pursued and there was the strangest excitement and delight in the sensation but she never looked behind she did not dare to she made for the cliffs on the fairholm estate and when she came to them her intention was to hide herself there was a nook she knew some distance on a grassy space on the cliff side not visible either from above or below she climbed down to it and there ensconced herself beneath was a little cove sheltered from the north and south by the jutting cliffs and floored with the firmest sand just then for the tide was out beth was lying in the shadow of the cliff but beyond the sun shone the water sparkled the sonorous seavoice sounded from afar while little laughing waves broke out into merry music all along the shore beth lying on her face with her arms folded in front of her and her cheek resting on them looked out lithe young strong bursting with exultation but motionless as a manifestation of inanimate nature that was a beautiful pause in her troublous day never mind if it only endured for an hour there was certainty in it a happy certainty from the moment their eyes had met she was sure she knew he would come the little waves rang out their laughing carillons light grace notes to the deep solemn melody of earth and air and sea and beth watching with dilated pupils and set countenance listened intently and presently below on her left round the headland some one came striding beths bright eyes flashed with a vivid interest but she shrank back flattening herself down on the rank grass as though thereby she made herself the more invisible the young man stopped took off his hat and wiped his forehead glanced this way and that round the cove and out to sea like one bewildered who has expected to find something which is not there and begins to look for it in the most unlikely places hesitating disappointed uncertain he moved a little on in one direction a little back in the other then drawn by a sudden impulse that most familiar manifestation of the ruling force which disposes of us all we know not how he walked up the cove with swift strong buoyant steps as if with a purpose swinging his hat in his hand as he came and threw himself full length on the smooth hard shining sand and sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction as though he knew himself within reach of what he sought in certain states of ecstatic feeling a faculty is released which takes cognisance of things beyond the ken of our beclouded intellects and although in the language of mind he did not know it may be that from the region of pure spirit there had come to him a subtle perception not to be defined which made it more desirable to be there on that spot alone than anywhere else in the world with no matter whom he was a young man of seventeen or eighteen slenderly built with wellshaped feet and long delicate nervous hands his face was shaved clean of the down of his adolescence so that his somewhat sallow complexion looked smooth to effeminacy his features were regular and refined and his fine brown curly hair was a shade lighter in colour than his skinwhich produced a noticeable effect his pale chinablue eyes too showed the same peculiarity which beth looking down on him through the fringe of long rank grass in front of her remarked but uncritically for every inch of him was a joy to her she was passive but the young man soon grew restless on his sandy couch he changed his position a dozen times then suddenly got on his knees and heaped up a mound of sand which having patted it and pressed it down as hard as it would set he began to model beth held her breath and became rigid with interest as she saw the shapeless mass gradually transformed into some semblance of a human figure conventional as an egyptian statue when the young man had finished he sat beside the figure for some time looking fixedly out to sea then he turned to his work once more and after surveying it critically he began to make alterations trying to improve upon what he had done but the result did not please him and in a fit of exasperation he fell upon the figure and demolished it this seemed such a wanton outrage to beth that she uttered a low cry of remonstrance involuntarily but the exclamation mingled with the murmur of wind and wave and was lost in it the young man looked disconcerted himself and ashamed too as a child does when it has broken something in a rage and repents and presently he began to heap the mound once more when it was done he stretched himself on the sand and shut his eyes and for a long time beth lay still looking down upon him all at once however the noise of the water became importunate she had not been aware of it at all since the young man appeared but now it came into her consciousness with the distinctness of a sudden and unexpected sound and she looked in that direction the last time she had noticed the tide it was far out but now where all had been sand beyond the sheltered cove all was water the silver line stretched from headland to headland and was still advancing already there was no way of escape by the sands and the cove itself would be a bay in a little whilea bay without a boat if he did not wake and bestir himself the callous waves would come and cover him should she call she was shy of taking the initiative even to save his life and hesitated a moment and in that moment there came a crash the treacherous clay cliff crumbled and the great mass of it on which she was lying slid down bodily on to the shining sand the young man started up roused by the rumbling had he been a few feet nearer to the cliff he must have been buried alive he and beth stared at each other stupidly neither realising what had happened for the first few minutes he was the first to recover himself are you hurt he asked with concern going forward to help her i dont know she answered staggering to her feet no i think not she added im a little shaken ill sit down the sitting would have been a tumble had he not caught her in his arms and held her up beth felt deadly sick for an instant then she found herself reclining on the sand with the young man bending over her looking anxiously into her face youre faint he said is that faint she answered what a ghastly sensation but there is something i want to remember she shut her eyes then opened them and looked up at him with a puzzled expression its very odd i cant remember she complained the young man could not help her he looked up at the cliff what were you doing up there he asked what were you doing down there she rejoined i followed you he answered simply i saw you come this way then i lost sight of you but i thought you would be somewhere on the sands because the cliffs are private property the owner is an uncle of mine said beth i come when i like then they looked into each others faces shyly and looked away again smiling but confused why did you follow me said beth you did not know me no but i wanted to he answered readily where were you lying on a shelf where that scar is now looking down on you then you saw me model that figure and the cliff fell beth put in irrelevantly to cover a blush it often falls were always having landslips here and i think wed better move away from it now she added rising people are killed sometimes but tell me he said detaining her didnt you know i was following you beth became embarrassed you did he persisted and you ran away why did you run away i couldnt help it beth confessed then she uttered an exclamation look look the tide what shall we do he turned and saw their danger for the first time our only way of escape is by the cliffs beth said unless a boat comes by and the cliffs are perpendicular just here he rejoined after carefully surveying them they looked into each others faces blankly i cant swimcan you he asked beth shook her head what is to be done he exclaimed there is nothing to be done i think she answered quietly we may see a boat but hardly anybody ever comes along the cliffs we might shout though they did so until they were hoarse but there was no response and the tide came creeping up over the sand how calm it is beth observed he looked at her curiously i dont believe youre a bit afraid he said im in a desperate funk i dont believe were going to be drowned and i always know whats coming she answered then after a little she asked him his name alfred he answered and yours bethbeth caldwell alfredi like alfred i like beth its queer but i like it all the better for that its like you do you think me queer beth asked prepared to resent the imputation i think you uncommon he replied beth reflected for a little what is your full name she asked finally alfred cayley pounce he replied my father gave me the name of alfred that i might always remember i was a cayley pounce but my ambition is to be the cayley pounce he added with a nervous little laugh beth compressed her lips and looked at the rising tide the next wave broke at their feet and both involuntarily stepped back behind them was the mass of earth that had fallen from the cliff it had descended in a solid wedge without scattering alfred climbed on to it and helped beth up we shall be a little higher here at all events he said beth looked along the cliff the highwater mark was still above their heads its getting exciting isnt it she observed but i dont feel nasty having you here makesmakes a difference you know if you have to die with me how shall you feel he asked i shall feel till my last gasp that i would much rather have lived with you she answered emphatically a wavelet splashed up against the clay on which they were standing he turned to the cliff and tore at it in a sort of exasperation trying to scoop out footholes with his hands by which they might climb up but the effort was futile the soft shale crumbled as he scooped and there was no hold to be had on it his face had grown grey in the last few minutes and his eyes were strained and anxious i wonder how you feel beth said i think i resent the fate that threatens us more than i fear it if my life must end now it will be so unfinished he made no reply and she stood looking out to sea thoughtfully its sunday she observed at last there wont be many boats about today the water had begun to creep up on to their last refuge it washed over her feet as she spoke and she shrank back alfred put his arm round her protectingly do you still believe we shall not be drowned he said yes she answered but even if we were it wouldnt be the end of us we have been here in this world before you and i and we shall come again what makes you think such queer things he asked i dont think them she answered i know them the things i think are generally all wrong but the things i know aboutthat come to me like thisare right only i cant command them one comes to me now and again like a flash as that one did down there just now when i said we should not be drowned but if i put a question to myself i can get no answer the water had crept up over their feet while they were speaking it was coming in at a great rate but there were no waves to splash them only a sort of gentle heave and ripple that brought it on insensibly so that it had lapped up to the cliff behind them before they suspected it beth shivered as it rose around her its a good thing i changed my dress she said suddenly that summer silk would certainly have been spoilt alfred held her tight and looked down into her face but said nothing im thinking so many things beth broke out again im glad its a still day for one thing and not freezing cold the cold would have numbed us and we should have been swept off our feet if there had been any waves i want to ask you so many things why did you make that figure on the sand i want to be a sculptor he said but my people object and they wont let me have the proper materials to model in so i model in anything the water was almost up to beths waist she had to turn and cling to him to keep her footing she hid her face on his shoulder and they stood so some time the water rose above her waist alfred was head and shoulders taller than she was he realised that she would be covered first i must hold her up somehow he muttered beth raised her head alfred she began were neither of us cowards are we you are hating to die i can see but youre not going to make an exhibition of yourself to the elements and im hating it tooim horribly anxiousand the cold makes me sob in my breath as the water comes up it is like dying by inches from the feet up but while my head is alive i defy death to make me whimper do you despair then he exclaimed as if there had been some safeguard in her certainty i have no knowledge at this moment she answered i am in suspense but that is nothing the things that have come to me like that on a sudden positively have always been true however much i might doubt and question beforehand i did know at that moment that we should not be drowned but i dont know it now my spirit cant grasp the idea though of being here in this comfortable body talking to you one moment and the next being turned out of house and home into eternity alone not alone he interrupted clasping her closer ill hold you tight through all eternity beth looked up at him and then they kissed each other frankly and forgot their danger for a blissful interval they were keeping their foothold with difficulty now the last heave of the tide came up to beths shoulder and took her breath away had it not been for the support of the cliff behind them they could not have kept their position many minutes but the cliff itself was a danger for the sea was eating into it and might bring down another mass of it at any moment the agony of death the last struggle with the water had begun i hate it beth gasped but im not afraid the steady gentle heave of the sea was like the breathing of a placid sleeper it rose round them once more up up over beths head they clung closer to each other and to the cliff staggering and fighting for their foothold then it sank back from them then slowly came again rising in an irregular wavy line all along the face of the cliffs with a sobbing sound as if in its great heart it shrank from the cruel deed it was doingrose and fell rose and fell again alfreds face was grey and distorted he groaned aloud are you suffering beth exclaimed oh i wish it was over she had really the more to suffer of the two for every wave nearly covered her but her nerve and physique were better than his and her will was of iron the only thing that disturbed her fortitude were the signs of distress from him gently gently the water came creeping up and up again it had swelled so high the last time that beth was all but gone and now she held her breath expecting for certain to be overwhelmed but after a pause it went down once more then rose again and again subsided alfred stood with shut eyes and clenched teeth blindly resisting beth kept her wits about her alfred she cried on a sudden i was right i was not deceived stand fast the tide is on the turn he opened his eyes and stared about him in a bewildered way his face was haggard and drawn from the strain his strength all but exhausted he did not seem to understand hold on beth cried again youll be a big sculptor yet the tide has turned its going out alfred its going out it washed an inch lower last time keep up keep up o lord help me to hold him help me to hold him its funny she went on changing with one of her sudden strange transitions from the part of actor to that of spectator as it were its funny we neither of us prayed people in danger do as a rule they say in the books but i never even thought of it the tide had seemed to come in galloping like a racehorse but now it crawled out like a snail and they were both so utterly worn that when at last the water was shallow enough they just sank down and sat in it leaning against each other and yearning for what seemed to them the most desirable thing on earth at that momenta dry spot on which to stretch themselves out and go to sleep i know now what exhaustion is said beth with her head on alfreds shoulder do you know beth he rejoined with a wan smile youve been picking up information ever since you fell acquainted with me here i can count a dozen new experiences youve mentioned already if you go on like this always youll know everything in time i hope so beth muttered fell acquainted with you isnt bad but i wonder if tumbled wouldnt have been better she dozed off uncomfortably before she could finish the sentence he had settled himself with his head against the uncertain cliff which beetled above them ominously but they were both beyond thinking or caring about it vaguely conscious of each other and of the seavoice that gradually grew distant and more distant as the water went out beyond the headland leaving them stranded in the empty cove they rested and slept uneasily yet heavily enough to know little of the weary while they had to wait before they could make their escape for it was not until the sun had set and the moon hung high above the sea in a sombre sky that at last they were able to go chapter xxvii it was dark night when beth got back to the little house in orchard street she had hoped to slip in unobserved but her mother was looking out for her where have you been she demanded angrily beth had come in prepared to tell the whole exciting story but this reception irritated her and she answered her mother in exactly the same tone ive been at fairholm what have you been doing there mrs caldwell snapped getting myself into a mess as any one might see who looked at me beth rejoined i must go and change you can go to bed said her mother thank you said beth and went off straight away mrs caldwell would have liked to have followed her and given her a good beating as in the old days had she dared her harshness however had much the same effect upon beth that a beating used to have it shut her up in herself and deprived her of the power to take her mother into her confidence harriet followed her to her room whativer ave you been doin she exclaimed youre draggled from top to toe and your sunday dress too i got caught by the tide said beth and im done just you get into bed then said harriet and ill fetch you up some tea when she goes out shes off in a moment to lady benyons bless you harriet beth exclaimed i read in a book once that there is no crime but has some time been a virtue and i am sure it will be a virtue to steal me some tea on this occasion if it ever is oh alls fair in love and war harriet answered cheerfully as she helped beth off with her boots and you and yer mas at war again i guess seems like it beth sighed but stay though no you mustnt steal the tea i promised aunt victoria and that reminds me theres some still left in her little canister here take it and make it and have some yourself as a reward for the trouble hot tea and toast an you love me harriet and to save my life ive had nothing but salt water since breakfast when beth went downstairs next morning her mother scowled at her what did you mean by telling me you had been at fairholm yesterday she asked i meant to tell you where i had been beth answered impertinently i saw your aunt grace mary last night and she told me she had not seen you well aunt grace mary is a good size beth rejoined but she doesnt cover the whole estate mrs caldwell flushed angrily youre an illconditioned girl and will come to a bad end or im much mistaken she exclaimed with the help of my relations its likely beth retorted her mother said no more until breakfast was over and then she ordered her peremptorily to get out her lessons oh lessons beth grumbled whats the use of the kind of lessons i do im none the better for knowing that henry viii had six wives nor the happier nor the richer and my wit and wisdom certainly dont increase nor my manners improve if you speak the truth mrs caldwell changed countenance if beth rebelled against the hometeaching what would happen about the money that jim was enjoying upon reflection her mother saw she was making a mistake i think she began in a conciliatory tone you are right perhaps you had better not do any lessons this morning for i am sure you cannot be well beth or you would never speak to your mother in such a way well im sorry mamma beth rejoined in a mollified tone but you know i cannot stand these everlasting naggings and scoldings they make me horrid im pugnacious when im rubbed the wrong way i cant help it there there then that will do mrs caldwell replied run out and amuse yourself or have a rest you take too much exercise and tire yourself to death and then you are so cross there is no speaking to you go away like a good child and amuse yourself until you feel better beth went back to her own room at once only too glad to escape and be alone she was not well every bone in her body ached and her head was thumping so she had to lie down on her bed at last and keep still for the rest of the day but her mind was active the whole time and it was a happy day she expected nothing yet she was pleasurably satisfied perfectly content the next morning at eleven there was service in the church at the end of the road beth and her mother had been having the usual morning misery at lessons and both were exhausted when the bell began to ring beths countenance was set sullen and mrs caldwells showed suppressed irritation the bell was a relief to them can i go to church beth asked her mothers first impulse was to say no out of pure contrariness but the chance of getting rid of beth on any honourable pretext was too much of a temptation even for her to withstand yes if you like she answered ungraciously after a moments hesitation and get some good out of it if you can she added sarcastically beth went with honest intention there was a glow in her chest which added fervency to her devotions and when alfred entered from the vestry and took his seat in the chancel pew happiness tingling in every nerve suffused her his first glance was for her and beth knew it but bent her head her soul did magnify the lord however and her spirit did rejoice in god her saviour with unlimited love and trust he had saved them he would hear them he would help them he would make them bothboth good and greatgreat after a pause as being perhaps not a worthy aspiration she did not look at alfred a second time but she sat and stood and knelt all conscious of him and it seemed as if the service lasted but a moment directly it was over she fled taking the narrow path by the side of the church to the fields but before she was half way across the first field she heard a quick step following her beth felt she must stop shortor run she began to run beth beth wait for me he called beth stopped then turned to greet him shyly but when he came close and put his arm round her she looked up smiling they gazed into each others eyes a moment and then kissed awkwardly like children were you any the worse for our adventure he asked ive been longing to know i had a headache yesterday said beth how were you all stiff and aching he replied or i should have been to ask after you im glad you didnt come beth ejaculated why i ought to know your people you know why dont the richardsons know them because were poor beth answered bluntly and mr richardson neglects his poor parishioners all the more reason that i should call alfred cayley pounce persisted you are people of good family like ourselves and old rich is a nobody yes said beth but my mother would not let me know you she and i are alwaysalwayswe never agree you know i dont think we can help it we certainly dont do it on purposeat least i dont but theres something in us that makes us jar about everything i was going to tell her all about you on sunday night but when i got in i couldnt she began by being angry because i was late without waiting to know if i were to blame and thatthat shut me up and i never told her and now i dont think i could but what objection can she have to me he asked loftily i really must make her acquaintance not through me then said beth do you know the benyons no i dont know anybody in the neighbourhood as yet im here with old rich to be crammed my people are trying to force me into the bar or the church or something because i want to be a sculptor dont be forced said beth with spirit follow your own bent i mean to follow mine i didnt know girls had any bent he answered dubiously there was a recoil in beth how is it people never expect a girl to do anything she exclaimed firing up i dont see what a girl can do he rejoined except marry and look after her husband and children thats all right at the proper time beth said but meanwhile and if she doesnt marry is she to do nothing oh there are always lots of little things a woman can do he answered airily but supposing little things dont satisfy her and she has power to follow some big pursuit oh well in that case he began somewhat superciliously but its too rare to be taken into accounttalent in women how do you know beth said robbing women of the means to develop their talents doesnt prove they havent any the best horseman in the world could never have ridden if he hadnt had a horse i certainly think a woman should see to the ordering of her household but if she has it in her to do more why shouldnt she i shall want to do more i know i shall want to be something and i shall never believe that i cannot be that something until i have tried the experiment if you have it in you to be a sculptor be a sculptor i certainly should girl and all as i am i couldnt help it youre very valiant he said drily but you dont know what it is to have your whole family against you dont i said beth laughing ive known that all my life but ive known something besides ive known what it is to be myself if you know yourself and yourself is a sculptor youre bound to be a sculptor in spite of your family he looked at her admiringly when you talk like that i feel i could be anything or do anything that you like i love you so he ventured flipping the grass with his stick to cover his boyish embarrassment i am thinking of you always all day long isnt it strange beth answered softly and only two days ago we had never met but now we shall never part he said only i dont want you to be anything or to care to be anything but just my wife the word wife came upon beth with the shock of a sweet surprise she had not realised that she would ever be asked to be any ones wife that seemed something reserved for the honour of beings above her beautiful beings in books and the hot flush of joy that suffused her at the word rendered her oblivious to the condition attached she looked up in the young mans face with eyes full of love and gratitude her transparent skin bright with a delicate blush and her lips just parted in a smile you are sweet beth he exclaimed how sweet you are for the next few weeks they saw each other every day if it were only for a few minutes but even when they contrived to spend long hours together it was not enough beth scarcely ate or slept at that time the glow and spring and flood of feeling that coursed through her whole being sustained her when we are married we shall always be together alfred would whisper when they had to separate and then their eyes would dilate with joy at the heavenly prospect each was covered the while with smiles and confusion neither of which they could control they made each other no formal vows it was all taken for granted between them now they were engaged but when they were old enough and had an income they were to be married alfred had given up the idea of making mrs caldwells acquaintance before it was absolutely necessary for the present it delighted them to think that their secret was all their own and no one suspected it except dicksie the vicars hunchback son whom alfred had taken into his confidence dicksie was as old as alfred but his deformity had stunted his growth and the young lovers looking down into his pathetic face were filled with compassion and eagerly anxious to make atonement to him for his misfortune by sharing as much of their happiness with him as might be they encouraged him to accompany them in their walks when he could which was a joy to him for he was content to live upon the fringe of their romance unselfishly when they separated beth and alfred kissed each other frankly and then beth would stoop and kiss dicksie also in pure affection neither of the three troubled themselves about other people in those days and they never suspected that their own doings could be of consequence to anybody they therefore remained serenely unaware of the fact that the whole place was talking about them their own relations being the only people who did not know of the intimacy and worse still everybody objected to it all the forces of nature combined and the vast scheme of the universe itself had been ordered so as to unite those two young things but on the other hand the whole machinery of civilisation was set in readiness to keep them apart and the first intimation they had of this fact took them by surprise the whole happy summer had passed and autumn was with them mellow warm and still the days were shorter then and the young people delighted to slip out at dusk and wander about the fields all three together a gate opened from the vicarage grounds into the fieldpath beside the church and there alfred and dicksie waited till beth appeared and often waited in vain for beth could not always get out her mother told lady benyon that beth was tiresome rather than naughty in those days she seemed to have no idea of time she would stay out so late that her mother became quite fidgety about her not knowing what had become of her and when beth came in at last in a casual way beaming blandly at every one it was certainly provoking beth thought her mother unreasonable to object to her late rambles she was not giving her any trouble and she could not understand why her mother was not content to let her be happy in her own way beths lessons became more perfunctory than ever that summer mrs caldwell salved her own conscience on the subject by arguing that it is not wise to teach a girl too much when she is growing so fast and lady benyon agreed lady benyon had no patience with people who overeducate girlswith boys it was different but let a girl grow up strong and healthy and get her married as soon as possible was what she advised had any one asked what was to become of a girl brought up for that purpose solely if no one were found to marry her lady benyon would have disposed of the question with a shrug of the shoulders she laid down the principle and if it did not act somebody must be to blame the principle itself was good she was sure of that so beth was kept without intellectual discipline to curb her senses at this critical period and the consequence was that her energy took the form of sensuous rather than intellectual pursuits her time was devoted not to practising but to playing to poetry and to dreamy musings she wove words to music at the piano by the hour together lolled about in languorous attitudes was more painfully concerned than ever about her personal adornment delighted in scents and in luxurious imaginings and altogether fed her feelings to such excess that if her moral nature were not actually weakened it was certainly endangered fortunately she had an admirable companion in alfred the boy is not naturally like a beast unable to restrain his passions a bit more than the girl to men as to women the power to control themselves comes of the determination there are cases of natural depravity of course but they are not peculiar to either sex and as the girl may inherit the fathers vices so may the boy have his mother to thank for his virtues depravity is oftener acquired than inherited as a rule the girls surroundings safeguard her from the acquisition but when they do not she becomes as bad as the boy the boy on the contrary especially if he is sent to a public school is systematically trained to be vicious he learns the latin grammar from his masters and from the habitual conversation of the other boys the books secretly circulated by them and their traditional code of vice he becomes familiarised with the most hoggish habits he may escape the practical initiation by a miracle at the time but it is from the mind familiar with ideas of vice that the vicious impulse eventually springs and the seed of corruption once sown in it bears fruit almost inevitably alfred had escaped this contamination by being kept at home at a dayschool and when beth knew him he was as refined and highminded as he was virile for his age and as selfrestrained as she was impetuous she wanted to hurry on and shape their lives but he was content to let things come about she lived in the future he in the present and he was teaching her to do the same which was an excellent thing for her often when she was making plans he would check her by saying arent you satisfied i cant imagine myself happier than i am at this moment one thing neither of them ever anticipated and that was interference they expected those happy days to last without interruption until the happier ones came when they should be independent and could do as they liked when i am king diddle diddle you shall be queen alfred used to sing to beth and dicksie shall be prime minister one night they were out in the fields together beth was sitting on a rail with her arm round dicksies neck as he stood on one side of her alfred being on the other with his arm round her supporting her they were talking about flowers alfred was great on growing flowers the vicar had given him a piece of the vicarage garden for his own and he was going to build a little greenhouse to keep beth well supplied with bouquets they were deeply engrossed in the subject and the night was exceedingly dark so that they did not notice a sailor creep stealthily up the field behind them on the other side of the hedge and crouch down near enough to hear all that they said certainly that sailor was never more at sea in his life than he was while he listened to their innocent prattle when at last beth said it was time to go home and they strolled away arm in arm alfred and dicksie discovered that they were late and beth insisted on parting from them at the fieldgate into the vicarage grounds instead of letting them see her safe into the street when they left her she hurried on down the path beside the church alone and she had not taken many steps before she was suddenly confronted by a tall dark man who made as if he would not let her pass she stopped startled and then went straight up to him boldly and peered into his face is that you gard she exclaimed how dare you how dare you he rejoined impudently ive had my eye on you for some time i saw you out there just now in the field i was determined to know what you were up to theres mighty little happens here that i dont know oh said beth so youre the town spy are you well youre not going to spy upon me so i warn you mr gard the next time i come here ill come armed and if i catch you dogging me about again ill shoot you as dead as my fathers pistols can do it and as it is you shall pay for this i promise you just step aside now you cowardly black devil and let me pass do you think that its milk ive got in my veins that you come out on a fools errand to frighten me without a word the man stepped aside and beth walked on down the path with her head in the air and deliberately to let him see how little she feared him the next morning directly after breakfast she went down to the pier count bartahlinskys yacht was alongside and gard was on deck he changed countenance when beth appeared she ran down the ladder i want to see your master she said he cant see you miss hes given orders that hes not to be disturbed for no one whatsoever gard answered with excess of deference and its as much as my billet is worth to go near him hes very much occupied this morning dont tell lies said beth im going to see him she went forward to the skylight as she spoke and called down below there count gustav hello a voice replied is that you beth you know youre too big to be on the yacht now without a chaperon rot said beth dont be coarse beth count gustav remonstrated from below in rather a precious tone you know how i dislike hoyden english well then nonsense if thats any better beth rejoined youve got to see methis once at all events or therell be a tragedy oh in that case was the resigned reply ill come on deck beth walked aft and waited for him enthroned on the bulwark with a coil of rope for her footstool when count gustav appeared he looked at her quizzically what is the matter beth he asked what are you boiling with indignation about now about that man gard beth replied what do you think he was doing last night and not for the first time by his own account spying spying said bartahlinsky gard come here gard who had been anxiously watching them from amidships approached now beth what do you mean said the count i mean that i was out sitting on a rail in the churchfields last night with alfred cayley pounce and dicksie richardson talking and this man came and listened and then when i left them he met me on the path beside the church and spoke impudently to me and would not let me pass i know what you thought she broke out turning upon gard you thought i was doing something that i was ashamed of and youd find it out and have me in your power but ill have you know that i do nothing im ashamed ofnothing i should be ashamed to tell your master about so you may save yourself the trouble of spying upon me black gard as they well call you gard was about to say something but count gustav stopped him peremptorily you can go he said ill hear what you have to say later then he sat down beside beth and talked to her long and earnestly he advised her to give up her rambles with alfred and dicksie but she assured him that that was impossible who else have i she asked pathetically and what am i to do with my days if they never come into them again you ought to have been sent to school beth long ago and i told your mother so count gustav answered frowning and by jove ill tell her again he thought before its too late the encounter with gard added excitement to the charm of beths next meeting with the boys it made them all feel rather important they discussed it incessantly speculating as to what the mans object could have been alfred said vulgar curiosity but beth suspected that there was more than that in the manoeuvre and when dicksie suggested acutely that gard had intended to blackmail them she and alfred both exclaimed that that was it they had gone about together all this time in the most open way now they began to talk about caution and concealment like the persecuted lovers of old romance who had powerful enemies and were obliged to manage their meetings so that they should not be suspected they decided not to speak to each other in public and consequently when they met in the street they passed with such an elaborate parade of ignoring each other and yet with such evident enjoyment of the position that people began to wonder what on earth they were up to disguises would have delighted them but the fashions of the day did not lend themselves much to disguise unfortunately there were no masks no sombreros no cloaks and all they could think of was false whiskers for alfred but when he tried them they altered him so effectually that dicksie said he could not bear him and beth would not kiss him one evening after dinner when mrs caldwell was reading aloud to beth and bernadine there came a thundering knock at the front door which startled them all the weather had been bad all day and now the shutters were closed the rain beat against them with a chilly depressing effect inexpressibly dreary instead of attending to the reading beth had been listening to the footsteps of people passing in the street in the forlorn hope that among them she might distinguish alfreds when the knock came they thought it was a runaway but harriet opened the door all the same and presently returned smiling archly and holding aloft a beautiful bouquet whats that said mrs caldwell give it to me beths heart stood still there was a card attached to the flowers and mrs caldwell read aloud miss caldwell with respectful compliments who brought this harriet she asked no one maam harriet replied it was itched on till the knocker very strange mrs caldwell muttered suspiciously beth do you know anything about it is there no name on the card beth asked diplomatically and mrs caldwell looked at the card instead of into beths face and discovered nothing raindrops sparkled on the flowers their fragrance filled the room and their colours and forms and freshness were a joy to behold how beautiful they are mrs caldwell exclaimed may i have them mamma beth put in quickly well yes i suppose you may mrs caldwell decided although i must say i do not understand their being left in this way at all who could have sent you flowers theres the gardener at fairholm beth ventured to suggest oh ah yes said mrs caldwell handing the flowers to beth without further demur the gift appeared less lovely somehow when she began to associate it with the gardeners respectful compliments beth took the flowers and hid her burning face with them this was her first bouquet the most exquisite thing that had ever happened to her she carried it off to her room and put it in water and when she went to bed she kept the candle burning that she might lie and look at it the following week a menagerie came to the place alfred and dicksie went to it and their description filled beth with a wild desire to see the creatures especially the chimpanzee the boys were quite ready to take her but how was it to be managed the menagerie was only to be there that one night more but it would be open late and they would be allowed to go because animals are improving could she get out too beth considered intently i can go to bed early she said at last and get out by the actingroom window but suppose you were missed alfred deprecated then i should be found out said beth but you would not how about being recognised in the menagerie though said dicksie you see therell be lots of people and its all lighted up i can disguise myself to look like an old woman beth rejoined thinking of aunt victorias auburn front and some of her old things oh no beth alfred protested that would be worse than the whiskers cant you come as a boy said dicksie i believe i can beth exclaimed theres an old suit of jims somewhere that would be the very thingone he grew out of i believe its about my size and i think i know where it is what a splendid idea dicksie i can cut my hair off oh no your pretty hair alfred exclaimed is it pretty said beth surprised and pleased is it pretty he ejaculated lifting it with both hands and bathing his face in it the brightest brownest curliest softest sweetest hair on earth turn it up under your cap these little curls on your neck will look like short hair they were all so delighted with this romantic plan that they danced about and hugged each other promiscuously but this last piece of cleverness was their undoing for beth was promptly recognised at the menagerie by some one with a sense of humour who told lady benyon who told mrs caldwell mrs caldwell came hurrying home from lady benyons a few nights later with the queerest expression of countenance beth had ever seen it was something between laughing and crying beth she began in an agitated manner i am told that you went with two of mr richardsons sons to the menagerie on tuesday night dressed as a boy one of his sons said beth correcting her the other boy was his pupil and you were walking about looking at the animals in that public place with your arm round the girl from the shoeshop beth burst out laughing all the boys had their arms round girls she explained i couldnt be singular mrs caldwell dropped into a chair and sat gazing at beth as if she had never seen anything like her before as indeed she never had who is this pupil of mr richardsons she asked at last and how did you make his acquaintance his name is alfred cayley pounce beth answered we were caught by the tide and nearly drowned together on the sands and ive known him ever since and do you mean to say that you have been meeting this young man in a clandestine mannerthat you hadnt the proper pride to refuse to associate with him unless he were known to your family and you could meet him as an equal he did wish to make your acquaintance but i wouldnt let him beth said why mrs caldwell asked in amazement oh because i was afraid you would be horrid to him beth answered mrs caldwell was thunderstruck the whole affair had overwhelmed her as a calamity which could not be met by any ordinary means scolding was out of the question for she was not able to utter another word but just sat there with such a miserable face she might have been the culprit herself especially as she ended by bursting into tears beths heart smote her and she watched her mother for some time yearning to say something to comfort her i dont think you need be so distressed mamma she ventured at last what have i done after all ive committed no crime youve done just about as bad a thing as you could do mrs caldwell rejoined youve made the whole place talk about you you must have known you were doing wrong but i think you can have no conscience at all i think i have a conscience only it doesnt always act beth answered disconsolately very often when i am doing a wrong thing it doesnt accuse me when it does i stop and repent she was sitting beside the diningtable balancing a pencil on her finger as she spoke look at you now beth her mother ejaculated utterly callous beth sighed and put the pencil down she despaired of ever making her mother understand anything and determined not to try again beth i dont know what to do with you mrs caldwell recommenced after a long silence ive been warned again and again that i should have trouble with you and heaven knows i have youve done a monstrous thing and instead of being terrified when youre found out you sit there coolly discussing it as if you were a grownup person and then youre so queer you ought to be a child but youre not lady benyon likes you but even she says youre not a child and never were you say things no sane child would ever think of and very few grownup people you are not like other people theres no denying it beths eyes filled with tears to be thought unlike other people was the one thing that made her quail well mamma what am i to do she said i hate to vex you goodness knows but i must be doing something the days are long and dreary she wiped her eyes when people warned you that you would have trouble with me they always said unless you sent me to school mrs caldwell rocked herself on her chair forlornly school would do you no good she declared at last no beth you are my cross and i must bear it if i forgive you again this time will you be a better girl in future i dont believe its my fault that i ever annoy you beth answered drily whose fault is it then her mother demanded beth shrugged her shoulders and began to balance the pencil on her fingers once more mrs caldwell got up and stood looking at her for a little with a gathering expression of dislike on her face which it was not good to see then she went towards the door you are incorrigible she ejaculated as she opened it making the remark to cover her retreat beth sighed heavily then resolved herself into a christian martyr cruelly misjudgedan idea which she pursued with much satisfaction to herself for the rest of the day in consequence of that conversation with her mother when the evening came her conscience accused her and she made no attempt to go out she was to meet alfred and dicksie on saturday their next halfholiday and she would wait till then that was wednesday during the interval however a strange chill came over her feelings the thought of alfred was as incessant as ever but it came without the glow of delight something was wrong they were to meet on the rocks behind the far pier at low water on saturday few people came to the far pier and when they did it was seldom that they looked over and they could not have seen much if they had for the rocks were brown with seaweed and dark figures wandering about on them became indistinguishable beth went long before the time it was a beautiful still grey day such as she loved and she longed to be alone with the sea the tide was going out and she had a fancy for following it from rock to rock as it went some of the bigger rocks were flattopped islands separated from the last haltingplace of the tide by narrow straits across which she sprang and on these she would lie her length peering down into the clear depths on the farther side where the healthy happy seacreatures disported themselves and seaweeds of wondrous colours waved in fantastic forms the water lapped up and up and up the rocks rising with a sobbing sound and bringing fresh airs with it that fanned her face and caused her to draw in her breath involuntarily and inhale long deep draughts with delight as the water went out bright runnels were left where rivers had been and miniature bays became sheltered coves paved with polished pebbles or purple mussels and every little sandy space was ribbed with solid waves where the busy lobworms soon began to send up their ropy castings beyond the break of the water the silver sea sloped up to the horizon and on it rocking gently far out a few cobles were scattered with rich red sails all set ready waiting for a breeze it was an exquisite scene remote from all wail of human feeling and strangely tranquillising gradually it gained upon beth her bosom heaved with the heaving water rhythmically and she lost herself in contemplation of sea and sky scape before she had been many minutes prone upon the farthest rock the vision and the dream were upon her that other self of hers unfurled its wings and she floated off revelling in an ecstasy of gentle motion beyond the sealine were palaces with terraced gardens white palaces against which grass and trees showed glossy green and there she wandered among the flowers and waited she was waiting for something that did not happen for some one who did not come suddenly she sat up on her rock the sun was sinking behind her the silver sea shone iridescent the tide had turned but where were the boys she looked about her out on the sands beyond the rocks on her right a man was wading in the water with a net shrimping close at hand another was gathering mussels for bait and a gentleman was walking towards her over the slippery rocks balancing himself as though he found it difficult to keep his feet but these were the only people in sight the gentleman was a stranger he wore a darkblue suit with a shirt of wonderful whiteness and beth could not help noticing how altogether welldressed he wastoo welldressed for climbing on the rocks she noticed his dress particularly because welldressed men were rare in rainharbour he was tall with glossy black hair inclining to curl slight whiskers and moustache blue eyes and a bright complexion a woman with as much colour would have been accused of painting in him it gave to some people the idea of superabundant health to others it suggested a phthisical tendency beth looked at him as he approached as she looked at everybody and everything with interestnothing escaped her but he made no great impression upon her she thought of him principally as a man with a watch and when he was near enough she asked him what time it was he told her looking hard at her and smiling pleasantly as he returned his watch to his pocket she noticed that his teeth were good but too far apart a defect which struck her as unpleasant why it is quite late she exclaimed forgetting to thank him in her surprise are you all alone here he asked i was waiting for some friends she answered but they have not come they must have been detained she began to walk back as she spoke and the gentleman turned too perforce for the tide was close upon them let me help you he said holding out his hand which was noticeably white and wellshaped the rocks are rough and slippery i can manage thank you beth answered i am accustomed to them beth involuntarily resolved herself into a young lady the moment she addressed this man and spoke now with the selfpossession of one accustomed to courtesies even at that age her soft cultivated voice and easy assurance of manner and above all her laugh which was not the silvery laugh of fiction but the soundless laugh of good society marked the class to which she belonged and as he stumbled along beside her her new acquaintance wondered how it happened that she was at once so wellbred and so shabbily dressed he began to question her guardedly do you know rainharbour well he asked i live here beth answered then i suppose you know every one in the place he pursued oh no she rejoined i know very few people except my own of course which is considered the principal family here he asked the benyon family is the biggest and the wickedest i should think she answered casually but i meant the most important he explained smiling i dont know she said uncle james patten thinks that next to himself the benyons are he married one of them hes an awful snob and what is his position i dont knowhes a landowner thats his estate over there and she nodded towards fairholm indeed how far does it extend from the sea right up to the hills there and a little way beyond they had left the rocks by this time and were toiling up the steep road into the town when they reached the top beth exclaimed abruptly i am late i must fly and leaving her companion without further ceremony turned down a side street and ran home when she got in she wondered what had become of alfred and dicksie and she was conscious of a curious sort of suspense which however did not amount to anxiety it was as if she were waiting and listening for something she expected to hear which would explain in words what she held already inarticulate in some secret recess of her beingheld in suspense and felt but had not yet apprehended in the region of thought there are people who collect and hold in themselves some knowledge of contemporary events as the air collects and holds moisture it may be that we all do but only one here and there becomes aware of the fact as the impalpable moisture in the air changes to palpable rain so does this vague cognisance become a comprehensible revelation by being resolved into a shower of words on occasion by some process psychically analogous to the condensation of moisture in the air it is a natural phenomenon known to babes like beth but illobserved and not at all explained because man has gone such a little way beyond the bogey of the supernatural in psychical matters that he is still befogged and makes up opinions on the subject like a divine when miracles are in question instead of searching for information like an honest philosopher whose glory it is not to prove himself right but to discover the truth beth did not sleep much that night she recalled the sigh and sob and freshness of the sea and caught her breath again as if the cool water were still washing up and up and up towards her she saw the silver surface too stretching on to those shining palaces where grass and tree showed vivid green against white walls and flowers stood still on airless terraces shedding strange perfumes and she also saw her new acquaintance coming towards her balancing himself on the slippery wrackgrown rocks in boots and things that were much too good for the purpose but alfred and dicksie never appeared and were not to be found of her imagination they were nowhere she expected to see them in church next dayat least so she assured herself and then was surprised to find that there was no sort of certainty in herself behind the assurance although they had always hitherto been in church something is different somehow she thought and the phrase became a kind of accompaniment to all her thoughts dicksie was the first person she saw when she entered the church but alfred was not there and he did not come she went up the fieldpath after the service and waited about for dicksie when alfred was detained himself dicksie usually came to explain but that day he did not appear and they were neither of them at the evening service beth could not understand it but she was more puzzled than perturbed she was reading french to her mother next morning by way of a lesson when they both happened to look up and see mrs richardson the vicars wornout wife passing the window the next moment there was a knock at the door can she be coming here mrs caldwell exclaimed what should she come here for beth rejoined her heart palpitating oh dear oh dear this is just what i expected mrs caldwell declared and if only she had come last week i should have known nothing about it you dont know much as it is beth observed without however seeing why that should make any difference the next moment the vicars wife was ushered in with a wink by harriet mrs caldwell and beth both rose to receive her haughtily she had entered with assurance but that left her the moment she faced them and she became exceedingly nervous she was surprised at the ease and grace of these shabbilydressed ladies and the refinement of their surroundingsthe design of the furniture the colour of curtains and carpet the china the books the pictures all of which bespoke tastes and habits not common in the parish i must apologise for this intrusion she began nervously i have a most unpleasant task to perform my husband requested me to come why didnt he come himself beth asked blandly why does he make you do the disagreeable part of his duties the vicars wife raised her meek eyes and gazed at beth she had not anticipated this sort of reception from poor parishioners and was completely nonplussed she was startled too by beths last question for she belonged to the days of brave unhonoured endurance when women meekly allowing themselves to be classed with children and idiots exacted no respect and received noneno woman decent or otherwise being safe from insult in the public streets when they were expected to do difficult and dirty work for their husbands such as canvassing at elections without acknowledgment their wit and capacity being traded upon without scruple to obtain from men the votes which they were not deemed wise and worthy enough to have themselves the days when they gave all and received nothing in return save doles of bread and contempt varied by such caresses as a good dog gets when his master is in the mood that was the day before woman began to question the wisdom and goodness of man his justice and generosity his right to make a virtue of wallowing when he chose to wallow and his disinterestedness and discretion when he also arrogated to himself the power to order all things mrs richardson had no more thought of questioning the beauty of her husbands decisions than she had thought of questioning the logic and mercy of her god and this first flash of the new spirit of inquiry from beths bright wit came upon her with a shock at firstone of those shocks to the mind which is as the strength of wine to the exhausted body that checks the breath a moment then rouses and stimulates may i sit down she gasped then dropped into a chair he might have come himself to be sure she muttered i have more than enough to do that is disagreeable in my own womanly sphere without being required to meddle in parish matters yet when her husband had said to her it is a very disagreeable business indeed this i think ill get you to go youll manage it with so much more tact than a man the poor lady unaccustomed to compliments was gratified now however thanks to beth she had been nearer to making an acute observation than she had ever been in her life before she all but perceived that the womans sphere is never home exclusively when man can make use of her for his own purposes elsewhere the sphere is the stable he ties her up in when he does not want her and takes her from again to drag him out of a difficulty or up to some distinction just as it suits himself mrs caldwell and beth waited for mrs richardson to commit herself but gave her no further help the truth is she recommenced desperately we have lost an excellent pupil his people have been informed that he was carrying on an intrigue with a girl in this place and have taken him away at a moments notice and what has that to do with us mrs caldwell asked politely the girl is said to be your daughter this is my eldest daughter at home mrs caldwell answered she is not yet fourteen but shes a very big girl mrs richardson faltered who is this person this pupil you allude to mrs caldwell asked superciliously he is the son of wealthy nottingham people ah lace manufacturers i suppose mrs caldwell rejoined yess mrs richardson acknowledged with reluctance she associated as she was expected to do with gentlemen who debauched themselves freely but would have scorned the acquaintance of a shopman of saintly life then certainly not a proper acquaintance for my daughter mrs caldwell decided with the manner of a county lady speaking to a person whom she knows to be nobody by birth beth will you be good enough to tell us what you know of this youth i was caught by the tide on the sands one day and he was there and helped me and i always spoke to him afterwards i thought i ought for politeness sake beth answered easily may i ask how that strikes you mrs caldwell turning to mrs richardson requested to know but did not wait for a reply it strikes me she proceeded that your husbands parish must be in an appalling state of neglect and disorder when slander is so rife that he loses a good pupil because an act of common politeness a service rendered by a youth on the one hand and acknowledged by a young lady on the other is described as an intrigue but i still fail to see she pursued haughtily why you should have come to spread this scandal here in my house oh the little woman faltered i was to ask if there had been anyany presents but she added hastily to save herself from the wrath which she saw gathering on mrs caldwells face i am sure there were not im sure you would never bring a breach of promise caseim sure it has all been a dreadful mistake if mr richardson wants anything of this kind done in future he must do it himself i apologise she uttered the last word with a gasp let me show you out said beth and the discomforted lady found herself ushered into the street without further ceremony when beth returned she found her mother smiling blandly at the result of her diplomacy it was probably the first effort of the kind the poor lady had ever made and she was so elated by her success that she took beth into her confidence and forgave her outright in order to hobnob with her on the subject i think i fenced with her pretty well she said several times a woman of her class a country attorneys daughter or something of that kind is no match for a woman of mine i hope beth this will be a lesson to you and will teach you to appreciate the superior tact and discretion of the upper classes beth could not find it in her heart to say a word to check her mothers jubilation besides she had played up to her answering to expectation as she was apt to do with fatal versatility but she did not feel that they had come out of the business well it was as if their honesty had been bedraggled somehow and she could not respect her mother for her triumph on the contrary she pitied her that kind of diplomacy or tact the means by which people who have had every advantage impose upon those who have had no advantages to speak of did not appeal to beth as pleasant even at fourteen mrs caldwell put her work away at once and hurried off to describe the encounter to lady benyon they had not heard of the menagerie affair i suppose the old lady observed twinkling thanks to yourself i think you may consider miss beth is well out of that scrape but take my advice get that girl married the first chance you have i know girls and shes one of the marrying kind once shes married let her mutiny or do anything she likes youll be shut of the responsibility chapter xxviii from that time forward it was as if alfred had vanished into space whether he ever attempted to communicate with her beth could not tell but she received no letter or message she expected to hear from him through dicksie but it soon became apparent that dicksie had deserted her he came to none of their old haunts and never looked her way in church or in the street when they met she was ashamed to believe it of him at first lest some defect in her own nature should have given rise to the horrid suspicion but when she could no longer doubt it she shrugged her shoulders as at something contemptible and dismissed him from her mind about alfred she could not be sure he might have sent letters and messages that never reached her and therefore she would not blame him but as the thought of him became an ache she resolutely set it aside so that in a very short time in that part of her consciousness where his image had been there was a blank thus the whole incident ended like a light extinguished as beth acknowledged to herself at last it is curious though she thought but i certainly knew it in myself all along from the moment the change came if only i could have got at the knowledge as a direct result of her separation from alfred beth entered upon a bad phase the simple satisfaction of her heart in his company had kept her sane and healthy with such a will as hers it had not been hard to cast him out of her anticipations but with him there went from her life that wholesome companionship of boy and girl which contains all the happiness necessary for their immaturity and also stimulates their growth in every way by holding out the alluring prospect of the fulfilment of those hopes of their being towards which their youth should aspire from the first insensibly but without pause having once known this companionship beth did not thrive without it she had no other interest in its place to take her out of herself and the time hung heavy on her hands with her temperament however more than a momentary pause was impossible her active mind being bare of all expectation soon began to sate itself upon vain imaginings for the rational plans and pursuits she had been accustomed to make and to carry out with the boys she had nothing to substitute but dreams and on these she lived finding an idle distraction in them until the habit grew disproportionate and began to threaten the fine balance of her other faculties her reason her power of accurate observation and of assimilating every scrap of knowledge that came in her way to fill up her empty days she surrounded herself with a story among the crowding incidents of which she lived whatever she might be doing she had a lover who frequented a wonderful dwelling on the other side of the headland that bounded rainharbour bay on the north he was rich dark handsome a mysterious man with horses and a yacht she was his one thought but they did not meet often because of their enemies he was engaged upon some difficult and dangerous work for the good of mankind and she had many a midnight ride to warn him to beware and many a wild adventure in an open boat going out in the dark for news but there were happy times too when they lived together in that handsome house hidden among the flowers behind the headland and at night she always slept with her head on his shoulder he had a confidential agent a doctor whom he sent to her with letters and messages because it was not safe for him to appear in the public streets himself this man was just like the one she had met on the rocks and his clothes were always too good for the occasion his name was angus ambrose cleveland just at this time charlotte hardy the daughter of a doctor who lived next door to the benyon dower house fell in love with beth and began to make much of her beth had never had a girl companion before and although she rather looked down on charlotte she enjoyed the novelty they were about the same age but charlotte was smaller than beth less precocious and better educated she knew things accurately that beth had only an idea of but beth could make more use of a hint than charlotte could of the fullest information beth respected her knowledge however and suffered pangs of humiliation when she compared it to her own ignorance and it was by way of having something to show of equal importance that she gradually fell into the habit of confiding her romance to charlotte who listened in perfect good faith to the fascinating details which beth poured forth from day to day beth did not at first intend to impose on her credulity but when she found that charlotte in her simplicity believed the whole story she adapted her into it and made her as much a part of it as hector the hero and dr angus ambrose cleveland the confidential agent on whom their safety depended charlotte was beths confidante now a post which had hitherto been vacant so the whole machinery of the romance was complete and in excellent order its queer i never see the doctor about charlotte said one day when they were out on the cliffs together beth happened to look up at that moment and saw her acquaintance of the rocks coming towards them your curiosity will be gratified she said for there he is where charlotte demanded in an excited undertone approaching beth answered calmly will he speak charlotte asked in a breathless whisper he will doubtless make me a sign beth replied when he was near enough the gentleman recognised beth and smiled as they passed each other oughtnt he to have taken off his hat charlotte asked he means no disrespect beth answered with dignity it is safer so in fact if you had not been my confidante he would not have dared to make any sign at all oh then he knows that i am your confidante charlotte exclaimed much gratified of course said beth i have to keep them informed of all that concerns me i brought you here today on purpose i shall doubtless have to ask you to take letters and you could not deliver them if you did not know the doctor by sight there is the yacht she added as a beautiful whitewinged vessel swept round the headland into the bay o beth arent you excited charlotte cried no beth answered quietly you see i am used to these things beth what a strange creature you are said charlotte with respect one can see that theres something extraordinary about you but one cant tell what it is youre not prettyat least i dont think so i asked papa what he thought and he said you had your points and a something beyond which is irresistible he couldnt explain it though but i know what he meant i always feel it when you talk to me and i believe i could die for you theres mrs warner benyon out again she broke off to observe papa was called in to see her the other day he isnt their doctor but she was taken ill suddenly so they sent for him because he was at hand and he says her shoulders are like alabaster beth pursed up her mouth at this but made no answer when she got home however she repeated the observation to her mother in order to ask her what alabaster was exactly mrs caldwell flushed indignantly at the story if dr hardy speaks in that way of his patients to his family he wont succeed in his profession she declared a man who talks about his patients may be a clever doctor but hes sure not to be a nice mannot highminded you knowand certainly not a wise one remember that beth and take my advice dont have anything to do with a talking doctora recommendation which beth remembered afterwards but only to note the futility of warnings matters became very complicated in the story as it proceeded it was all due to some spanish imbroglio beth said hector ran extraordinary risks and she was not too safe herself if things went wrong there were implicating documents and emissaries of the jesuits were on the lookout one day charlottes mother being away from home beth asked her mysteriously if she could conceal some one in her room at night unknown to her father easily charlotte answered he never comes up to my room then you must come and ask mamma to let me spend the day and night with you tomorrow beth said i shall have business which will keep me away all day but i shall return at dusk and then you must smuggle me up to your room we shall be obliged to sit up all night i dont know what is going to happen are the servants safe if i should be betrayed safe not to tell you are there said charlotte and that is all they will know they wont tell on me i never tell on them the next morning early charlotte arrived in orchard street with a face full of grave importance and obtained mrs caldwells consent to take beth back with her but instead of having to go home to spend the day alone waiting for beth as she had expected she was sent out some distance along the cliffs to a high hill which she climbed by beths direction she was to hide herself among the firtrees at the top and watch for a solitary rider on a big brown horse who would pass on the road below between noon and sunset if all went well going towards the headland i shall be that rider beth said solemnly and the moment you see me take this blue missive and place it on the flat rock with a stone on it to keep it from blowing away then go home if i do not appear before sunset here is a red missive to place on the flat rock instead of the blue one which must then be destroyed by fire if i return i return if not never breathe a word of these things to a living soul as you value your life i would rather die than divulge anything charlotte protested solemnly and her choice of the word divulge seemed to add considerably to the dignity of the proceedings they separated with a casual nod that people might not suspect them of anything important and each proceeded to act her part in a delightful state of excitement but what was thrilling earnest to charlotte calling for courage and endurance was merely an exhilarating play of the fancy put into practice to beth by the time charlotte arrived at the top of the hill and had settled herself among the firs overlooking the road below she was very tired beth had given her a bag one of aunt victorias many reticules with orders not to open it before her watch began the bag had been a burden to carry but charlotte was repaid for the trouble for she found it full of good things to eat and a bottle of cold coffee and cream to drink with lumps of sugar and all complete beth had really displayed the most thoughtful kindness in packing that bag the contents she had procured on a sudden impulse from a pastrycook in the town by promising to pay the next time she passed after having very much enjoyed a solid melton mowbray pie a sausage in puffpastry a spongecake a lemon cheesecake and two crisp brandy snaps and slowly sipped the coffee charlotte felt that this was the only life worth living and formally vowed to dedicate herself for ever to the secret service of humanitybeths name for these enterprises she kept a careful eye on the road below all this time and there ran through her head the while fragments of a ballad beth had written which added very much to the charm of the occasion the firtrees whisper overhead between the living and the dead i watch the livelong day i watch upon the mountainside for one of courage true and tried who should ride by this way it began when she first heard that beth had written that ballad charlotte was astonished it was the only assertion of beths she had ever doubted but beth assured her that any one could write verses and convinced her by making some up there and then on a subject which she got charlotte to choose for her many things passed on the road belowteams of waggons drawn by beautiful big carthorses with glossy coats well cared for tossing their headland rattling the polished brasses of their harness proudly signs of successful farming and affluence smart carriages with what beth called sillyfool ladies good for nothing in them a carriers cart pedestrians innumerable and thenthen at last a solitary big brown horse ridden at a steady canter by a slender girl in a brown habit worn by her mother in her youth and borrowed from her wardrobe without permission for the occasion the horse was a brokendown racer with some spirit left which beth had hired as she had procured the provisions on a promise to pay in passing she waved a white handkerchief carelessly as if she were flicking flies from the horse but without relenting her speed this was the signal agreed upon charlotte glowing with excitement and greatly relieved watched the adventurous rider out of sight then trudged off bravely to the flat rock miles away behind the far pier where she loyally deposited the blue missive the red one she destroyed by fire according to orders beth had warned her that she would be tired to death when she got in and had better snatch some repose in preparation for the night but if i oversleep myself and am not on the lookout for you when you come what will you do charlotte objected leave that to me said beth and charlotte did accordingly with perfect confidence when she awoke the room was dark but there was a motionless figure sitting in the window clearly silhouetted against the sky charlotte who expected surprises was pleasantly startled is all safe in the west sister she said softly raising herself on her elbow yes was the reply but clouds are gathering in the north our hope is in the east let us pray for the sunrise you left the letter yes as fast as i could fly i went ah then it will be gone by this time beth ejaculated with conviction the flat rock was only uncovered at low water and now the tide was high can you get me some food little one for i am famished she proceeded i have had nothing since the morning and have ridden far and have done much oh dear oh dear said charlotte and you got me such good things ah that was different beth rejoined charlotte stole downstairs her father had been out seeing his patients all day and had not troubled about her she returned with chicken and ham cold appletart and cream and a little jug of cider poor beth accustomed to the most uninteresting food and not enough of that was so exhausted by her long fast and arduous labours that she found it difficult to restrain her tears at the sight of such good things she ate and drank with seemly selfrestraint however it would have lowered her much in her own estimation if she had showed any sign of the voracity she felt then the watch began having wrapped themselves up in their walking things to be ready for any emergency they locked the door and opened the window softly they were in a room at the top of the house which being next door to the benyons commanded the same extensive view down the front street and a bit of rock street and the back street and up orchard street on the left to the church they were watching for a sailor in a smart yachting suit a manofwars man with bare feet and a priest in a heavy black cloak beth greatly refreshed and stimulated by her supper and the cider fell into her most fascinating mood and charlotte listened enthralled to wonderful descriptions of places she had visited with hector sights she had seen and events she had taken part in but how is it you are not missed from home when you go away like that said charlotte how is it i am not missed tonight beth answered when you are fully initiated into the secret service of humanity you will find that things happen in a way you would never suspect i suppose it is all right and proper being so much alone with single gentlemen charlotte just ventured all things are right and proper so long as you do nothing wrong beth answered sententiously lights began to move from room to room in the houses about them gigantic shadows of people appeared on white window blinds in fantastic poses and there was much moving to and fro as they prepared for bed then one by one the lights went out and in the little oldfashioned windowpanes the dark brightness of the sky and the crystal stars alone were reflected it was a fine clear night the gas burnt brightly in the quiet streets there was not a soul stirring isnt it exquisite said beth sniffing the sweet air i am glad i was born if it is only for the sake of being alive at night after this they were silent then by degrees the desire for sleep became imperative and they both suffered acutely in their efforts to resist it finally charlotte was vanquished and beth made her lie down on the bed as she dropped off she saw beth sitting rigidly at the open window when she awoke it was bright daylight and beth was still there in exactly the same attitude beth she exclaimed you are superhuman ah said beth with a mysterious smile when you have learnt to listen to the whispers of the night and know what they signify as i do you will not wonder marvellous things have been happening while you slept o beth said charlotte reproachfully why didnt you wake me i was forbidden beth answered sadly but now watch for me it is your turn and i must sleep a yachtsman or a manofwars man with bare feet remember beth curled herself up on the bed and charlotte very weary and aching all over but sternly determined to do her duty took her place in the window she had her reward however and when beth awoke she found her all on the alert for she had seen the yachtsman he came up the street and hung about a little pretending to look at the shops then walked away briskly which showed charlotte that the plot was thickening and greatly excited her beth smiled and nodded as though well satisfied when she heard the news but preserved an enigmatical silence then charlotte went downstairs and smuggled her up such a good breakfastfried ham boiled eggs hot rolls with plenty of butter and delicious coffeethat the famishing beth was fain to exclaim with genuine enthusiasm in spite of all the difficulty danger and privation we have to endure in the secret service of humanity charlotte is there anything to equal the delight of it and charlotte solemnly asseverated that there was not much stimulated by her breakfast beth took leave of charlotte she must be alone she said she had much to think about she went to the farther shore to be away from everybody she wanted to hear what the little waves were saying to the sand as they rippled over it it was another grey day close and still and the murmur of the calm sea threw her at once into a dreamy state full of pleasurable excitement she hid herself in a spot most soothing from its apparent remoteness a sandy cove from which because of the projecting cliffs on either hand neither town nor coast could be seen but only the sea and sky although the grey was uniform enough to make it impossible to tell where cloud met water on the horizon it was not dull but luminous with the sunshine it enfolded and full of colour in fine gradations as beth beheld it she sat a long time on the warm dry sand with her chin resting on her knees and her hands clasped round them not gazing with seeing eyes nor listening with open ears but apprehending through her further faculty the great harmony of nature of which she herself was one of the triumphant notes at that moment she tasted life at its best and fullestlife all ease and grace and beauty without regret or longingperfect life in that she wanted nothing more but she rose at last and still gazing at the sea slowly unclasped her waistbelt and let it fall on the sand at her feet then she took her hat off her dress her boots and stockings everything and stood ivorywhite with bright brown wavy hair against the lilac greyness under the tall dark cliffs the little waves had called her coming up closer and closer and fascinating her until yielding to their allurements she went in amongst them and floated on them or lay her length in the shallows letting them ripple over her and make merry about her the gladdest girl alive yet with the wrapt impassive face of a devotee whose ecstasy is apart from all that acts on mere flesh and makes expression all through life beth had her moments and they were generally such as this when her higher self was near upon release from its fetters and she arose an interval towards oneness with the eternal but on this occasion she was surprised in her happy solitude a troop of what mrs caldwell called common girls came suddenly round the cliff into her sheltered nook with shouts of laughter also bent on bathing beth plunged in deeper to cover herself the moment they appeared but they did not expect her to have anything on and her modesty was lost upon them hows the water they shouted delicious she answered glad to find them friendly they undressed as they came along and were very soon all of them playing about her ducking and splashing each other and beth also including her sociably in their game and beth as was her wont responded so cordially that she was very soon heading the manoeuvres we shall all be ill if we stay in any longer she said at last i shall take one more dip and go and dress lets all take hands and dip in a row they did so and then still hand in hand scampered up on to the beach my one of them exclaimed when they came to their clothes and had broken the linemy aint she nice then all the other girls stood and stared at beth whose fine limbs and satinsmooth white skin so different in colour and texture from their own drew from them the most candid expressions of admiration beth covered with confusion hurried on a garment all wet as she was for she had no towel and then in order to distract their attention from her body she began to display her mind eh i have had a good time one of the girls exclaimed lets come again often let us form a secret society said beth and i will be your leader and well have a watchword and a sign and when the water is right ill send the word round and then well start out unobserved and meet here and bathe in secret my that would be fine the girls agreed but thats not all said beth standing with her chemise only half on oblivious of everything now but her subject it would be much better than that there would be much more in it we could meet in the fields by moonlight and i would drill you and show you a great many things all for the secret service of humanity you dont know what were doing were going to make the world just like heaven and everybody will be good and beautiful and have enough of everything and we shall all be happy because nobody will care to be happy unless everybody else has been made so but it will be very hard work to bring it about the wicked people are doing all they can to prevent us and the devil himself is fighting against us we shall conquer however and those who are first in the fight will be first for the glory the girls some standing some sitting most of them with nothing on remained motionless while she spoke not understanding much yet so moved by the power of her personality that when she exclaimed well what do you say girls will you join they all exclaimed with enthusiasm we will we will and then they made haste to dress as if the millennium could be hurried here by the rate at which they put on their clothes beth then and there composed a terrible oath binding them to secrecy and obedience and swore them all in solemnly then she chose one for her orderly who was to take round the word on occasion and they were all to meet again in the fields behind the church on saturday at eight oclock but in the meantime not a word beth made charlotte captain of the band and drills bathing rites and other mysteries were regularly conducted the girls being bound together more securely by the fascination of beths discourses and the continual interest she managed to inspire than by any respect they had for an oath beths interest in them extended to the smallest detail of their lives she knew which would be absent from drill because it was washingday and which was weak for want of food and she resumed her poaching habitsonly on uncle james pattens estate of courseand having beguiled a gunsmith into letting her have an airgun on credit she managed to snare and shoot birds enough to relieve their necessities to an appreciable extent she never let any one into the secret of those supplies and the mystery added greatly to her credit with the girls that season some friends of the benyons brought their boys to stay at rainharbour for the holidays and beth varied her other pursuits by rambling about with them lady benyon having seen to it that she made their acquaintance legitimately for the old lady shrewdly suspected that beth was already beginning to attract attention from her post of observation in the window she had seen young men turn in the street and look back at the slender girl in spite of her short petticoats with more interest than many a maturer figure aroused and she had heard that beth caldwell was already much discussed beths brother jim when he came home that summer also began to introduce her to his young men friends in the neighbourhood so that very soon beth had quite a little court about her on the pier when the band played she liked the boys and the young men she found an absorbing study but not one of them touched her heart her acquaintance with alfred had made her fastidious he had had sense enough to respect her and his companionship had given her a fine foretaste of the love that is ennobling the love that makes for high ideals of character and conduct for fine purpose spiritual power and intellectual development the one kind worth cultivating in these more sophisticated youths she found nothing soulsustaining she philandered with some of them up to the point where comparisons become inevitable and so long as they met her in a spirit of frank camaraderie it was agreeable enough but when with their commonplace minds they presumed to be sentimental they became intolerable still the glow was there in her breast often and often and would be momentarily directed towards one and another but the brightness of it only showed the defects in each and so she remained in love with love alone and the power of passion in her thwarted was transmuted into mental energy but beth learnt a good deal from her young men that summerlearnt her own power for one thing when she found that she could twist the whole lot of them round her little finger if she chose the thing about them that interested her most however was their point of view she found one trait common to all of them when they talked to her and that was a certain assumption of superiority which impressed her very much at first so that she was prepared to accept their opinions as confidently as they gave them and they always had one ready to give on no matter what subject beth perceiving that this superiority was not innate tried to discover how it was acquired that she might cultivate it gathering from their attitude towards her ignorance that this superiority rested somehow on a knowledge of the latin grammar she hunted up an old one of her brothers and opened it with awe so much seemed to depend on it verbs and declensions came easily enough to her however the construction of the language was puzzling at the outset but with a little help she soon discovered that even in that there was nothing occult any industrious persevering person could learn a language she decided and then she made more observations she discovered that in the estimation of men feminine attributes are all inferior to masculine attributes any evidence of reasoning capacity in a woman they held to be abnormal and they denied that women were ever logical they had to allow that womens intuition was often accurate but it was inferior nevertheless they maintained to mans uncertain reason and such qualities as were undeniable they managed to discount as for instance in the matter of endurance if women were long enduring they said it was not because their fortitude was greater but because they were less sensitive to suffering and so in point of fact suffered less than men would under the circumstances this persistent endeavour to exalt themselves by lowering women struck beth as mean and made her thoughtful she began by respecting their masculine minds as much as they did themselves but then came a doubt if they were any larger and more capable than the minds of women would be if they were properly trained and developed and she began to dip into the books they prided themselves on having read to see if they were past her comprehension she studied popes translation of the iliad and odyssey indoors and she also took the little volume out under her arm but this was a pose for she could not read out of doors there were always so many other interests to occupy her attentionbirds and beasts men and women trees and flowers land and water all much more entrancing than the iliad or odyssey long years afterwards she returned to these oldworld works with keen appreciation and wondered at her early self but when she read them first she took their meanings too literally and soon wearied of warlike heroes however great a number of their fellowcreatures they might slay at a time and of chattel heroines however beautiful which was all that homer conveyed to her not did she find herself elated by her knowledge of their exploits she noticed however that the acquisition of such knowledge imposed upon the boys and gained her a reputation for cleverness which made the young university prigs think it worth their while to talk to her they had failed to discover her natural powers because there was no one to tell them she had any and they only thought what they were told to think about people and things and admired what they were told to admire in this beth differed from them widely for she began by having tastes of her own she did not believe that they enjoyed homer a bit more than she did but the right pose was to pretend that they did so they posed and pretended according to order and beth posed and pretended too just to see what would come of it it was a young tutor in charge of a readingparty who helped beth with the latin grammar he managed to ingratiate himself with mrs caldwell and came often to the house and finally he began to teach beth latin at her own request and with the consent of her mother the lessons had not gone on very long however before he tried to insinuate into his teaching some of the kind of sophistries which another tutor had imposed by way of moral philosophy on rousseaus madame de warens in her girlhood to her undoing this was all new to beth and she listened with great interest but she failed utterly to see why not believing in a god should make it right and proper for her to embrace the tutor so the lessons ended abruptly beth profited largely by the acquaintance howevernot so much at the time perhaps as afterwards when she was older and had gained knowledge enough of men of various kinds to enable her to compare and reflect it was her first introduction to the commonplace cleverness of the academic mind the mere acquisitive faculty which lives on pillage originates nothing itself and as a rule fails to understand let alone appreciate originality in others the young tutors ambition was to be one of a shining literary clique of extraordinary cheapness which had just then begun to be formed the taint of a flippant wit was common to all its members and their assurance was unbounded they undertook to extinguish anybody with a few fine phrases and in their conceited irreverence they even attacked eternal principles the sources of the best inspiration of all ages and pronounced sentence upon them repute of a kind they gained but it was by glib falsifications of all that is noble in sentiment thought and action all that is good and true it was the contraction of her own heart the chill and dulness that settled upon her when she was with this man as compared to the glow and expansion the release of her finer faculties which she had always experienced when under the influence of aunt victorias simple goodness that first put beth in the way of observing how inferior in force and charm mere intellect is to spiritual power and how soon it bores even when brilliant if unaccompanied by other endowments qualities of heart and soul such as constancy loyalty truthfulness and that scrupulous honesty of action which answers to what is expected as well as to what is known of us beth played very diligently at learning during this experiment but only played for a time the mind in process of forming itself involuntarily rejects all that is unnecessary and that kind of knowledge was not for her it opened up no prospect of pleasure in itself all she cared to know was what it felt like to have mastered it and that she arrived at by resolving herself into a lady of great attainments who talked altogether about things she had learnt but had nothing in her mind besides a mind with nothing else in it in beths sense of the word was to beth what plainness is to beauty so while many of her contemporaries were stultifying themselves with greek and latin ingenuities she pursued the cultivation of that in herself which is beyond our ordinary apprehension that which is more potent than knowledge more fertilising to the mindthat by which knowledge is converted from a fallow field into a fruitful garden altogether apart from her special subject she learnt only enough of anything to express herself but it was extraordinary how aptly she utilised all that was necessary for her purpose and how invariably she found what she wantedif found be the right word for it was rather as if information were flashed into her mind from some outside agency at critical times when she could not possibly have done without it one sad consequence of her separation from alfred and the strange things she did and dreamed for distraction in the unrest of her mind was a change in her constitution her first fine flush of health was over the equability of her temper was disturbed and she became subject to hysterical outbursts of garrulity to fits of moody silence to apparently causeless paroxysms of laughter or tears and she was always anxious she had real cause for anxiety however for in her efforts to realise her romance to charlottes satisfaction she had run up little bills all over the place what would happen when they were presented as they certainly would be sooner or later she dared not think but the dread of the moment preyed upon her mind to such an extent that whenever she heard a knock at the door she entreated god to grant that it might not be a bill and even when there were no knocks she went on entreating to be spared and worked herself into such a chronic fever of worry that she was worn to a shadow and developed a racking cough which gave her no peace just at this time too the whole place began to be scandalised by her vagaries her mysterious expeditions on the big brown horse and her constant appearance in public with a coterie of young men about her at a time when anything unconventional in a girl was clear evidence of vice to all the men and most of the women who knew of it beths reputation was bound to suffer and it became so bad at last that dr hardy forbade charlotte to associate with her charlotte told her with tears and begged to be allowed to meet her in the secret service of humanity as usual but beth refused she said it was too dangerous just then they must wait the truth being that she was sick of the secret service of humanity of charlotte of everything and everybody that prevented her hearing when there was a knock at the door and praying to the lord that it might not be a bill the secret society was practically dissolved by this time and very soon afterwards the catastrophe beth had been dreading occurred and wrought a great change in her life it happened one day when she was not at home aunt grace mary was so alarmed by her cough and the delicacy of her appearance that she had braved uncle james and carried her off to stay with her at fairholm for a change once she was away from the sound of the knocks beth suffered less and began to revive and be herself again to the extent of taking aunt grace mary into her confidence boldly beth beth beth said that poor good lady tenderly you naughty girl how could you running in debt with nothing to pay why it isnt honest so i think said beth in cordial agreement taking herself aside from her own acts as it were and considering them impartially help me out of this scrape aunt grace mary and ill never get into such another but how much do you owe beth dear im sure i dont know beth answered pounds for tom briggs alone whos he was aunt grace marys horrified exclamation oh only the horsea dark bay with black points i rode him a lot and oh it was nice it was like poetry like living it you know like being a poem ones self and im glad i did it if i should die for it i couldnt regret it and i shouldnt wonder if i did die for i feel as if those knocks had fairly knocked me to bits nonsense beth you silly child dont talk like that said aunt grace mary what else do you owe oh then theres mrs andrews the confectioners bill confectioners aunt grace mary exclaimed o beth i never thought you were greedy well i dont think i am beth answered temperately ive been very hungry though but i never touched any of those good things myself i only got them for charlotte when she had heavy work to do for the secret service of humanity the what aunt grace mary demanded the game we played then theres the hairdressers bill that must be pretty big i had to get curls and plaits and combs and things besides having my hair dressed for entertainments to which i was obliged to go beth are you mad aunt grace mary interrupted youve never been to an entertainment in your life no beth answered casually but ive played at going to no end of a lot well this is the most extraordinary game i ever heard of but it was such an exciting game beth pleaded with a sigh but my dear child such a reckless unprincipled game but you dont think of that at the time beth assured her its all real and right then we but here the colloquy was interrupted by the arrival of mrs caldwell in a state of distraction with the hairdressers bill in her hand aunt grace mary made her sit down and patted her shoulder soothingly uncle james was out beth greatly relieved looked on with interest she knew that the worst was over never mind caroline aunt grace mary said cheerfully beth has just been telling me all about it confession is good for the saints you know or the soul or something so thats cheering she has been very naughty very naughty indeed but she is very sorry she sincerely regrets hairdresser did you say oh give it to me now do give it to me theres a dear and we wont have another word about it beth you bad girl be good and say you repent say it beth ejaculated coughing look at me and youll see it aunt grace mary ive been repenting myself to pieces for months well dear well dear aunt grace mary rejoined beaming blandly that will do thats enough im sure mamma forgives you so well have no more about it the hairdressers bill was the only one mrs caldwell ever heard of for aunt grace mary got the use of her pony carriage next day by telling uncle james her mamma had sent caroline to say she particularly wished her to take beth to see her uncle james to whom any whim of lady benyons was wisdom ordered the carriage for them himself and as they drove off together aunt grace mary remarked to beth i think i managed that very cleverly dont you naturally estimable women are forced into habits of dissimulation by the unreason of the tyrant in authority in many families and aunt grace mary was one of the victims she had been obliged to resort to these small deceits for so many years that all she felt about them now was a sort of mild triumph when they were successful i mean to go and see mamma you know so it wont be any story she added she went with beth first however to the various shops where beth owed money and paid her debts and beth was so overcome by her generosity and so anxious to prove her repentance that she borrowed sixpence more from her and went straightway to the hairdressers and had all her pretty hair cropped off close like a boys by way of atonement when she appeared lady benyon burst out laughing but her mother was even more seriously annoyed than she had been by the hairdressers bill beths hair had added considerably to her market value in mrs caldwells estimation she would not have put it so coarsely but that was what her feeling on the subject amounted to what is to be done with such a child she exclaimed in despair send her to school aunt grace mary gasped she would be expelled in a month mrs caldwell averred possibly but it would be worth the trial aunt grace mary rejoined in her breathless way yes lady benyon agreed she has been at home far too long running wild and its the only thing to be done but let it be a strict school how am i to afford it mrs caldwell wailed rocking herself on her chair well theres the royal service school for officers daughters you can get her in there for next to nothing and its strict enough lady benyon suggested and finally after the loss of some more precious time and with much reluctance mrs caldwell yielded to public opinion and decided to deprive jim of beths little income and send beth to school some new enormities of beths having helped considerably to hasten her mothers decision chapter xxix mrs caldwells married life had been one long sacrifice of herself her health her comfort her every pleasure to what she conceived to be right and dutiful duty and right were the only two words approaching to a religious significance that she was not ashamed to use to her all the other words savoured of cant and even these two she pronounced without emphasis or solemnity lest the sense in which she used them might be mistaken for a piece of religiosity of the joy and gladness of religion the poor lady had no conception nevertheless as has already been said mrs caldwell was an admirable person according to the light of her time to us she appears to have been a good woman marred first of all by the narrow outlook the ignorance and prejudices which were the result of the mental restrictions imposed upon her sex secondly by having no conception of her duty to herself and finally by those mistaken notions of her duty to others which were so long inflicted upon women to be their own curse and the misfortune of all whom they were designed to benefit she had sacrificed her health in her early married life to what she believed to be her duty as a wife and so had left herself neither nerve nor strength enough for the neverending tasks of the mistress of a household and mother of a family on a small income the consequence of which was that shortness of temper and querulousness which spoilt her husbands life and made her own a burden to her she was highly intelligent but had carefully preserved her ignorance of life because it was not considered womanly to have any practical knowledge of the world and she had neglected the general cultivation of her mind partly because intellectual pursuits were a pleasure and she did not feel sufficiently selfdenying if she allowed herself any but exceptional pleasures but also because there was a good deal of her husbands work in the way of letters and official documents that she could do for him and these left her no time for anything but the inevitable making and mending busy men take a sensible amount of rest and relaxation of food and fresh air and make good speed but busy women look upon outdoor exercise as a luxury talk about wasting time on meals and toil on incessantly yet with everdiminishing strength because they take no time to recoup therefore they recede rather than advance all the extra effort but makes for leeway the consequence of mrs caldwells ridiculous education was that her judgment was no more developed in most respects than it had been in her girlhood so that when she lost her husband and had to act for her children she had nothing better to rely on for her guidance than timehonoured conventions which she accepted with unquestioning faith in their efficacy even when applied to emergencies such as were never known in the earlier ages of human evolution to which they belonged she had starved herself and her daughters in mind and body in order to scrape together the wherewithal to send her sons out into the world but she had let them go without making any attempt to help them to form sound principles or to teach them rules of conduct such as should keep them cleanhearted and make them worthy members of society so that all her privation had been worse than vain it had been mischievous for the boys unaided by any scheme or comprehensive view of life any knowledge of the meaning of it to show them what was worth aiming at and also unprotected by positive principles had drifted along the commonest course of selfseeking and selfindulgence and were neither a comfort nor a credit to her however she was satisfied that she had done her best for them and therefore being of the days when the womans sphere was home exclusively and home meant for the most part the nursery and the kitchen she sat inactive and suffered as was the wont of oldworld women while her sons were sinning all the sins which she especially should have taught them to abhor and with regard to her girls she was equally satisfied that she had done the right thing by them under the circumstances she could not have been made to comprehend that beth a girl was the one member of the family who deserved a good chance the only one for whom it would have repaid her to procure extra advantages but having at last been convinced that there was nothing for it but to send beth to school she set to work to prepare her to the best of her ability her own clothes were in the last stage of shabbiness but what money she had she spent on getting new ones for beth and that too in order that she might continue the allowance to jim as long as possible she made a mighty effort also to teach beth all that was necessary for the entrance examination into the school and sewed day and night to get the things readyin all of which be it said beth helped to the best of her ability but without pride or pleasure because she had been made to feel that she was robbing jim and that her mother was treating her better than she deserved and the feeling depressed her so that the muchlongedfor chance when it came found her with less spirit than she had ever had to take advantage of it ah beth her mother said to her seeing her so subdued i thought you would repent when it was too late you wont find it so easy and delightful to have your own way as you suppose when it comes to leaving home and going away among strangers who dont care a bit about you you will not be very jubilant i expect you know what it is when mildred leaves home how she cries summer showers soft warm and refreshing beth snapped irritated by the itoldyouso tone of superiority which when her mother assumed it always broke down her best resolutions and threw her into a state of opposition mildred the satisfactory has the right thing ready for all occasions the result of this encounter was an elaborate pose in dread of her mothers comments should she betray the feeling expected of her she set herself to maintain an unruffled calm of demeanour whatever happened autumn was tinting the woods when beth packed up the day before her departure she paid a round of visits not to people but to places which shows how much more real the life of her musings was to her at that time than the life of the world she got up at daybreak and went and sat on the rustic seat at the edge of the cliff where the stream fell over on to the sand and thought of the first sunrise she had ever seen and of the puritan farmer who had come out and reprimanded her ruggedly for being there alone at that unseemly hour poor man his little house behind her was shut up and deserted the garden he had kept so trim was all bedraggled neglect ruled ruin all over his small demesne and he himself was where the worthy rest till their return the thought however at that hour and in that heavenly solitude where there was no sound but the seavoice which filled every pause in an undertone with the great song of eternity it sings on always did not sadden beth but on the contrary stimulated her with some singular vague perception of the meaning of it all the dawn was breaking and the spirit of the dawn all about her possessed and drew her till she revelled in an ecstasy of yearning towards its crowning gloryrise great sun when she first sat down the hollow of the sky was one dark dome only relieved by a star or two but the darkness parted more rapidly than her eyes could appreciate and was succeeded in the hollow it had held by rolling clouds monotonously grey which in turn ranged themselves in long low downs irregularly ribbed and all unbroken but gradually drawing apart until at length they were gently riven and the first triumphant tinge of topaz colour pale pink warm and clear like the faint flush that shyly betrays some delicate emotion on a young cheek touched the soft gradations of the greyness to warmth and brightness then mounted up and up in shafts to the zenith while behind it was breathed in the tenderest tinge of turquoise blue which shaded to green which shaded to primrose low down on the horizon where all was shining silver then as the grey so was the colour riven and rays of light shot up crimson flashes of flame which while beth held her breath were fast followed from the sea by the sun that rose enwrapt in their splendour while the water below caught the fine flush and heaved and heaved like a breast expanding with delight into long deep sighs beth cried aloud o lord of loveliness how mighty are thy manifestations later in the day she climbed to the top of the hill where charlotte had kept her faithful watch for the darkbrown horse and there beneath the firs she sat looking out with large eyes straining far into the vague distance where hector had been the ground was padded with pineneedles briony berries shone in the hedgerows below and hips and haws and rowans also rioted in red brambles were heavy with blueblack berries and the bracken was battered and brown on the steep hillside down in the road a team of four horses dappled bays with black points and coats as glossy as satin drawing a waggon of wheat curved their necks and tossed their heads till the burnished brasses of their harness rang and pacing with pride as if they rejoiced to carry the harvest home on the top of the wheat two women in coloured cotton frocks rested and sangsang quite blithely beth watched the waggon out of sight then rose and turning faced the sea as she descended the hill she left that dream behind her hector like sammy and arthur passed to the background of her recollections where her lovers ceased from troubling and the secret service of humanity superseded was no more a living interest beth went also to the farther sands to visit the spot where she had been surprised in the water by the girls and had become the white priestess of their bathing rites and taught that girls had a strength as great as the strength of boys but different if only they would do things mere mental and physical strength were what beth was thinking of she knew nothing of spiritual force although she was using it herself at the time and doing with it what all the boys in the diocese taken together could not have done she had heard of works of the spirit and that she should pray to be imbued with it but that she herself was pure spirit only waiting to be released from her case of clay had never been hinted to her the next day she travelled with her mother from the north to the south and during the whole long journey there was no break in the unruffled calm of her demeanour her mother wondered at her and was irritated and fussed about the luggage and fumed about trains she feared to miss but beth kept calm she sat in her corner of the carriage looking out of the window and the world was a varied landscape to every beauty of which she was keenly alive yet she gave no expression to her enthusiasm nor to the discomfort she suffered from the august sun which streamed in on her through the blindless window burning her face for hours nor to her hunger and fatigue and when at last they came to the great house by the river and her mother having handed her over to miss clifford the lady principal said somewhat tearfully goodbye beth i hope you will be happy here but be a good girl beth answered thank you i shall try mamma and kissed her as coolly as if it were her usual goodnight we do not often have young ladies part from their mothers so placidly miss clifford commented i suppose not mrs caldwell said sighing beth felt that she was behaving horridly there was a lump in her throat and she would liked to have shown more feeling but she could not now when she would have laid aside the mask of calmness which she had voluntarily assumed she found herself forced to wear it falsifications of our better selves are easily entered upon but hard to shake off they are evil things that lurk about us ready but powerless to come till we call them but having been called they hold us in their grip and their power upon us to compel us becomes greater than ours upon them mrs caldwell felt sore at heart when she had gone and beth was not less sore each had been a failure in her relation to the other mrs caldwell blamed beth and beth in her own mind did not defend herself she forbore to judge chapter xxx st catherines mansion the royal service school for officers daughters had not been built for the purpose but bought otherwise it would have been as ugly to look at as it was dreary to live in as it was however the house was beautiful and so also were the grounds about it and the views of the river the bridge with its many arches and the grey town climbing up from it to the height above beth was still standing at the top of the steps under the great portico where her mother had left her contemplating the river which was the first that had flowed into her experience come come my dear come in some one behind her exclaimed impatiently youre not allowed to stand there beth turned and saw a thin dry middleaged woman with keen dark eyes and a sharp manner standing in the doorway behind her with a gentlerlooking lady who said it is a new girl miss bey i expect she is all bewildered no i am not at all bewildered thank you beth answered in her easy way as she spoke she saw two grownup girls in the hall exchange glances and smile and wondered what unusual thing she had done then you had better come at once miss bey rejoined drily and let me see what you can do please to remember in future that the girls are not allowed to come to this door she led the way as she spoke and beth followed her across the hall up a broad flight of steps opposite the entrance down a wide corridor to the right and then to the right again into a narrow classroom and through that again into another inner room these are the fifth and sixth rooms miss bey remarkedfifth and sixth classes they were furnished with long bare tables forms hard wooden chairs a cupboard and a set of pigeonholes miss bey sat down at the end of the table in the sixth with her back to the window and made beth sit on her left there were some books a large slate a slate pencil and damp sponge on the table what arithmetic have you done miss bey began ive scrambled through the first four rules beth answered set yourself a sum in each and do it miss bey said sharply taking a piece of knitting from a bag she held on her arm and beginning to knit in a determined manner as if she were working against time beth took up the slate and pencil and began but the sharp clickclick of the needles worried her and her brain was so busy studying miss bey she could not concentrate her mind upon the sums miss bey waited without a word but beth was conscious of her keen eyes fixed upon her from time to time and knew what she meant im hurrying all i can she said at last youll have to hurry more than you can then in class miss bey remarked if this is your ordinary rate of work when the sums were done she took the slate and glanced over them they are every one wrong she said but i see you know how to work them now clean the slate and do some dictation she took up a book when beth was ready and began to read aloud from it beth became so interested in the subject that she forgot the dictation and burst out at last well i never knew that before you are doing dictation now miss bey observed severely all right go on beth cheerfully rejoined miss bey did not go on however and on looking up to see what was the matter beth found her gazing at her with bent brows may i ask what your name is miss bey inquired beth caldwell then allow me to inform you miss beth caldwell that all right go on is not the proper way to address the headmistress of the royal service school for officers daughters thank you for telling me beth answered you see i dont know these things i always say that to mamma have you ever been to school before miss bey asked no beth answered oh miss bey ejaculated with peculiar meaning then you will have a great deal to learn i suppose so beth rejoined but thats what i came for you knowto learn its high time i began she fixed her big eyes on the blank wall opposite and there was a sorrowful expression in them miss bey noted the expression and nodded her head several times but there was no relaxation of her peremptory manner when she spoke again go on my dear she said if i give as much time to the others as you are taking i shall not get through the new girls tonight beth finished her dictation what a hand miss bey exclaimed wherever did you learn to write like that i taught myself to write small on purpose beth replied you can get so much more on to the paper you had better have taught yourself to spell then miss bey rejoined there are four mistakes in this one passage beth balanced her pencil on her finger with an air of indifference she was wondering how it was that the headmistress of the royal service school for officers daughters used the word wherever as the vulgar do the examination concluded with some questions in history and geography which beth answered more or less incorrectly i shall put you here in the sixth miss bey informed her but rather for your size than for your acquirements there is a delicate girl much smaller than you are in the first then id rather be myself tall and strong in the sixth beth rejoined if i dont catch her up at all events i shall have more pleasure in life and thats something again miss bey gazed at her but she was too much taken aback by beths readiness to correct her on the instant although it was an unaccustomed and a monstrous thing for a girl to address a mistress in an easy conversational way let alone differ from her she took beth to the great classroom where the seventh and eighth worked and the fifth and sixth joined them for recreation and preparation and where also the bible lessons were given by miss clifford to the whole school there were a good many girls of various ages in the room who all looked up this is a new girl miss bey said addressing them generallymiss beth caldwell please to show her where to go and what to do she glanced round keenly as she spoke then left the room and at the same time a thin sharplooking little girl with short hair rose from the table at which she was sitting and went up to beth im head of the fifth she said has bey been examining you what class did she put you in the sixth beth said i should have thought youd have been in the third at least the head of the fifth piped youre so big here are some sixth girlsjessie baker ina formby rosa bird the sixth girls were sitting at a round table with their little desks before them writing letters one of them pulled out a chair for beth they had just returned from the holidays and were in various stages of homesicknesssome of them crying and the rest depressed but they welcomed beth kindly as one of themselves and inspected her with interest you can write a private letter today you know rosa bird said to beth what is a private letter beth asked one to your mother you know that isnt read you seal it up yourself public letters have to be sent in open to miss clifford one week you write a public letter and the next a private one hello heres amy wynne a dark girl of about eighteen had entered by a door at the farther end of the room and was received with acclamation being evidently popular beth who was still in her mask of calm indifference looked coldly on but in herself she determined to be received like that some day most of the girls in the room jumped up and amy wynne kissed one after the other and then shook hands with beth are all my children back she asked i dont know rosa bird rejoined glancing round they are not all here thats one of the mothers rosa explained to beth when amy wynne had gone again the firstclass girls are mothers to us you walk with your mother in the garden and sit with her on halfholidays and shes awfully good to you i advise you to be one of amy wynnes children if you can she was interrupted by the loud ringing of a bell in the hall thats for tea rosa added come and ill show you the way the big diningroom was downstairs in the basement next the kitchen miss clifford dined in the next room attended by her maids of honour the two girls at the top of the first class for the time being and the rest of the class except the girls at the bottom who were degraded to the secondclass table in the big diningroom here each two classes had a separate table at either end of which a teacher sat on a windsor chair the girls had nothing but hard benches without backs to sit on miss bey the housekeeper miss winch and the head musicmistress irreverently called old tom by the girls sat at a separate table where at dinnertime they did all the carving and snatched what little dinner they could get in the intervals patiently and foolishly regardless of their own digestions for tea there were great dishes of thick bread and butter on all the tables which the girls began to hand round as soon as grace had been said each class had a big basin of brown sugar to put in the tea which gave it a coarse flavour the first cup was not so bad but the second was nothing but hot water poured through the teapot it was not etiquette to take more than two when the girls were ready for a second they put pieces of bread in their saucers that they might know their own again and passed the cups up to the teacher who poured out tea if any girl suspected that the cup returned to her was not her own she would not touch the tea when the meal was over one of the girls took the sugarbasin beat down the sugar in it flat and hard with the spoon did a design on the top and put it away whats that for beth asked thats so that we shall know our own again rosa answered but it never lasts the proper time what do you do when its done said beth do without was the laconic rejoinder all the girls were talking at once what a racket beth exclaimed itll be quiet enough tomorrow rosa replied the first class talks at table in miss cliffords room but we are not allowed to speak a word here except to the teachers nor in the bedrooms either once work begins do you see that great fat old thing at the mistresss table thats old tom the head musicmistress she is a greedy old cat she likes eating you can see it by the way she gloats over things and shes quite put out if she doesnt get exactly what she wants fancy caring its just like a man and thats why shes called old tom not that shes fastidious said agnes stewart a tall slender girl with short crisp black hair and greygreen eyes who was sitting opposite to beth i believe she likes mutton oh shes horrid enough for anything the girl next her exclaimed with an expression of disgust some of the girls ate their thick bread and butter unconcernedly others were choked with tears and could not touch it most of the tearful ones were new girls and the old ones were kind to them the teachers too were sympathetic and did their best to cheer them after tea they all returned to their classrooms beth went and stood in one of the great windows looking out on to the grounds the river the old arched bridge and the grey houses of the town climbing up the hill among the autumntinted trees all the windows were shut and she began to feel suffocated for want of fresh air and bewildered by the clatter of voices if only she could get out into the garden the door at the end of the room which led into the first and second was open she went through but before she was half across the room one of the elder girls exclaimed roughly hello what are you doing here its a new girl inkie another put in well the sooner she learns she has no business here the better inkie rejoined beth thought her exceedingly rude and passed on into the vestibule unconcernedly well thats cool cheek inkie exclaimed hieyounew girl come back here directly and go round the other way just to teach you manners beth turned back with flaming cheeks looked at her hard a moment that for your manners she said snapping her fingers at her amy wynne rose from her seat and went up to beth you must learn at once miss caldwell she said that you will not be allowed to speak to the elder girls like that then the elder girls had better learn at once said beth defiantly that they will not be allowed to speak to me as your inkieperson did just now youll not teach me manners by being rude to me and if any girl in the school is ever rude to me again ill box her ears now i apologise for coming through your room but you should keep the door shut when she had spoken she returned to the big classroom deliberately and crossed it to the other door as she did so she noticed that a strange hush had fallen upon the girls and they were all looking at her curiously she went into the hall and was passing the vestibule door when miss bey who was sitting just inside knitting stopped her where are you going miss caldwell she asked in her sharp way upstairs beth answered you speak shortly miss caldwell it would have been more polite to have mentioned my name i beg your pardon miss bey beth rejoined miss bey bowed with a severe smile in acknowledgment of the apology what do you want upstairs she asked to be alone beth answered i cant stand the noise you must stand the noise said miss bey girls are not allowed to go upstairs without some very good reason and they must always ask permissionpolitelyfrom the teacher on duty i am the teacher on duty at this moment if you had gone upstairs without permission i should have given you a bad mark beth looked longingly at the hall door which had glass panels in the upper part through which she could see the river and the trees what a prison this is she exclaimed miss bey had had great experience of girls and her sharp manner which was mainly acquired in the effort to maintain discipline somewhat belied her kindly nature you can bring a chair from the hall and sit here beside me if you like she said to beth thank you beth answered this is better she said when she was seated may i talk to you yes certainly said miss bey there was a great conservatory behind them as they sat looking into the hall on their left was the third and fourth classroom on their right the first and second the doors of both stood open did you hear the row i had in there just now beth asked nodding towards the first and second i did said miss bey but you mustnt say row it is vulgar difficulty then beth rejoined but what did you think of it miss bey reflected the question as beth put it was not easy to answer i thought you were both very much in the wrong she said at last well that is fair at all events beth observed with approval i dont mean to break any of your rules when i know what they are and i bet you i wont have a bad mark if theres any way to help it the whole time i am at school but im not going to be sat upon by anybody miss bey pursed up her mouth and knitted emphatically she was accustomed to naughty girls but the most troublesome stood in awe of the teachers my dear she said after a little pause i honour your good resolutions but i must request you not to say ill bet or talk about being sat upon both expressions are distinctly unladylike i must also tell you that at school the teachers are not on the same level as the girls they are in authority you see i see said beth i spoke to you as one lady might speak to another i wont again miss bey miss bey paused once more with bent brows to reflect upon this ambiguous announcement but not being able to make anything of it she proceeded it is a matter of discipline without strict discipline an establishment of this size would be in a state of chaos the girls must respect the teachers and the younger girls must respect the elder ones all become elder ones in turn and are respected well i mean to be respected all through beth declared and set her mouth hard on the determination at eight oclock miss bey rang a big handbell for prayers and the whole household including the servants came trooping into the hall the girls sat together in their classes and when all were in their places miss clifford came in attended by her maidsofhonour mounted the readingdesk and read the little service in a beautiful voice devoutly beth softened as she listened and joined in with all her heart towards the end when prayers were over and the servants had gone downstairs one of the maidsofhonour set a chair under the domed ceiling in front of the vestibule for miss clifford who went to it from the readingdesk and sat there then the firstclass girls rose and left their seats in single file and each as she passed walked up to miss clifford took the hand which she held out and curtsied goodnight to her the other classes followed in the same order miss clifford said a word or two to some of the girls and had a smile for all when beths turn came she made an awkward curtsey in imitation of the others miss clifford held her hand a moment and looked up into her face keenly then smiled and let her go beth felt that there was some special thought behind that smile and wondered what it was miss clifford made it her duty to know the character temper constitution and capacity of every one of the eighty girls under her and watched carefully for every change in them this goodnight which was a dignified and impressive ceremony gave her an opportunity of inspecting each girl separately every day and very little escaped her if a girl looked unhappy run down overworked or otherwise out of sorts miss clifford sent for her next morning to find out what was the matter and she was scolded comforted put on extras had a tonic to take or was allowed another hour in bed in the morning according to the necessities of her case the girls who were in certain bedrooms sat up an hour after prayers and had dry bread and water for supper they turned to the left and went back to their classrooms when they had made their curtseys the others turned to the right and went upstairs beth was one of these she was in no there were several beds in the room and beside each bed was a washstand and a box for clothes the floor was carpetless there were white curtains hung on iron rods to be drawn round the beds and the space beside them so that each girl had perfect privacy to dress and undress the curtains were all drawn back for air when the girls were ready but no girl drew her curtain without the permission of the girl next to her when a bell rang they all knelt down and had ten minutes for private prayers night and morning the bell being rung again when the time was up the girls had to turn down their beds to air them before they left their rooms in the morning they had an hours lessons before breakfast then prayers after prayers the monitresses rose from their seats below the readingdesk and as they filed out each in turn reported if any one had spoken or not spoken in the bedrooms breakfast consisted of thick bread and butter and tea for the girls with the addition of an insufficient quantity of fried bacon for the teachers after breakfast the girls went upstairs again and made their beds in a given time then all but a few who were kept in for music went out into the garden for halfanhour beth had to go out that first morning the sun was shining bright drops sparkled on grass and trees the air was heavy with autumn odours but fresh and sweet and the birds chirped blithely beth felt like a free creature once more directly she got out and throwing up her arms with a great exclamation of relief after the restraint indoors she ran out on to the wide grassplot in front of the house at the top of her speed come back come back new girl cried the head french mistress mademoiselle duval the teacher on duty you are not allowed to go on the grass nor must you run in that unseemly way im sorry said beth i didnt know she moved off on to the path which overlooked the river and began to walk soberly up and down gazing at the water mademoiselle the french mistress screamed again shrilly come away from there the girls are not allowed to walk on that path oh dear said beth where may i go just go where you see the other girls go mademoiselle rejoined sharply not being a favourite the french mistress was left to wander about alone popular teachers always had some girls hanging on to their arms out in the garden and sitting with them when they were on duty indoors but mademoiselle seldom had a satellite and never one who was respected the girls thought her deceitful and deceit was one of the things not tolerated in the school miss bey was believed to be above deceit of any kind and was liked and respected accordingly in spite of her angular appearance sharp manner the certainty that she was not a lady by birth and the suspicion that her father kept a shop the girls had certain simple tests of character and station they attend more to each others manners in the matter of nicety at girls schools than at boys mores the pity for those who have to live with the boys afterwards if a new girl drank with her mouth full ate audibly took things from the end instead of the side of a spoon or bit her bread instead of breaking it at dinner she was set down as nothing much at home which meant that her people were socially of no importance not to say common and if she were not perfectly frank and honest or if she ever said coarse or indelicate things she was spoken of contemptuously as a dockyard girl which meant one of low mind and objectionable manners who was in a bad set at home and made herself cheap after the manner of a garrison hack the terms being nearly equivalent there was no pretence of impossible innocence among the elder girls but neither was there any impropriety of language or immodesty of conduct certain subjects were avoided and if a girl made any allusion to them by chance she was promptly silenced if she recurred to them persistently she was set down at once as a dockyard girl and an outsider the consequence of this high standard was an extremely good tone all through the school beth turned into the limetree avenue where she met several sets of girls all walking in rows with their arms round each other none of them took any notice of her until she got out on to the drive where she met amy wynne with her children amy let go the two she had her arms round sent them all on and stopped to speak to beth have you no mother she asked i have one at home beth answered coldly in spite of herself but you know our custom here amy rejoined the elder girls are mothers to the young ones i know said beth but i dont want a mother i should hate to have my thoughts interrupted by a lot of little girls in a row all cackling together i was going to offer amy began but of course if you are so selfreliant it would only be an impertinence oh no said beth sincerely regretting her own ungraciousness it is kind of you and if it were you alone i should be glad but i could not stand the others well i hope you wont be lonely amy answered and hurried on after her children lonely i must be beth muttered to herself with sudden foreboding when the girls went in beth was summoned to the big musicroom old tom was there with dr centry who came twice a week to hear the girls play there were twelve pianos in the room ten upright and two grand besides old toms own private grand all old hard and metallic and twelve girls hammered away on them all together at the same piece but if one made a mistake old tom instantly detected it and knew which it was do ye know any music she asked beth in a gruff voice with a rough scotch accent a little beth answered what for instance old tom pursued looking at beth as if she were a culprit up for judgment some of chopin beth replied i like him best old tom raised her eyebrows incredulously sit down here and play one of his compositions if you pleasehere at my piano she said opening the instrument but beth felt intimidated for once partly by the offensive manners of the formidablelooking old woman her bulk and gruffness but also because old toms doubt of her powers which she perceived was shaking her confidence she sat down at the piano however and struck a few notes then her nerve forsook her i cant play she said im nervous humph snarled old tom i thought that ud be your chopin go and learn exercises with the children in miss taits classroom miss tait acting on old toms report put beth into one of her lower classes and left her to practise with the beginners when she had gone beth glanced at the exercises and then began to rattle them off at such a rate that no one in the class could keep up with her miss tait came hurrying back who is that playing so fast she said was it you miss caldwell yes beth answered then you must go into a higher class said miss tait but the same thing happened in every class until at last beth had run up through them all as up a flight of stairs into old toms first her piano in the first when the whole class was present and she had no choice was a hard old instrument usually avoided because it was the nearest to the table at which old tom sat when she did not walk about during a lesson the first time beth took her place at it the other girls were only beginning to assemble and old tom was not in the room a great teasing of instruments as old tom called it was going on a new piece was to be taken that morning and each girl began to try it as soon as she sat down so that they were all at different passages they stopped however and looked up when beth appeared thats your piano the head girl said i hope youll like it one of the others added sarcastically oh but im glad to be here said beth striking a few firm chords now i feel like chopin and she burst out into one of his most brilliant waltzes triumphantly old tom had come in while she was speaking but beth did not see her old tom waited till she had done oh so now ye feel like chopin miss caldwell she jeered and it appears ye are not above shamming nervous when it suits ye to mak yerself interesting i shall remember that old tom taught by a series of jeers and insults if a girl were poor she never failed to remind her of the fact but indeed yere beggars all was her favourite summing up when they stumbled at troublesome passages most of the girls cowered under her insults but beth looked her straight in the face at this second encounter and at the third her spirit rose and she argued the point old tom tried to shout her down but beth left her seat and suggested that they should go and get miss clifford to decide between them then old tom subsided and from that time she and beth were on amicable terms beth had an excellent musical memory when she went to school but she lost it entirely whilst she was there and the delicacy of her touch as well both being destroyed as she supposed by the system of practising with so many others at a time which made it impossible for her to feel what she was playing or put any individuality of expression into it on that opening day beth had to go from the musicroom to her first english lesson in the sixth all the girls sat round the long narrow table miss smallwood the mistress being at the end with her back to the window the lesson was guy a collection of questions and answers used also by the firstclass girls only that they were farther on in the book who was william the conqueror when did he arrive what did he do on landing and so on beth at the bottom of the class on miss smallwoods right was in a good position to ask questions herself she could have told the whole history of william the conqueror in her own language after once reading it over but the answers to the questions had to be learnt by heart and repeated in the exact language of the book and in the struggle to be wordperfect enough to keep up with the class the significance of what she was saying was lost upon her it was her mothers system exactly and beth was disappointed having hoped for something different these pillules of knowledge only exasperated her she wanted enough to enable her to grasp the whole situation what is the use of learning these little bits by heart about william the conqueror and the battle of hastings and all that miss smallwood she exclaimed one day it is a part of your education beth miss smallwood answered precisely i know beth grumbled but couldnt one read about it and get on a little quicker i want to know what he did when he got here why my dear child how can you be so stupid you have just said he fought the battle of hastings yes but what did the battle of hastings do beth persisted making a hard but ineffectual effort to express herself oh now beth you are silly miss smallwood rejoined impatiently and all the girls grinned in agreement but it was not beth who was silly miss smallwood had had nothing herself but the trumpery education provided everywhere at that time for girls by the part of humanity which laid undisputed claim to a superior sense of justice and it had not carried her far enough to enable her to grasp any more comprehensive result of the battle of hastings than was given in the simple philosophy of guy most of the girls at the royal service school would have to work for themselves and teaching was almost the only occupation open to them yet such education as they received consisting as it did of mere rudiments was an insult to the high average of intelligence that obtained amongst them they were not taught one thing thoroughly not even their own language and remained handicapped to the end of their lives for want of a grounding in grammar when you find a womans diction at fault never gird at her for want of intelligence but at those in authority over her in her youth who thought anything in the way of education good enough for a girl even the teachers at st catherines some of them wrote in reply to invitations i shall have much pleasure in accepting the girls might be there eight years but were never taught french enough in the time either to read or speak it correctly their music was an offence to the ear and their drawings to the eye history was given to them in outlines only which isolated kings and their ministers showing little or nothing of their influence on the times they lived in and ignoring the condition of the people who were merely introduced as a background to some telling incident in the career of a picturesque personage and everything else was taught in the same superficial wayexcept religion but the fact that the religious education was good in beths time was an accident due to miss cliffords character and capacity and therefore no credit to the governors of the school who did not know that she was specially qualified in that respect when they made her lady principal she was a highminded woman low church of great force of character and exemplary piety and her spirit pervaded the whole school she gave the bible lessons herself in the form of lectures which dealt largely with the conduct of life and as she had the power to make her subject interesting and the faith which carries conviction both girls and mistresses profited greatly by her teaching many of them became deeply religious under her and most of them had phases of piety whilst there were very few who did not leave the school with yearnings at least towards honour and uprightness which were formed by time and experience into steady principles beth persisted in roaming the garden alone she loved to hover about a large fountain there with a deep wide basin round it in which goldfish swam and waterlilies grew she used to go and hang over it peering into the water or when the fountain played she would loiter near delighting in the sound of it the splash and murmur one of the windows of miss cliffords sittingroom overlooked this part of the garden and beth noticed the old lady once or twice standing in the window but it did not occur to her that she was watching her one day however miss clifford sent a maidofhonour to fetch her and beth went in wondering what she had done but asked no questions calm indifference was still her pose miss clifford dismissed the maidofhonour she was sitting in her own special easychair and beth stood before her my dear child she said to beth why are you always alone are the girls not kind to you oh yes thank you beth answered they are quite kind then why are you always alone i like it best are you sure said miss clifford that the others do not shun you for some reason or other one of them wished to be my mother beth rejoined but i did not care about it but you cannot be happy always alone like that miss clifford observed beth was silent miss clifford looked at her earnestly for a little then she shook her head i tell you what i will do if you like miss clifford beth said upon reflection i will form a family of my own miss clifford smiled ah i see you are ambitious she said but my dear child a sixth girl cant expect to have that kind of influence it is not ambition beth answered for i shall feel it no distinction only a great bother nevertheless i will do it to show you that i am not shunned and to please you as you do not like me to wander alone a week or two later beth appeared in the garden with six of the worst girls in the school clinging to her fascinated by her marvellous talk miss clifford sent for her again i am sorry to see you in such company she said those girls are all older than you are and they will lead you into mischief on the contrary miss clifford beth replied i shall keep them out of mischief not one of them has had a bad mark this week then miss clifford sent for miss smallwood the mistress of the sixth what do you make of beth caldwell she asked i cant make anything of her miss smallwood answered i think she tries but she does not seem able to keep up with the other girls at all she seldom knows a lesson or does a sum correctly i sometimes think she ought to be in the eighth but then occasionally she shows a knowledge far beyond her years not a knowledge of school work but of books and life how about her themes i dont know what to think of them they are too good but she declares emphatically that she does them all out of her own head what sort of temper has she queer like everything else about her not unamiable you know but irritable at times and she has days of deep depression and moments of extreme elation ah miss clifford ejaculated and then reflected a little well be patient with her she said at last if she hasnt exceptional ability of some kind i am no judge of girls but she is evidently unaccustomed to school work and is suffering from the routine and restraint after being allowed to run wild she should have been sent here years ago chapter xxxi from the foregoing it will be seen that beth made her mark upon the school from the day of her arrival in the way of getting herself observed and talked about she was set down as queer to begin with and when lessons began both girls and mistresses decided that she was stupid and queer she remained to the end in the estimation of those who had no better word to express it but with regard to her stupidity there soon began to be differences of opinion at preparation one evening she talked instead of doing her work and gradually all the girls about her had stopped to listen gracious beth exclaimed at last the bell will go directly and ive not done a sum show me how to work them rosa oh bother rosa rejoined find out for yourself my theme was turned and ive got to do it again look here said beth if youll do my sums ill do your theme now and your thorough bass on thursday i wish to goodness you wouldnt talk beth agnes stewart exclaimed we shall all get bad marks tomorrow then why do you listen beth retorted i cant help it agnes grumbled you fascinate me i should have thought you were clever if i had only heard you talk and not known what a duffer you are at your lessons well shes not a duffer at thorough bass anyway rosa put in she only began this term and shes a long way ahead even of some of the first old toms given her a little book to herself i began thorough bass with the rest of you beth observed its the only thing we started fair in you are years ahead of me in all the other work the girls reflected upon this for a little and you can write themes rosa finally asseverated oh thats nothing beth protested themes are easy enough i could write them for the whole school well thats no reason why you should put your nose in your cup every time you drink lucy black the sharpest shrimp of a girl in the class said grinning i never did such a thing in my life beth exclaimed turning crimson youll say i eat audibly next no you dont do that rosa said solemnly but you do put your nose in your cup the colour flickered on beths sensitive cheek and she shrank into herself there dont tease her mary wright the eldest stupidest and most motherly girl in the school exclaimed how can you drink without putting your nose in your cup stupid then beth saw it and smiled greatly relieved this venerable pleasantry was a sign that she had been taken once for all into the good graces of her schoolmates the girls who were liked were usually nicknamed and always chaffed the rest were treated with different degrees of politeness the dockyard girls as the lowest of all being called miss even by the teachers on thursday evenings the girls in the fifth and sixth were allowed to do fancy work for an hour while a storybook was read aloud to them either by miss smallwood or one of themselves when her voice was tired the book was always either childish or dull generally both and beth who had been accustomed to scott dickens and thackeray grew restive under the infliction one evening when she had twice been reprimanded for yawning aggressively she exclaimed well miss smallwood it is such silly stuff why i could tell you a better story myself and make it up as i go on then begin at once and tell it said miss smallwood glancing round at the girls who smiled derisively thinking that beth would have to excuse herself and thereby tacitly acknowledge that she had been boasting to their surprise however beth took the request seriously settled herself in her chair folded her hands and with her eyes roaming about the room as if she were picking up the details from the walls the floor the ceiling and all it contained started without hesitation it was the romantic story of a haunted house on a great rocky promontory and the freshness and sound of the sea pervaded it the girls went on with their work for a little but by degrees first one and then another stopped and just sat staring at beth while gravity settled on every face as the interest deepened suddenly the bell rang and the story was not finished oh dear miss smallwood exclaimed it is very fascinating beth but i really am afraid i ought not to have allowed you to tell it i had no ideai must speak to miss clifford the fame of this wonderful story spread through the school and the next halfholiday the firstclass girls sent to ask beth to go to their room and repeat it but beth was not in the mood and answered their messenger tragically twas not for this i left my fathers home go tell your class that vashti will not come vashtis a little beast i think the head girl observed when the message was delivered miss clifford also sent for beth and requested her to repeat the story that she might judge for herself if she should be allowed to go on with it and beth repeated it being constrained but the recital was so wearisome that miss clifford dismissed her before she was halfway through with leave to finish it if anybody cared to hear it when thursday came the girls and miss smallwood cared very much to hear it and beth stimulated by their clamours went on without a break for the whole hour and ended with a description of a shipwreck which was so vivid that the whole class was shaken with awe and sat silent for a perceptible time after she stopped beth could rarely be persuaded to repeat this performance but from that time her standing was unique both with girls and mistresses a fact however of which she herself was totally unaware she felt her backwardness in school work and nothing else and petitioned god incessantly to help her with her lessons and get her put up and put up she was regularly until she reached the third when she was among the elder girls she was never able to do the work properly of any class she was in however and her class mistresses were always against her being put up but miss clifford insisted on it beth was never anything but miserable at school the dull routine of the place pressed heavily upon her and everything she had to do was irksome the other girls accommodated themselves more or less successfully to the circumstances of their lives but beth in herself was always at war with her surroundings and her busy brain teemed with ingenious devices to vary the monotony the confinement want of relaxation and of proper physical training very soon told upon her health and spirits as indeed they did upon the greater number of the girls who suffered unnecessarily in various ways beth very soon had to have an extra hour in bed in the morning a cup of soup at eleven oclock a tonic three times a day and a slice of thick bread and butter with a glass of stout on going to bed such things were not stinted during miss cliffords administration but it was a case of treating effects which all the time were being renewed by causes that might and ought to have been removed but were let alone st catherines mansion was regulated on a system of exemplary dulness there is a certain dowager still extant who considers it absurd to provide amusement for people of inferior station all people who earn their living are people of inferior station to her she has never heard of such a thing as the dignity of labour because many of the girls at st catherines were orphans without means and would therefore have to earn their own living as governesses when their education was finished the dowagerpersons who interested themselves in the management of the school had used their influence strenuously to make the life there as much of a punishment as possible you cannot be too strict with girls in their position was what they continually averred their own position by birth being in no way better and in some instances not so good as that of the girls whom they were depriving of every innocent pleasure natural to their age and necessary for the good of their health and spirits they were not allowed to learn dancing they had no outdoor games at all not even croquetnothing whatever to exhilarate them and develop them physically except an hours deportment the very mildest kind of calisthenics in the big classroom once a fortnight and the daily making of their little beds for the rest monotonous walks up and down the gardenpaths in small parties or about the dreary roads two and two in long lines was their only exercise and even in this they were restricted to such a severe propriety of demeanour that it almost seemed as if the object were to teach them to move without betraying the fact that they had legs the consequence of all this restraint was a low state of vitality among the girls and the outbreak of morbid phases that sometimes went right through the school beth as might have been expected was one of the first to be caught by anything of this kind and she arrived by way of her own emotions at the cause of a great deal that was a mystery to older people and also thought out the cure eventually but she suffered a great deal in the process of acquiring her special knowledge of the subject she was especially troubled by her old maladydepression of spirits sometimes on a summer evening when all the classes were at preparation and the whole great house was still a mistress would begin to practise in one of the musicrooms and beth would be carried away by the music so that work was impossible one evening when this happened she sat with a very sad face looking out on the river pleasureboats were gliding up and down a gay party went by dancing on the deck of a luxurious barge to the music of a stringband a young man skimmed the surface in a skiff another punted two girls along and people walked on the banks or sat about under the trees and children playedand they were all free suddenly beth burst into tears miss smallwood questioned her was she ill had she any pain had any one been unkind to her no what was the matter then nothing she was just miserable beth dont be so silly miss smallwood remonstrated a great girl like you crying for nothing it is positively childish the other girls stole glances at her and looked grave at the beginning of the term they would not have sympathised perhaps but this was the middle and many of them were in much the same mood themselves when the bell rang and the recreation hour began they got out their little bits of fancywork and such dull childish books as they were allowed and broke up into groups beth was soon surrounded by the cleverer girls in the class i sympathise with you beth said janey north a redhaired irish girl for i felt like it myself i did indeed will the holidays never be here sighed rosa bird i cant think why i stay at all said beth i hate iti hate it all the time but how could one get away said janey only by being ill agnes stewart answered darkly she was a delicate girl and from that time she starved herself resolutely until she was so wasted that miss clifford in despair sent her home another girl was seized with total deafness suddenly and had also to go the change brought her hearing back in a very short time and some of the dockyard girls received urgent summonses from dying relations and were allowed to go to them they always returned the brighter for the experience one day after the weather became cold a girl appeared in class wrapped up in a shawl and with her head all drawn down to one side her neck was stiff and she could not straighten it she was sent to the infirmary the girls thought her lucky for it was warm there and nurse was kind and sang delightful songs she would be able to do fancywork too and read as much as she liked and would not have to get up till she had had her breakfast and the fire was lighted and need not trouble about lessons at alla stiff neck was a very small drawback to the delights of such a change next day another girls neck was stiff miss smallwood searched for a draught but did not succeed in finding one that evening at prayers one of the girls in the first appeared in a shawl with her head on one side and a white worn face and next day there was another case from the third and fourth so it was evident that there was something like an epidemic going through the school but the doctor had never seen one of the kind before and was at a loss to account for it the cases were all exactly alike stiff neck with the head drawn down to one side accompanied by feverishness and followed by severe prostration beth sat with a stolid countenance and stared solemnly at every girl that was attacked as if she were studying her case then one morning she came down in a shawl herself with her head on one side and a very white face nurse marched her off at once to the infirmary and put her in a bed beside the fire and beth as she coiled herself up and realised that she need not worry about lessons or rush off to practise when the bell rang or go out to walk up and down in the garden till she hated every pebble on the path heaved a great sigh of relief and fell asleep when she awoke the doctor was feeling her pulse shes very low he said is she a delicate girl naturally she looked strong enough when she came to school nurse answered but she soon went off as so many of them do the loss of vitality amongst them is really extraordinary the doctor observed give her port wine and beeftea dont keep her in bed too much but dont hurry her up rest and relief from lessons is the great thing some healthy pleasure to vary the monotonous routine some liberty of action and something to look forward to would have been better but nobody thought of that how many of those necks were really stiff beyond the will of the sufferer to move it no one will ever know but when it occurred to beth to straighten her own one day she found no difficulty chapter xxxii when beth was moved into the upper school she came under the direct influence of miss crow the english mistress of the third and fourth who had been educated at st catherines herself and was an ardent disciple of miss cliffords beth although predisposed to pietism had not been sensibly influenced by miss cliffords teaching heretofore now however she attached herself to miss crow who began at once to take a special interest in her spiritual welfare she encouraged beth to sit and walk with her when she was on duty and invited her to her room during recreation in order to talk to her earnestly on the subject of salvation or to read to her and expound portions of scripture fine passages from religious books and beautiful hymns some of the hymns she took the trouble to copy out for beths help and comfort when they were specially appropriate to the needs of her nature such as calm me my god and keep me calm or specially suited to her case like call me and i will answer gladly singing beth responded readily to her kindness and very soon became a convert to her views but she did not stop there for it was not in beths nature to rest content with her own conversion while there were so many others still sitting in darkness who might be brought to the light no sooner was she convinced herself than she began to proselytise among the other girls and in a short time her eloquence and force of character attracted a following from all parts of the school miss crow told miss clifford that she spoke like one inspired and high hopes were entertained of the work which they somewhat prematurely concluded she was destined to do unfortunately beths fervent faith received a check at a critical time when it was highly important to have kept it well nourishedthat is to say when she was being prepared for confirmation it happened when miss crow was hearing the girls their scripture lesson one morning the subject being the escape of the children of israel from egypt and the destruction of pharaohs hosts in the red sea i know a man who says the whole of that account has been garbled beth remarked in a dreamy way meaning count gustav bartahlinsky but not thinking much of what she was saying miss crow nearly dropped the bible so greatly was she startled and shocked by the announcement beth she exclaimed directly the class was over and she could speak to beth privately how could you be so wicked as to say that anything in holy scripture is a garbled account i said i knew a man who said so beth answered surprised that so simple a remark should have created such consternation but miss crow saw in her attitude a dangerous tendency to scepticism and expressed strong condemnation of any one who presumed to do other than accept holy writ in blind unquestioning faith she talked to beth with horror about the ungodly men who cast doubt on the unity of the bible called its geology in question and even ventured to correct its chronology by the light of vain modern scientific discoveries and beth shocked her again by the questions she asked and the intelligent interest she showed in the subject she told miss crow that count gustav had also said that the old testament was bad religion and worse history but she did not know that other people had thought so too whereupon miss crow went to miss clifford and reported beths attitude as something too serious for her to deal with alone and miss clifford sent for beth and talked to her long and earnestly she told her that it was absurd for a girl of her age to call in question the teaching of the best and greatest men that ever lived which somehow reminded beth of the many mistakes made by the best and greatest men that ever lived of their differences of opinion and undignified squabbles the instances of one man discovering and suffering for a truth which the rest refused to accept and the constant modification alteration and rejection by one generation of teaching which had been upheld by another with brutality and bloodshedinstances of all of which were notorious enough even to be known at a girls school beth said very little however but she determined to read the bible through from beginning to end and see for herself if she could detect any grounds for the mischiefmaking doubts and controversies she had been hearing about she began in full faith but was brought up short at the very outset by the discrepancy between the first and second chapters of genesis which she perceived for the first time she went steadily on however until she had finished the book of job and then she paused in revolt she could not reconcile the dreadful experiment which had entailed unspeakable suffering and loss irreparable upon a good man with any attribute she had been accustomed to revere in her deity there might be some explanation to excuse this game of god and devil but until she knew the excuse she would vow no adhesion to a power whose conduct on that occasion seemed contrary to every canon of justice and mercy she did not belong to the servile age when men forgetting their manhood fawned on patrons for what they could get and cringingly accepted favours from the dirtiest hands even her god must be worthy to help her worthy to be loved good as well as great the god who connived at the torment of job could not be the god of her salvation beth had spoken casually in class she had never questioned her religion and would not have done so now if the remark had been allowed to pass but the fuss that was made about it and the severity with which she was rebuked by putting her mind into a critical attitude had the effect of concentrating her attention on the subject so that it was the very precautions which were taken to check her supposed scepticism that first made her sceptical the immediate consequence was that she gave up preaching and refused to be confirmed miss clifford miss crow and the chaplain argued expostulated and punished in vain it was the first case of the kind that had occurred in the school and beth was treated as a criminal but she felt more like a martyr and was not to be moved she did not try to make partisans for herself however on the contrary she deserted her family as well as her congregation and took to wandering about alone again but she was not unhappy her old faith had gone it is true but it had left the way prepared for a new one she did not believe in the god of jobbecause she was sure that there must be a better godthat was all from this time however her imagination rode rampant once more over everything the vision and the dream were upon her all wholesome interest in her work was over there was an old piano in the receptionroom which the girls were allowed to use for their amusement on halfholidays and she often went there but even when she practised she moved her fingers mechanically her mind busy with vivid scenes and moving dramatic incidents so that her beloved music was gradually converted from an object in itself into an aid to thought it was only six weeks to the holidays but oh how the days dragged she struggled to be conscientious to be good to please miss crow to escape bad marks but everything was irksome getting up lessons breakfast making her bed practising lessons again dressing going out dinnerthe whole round of regular life was an effort her face grew thin and pale she began to cough and was put upon extras again we cant let you go home looking like that you know nurse said beth looked up at her out of her dream absently and smiled she was enjoying a visionary walk at the moment with a vague being who loved her they were out on a white cliff overlooking the sea in a wild warm region the turf they trod on was vivid green and short and springy the water below was green and bright and clear seabirds skimmed the surface and the air was sweet but presently the road was barred by a rail so they had to stop and he put his arm round her and she laid her head on his shoulder and the murmur of wind and water was in her ears and she became as the lark that sang above them the curlew that piped the quiet cattle and all inanimate thingsuntroubled natural complete all intellectual interest being suspended she had begun to yearn for a companion a mate her delicate mind refused to account for the tender sensation but it was love or rather the mood for love she had fallen intothe passive mood which can be converted into the active in an ordinary young girl by almost any man of average attractions provided she is not already yearning happily for some one in particular it is not until much later that she learns to discriminate there were girls at the school who saw in every man they met a possible lover and were ready to accept any man who offered himself but they were of coarser fibre than beth more susceptible to the physical than to the ideal demands of love and fickle because the man who was present had more power to please than the one who was merely a recollection the actual presence was enough for them they had no ideals with beth it was different her present was apt to be but a poor faded substitute for the future with the infinite range of possibilities she had the power to perceive in it or even for the past as she glorified it while she was in this mood she was particularly provoking to those in authority over her beth said miss crow one day severely you are to go to miss clifford directly beth went i hear said miss clifford in her severest tone that you have not made your bed this morning i went up to make it beth answered trying dreamily to recollect what had happened after that i must give you a bad mark miss clifford said and then paused and beth who had not been attending becoming conscious that something had been bestowed upon her answered politely thank you beth you are impertinent miss clifford exclaimed and i must punish you severely stay in the whole of your halfholiday and do arithmetic then beth awoke with a start and realising what she had done struggled to explain but the moment she became herself again an agony of dumbness came upon her and she left the room without a word she spent the long bright afternoon cowering over her arithmetic and crying at intervals being in the lowest spirits so that by prayertime she was pretty well exhausted she tried to attend to the psalms but in the middle of them she became a poor girl suffering from a cruel sense of injustice all her friends misunderstood her and were unkind to her in consequence of which she pined away and one day in the midst of a large party she dropped down dead and at this point she actually did fall fainting with a thud on the floor miss clifford who was giving out the hymn stopped startled and some of the girls shrieked miss crow and one of the other teachers carried beth out by the nearest door poor little thing said miss crow looking pityingly at her drawn white face and purple eyelids im afraid shes very delicate miss clifford came also when prayers were over and said kind things and from that time forward beth received a great deal of sympathetic attention which did her good but in no way reconciled her to her imprisonment the following term beth watched the spring come in at school with infinite yearning to be outto be free to sit under the appletrees and look up through the boughs at the faintly flushed blossom till the vision and the dream came upon her and she passed from conscious thought into a higher phase of beingjust to do that was her one desire till the petals fell then pleasureboats began to be rowed on the river rowed or steered by girls no older than herself in summer dresses delicately fresh and she seeing them became aware of the staleness of her own shabby clothing and writhed under the rules which would not allow her even to walk on the path overlooking the river and gaze her fill at it the creamy white flowers of the great magnolia on the lawn came out and once she slipped across the grass to peer into them and smell them she got a bad mark for that the second she had had at preparation that evening she sat so that she could see the river and watched it idly instead of working and presently there floated into her mind the rhyme she made when she was a little child at fairholm the fairy folk are calling me suddenly she caught her breath her cheeks flushed her eyes sparkled her whole aspect changed from apathy to animation and she laughed what has happened to please you beth you look quite bright miss bey said meeting her in the vestibule when preparation was over miss bey was said to favour beth by some beth was said to toady bey by others the truth being that they had taken to each other from the first and continued friends ive got a sort of singing at my heart beth answered sparkling the fairy folk are calling me beth slept in no then and had the bed nearest to the window there was a moon that night and she lay long watching the light of it upon the blindlong after the gas was put out and the teachers had gone to their rooms wondering at last if the girls in the room were asleep she sat up in bed the better to be able to hear and judged that they were then she got out of bed walked quietly down the room in her nightdress and bare feet opened the door cautiously and found herself out in the carpetless passage it was dark there but she walked on confidently to the head of the grand staircase which the girls were only allowed to use on special occasions this is a special occasion beth said to herself with a grin the fairy folk are calling me and i must go out and dance on the grass in that lovely moonlight but how to get out was the difficulty the hall door was bolted and barred she went into the first and second there were two large windows in the room which looked into the great conservatory and one of them was open a crack she pushed it up higher and got through into the conservatory there she found a large side window on the left of the first and second also open a little the shelf in front of the window had flowerpots on it which she moved aside then got up herself and with a tug managed to raise the heavy sash then she sat on the sill and looked down it was too far to jump but a sort of dado of ornamental stonework came right up to the window and by the help of this she managed to descend to the ground and found herself free for a moment she stood stretching herself like one just released from a cramped position drawing in deep draughts of the delicious night air the while then she bounded off over the dewy grass and ran and jumped and waved her arms every muscle of her rejoicing in an ecstasy of liberty she ran round to the front of the house regardless of the chance of some one seeing her from one of the windows and danced round and round the magnolia and buried her face in the big white flowers one after the other and bathed it in the dew on their petals then she went to the path by the river and hung over the railing and after that she visited the orchard and every other forbidden place in the grounds in the orchard she found some halfripe fruit under the trees and gathered it and finding that she could not climb into the conservatory again with the fruit in her hands she amused herself by throwing it through the open window it was harder to climb up than it had been to get down but she accomplished the feat at last with sundry abrasions shut the window replaced the flower pots got into the first and second and went back to bed her nightdress was wet with dew and her feet were scratched and dirty but she was too much exhilarated by the exercise and adventure to feel any discomfort she was sitting up in bed hungrily munching some of her spoils when janey north the girl in the next bed awoke what are you eating beth she asked in a cautious voice whispering fearful of awaking a monitress and being reported for talking apples beth answered have some all right but where did you get them janey asked never you mind said beth janey did not mind at the moment and ate the greater number but next day she went treacherously and told in order to ingratiate herself with one of the mistresses and the matter was reported to miss clifford who sent for beth janey north was also sent for what is this i hear about your having apples in your bedroom last night beth miss clifford said a story i should think beth answered readily who told you janey north looked disconcerted what have you to say miss north miss clifford asked you were eating apples janey said to beth how do you know beth asked suavely i saw you what in the middle of the night when the gas was out yeyes janey faltered beth shrugged her shoulders and looked at miss clifford who said severely i think miss north you have either dreamt this story or invented it janey was barred in the school after that the girls deciding that whether the story were true or not she was a dockyard girl for telling it it was beths sporting instinct that had made her evade the question when she had won the game and the excitement was over she felt she had been guilty of duplicity and determined to confess when miss clifford sent for her next and gave her a good opportunity she would have gone at once but for the dread of losing the precious liberty that was life to her all through the weeks that followed she kept herself sane and healthy by midnight exercises in the moonlight her appetite had failed her till she took to this diversion but after her second ramble she was so hungry that she went down to the kitchen boldly to forage in the hope of finding a crust the fire was still burning brightly and by its light she discovered on the table the thick bread and butter for the next mornings breakfast all cut ready and piled up under covers on the dishes there was half a jug of beer besides doubtless left from the servants supper it was rather flat but she thought it and the new bread and butter delicious she had a bad cold after the first ramble but that was the only one strange to relate for she always went out in her nightdress and barefooted during this time her imagination was exceedingly active and her health improved but her work was a greater trouble than ever she had just been put into the third but miss clifford threatened to put her down again if she did not do better and one day she sent for beth who went trembling under the impression that that was what the summons was for she found miss clifford and miss bey discussing a letter and both looking very serious beth miss clifford began a gentleman whom i know well has written to tell me that he was walking home by the riverpath at two oclock on monday morning and saw a girl here at st catherines with only her nightdress on hanging over the railing looking into the river and i am sure from the description it was you yes said beth i saw him miss clifford let the letter fall on her lap and miss bey dropped into a chair beth looked on with interest and wondered about that accurate description of herself she would have given anything to see it what were you doing there miss clifford asked and beth noticed that she was treating the matter just as her mother had treated the menagerie business just looking at the water beth said at two oclock in the morning how did you get out by the conservatory window had you been out before oh yes often do any of the other girls go out not that i know of said beth then added no im sure they dont thank heaven for that at all events miss clifford ejaculated then she made beth sit down beside her and took her hand and gazed at her long and sorrowfully was it such a very dreadful thing to do beth asked at last you have been a great disappointment to me beth miss clifford answered indirectly and to miss bey we expected more of you than of any other girl now in the schoolyou promised so well in many ways at one time did i said beth looking from one to the other in consternation oh why didnt you tell me i thought you all fancied i should never do anything well and that disheartened me if i had known she burst into tears late that night miss clifford and miss bey sat together discussing beth i feel more than ever convinced there is something exceptional about the child miss clifford declared i hope it is not insanity but at all events it is not sin and i wont have her punished i say now what i said at first she should have been sent here early or not at all and now she must go what expel her miss bey ejaculated no didnt i say i would not have her punished there is some explanation of her wild escapade besides mere naughtiness i feel sure and she shall have every chance that i can give her there is no vice in her of any kind that i can discover and she is fearlessly honest if she were grownup we should call her eccentric and be interested and amused by her vagaries and i do not see why she should not be allowed the same excuse as it is only st catherines is not the place for her here all must move in the common orbit to save confusion so i shall write to her mother and get her to take her from the school at the end of the term in the regular way but in the meantime miss bey asked beth has given me her word that she will be good and do nothing i should disapprove of and she will keep it so beths credit was saved by the good judgment of this kind wise woman and her career at st catherines ended honourably if somewhat abruptly chapter xxxiii when it was rumoured amongst the mistresses that beth was to leave that term old tom put her on to play first piano in the firstclass solo and to lead the treble in the secondclass duet at the examination for i rather like ye miss beth caldwell she said youre not a sycophant whatever else ye are theyve not been able to do much wi ye in regard to yer work in the rest of the school but yeve done well under me and ill let ye have yer chance to distinguish yerself before ye go oh but do you think i can do it beth exclaimed ye can do anything ye set yerself to do beth caldwell old tom shouted at her beth set herself accordingly and when the day came she led the solo and duet with the precision of a musical box but with such an expenditure of nervepower that she was prostrated by the effort she was considered quite a musician at st catherines but by this time the dire method of teaching had had its effect her confidence and her memory for music were gone the beauty of her touch spoilt and the further development of her talent effectually checked she did not go home for the holidays miss clifford had advised lady benyon approved and mrs caldwell decided that she should be sent direct to a finishing school in london and when st catherines broke up miss bey who happened to be going that way goodnaturedly undertook to see beth safely to her destination miss clifford held beths hand long and gazed into her face earnestly when she took leave of her i shall hear of you again she said and i pray god it may be good news but it depends upon yourself beth we are free agents goodbye my dear child and god bless you beth had been eighteen intolerable months at the school and had been exceedingly miserable most of the time yet she left it with tears in her eyes melted and surprised by the kindest farewells from every one it had never dawned upon her until that moment that she was really very much liked her new school was a large house in a long wide street of houses all exactly alike when she arrived with miss bey they were shown into a deliciously cool shady drawingroom charmingly furnished and the effect upon beth after the graceless bareness of st catherines was altogether reassuring in front of the fireplace which was hidden by ferns and flowering plants a slender girl with thick dark hair down her back was lying on the white woolly hearthrug reading she got up to greet the visitors without embarrassment still holding her book in her hand miss blackburne will be here directly she said will you sit down then there was a little pause which miss bey broke by asking in her magisterial way what is that you are reading my dear the idylls of the king the girl answered miss beys nostrils flapped is it not rather advanced for you my dear she said we do not allow it at all even to our firstclass girls oh miss blackburne likes us to read it was the easy answer she says that tennyson and all the good modern writers are a part of our education thank goodness beth ejaculated fervently at st catherines our minds were starved on books suited to the capacity of infants and imbeciles i should think beth you are hardly old enough or educated enough to be a judge of literature as yet miss bey said severely nor do i pretend to be a judge how can i know anything of literature when literature is unknown at st catherines but i should think babes and sucklings would be wise enough to object to the silly trash we had instead of literature beth spoke emphatically shaking herself free of the restrictions of the royal service school for officers daughters once for all miss blackburne came in while she was speaking and smiled i like to hear a girl express an opinion she said she may be quite wrong but she must have some mind if she attempts to think for herself at all and mind is material to work upon im afraid i havent much mind beth said sighing or manner either miss blackburne smiled again and looked at miss bey but miss bey supported beth in her selfdepreciation by preserving an ominous silence this is one of your new schoolfellows miss blackburne said to beth let me introduce you to each other clara herring beth caldwell when miss bey took her leave miss blackburne left the room with her and immediately afterwards another girl came in clapping her hands oh i say she exclaimed signor caponi is a dear he has the nicest chocolate eyes and he says my italian is wonderful now ive done all my work for today have you said beth why it isnt five oclock yet miss blackburne wont let us work long hours the girl rejoined she says it destroys our freshness but let us know each others names i am geraldine tressillion good name for a novel isnt it and she clapped her little white hands and laughed again thats just what youre made to bethe heroine of a novel clara herring observed looking at her admiringly i always think of you when i come across a gay one with golden hair and blue eyes i have my good points i know geraldine rejoined but how about my hips too high alas oh that wont show much while youre slight said clara looking at her critically well ill make haste and marry me before im afflicted with flesh as im sure to become for i deny myself nothingi live to eat geraldine rattled on cheerfully one cant get very fat before one comes out and i hate a thin dowager im engaged already you know but i dont like the man muchdont like him at all in fact and my sister says i can do better shes been married a year and has a baby she told me all about it mamma imagines were all innocent a lady implored her to tell my sister things before she married but she said she really could not speak to an innocent girl on such a subject i dont believe she was ever so innocent herself a grown girl cant be innocent unless shes a fool but anyway its the right pose to pretend youve got to play the silly fool to please a man then he feels superior but its hypocritical said beth yes my dear but you must be hypocritical if you want to be a mans ideal of a woman you must know nothing do nothing see nothing but just what suits his pleasure and convenience and in order to answer to his requirements you must be either a hypocrite or a blind worm without eyes or intelligence men dont like innocence because its holy but because it whets their appetites my sister says and if theyre deceived it serves them right they work the world for their own pleasure not ours and we must look out for ourselves if we want money liberty devotion admiration and any other luxury we must pretend dont you see i dont know beth rejoined but personally i shall never pretend anything then you will suffer for your sincerity geraldine rejoined beth shrugged her shoulders the turn the conversation had taken was distasteful to her and she would not pursue it there was a pause then clara observed sententiously innocence is not impossible geraldine surely adelaide is innocent enough i said innocence and intelligence were incompatible geraldine answered you dont call adelaide intelligent do you who is adelaide beth asked the daughter of a roman catholic peer geraldine replied she is eighteen and her mind is absolutely undeveloped we think shes in training for a convent and thats why they dont let her learn much miss ella blackburne is a roman catholic and so also is adelaides maid they trot her round to all the observances of her church regularly and in the intervals she plays with the kitten i dont know why she should have been sent here at all for this is a regular forcinghouse for the marriage market miss blackburne expects all her girls to marry well and they generally do i should think miss beth she will be able to make something of you with those eyes look at its neck and shoulders too and the way its head is set on them clara exclaimed not to mention its hands and its complexion geraldine supplemented but its voice alonesoft gentle and lowwould get it into the peerage beth unused to be appraised in this way blushed and smiled rather pleased but confused how many girls are there here she asked to change the subject six boarders till you came but now we are seven clara answered there are some daygirls too but they are children and dont count the greatest pickle in the school is the daughter of an archbishopat least she has been the greatest pickle so farwe dont know you as yet however but we have heard things come and see my room geraldine interrupted and perhaps youd like to see your own its next to mine are you allowed to go up and down stairs just as you like beth asked in surprise why of course geraldine cried you can go where you like and sit where you like when youve done your work were not in prison beth had a dainty little room hung with white curtains all to herself her heart expanded when she saw it the delightful appearance of her new surroundings had already begun to have the happiest effect upon her mind when geraldine took her into her own room she drew a yellow book from under a quantity of linen in a drawer its a french novel she said miss blackburne wouldnt let me read it for worlds if she knew so you mustnt tell ill lend it to you if you like i couldnt read it if i would i dont know enough beth said oh youll soon learn and ill tell you all there is in it i say what size is your waist mine is only seventeen inches but i laced till i got shingles to reduce it to that i know a doctor who says small waists are neither healthy nor beautiful but then theyre the fashion and men are such awful fools about fashion they sneer at a healthy figure and saddle themselves every day with ailing wives all deformed because theyre accustomed to see women so and then they call us silly my husband wont think me silly once i get command of his money whatever else he may think me till then she made a pretty gesture with her hands and laughedbeth observing her the while with deep attention as a new specimen she found eventually that geraldine was not at all a bad girl or in the least inclined to be vicious her conversation notwithstanding she was merely a shrewd one learning how to protect herself in that state of life to which she was destined if a woman is to make her way in society and keep straight she must have wits and knowledge of a special kind there is probably no more delightful highminded charmingmannered honourable and trustworthy woman in the world than a wellbred englishwoman but on the other hand there can be nothing more vulgarminded coarse and despicable than women of fashion tend to become there is no meanness nor shabbiness not to mention fraud that they will not stoop to when it suits themselves from tricking a tradesman and sweating a servant to neglecting their children deceiving their husbands and slandering their friends they are sheep running hither and thither in servile imitation of each other without an original thought amongst them the froth of society with the natural tendency of froth to rise to the surface and thence be swept aside mere bubbles that shine a moment and then burst it is fashion that unsexes women and unmakes men to be in the world of fashion and of it is to degenerate but to be in it and not of it to know it and remain untainted despising all it has to give makes towards solid advance there are some ugly stages to be gone through however before the advancement is pronounced the six girls at miss blackburnes were all daughters of people of position all enjoying the same advantages and under the same influences but three of them were already shaping themselves into women of fashion while the other three were tending as inevitably to develop into women of fine character and cultivated mind beth was attracted to all such women and recognised their worth often long before they appreciated her at all she was seventh among the girls her place being in the middle as it were with three on either side of her teaching her all they could as was inevitable in association with the budding women of fashion she lost the first fine delicacy of maiden modesty of mind but the example of the young gentlewomen on the other hand confirmed her taste and settled her convictions the ladies who kept the school were highminded themselves and exemplary in every possible way and if they did not make all their pupils equally so it was because factors go to the formation of character with which for want of knowledge no one can reckon at present the influence of these ladies upon beth was altogether benign she was in a new world with thema world of ease and refinement of polished manners of kindly consideration where instead of being harried by nagging rules stultified by every kind of restraint and lowered in her own estimation for want of proper respect and encouragement she was allowed as much liberty as she would have had in a wellordered home and found herself and her abilities of special interest to each of her teachers instead of being an item a part of a huge piece of machinery to be strictly kept in the particular place assigned to her whether it were adapted to the needs of her nature or not for fear of putting the whole mechanism out of order her present and future being less considered than the smooth working of the machineshe was a girl again with some character of her own to be formed and developed here too she was put upon her honour to do all that was expected of her and the immediate consequence of this in her case was the most scrupulous exactness she attached herself to miss ella attracted first of all by the fact that she was a roman catholic how she could be one was a mystery beth longed to solve but miss ella did not consider it loyal to protestant parents to influence their daughters at school and would give her no help in this in every other respect however beth found her exceedingly kind and sympathetic a serene strong woman who began to curb the exuberance of beths naughtiness from the first and to direct the energy of which it was the outcome into profitable channels there was no monotony in miss blackburnes establishment the girls were taken in turns to operas concerts picturegalleries and every kind of exhibition that might help to cultivate their minds to be able to discuss such things was a part of their education they were expected to describe all they saw fluently and pleasantly but without criticism enough to require thought and provoke argument which is apt to be tedious and thus was formed the habit of chatting in the genial light frothy way which does duty for conversation in society geraldine had not exaggerated when she called miss blackburnes school a forcing house for the marriage market at that time marriage was the only career open to a gentlewoman and the object of her education was to make her attractive the theory then was that solid acquirements were beyond the physical strength of girls besides being unnecessary showy accomplishments therefore were all that was aimed at but they had to be thorough music singing drawing dancing french german italianwhatever it might be the girl who was learning it had the greatest attention from her master or mistress during the lesson she was made to do it as much by the will of the teacher as by her own intelligence this was the first experience of thorough teaching beth had ever had and she enjoyed it and would have worked harder to profit by it than miss blackburne would allow as it was she made great progress with her work while all the time the more informal but most valuable part of her education which was directed to the strengthening of every womanly attribute went on steadily under the influence of miss ella it would have been well for beth if she had been left at miss blackburnes for the next three years but just when the rebellious beating of her wings against the bars had ceased and they had folded themselves contentedly behind her for awhile just when the wild flights of her imagination were giving way to wholesome habits of thought and her own vain dreams were being dissipated by the honest ambition to accomplish something actualshe was summoned away her sister mildred had died suddenly of meningitis and the immediate effect of the shock on mrs caldwell who had dearly loved her eldest daughter was a kindlier feeling for beth and a wish to have her at homefor a time at all events and beth went willingly under the circumstances she sympathised deeply with her mother and was full of grief herself for her sister to whom she had been tenderly attached although they had seen so little of each other beth was not yet sixteen and this was the third blow that death had dealt her chapter xxxiv beth had a natural love of order and at school she had learnt the necessity for it she did not mean to give up work when she went home on the contrary she determined to do more than ever miss ella had taught her to be deliberate neither to haste nor to rest but steadily to pursue she insisted that things to be well done must be done regularly and beth in accordance with this precept mapped out her day so as to make the most of it she got up at seven opened her window wider threw the clothes back from her bed to air it had her bath brushed her hair left nothing untidy lying about her room did her good reading the psalms and lessons breakfasted made her bed studied french went out for exercise sewed and read so much all in the same order every day she paid particular attention to her personal appearance too that being the one of her mothers principles which had also been most particularly enjoined by miss blackburne at both of her schools marriage was the great ambition of most of the girls at st catherines it meant a means of escape from many hardships to miss blackburnes girls it offered the chance of a better position and more money and luxury there was a nicer tone among the royal service girls and more reticence in their discussions of the subject than at miss blackburnes where the girls were not at all highminded and talked of their chances with the utmost frankness not to say coarseness but good looks were held to be the best if not the only means to the end in both sets money and accomplishments might help but personal appearance was the great certainty and beth was naturally impressed with this idea like the rest marriage however was far from being the distinct object of her life in fact she had no distinct object at all as yet she had always meant to do something or rather to be something but further than that she had not got miss blackburne had paid particular attention to the cultivation of the speaking voice and it was from her that beth had learnt how to round hers to richness and modulate it so that its natural sweetness and charm were greatly enhanced there was considerable difference of opinion about her looks she was always striking in appearance but dress for one thing altered her very much and the state of her mind still more people who met her on one occasion admired her exceedingly and on the next wondered why they had thought her goodlooking at all she had the mesmeric quality which makes it impossible to escape observation and her personality never failed to interest the intelligent whether it pleased them or not but she was only at her best in mind manner and appearance when her fitful further faculty was active then indeed she shone with a strange loveliness a light to be felt rather than seen and not to be described at all at such times the mere physical beauty of other women went out in her immediate neighbourhood and was no more thought of it was not until she was quite mature however that her manner permanently acquired that subtle indefinable quality called charm which is the outcome of a large tolerant nature and kindness of heart it was as if she did not come into full possession of her true self until she had experienced numberless other phases of being common to the race hence the apparently incongruous mixture she presented in the earlier stages of her youth her sluggish indifference at times her excesses of energy and zeal her variations of taste at first after she left school as was inevitable her selfdiscipline was irksome enough at times and some of the details she shirked but not for long because the time which accustomed duties should have occupied hung heavy on her hands and she felt dissatisfied with herself rather than relieved when she neglected them so by degrees her habits were formed and in after life she found them a very present help in time of trouble anchors which kept her from drifting to leeward as she must have done but for their hold upon her some of her erratic tricks were not to be cured but they came to be part of the days work rather than a hindrance to it she saw many a sunrise for instance and revelled with uplifted spirit in the beauty and wonder of the hour but the soul that sang responsive to the glories of the summer dawn the colour the freshness the perfume was steeped at noon with equal energy in the book she was studying so that instead of losing anything she gained that day one sunrise more when she left school beth was fastidiously refined she hurried over all the hateful words and passages in the bible shakespeare or any other book she might be reading the words she would not even pronounce to herself so strongly did her delicate mind revolt from a vile idea and sicken at the expression of it but nevertheless she pored patiently over every book she could get that had a great reputation and in this way she read many not usually given to girls and became familiarised with certain facts of life not generally supposed to be of soulmaking material but she took no harm the soul that is shaping itself to noble purpose the growing soul tries more than is proper for its nourishment in its search for sustenance but rejects all that is unnecessary or injurious as water creatures without intelligence reject any unsuitable substance they collect with their food before she had been many days at home beth found that her mother had made a new acquaintance who came to the house often in a casual way like an intimate friend he came in on the day of her arrival after dinner and was introduced to beth by her mother as the doctor beth broke into smiles for she recognised her longago acquaintance of the rocks the doctor of her hectorromance and it seemed he really was a doctor now that was a singular coincidence in their little drawingroom she discovered him to be a bigger man than she had supposed but otherwise he was like her first impression of him striking because of his colouring the red and white of his complexion which was unusually clear for a man and the lightness of his greygreen eyes being in peculiar contrast to the blackness of his hair she noticed again too that the expression of his face when he smiled was not altogether agreeable because his teeth were too far apart and she also thought his finelyformed hands would have looked better had they not been so obtrusively white but we have met before he exclaimed when beth acknowledged the introduction you are the young lady i helped on the rocks one day quite a long time ago now when you were a little girl i remember beth said noticing that he claimed to have helped her on that occasion and remembering also that she had declined his help you never told me beth her mother said reproachfully there was really nothing to tell he answered coming to the rescue what a day that was beth observed did you notice the sea it was the sort of sea that might make one long to be a crab to live in it though a crab is not the animal that i should specially choose to be i long to be a cat sometimes to be able to fluff out my fur and spit would be such a satisfaction there are feelings that can be expressed in no other way and then to be able to purr purring is the one sound in nature that expresses perfect comfort and content i think beth dont talk nonsense her mother said impatiently oh its not nonsense altogether the doctor interposed it is just cheery chatter and that is good miss beth will raise your spirits in no time or im much mistaken he had watched beth with gravity while she was speaking as one sees people watch an actress critically obviously marking her points but betraying no emotion mrs caldwell sighed heavily the doctor has been so good beth she said he has come here continually and done more to cheer me than anybody oh now mrs caldwell you exaggerate he remonstrated with a smile but its my principle you know to be cheery i always say be cheery whatever happens its no use crying over spilt milk a merry heart goes all the day your sad tires in a milea beth rattled off glibly and again the doctor considered her now thats good he said just as if he had never heard it before and its my meaning exactly dont let your spirits go down for theres many a girl as i know well alooking for you in the town beth concluded her spirits rising uproariously beth her mother remonstrated but with a smile the worst of it is the ones on the lookout are not the ones with the good looks the doctor observed also smiling but they are the ones with the money beth rejoined i wonder how it is that plain girls so often have money i suppose the moneygrubbing spirit comes out in ugliness in the female branch tea was brought in but beth refused to take any the doctor tried to persuade her you had better change your mind he said ladies are privileged to change their minds i know said beth ladies are privileged to be foolish it is almost the only privilege men allow them i scorn it myself at school we were warned to be firm when once we had said no thank you miss ella used to say that people who allowed themselves to be overpersuaded and changed their minds lost selfcontrol and became selfindulgent eventually ah that makes me think of my poor dear mother said the doctor a better and more consistent woman never lived once she said a thing you couldnt move her she was a good mother to me i was always her favourite son but like other young fellows im afraid i didnt half appreciate her till i had lost her all the same i am sure you were all that a good son should be mrs caldwell observed sincerely the doctors eyes shone with emotion when he had gone mrs caldwell began to discuss him he really is cheery she said he always raises my spirits and i am sure he is good and kind did you see how his eyes filled with tears when he mentioned his mother he is handsome too dont you think so such a colour and always so well dressed lady benyon admires him very much but he gets on with every one even uncle james what do you think of him beth i think he looks neat to the point of nattiness which is finical in a man beth answered ah that is because you are not accustomed to welldressed men her mother assured her here in rainharbour you dont often see one i have been in london lately beth observed beth her mother began emphatically that is so like you will you never get out of the habit of answering so you are always in opposition and it is too conceited of you at your age i did hope they would have cured you of the trick at school but no sooner do you get home than you begin again as bad as ever well rather than displease you mamma ill do my best to hold my tongue for the future when i cant say what you want me to say beth answered cheerfully i came home to be a comfort to you and if i cant be a comfort to you and express myself as well why i must go unexpressed now there you are again beth mrs caldwell cried peevishly is that a nice thing to say beth looked at her mother and smiled enigmatically then she reflected then her countenance cleared mamma she said your hair is much whiter than it was but i dont think i ever saw you look so nice you have such a pretty complexion and so few wrinkles and such even teeth what a handsome girl you must have been mrs caldwell smiled complacently and went to bed in high good humour she told bernadine as they undressed that she thought beth greatly improved but beth herself lay long awake that night tossing and troubled feeling far from satisfied either with herself or anybody else the next morning she rose early and drew up her plan of life chapter xxxv as that first day at home wore on beth was seized with an importunate yearning to go out and it was with difficulty that she got through her selfappointed tasks she thought of the sea the shore the silence and solitude which were apt to be so soothing to her dull senses that she ceased to perceive with them and so passed into the possession of her farther faculty for blissful moments she fancied the sea was as she best loved to have it her favourite sea with tiny wavelets bringing the tide in imperceptibly over the rocks and the long stretch of water beyond heaving gently up to the horizon with smooth unruffled surface shining in the sun when she had done her work she fared forth to the sea to sit by it and feel the healthy happy freshness of it all about her and in herself as well she went to the rocks the tide was coming in the water however was not molten silvergrey as she had imagined it but bright dark sapphire blue with crisp white crests to the waves which were merry and tumbled it was the sea for an active not for a meditative mood its voice called to play rather than to that prayer of the whole being which comes of the contemplation of its calmness it exhilarated instead of soothing and made her joyous as she had not been since she went to school she stood long on the rocks by the waters edge retreating as the tide advanced watching wave after wave curve and hollow itself and break and curve and hollow itself and break again the sweet seabreeze sang in her ears and braced her with its freshness while the continuous sound of wind and water went from her consciousness and came again with the ebb and flow of her thoughts but the strength and swirl of the water its tireless force its incessant voices choiring on a chorus of numberless notes invited her fascinated her filled her with longinglonging to trust herself to the waves to lie still and let them rock her to be borne out by them a little way and brought back again passive yet in ecstatic enjoyment of the dreamy motion the longing became an impulse she put her hand to her throat to undo her dressbut she did not undo itshe never knew why had she yielded to the attraction she must have been drowned for she could swim but little and the water was deeper than she knew and the current strong and she might have yielded just as she resisted for no reason that rendered itself into intelligible thought she turned from the scene of her strange impulse and began to wander back over the rocks suffering the while from that dull drop of the spirit which sets in at the reaction after moments of special intensity and in this mood she came upon the doctor also climbing the rocks now it is a singular coincidence that i should meet you here again he said beth smiled i am afraid those nice boots of yours will suffer on these sharp rocks she remarked by way of saying something we natives keep our old ones for the purpose ah he said i dont keep old ones for any purpose i have an objection to everything old old people included beth had a book under her arm and he coolly took it from her as he spoke and read the title drydens poetical works ah so you carry the means of improving your mind at odd moments about with you well im not surprised for i heard you were clever beth smiled more pleased than if he had called her beautiful but she wondered if dryden could properly be called improving it is absurd to keep a girl at school who has got as far as this kind of thing he added tapping the old brown book but it seems to me they dont understand you much at home little lady what makes you think so beth asked shrewdly oh he answered somewhat disconcerted i judge fromfrom things i hear and see this implied sympathy and again beth was pleased it was late when she got in and she expected her mother to be annoyed but mrs caldwell was all smiles i suppose the doctor found you she said he asked where you were and i said on the rocks probably that accounts for the singular coincidence beth observed but girllike she thought less at the moment of the little insincerity than of the compliment his following her implied they dined that evening with lady benyon it was a quiet little family party including uncle james and aunt grace mary the doctor was the only stranger present he looked very well in evening dress striking isnt he aunt grace mary whispered to beth such colouring and how are you dan was uncle jamess greeting uttered with an affectation of cordiality in his unexpected little voice that interested beth she wondered what was toward she noticed too that she herself was an object of special attention and her heart expanded with gratification very little kindness went a long way with beth dr dan took her in to dinner by the way he said looking across the table at uncle james i went to see that old mrs prince your keepers mother as i promised shes a wonderful old woman for eightyfive i shouldnt be surprised if she lived to a hundred dear dear uncle james ejaculated with something like consternation i seem to have put my foot in it somehow dr dan remarked to beth confidentially if you do anything to keep her alive you will beth answered uncle james always speaks bitterly about elderly womenabout old ones he is perfectly rabid he seems to think they rob worthy men of part of their time by living so long it was arranged before the party broke up that the doctor should drive beth to fairholm in the benyon dogcart to lunch next day beth was surprised and delighted to find herself the object of so much consideration dr dan as they all called him began to be associated in her mind with happy days have you come to live here she asked as they drove along no he answered i am only putting in the time until i can settle down to a practice of my own i have just heard of one which i shall buy if i can get an appointment i am trying for in the same place what is the appointment beth asked its a hospital i want to be put in charge of he answered casuallya small affair but i should get a regular income from it and that would make my rent and all that sort of thing secure a doctor has to set up with a show of affluence it is a terrible profession to me the medical profession beth said the responsibilities must be so great and so various oh i never think of that he answered easily i should beth rejoined yes you would of course he said and that shows what folly it is for women to go in for medicine they worry about this and that things that are the patients lookout not the doctors and make no end of mischief besides always losing their heads in a difficulty just then the horse which had been very fidgety all the way bolted the blood rushed into the doctors face sit tight sit tight he exclaimed dont nownow dont move and make a fuss keep cool keep cool yourself said beth dryly im all right dr dan glanced at her sideways and saw that she was laughing when they arrived at fairholm he made much of the incident if i hadnt had my wits about me there would have been a smash he vowed but i happened to be on the spot myself and miss beth behaved admirably most girls would have shrieked you know but she behaved heroically this was all rather gushing but it did not offend beth because she associated gush with aunt grace mary who had always been kind to her gushing people are usually weak and amiable gush being the illjudged outcome of a desire to please but at that happy age it was the amiable intention that beth took into account her desire to be pleased which had so seldom been gratified had become a danger to her judgment by this time it made her apt to respond to any attempt to please her without considering means and motives which should have discounted her appreciation everybody was trying to please her now and all her being answered only too readily she spent a delightful day at fairholm and went home in extravagantly high spirits dr dan called early the next morning and found her with her hat on just going out how are you this misty cold grey day he asked oh very bright she answered i feel as if i were the sun and im just going to shine out on the world to enliven it may i accompany you he asked the sun alas is a solitary luminary she answered shaking her head then i shall hope for better luck next time he said and let her go alone in the evening he came in again to have a game of cribbage with mrs caldwell beth was sleepy and had gone to bed early in the pauses of the game they talked about her and the responsibilities of a family a girl wants some one to look after her the doctor said especially if she has money yes indeed mrs caldwell replied girls are a great anxiety now a boy you can put into a profession and have done with it but it is not so easy to find a suitable husband for a girl but of course if she has a little money it makes a difference he observed only she should have some one to advise her in the spending of it now miss beth for instance will be as much a child at twentyone in money matters as she is now i hope we shall find the right man for her before then mrs caldwell answered archly not that i think her aunts fortune will cause her much anxiety she alluded to the smallness of the sum she gets some of the interest i suppose to go on with he said just enough to dress on beth saw a great deal of dr dan after that she was not in the least in love with him but they became intimate all the sooner on that account a girl shrinks more shyly from a man she loves than from one for whom she has only a liking in the one case every womanly instinct is on the alert in the other her feeling is not strong enough to seem worth curbing beth was fond of mens companionship and dr dans assiduous attentions enlivened her made her brain active and brought the vision and the dream within reach so that she moved in a happy light but considered the source of it no more than she would have considered the stick that held the candle by which she read an entrancing book there are idyllic gleams in all interesting lives but life as we live it from day to day is not idyllic in beths case there was the inevitable friction the shocks and jars of difficulties and disagreements with her mother these had been suspended for a time after her return but began to break out again fomented very often by bernadine who was always her mothers favourite but was never a pleasant child dr dan came one very wet day and found beth sitting in the drawingroom alone looking miserable she had done all her little selfimposed tasks honestly but had reaped no reward on the contrary there had come upon her a dreadful vision of herself doing that sort of thing on always into old age as aunt victoria did her french with no object and to no purpose and for the first time she formulated a feeling that had gradually been growing up in her of late i must have more of a life than this what could she do however tied to that stupid place without a suspicion as yet that she had it in her to do anything special and without friends to help her with no one to advise as she reflected the hopelessness of it all wrung from her some of the bitterest tears she ever shed if her mother would only send her back to miss blackburne she would be learning something at all events but although mrs caldwell had said nothing definite on the subject beth was pretty certain by this time that she did not mean to let her return to school beth was in the middle of this misery when dr dan arrived hows this he said down you should have the window open its not cold today though its wet and the room is quite stuffy never be afraid of fresh air you know im not beth said i didnt know the window was shut open it as wide as you likethe wider the better for me thats better he said as the fresh air flowed in its singular how women will shut themselves up no wonder they get out of spirits now i never let myself run down when one thing goes wrong i just take up another and dont bother youd think i wasnt having much of a time here but im as happy as the day is long and i want to see you the same he sat down beside her on the oldfashioned sofa took her hand and began to stroke it gently cheer up little girl he added i believe youve been crying arent they kind to you oh yes theyre kind enough beth answered soothed by the caress at least they mean to be the misery is in myself i feel all dissatisfied not when im with you do you he asked reproachfully no i dont bother about myself when i have you to talk to beth answered you come in fresh and give me something else to think about then look here beth he said putting his arm round her i dont think i can do better than take you away with me youve a head on your shoulders and an original way with you that would be sure to bring people about the house and youre well connected and look itall of which would be good for my practice besides a young doctor must marry im over thirty though you might not think it come what do you say youd have a very good time of it as my wife i can tell you all your own way and no nagging you know what i am a cheery fellow never put out by anything now what do you say are you asking me to marry you said beth breaking into a smile the position struck her as comical rather than serious why what else he replied smiling also i see you are recovering your spirits youll be as happy as the day is long when were married youd never get on with anybody else as youd do with me i dont think anybody else would understand you beth laughed she liked him and she liked to be caressed why not marry him and be independent of every one she hadnt the slightest objection at the moment far from it for she saw in the offer the one means of escape she was likely to have from the long dull dreary days and the loneliness which was all the life she could have to look forward to when he had gone and he was goodlooking too and niceeverybody said so besides they would all be pleased if she accepted him her mother especially so now that she came to think of it she perceived that this was what they had been suggesting to her ever since her return it is settled then he said stooping forward to look into her face she looked at him shyly and laughed again for the life of her she could not keep her countenance although she felt she was behaving in the silly gigglinggirl sort of way she so much despised thats all right he exclaimed looking extremely well pleased and at that moment mrs caldwell walked into the room just in time to witness a loverlike caress beth jumped up covered with confusion mrs caldwell looked from one to the other and waited for an explanation weve just come to the conclusion that we cannot live apart dan said deliberately rising at the same time and taking beths hand my dear child mrs caldwell exclaimed embracing beth with happy tears in her eyes this is a joy i do congratulate you beth became suddenly serious the aspect of the affair had changed it was no longer a game of the moment but a settled business already irrevocable she wanted to explain that she had not actually pledged herself that she must take time to consider but her heart failed her in view of her mothers delight it was beths great weakness that as a rule she could neither spoil pleasure nor give pain to save herself in an emergency chapter xxxvi when dan came to see her the next morning he found her in a mixed mood halfadozen times during the night she had declined to marry him in a painful scene but just as often her imagination would run on into the unknown life she would have to lead with him she saw herself in white satin and lace and pearls a slender figure at the head of a long diningtable interesting to everybody and dan was at the foot looking quite distinguished in evening dress with his glossy black hair and wonderful clear skin she had gathered the nicest people in the neighbourhood about her and on her right there was a shadowy person a man of mark and knightly who delighted in her conversation when she came downstairs to receive dan she was coughing and he showed his devotion by being greatly concerned about her health he said she must have port wine and a tonic and be out in the air as much as possible and suggested that they should go for a walk at once as it was a lovely day though still wet under foot i would not ask you to walk if i had a carriage to offer you he said for i hate to see a delicate lady on foot in the mud but you shall have your carriage yet please god all in good time where shall we go said beth when they left the house oh anywhere he answered take me to one of your own favourite haunts she thought of the fairholm cliffs for a moment but felt that they were sacred to many recollections with which she would not care to associate this new experience ill show you the chalybeate spring she said they turned out of orchard street and went down the hill to the beck a broad clear shallow rivulet that came round a sharp green curve between high banks well wooded with old trees all in their heavy darkgreen summer foliage as they crossed the rustic wooden bridge beth paused a little to look up at the trees and love them and down into the clear water at the scarlet sticklebacks heading up stream her companion looked at her in surprise when she stopped and then followed the direction of her eyes all he saw however was a shallow stream a green bank and some trees this is not very interesting he observed beth made no reply but led the way up the hill on the other side and to the right passed a row of cottages with long gardens at the back running down to the brow of the bank that overhung the beck in most of these cottages she was an object of suspicion because of her uncanny words and ways and she knew it and the thought of it was a grief to her she wanted the people to like her as she would have liked them had they let her the wish to win them fired her imagination she looked on ahead into futurity and was a beautiful lady driving a pair of ponies down a wooded lane with a carriage full of good things for the cottagers and they all loved her and were very glad to see her what are you thinking about dan asked how nice it would be to be rich she replied but you will be well off when youre twentyone i am told i suppose theres a chance of it she answered dreamily the ponies had arrived at the village by this time and she was looking up at an old grey church with a red roof do you know what your aunts income was he asked seven or eight hundred a year she answered absently the sextons little house stood by the gate leading into the churchyard his wife came out when the carriage stopped wiping soapsuds from her bare arms with her apron beth leaned forward and held out her hand to her and the woman smiled a cordial welcome she had a round flat face and fair hair then beth handed her a mysterious package from the carriage which she received half in delight and half in inquiry but beths imagination stopped there for she perceived that she had passed the gate of the garden in which was the chalybeate spring there was a cottage in the garden and beth turned back and went up to the door where a woman was standing holding a plump child whose little fat thigh indented by the pressure bulged over her bare arm may we have a drink please beth asked yes and welcome the woman answered ill fetch you a glass let me hold the baby said beth the woman smiled and handed him to her beth took him awkwardly and squeezed him up in her arms as a child holds a kitten isnt he nice she said thats a matter of taste dan answered i dont like em fatbottomed myself beth froze at the expression when the woman returned she handed the child back to her carefully but without a smile took the glass and went down to the spring by a narrow winding path which took them out of sight of the cottage directly here it was old trees again and green banks with the beck below when they were under the trees beth looked up at a big elm and her companion noticed her lips move what are you saying to yourself he asked nothing to myself she answered im saying oh tree give me of thy strength the eastern invocation he laughed and wanted to know what rot that was and again beth was jarred youll have no luck if you dont respect the big trees she said oh by jove if we wait for the big trees to make our luck we shant have much he rejoined picking up a pebble and firing it into the beck below they were on a narrow path now about halfway down the bank and here in a hollow the chalybeate spring bubbled out and was gathered by a wooden spout into a slender stream which fell on the ground where in the course of time it had made a basin for itself that was always partly full the water was icy cold and somewhat the colour of light on steel beth held the glass to the spout rinsed it first then filled it and offered it to dan but he dryly declined to take it not for me thank you he said i never touch any medicinal beastliness for the third time beth was jarred she threw the water on the ground refilled the glass and drank dan saw he had made a mistake ill change my mind and have some too he said anxious to mollify her beth filled the glass again and handed it to him in silence but no afterthought could atone for the discourtesy of his first refusal and she looked in another direction not even troubling herself to see whether he tried the water or not there was a rustic seat in the hollow of the bank and he suggested that they should sit there a while before they returned beth acquiesced and soon the sputter of the little spring bubbling into its basin the chitter of birds in the branches above the sunbeams filtering from behind through the leaves the glint of the beck below slipping between its banks soundless to the sea enthralled her isnt this lovely she ejaculated yes its very jollywith you he said you wouldnt like it so well without me beth asked no i should think not he rejoined and you wouldnt like it as well without me i hope no beth responded it makes it nicer having some one to share it now thats not quite kind he answered in an injured tone some one is any one and i shouldnt be satisfied with anybody but you well but i am satisfied with you beth answered dispassionately he took her hand laid it in his own palm and looked at it it was a childs hand as yet delicately pink and white what a pretty thing he said oh you smile at that he reached up to put a lock of her brown hair back from her cheek and then he put his arm round her next day he was obliged to go awaybeth never thought of inquiring why or wherefore but she heard her mother and lady benyon talking about the very eligible appointment he was hoping to get he took an affectionate leave of her when he had gone she went off to the sands and was surprised to find how glad she was to be alone again the tide was far out and there were miles and miles of the hard buff sand a great open space not empty to beth but teeming with thought and full of feeling some distance on in front of her there was a solitary figure a man walking with bent head and hands folded behind him holding a stickcount gustav bartahlinskys favourite attitude when deep in meditation beth hurried on and soon overtook him would you rather be alone count gustav she said he turned to look at her then smiled and they walked on together so they are going to marry you off he said abruptly yes beth answered laconically do you wish to be married no i do not then why do you consent because im weak i cant help it she said nonsense i cant she repeated im firm enough about some things but in this i vacillate when i am alone i know i am making a mistake but when i am with other people who think differently my objection vanishes what is your objection he asked that is the difficulty she said i cant define it do you know dr dan i cant say i know him he answered i have met him and talked to him he expresses the most unexceptional opinions but it is premature to respect a man for the opinions he expresseswait and see what he does words and acts dont necessarily agree sometimes however a chance remark which has very little significance for the person who makes it is like an aperture that lets in light on the whole character he cogitated a little then added dont let them hurry you take time to know your man and if you are not satisfied yourself if there is anything that jars upon you never mind what other people think have nothing to do with him when beth went home she found her mother sitting by the drawingroom window placidly knitting and looking out i am afraid i am very late beth said i have been on the sands with count gustav ah that was nice i should think mrs caldwell observed graciously and what were you talking about being married principally beth answered mrs caldwell beamed above her knitting and what did he say he strongly advised me not to marry if i didnt want to mrs caldwell changed countenance did he indeed she observed with a sniff then she reflected and what had you been saying to draw such a remark from him i said i didnt want to be married beth blurted out with an effort how could you tell count gustav such a story beth mrs caldwell asked shaking her head reproachfully it was no story mamma nonsense beth her mother rejoined it is nothing but perverseness that makes you say such things you feel more interesting i believe when you are in opposition if i had refused to allow you to be married you would have been ready to run away i know girls they all want to be married and they all pretend they dont why when i was a girl i thought of nothing else but i didnt talk about it perhaps you had nothing else to think about beth ventured and what have you to think about pray beth clasped her hands and her grey eyes dilated beth dont look like that her mother remonstrated you are always acting and it is such a pityas you will find when you go out into the world i am afraid and people avoid you i didnt know i was doing anything peculiar beth said and how am i to help it if i dont know just help it by only doing as you are told until you are able to judge for yourself look at the silly way you have been talking this afternoon what must count gustav have thought of you never be so silly again you must be married now you know when a girl lets a man kiss her she has to marry him beth had been watching her mothers fingers as she knitted until she was half mesmerised by the bright glint of the needles but now she woke up and burst out laughing if that be the case she said he is not the only one that i shall have to marry mrs caldwells hands dropped on her lap and she looked up at beth in dismay what do you mean she said just that beth answered do you mean to tell me you have allowed men to kiss you mrs caldwell cried beth looked up as if trying to keep her countenance you wicked girl how dare you well mamma if it were wicked why didnt you warn me beth said how was i to know your womanly instincts ought to have taught you better unfortunately for this theory all beths womanly instincts set in the opposite direction her fathers ardent temperament warred in her with aunt victorias puritan principles and there was no telling as yet which would prevail beth made no reply to that last assertion of her mothers but remained half sitting on the table with her feet stretched out in front of her and her hands supporting her on either side which brought her shoulders up to her ears it was a most inelegant attitude and peculiarly exasperating to mrs caldwell oh you wickedyou badyou abandoned girl she exclaimed losing her temper altogether my heart is broken with you go to your room and stay there i feel as if i could never endure the sight of you again beth gathered herself together slowly and strolled away with an air of indifference but as soon as she found herself alone in her own room with the door shut she dropped on her knees and lifted her clasped hands to heaven in an agony of remorse for having tormented her mother and in despair about that wretched engagement o lord what am i to do she said what am i to do if she could make up her mind once for all either way she would be satisfied it was this miserable state of indecision that was unendurable presently in the room below she thought she heard her mother sob aloud she listened breathless her mother was sobbing beth jumped up and opened her door what should she do her unhappy motherheartbroken indeed what a life hers wasa life of hard privation of suffering most patiently borne of the utmost selfdenial for her childrens sake of loss of loneliness of bitter disappointment first her husband taken then her dearest child her ungrateful boys not overkind to her and now this last blow dealt her by beth just when the prospect of getting her well married was bringing a gleam of happiness into her mothers life the piteous sobs continued beth stole downstairs bent on atoning in her own person by any sacrifice for all the sorrows no matter by whom occasioned which she felt were culminating in this final outburst of grief she found her mother standing beside the high oldfashioned mantelpiece leaning her poor head against it mamma beth cried do forgive me i never meant toi never meant to hurt you so i will do anything to please you i was only teasing you about kissing men i havent been in the habit of kissing any one and of course ill marry dan as soon as you like and well all be happythere mrs caldwell held out her arms and beth sprang into them and hugged her tight and burst into tears chapter xxxvii that autumn beth was married to daniel maclure md c c at the time of her marriage she hardly knew what his full name was she had always heard him called the doctor or dr dan and had never thought of him as anything else nor did she know anything else about himhis past his family or his prospects which considering her age is not surprising but what did surprise her in after years when she discovered it was to find that her friends who made the match knew no more about him than she did he had scraped acquaintance with her brother jim in a public billiardroom in rainharbour and been introduced by him to the other members of her family who because his address was good and his appearance attractive had taken it for granted that everything else concerning him was equally satisfactory beth decided to keep her surname for her fathers sake and also because she could not see why she should lose her identity because she had married everybody said it was absurd of her but she was determined and from the time of her marriage she signed herself elizabeth caldwell maclure dan confided to mrs caldwell that he was troubled by some few small debts which he was most anxious to pay in order that he might start his married life clear and the poor lady generously reduced her slender income by selling some shares to raise the money for him when he accepted it his eyes filled with tears as was usual with him in moments of emotion o mamma beth exclaimed when she heard of the sacrifice how could you i do not deserve such generosity for i have never been any comfort to you and i shall always be miserable about it thinking how badly you want the money there will be one mouth less to feed when you have gone you know beth mrs caldwell answered bravely and i shall be the happier for thinking that you start clear debt crushed us our whole married life i shall be the easier if i know you havent that burden to bear besides dan will repay me as soon as he can he is a thoroughly good fellow you shall be repaid mamma in more ways than one if i live beth vowed uncle james patten doled out a fivepoundnote to beth by way of a wedding present from the long rentroll her mother should have inherited this is to help with your trousseau but do not be extravagant he said in his pleasant way as the wife of a professional man you will descend from my class to the class below the middle class and you should dress according to your station but you are doing as well as we could expect you to do considering your character and conduct some doubted if you would ever receive an offer of marriage or have the sense to accept it if one were made you but i always said you would have the doctor if he would have you beths impulse was to throw the note at him but she restrained herself on her brother jims account it was suspected that uncle james was only waiting for a plausible excuse to disinherit jim and he found it the next time jim stayed at fairholm they were in the drawingroom together one day and a maid was mending the fire uncle james was sitting at a writingtable with a mirror in front of him and he declared that in that mirror he distinctly saw his nephew chuck the maidservant under the chin which was conduct such as mr james patten could not be expected to tolerate in his heir so he altered his will and after that all communication ceased between the two families except such as aunt grace mary managed to keep up surreptitiously aunt grace mary was very generous to beth and so also was old lady benyon had it not been for these two beth would have left home illprovided for thanks to them however she was spared that humiliation and went with an ample outfit in the days preceding her marriage beth sometimes thought of charlotte and of the long fiction of that wonderful time when they were friends her busy brain had created many another story since then but none that had the fascination of that first sustained effort hectors mysterious establishment on the other side of the headland the troubles in spain the wicked machinations of their enemies the secret service of humanity the horses yacht and useful doctorwho had not held a high place in their estimation being merely looked upon as a trustworthy tool of hectors yet it was he whom beth was to marry she wondered what charlotte would think of her when she heard it and of hector and the whole story but she never knew for charlotte was at school in france during this period and never came into beths life again during the early days of her married life a sort of content settled upon beth a happy sense of wellbeing of rest and satisfaction came to her and that strange vague yearning ache the presence of which made all things incomplete was laid the atmosphere in which she now lived was sensuous not spiritual and although she was unaware of this she felt its influence dan made much of her and she liked that but the vision and the dream had ceased her intellectual activity was stimulated however and it was not long before she began to think for herself more clearly and connectedly than she had ever done before they spent the first few weeks in london in a whirl of excitement living at sumptuous restaurants and going to places of amusement every night where beth would sit entranced with music singing dancing and acting never taking her eyes from the stage and yearning in her enthusiasm to do the same things herselfnot doubting but that she could either so perfectly had she the power to identify herself with the performers and realise as from within what their sensations must be when she had been in london as a girl at school she had seen nothing but the bright side of life the wholesome happy young side a poor beggar to be helped or a glimpse in the street of a sorrowful face that saddened her for a moment was the worst she knew of the great wicked city but now with dan for a companion the realities of vice and crime were brought home to her she learnt to read signs of depravity in the faces of men and women and to associate certain places with evildoers as their especial haunts her husbands interest in the subject was inexhaustible he seemed to think of little else he would point out people in places of public amusement and describe in detail the loathsome lives they led every welldressed woman he saw he suspected he would pick out one because she had yellow hair and another because her two little children were precocious and pretty and declare them to be kept women that a handsome woman could be anything but vicious had apparently never occurred to him he was very highminded on the subject of sin if the sinner were a woman and thought no degradation sufficient for her in speaking of such women he used epithets from which beth recoiled she allowed them to pass however in consideration of the moral exasperation that inspired them and the personal rectitude his attitude implied the subject had a horrible kind of fascination for her she hated it yet she could not help listening although her heart ached and her soul sickened she listened in silence however neither questioning nor discussing but simply attending collecting material for which she had no use at the moment and storing it without designmaterial which she would find herself forced to turn to account eventually but in what way and to what purpose there was no knowing as yet they were to live at slane an inland town near morningquest where modern manufactures had competed successfully with ancient agricultural interests and altered the attitude of the landed gentry towards trade and towards the townspeople beguiling them to be less exclusive because there was money in the town selfinterest weighing with them all at once in regard to the neighbours whom christian precept had vainly urged them to recognise dr maclure had taken an oldfashioned house in a somewhat solitary position on the outskirts of slane but near enough to the town to secure paying patients as he hoped while far enough out of it to invite county callers it stood just on the highroad from which it was only divided by a few evergreen shrubs and an iron railing but it was picturesque nevertheless with creepersmagnolia wisteria and ivyclustering on the dark red bricks at the back there was a good garden and in front across the road were green meadows with hedgerowsa tangle of holly hawthorn and brambleand old trees surviving giants of a forest long uprooted and forgotten it was a rich and placid scene infinitely soothing to one fresh from the turmoil of the city and weary of the tireless motion the incessant sound and tumult of the sea when beth looked out upon the meadows first she sighed and said to herself surely surely one should be happy here the house was inconveniently arranged inside and had less accommodation than its outside pretensions promised but beth was delighted with it all and took possession of her keys with pride she was determined to be a good manager and make her housekeeping money go a long way her dream was to save out of it and have something over to surprise dan with when the bills were paid to her chagrin however she found that she was not to have any housekeeping money at all you are too young to have the care of managing money said dan just give the orders and ill see about paying the bills but the system did not answer beth had no idea what she ought to be spending and either the bills were too high or the diet was too low and dan grumbled perpetually if the housekeeping were at all frugal he was anything but cheery during meals but if she ordered him all he wanted there were sure to be scenes on the day of reckoning he blamed her bad management and she said nothing but she knew she could have managed on any reasonable sum to which he might have limited her she had too much selfrespect to ask for money however if he did not choose to give it to her it surprised her to find that what he had to eat was a matter of great importance to him he fairly gloated over things he liked and in order to indulge him and keep the bills down besides she went without herself and he never noticed her selfdenial he was apt to take too much of his favourite dishes and was constantly regretting it i wish i had not eaten so much of that cursed vol au vent it never agrees with me he would say but he would eat as much as ever next time beth could not help observing such traits she did not set them down to his personal discredit however but to the discredit of his sex at large she had always heard that men were selfindulgent and dan was a man that was the nearest she came to blaming him at first being her husband had made a difference in her feeling for him before their marriage she was not so tolerant her housekeeping duties by no means filled her day an hour or so in the morning was all they occupied at most and the time must have hung heavy on her hands had she had no other pursuit to beguile her fortunately she had no intention of allowing her plans for the improvement of her mind to lapse simply because she had married on the contrary she felt the defects of her education more keenly than ever and expected dan to sympathise with her in her efforts to remedy them he came in one day soon after they were settled and found her sitting at the end of the diningroom table with her back to the window and a number of books spread out about her this looks learned he said what are you doing i am looking for something to study she answered what writers have helped you most helped me mosthow do you mean well helped you to be upright you know to make good resolutions and keep straight thank you he said i have not felt the need of good resolutions and this is the first hint i have had that i require any if you will inquire among my friends i fancy you will find that i have the credit of going pretty straight as it is o dan beth exclaimed you quite misunderstand me i never meant to insinuate that you are not straight i was only thinking of the way in which we all fall short of our ideals ideals be hanged said dan if a man does his duty thats ideal enough isnt it i should think so beth said pacifically dan went to the mantelpiece and stood there studying himself with interest in the glass a lady told me the other day i looked like a military man he said smoothing his glossy black hair and twisting the ends of his long moustache well i think you look much more military than medical beth replied considering him im glad of that he said smiling at himself complacently are you beth exclaimed in surprise why a medical man has a finer career than a military man and should have a finer presence if ability purpose and character count for anything towards appearance personally i think i should wish to look like what i am if i could choose so you do he rejoined adjusting his hat with precision as he spoke and craning his neck to see himself sideways in the glass you look like a silly little idiot but never mind thats all a girl need be if shes pretty and if she isnt pretty shes of no account so it doesnt matter what she is when he had gone beth sat for a long time thinking but she did no more reading that day nor did she ever again consult dan about the choice of books or expect him to sympathise with her in her work for the first few months of her married life she had no pocketmoney at all aunt grace mary slipped two sovereigns into her hand when they parted but these beth kept she hardly knew why as she had her halfyears dividend to look forward to about the time that her money was due dan began to talk incessantly of money difficulties bills were pressing and he did not know where on earth to look for a fivepoundnote he did not think beth too young to be worried morning noon and night on the subject although she took it very seriously one morning after he had made her look anxious he suddenly remembered a letter he had for her and handed it to her it was from her lawyer and contained a cheque for twentyfive pounds the longlookedforwardto pocket money will this be of any use to you beth asked handing him the cheque his countenance cleared of use to me i should think it would he exclaimed it will just make all the difference you must sign it though when she had signed it he put it in his pocketbook and his spirits went up to the cheery point he adjusted his hat at the glass over the diningroom mantelpiece lit a shilling cigar and went off to his hospital jauntily beth was glad to have relieved him of his anxiety she half hoped he might give her something out of the cheque if it were only a pound or two she wanted some little things so badly but he never offered her a penny she thought of aunt grace marys two sovereigns but the dread of having nothing in case of an emergency kept her from spending them there was one thing dan did which beth resented he opened her letters husband and wife are one he said they should have no secrets from each other i should like you to open my letters too but they contain professional secrets you see and that wouldnt do he spoke in what he called his cheery way but beth had begun to feel that there was another word which would express his manner better and now it occurred to her you have no right to open my letters she said and being facetious on the subject does not give you any but if i chose to he asked it will be a breach of good taste and good feeling she answered no more was said on the subject and dan did not open her letters for a little but then he began again he had always some excuse howevereither he hadnt looked at the address or he had been impatient to see if there were any message for himself and so on but beth was not mollified although she said nothing and her annoyance made her secretive she would watch for the postman and take the letters from him herself and conceal her own so that dan might not even know that she had received any she had a difficulty with him about another matter too his loverlike caresses while they were engaged had not been distasteful to her but after their marriage he kept up an incessant billing and cooing and of a coarser kind which soon satiated her she was a nicely balanced creature with many interests in life and love could be but one among the number in any case but dan almost seemed to expect it to be the only one oh dear must i be embraced again she exclaimed one day with quite comical dismay on being interrupted in the middle of a book that was interesting her at the moment dan looked disconcerted in his cheerful masculine egotism it had not occurred to him that beth might find incessant demonstrations of affection monotonous he would smile at pictures of the waning of the honeymoon where the husband returns to his book and his dog and the wife sits apart sad and neglected it was inevitable that the man should tire he had other things to think of but that the wife should be the first to be bored was incredible and worse it was unwomanly dan went to the mantelpiece and stood looking down into the fire and his greygreen eyes became suffused have i hurt you dan beth exclaimed jumping up and going to him hurt me he said taking out his pockethandkerchief that is not the word for it you have made me very unhappy oh said beth her own inclinations disregarded at once i am sorry but he had satiated her once for all and she never recovered any zest for his caresses she found no charm or freshness in them especially after she perceived that they were for his own gratification irrespective of hers the privileges of love are not to be wrested from us with impunity habits of dutiful submission destroy the power to respond and all that they leave to survive of the warm reality of love at last is a cold pretence by degrees as beth felt forced to be dutiful she ceased to be affectionate although dan dressed to go out with scrupulous care he took no trouble to make himself nice in the house care in dress was not in him a necessary part and expression of a refined nature but an attempt to win consideration he never dressed for dinner when they were alone together it was a trouble rather than a refreshment to him to get rid of the dust of the day and the associations of his walkingdress this was a twofold disappointment to beth she had expected him to have the common politeness to dress for her benefit and she was not pleased to find that the punctiliousness he displayed in the matter on occasion was merely veneer it was a defect of breeding that struck her unpleasantly they had been poor enough at home but beth had been accustomed all her life to have delicate china about her and pictures and books to walk on soft carpets and sit in easychairs possessions of a superior class which in her case were symbols bespeaking refinement of taste and habits from which her soul had derived satisfaction even while her poor little fragile body starved she dressed regularly and daintily herself and dan at the bottom of the table in his morning coat was an offence to her she said nothing at first however so his manners still further deteriorated until one night after she had gone to her room he walked in with his hat on smoking a cigar it was this last discourtesy that roused her to rebel this is my bedroom she said significantly i know he answered you knowyet you keep your hat on and you are smoking she proceeded why he rejoined and if i do what then i know ladies who let their husbands smoke in bed probably she said i have heard of more singularly coarse things than that even but i am accustomed to pure air in my room and i must have it and suppose i should choose to stay here and smoke he said of course i could not prevent you she answered but i should go and sleep in another room hm he grunted youre mighty particular but he went away all the same and did not appear there again either with his hat on or smoking a cigar beth suffered miserably from the want of proper privacy in her life she had none whatever now it had been her habit to read and reflect when she went to bed to prepare for a tranquil night by setting aside the troubles of the day and purifying her mind systematically even as she washed her body but all that was impossible if her husband were at home he would break in upon her reading with idle gossip fidget about the room when she wished to meditate and leave her no decent time of privacy for anything he had his own dressingroom where he was secure from interruption but never had the delicacy to comprehend that his presence could be any inconvenience to beth and it was worse than an inconvenience it was a positive hardshipnever to be sure of a moment alone one afternoon when she had locked herself in her bedroom he came and turned the handle of the door noisily open the door he said do you want anything she asked open the door he repeated she obeyed and he came in and glanced round suspiciously what were you doing he asked oh she exclaimed this is intolerable what is intolerable he demanded this intrusion she replied i want to be alone for a little cant you understand that no i cannot understand a wife locking her husband out of her room and whats more youve no business to do it ive a legal right to come here whenever i choose then beth began to realise what the law of man was with regard to her person i never intrude upon you when you shut yourself up she remonstrated oh that is different he answered arrogantly i may have brainwork to do or something important to think about there is no comparison beth went to her dressingtable sat down in front of it folded her hands and waited doggedly he looked at her for a little then he said i dont understand your treatment of me at all beth but theres no understanding women he spoke as if it were the womens fault and to their discredit that he couldnt understand them beth made no answer and he finally took himself off slamming the door after him thank goodness beth exclaimed one would think he had bought me then she sat wondering what she should do she must have some corner where she would be safe from intrusion he had his consultingroom a room called his laboratory a surgery and a dressingroom where no one would dream of following him if he shut the door she had literally not a corner she left her bedroom and walked through the other rooms on the same floor as she considered the matter then she went up to the next floor where the servants slept above that again there was an attic used as a boxroom and she went up there too it was a barn of a place supported by pillars and extending apparently over the whole of the storey below the roof sloped to the floor on either side and the whole place was but illlighted by two small windows looking to the north dr maclure had taken over the house as it stood furniture and all from the last occupants by whom this great attic had evidently been used as a lumberroom there were various pieces of furniture in ittables chairs and drawers some broken some in fair condition at the farther end opposite to the door there was a pile of packingcases and travellingtrunks beth had always thought that they stood up against the wall but on going over to them now she discovered that there was a space behind the pile was too high for her to see over it but by going down on her hands and knees where the sloping roof was too low for her to stoop she found she could creep round it it was the kind of thing a child would have done but what was beth but a child on the other side of the pile it was almost dark she could see something however when she stood up which looked like a mark on the whitewash and on running her hand over it she discovered it to be a narrow door flush with the wall there was no handle or latch to it but there was a key which had rusted in the keyhole and was not to be turned the door was not locked however and beth pushed it open and found herself in a charming little room with a fireplace at one end of it and opposite at the other end a large bow window beth was puzzled to understand how there came to be a room there at all then she recollected a sort of tower there was at the side of the house which formed a deep embrasure in the drawingroom a dressingroom to the visitors room and a bathroom on the floor above the window looked out on the garden at the back of the house a light iron balcony ran round it the rail of which was so thickly covered with ivy that very little of the window was visible from below beth had noticed it however only she thought it was a dummy and so also did dan the little room looked bright and cosy with the afternoon sun streaming in it seemed to have been occupied at one time by some person of fastidious taste judging by what furniture remaineda square chippendale table with slender legs two highbacked chairs covered with oldfashioned tapestry and a huge mahogany bookcase of the same period with glass doors above and cupboards below the high white mantelpiece adorned with vases and festoons of flowers was of adams design and so also was the dado and the cornice the walls were painted a pale warm pink a high brass fender pierced surrounded the fireplace and there were a poker tongs and shovel to match and a small brass scuttle still full of coals there were ashes in the grate too as if the room had only lately been occupied the boards were bare but white and wellfitting and in one corner of the room there was a piece of carpet rolled up beth dropped on to one of the dusty chairs and looked round everything about her was curiously familiar and her first impression was that she had been there before on the other hand she could hardly believe in the reality of what she saw she thought she must be dreaming for here was exactly what she had been pining for most in the whole wide world of late a secret spot sacred to herself where she would be safe from intrusion she went downstairs for some oil for the lock and patiently worked at it until at last she succeeded in turning the key then as it was too late to do anything more that day she locked the door and carried the key off in her pocket triumphantly half the night she lay awake thinking of her secret chamber and as soon as dan had gone out next morning and she had done her housekeeping she stole upstairs with duster and brush and began to set it in order all her treasures were contained in some old trunks of aunt victorias which were in the attic but had not been unpacked because she had no place to put the things dan had seen some of these treasures at rainharbour and considered them old rubbish and not thinking it likely that there would be anything else in the boxes he had taken no further interest in them he would have liked to have left them behind altogether and even tried to laugh beth out of what he called her sentimental attachment to odds and ends but as most of the things had belonged to aunt victoria she took his ridicule so ill that he wisely let the subject drop he had been somewhat hasty in his estimation of the value of the contents of the boxes however for there were some handsome curios a few miniatures and pictures of great artistic merit some rare editions of books besides laces jewels brocades and other stuffs in them when beth had swept and dusted she put down the carpet then she began to unpack among the first things she found were the old french books a quarto bible with the apocrypha in it shakespeare in several volumes and her schoolbooks and notebooks some ornaments some beautiful old curtains and a large deep rug like a turkey carpet in crimson and green and purple and gold worked by aunt victoria this she spread before the fireplace the doorway she covered with a curtain and two more she hung on either side of the window so that they could not be seen from below her books of reference desk notebooks and writing materials she put on the table arranged the ornaments on the mantelpiece and hung the miniatures and pictures on the walls then she sat down and looked about her well pleased with the whole effect now she exclaimed i am at home thank god i shall be able to study to read and write think and pray at last undisturbed chapter xxxviii as dan sympathised with none of beths tastes or interests and seemed to have none of his own with which she could sympathise their stock of conversation was soon exhausted and there was nothing like companionship in their intercourse if beth had had no resources in herself she would have had but a sorry time of it in those days especially as she received no kindness from any one in slane some of the other medical mens wives called when she first arrived and she returned their calls punctually but their courtesy went no farther mrs carne the wife of the leading medical practitioner asked her to lunch and mrs jeffreys a surgeons wife asked her to afternoon tea but as these invitations did not include her husband she refused them she invited these ladies and their husbands in return however but they both pleaded previous engagements after the maclures had been some little time at slane lady benyon bethought her of an old friend of hers one lady beg who lived in the neighbourhood and asked her to call upon beth which she did forthwith for she was one of those delightful old ladies who like nothing better than to be doing a kindness she came immediately bringing an invitation to lunch on the following sunday already written in case she should find no one at home dan was delighted we shall meet nothing but county people there he said and thats the proper set for us they always do the right thing you see theyre the only people worth knowing but beg is miles away from here beth said how shall we go well go in the dogcart of course dan answered he had set up a dogcart on their arrival but this was the first time he had proposed to take beth out in it as they drove along on sunday morning in the bright sunshine dans spirits overflowed in a characteristic way at the prospect of meeting somebody decent as he expressed it and he made remarks about the faces and figures of all the women they passed on the road criticising them as if they were cattle to be sold at so much a point that little girl there he said of one whom he beamed upon and ogled as they passed reminds me of a fairhaired little devil i picked up one night in paris gad she was a bad un up to more tricks than any other i ever knew she used to here followed a description of some of her peculiar practices i wish you would not tell me these things beth remonstrated but he only laughed you know youre amused he said its just your conventional affectation that makes you pretend to object thats the way women drive their husbands elsewhere for amusement they wont take a proper intelligent interest in life so theres nothing to talk to them about i agree with the advanced party theyre always preaching that women should know the world women who do know the world have no nonsense about them and are a jolly sight better company than your starched puritans who pretend to know nothing its the most interesting side of life after all and the most instructive and i wonder at your want of intelligence beth you shouldnt be afraid to know the natural history of humanity nor am i beth answered quietly nor the naturalor unnaturaldepravity either which is what you really mean i believe but knowing it and delighting in it as a subject of conversation are two very different things jesting about that side of life affects me like mud on a clean coat i resent being splashed with it and try to get rid of it but unfortunately it sticks and stains oh youre quite right dan answered unctuously its just shocking the stories that are told and for the rest of the way he discoursed about morals illustrating his meaning as he proceeded with anecdotes of the choicest description when they arrived at beg house they found the company more mixed than dan had anticipated dr and mrs carne were there mr and mrs jeffreys and mr mrs and miss petterick mr petterick was a solicitor of bumptious manners and doubtful reputation whom the whole county hated but tolerated because of his wealth and shrewdness either of which they liked to be in a position to draw upon if necessary but besides these townspeople there were sir george and lady galbraith mr and mrs kilroy of ilverthorpe and mrs orton beg a widowed daughterinlaw of lady begs dr maclure immediately made up to sir george galbraith who was also a medical man and of great repute in his own line he was a county magnate besides and a man of wealth and importance by reason of a baronetcy somewhat unexpectedly inherited and a beautiful countryseat he continued to practise however for love of his profession but used it as a means of doing good rather than as a source of income in appearance he was a tall rather awkward man with a fine head and a strong plain face he spoke in that deliberate scotch way which has a ring of sincerity in it and inspires confidence and the contrast between his manner and dans struck beth unpleasantly she wished dan would be less effusive it was almost as if he were cringing and she thought he should have waited for sir george galbraith who was the older man to have made the first advance beth herself was at her ease as soon as she came among these people it was the social atmosphere to which she had been accustomed mrs carne mrs jeffreys and mrs petterick were on their best behaviour but beth had only to be natural the county people were all nice to her and the other town ladies who had hitherto slighted her looked on and wondered to see her so well received at luncheon as there were not gentlemen enough to go round she sat between sir george galbraith and mrs orton beg mrs kilroy sat opposite sir george had known mrs kilroy all her life it was he in fact who nicknamed her and her brother the heavenly twins in the days when as children they used to be the delight of their grandfather the old duke of morningquest and the terror of their parents mr and lady adeline hamiltonwells as soon as they were seated mrs kilroy attacked sir george on some subject which they had previously discussed and there ensued a little playful war of words oh youre just a phrasemaker mrs kilroy exclaimed at last finding herself worsted and phrases prove nothing what is a phrasemaker he asked with a twinkle why a phrasemaker is a person who recklessly launches a saying winged by wit and of superior brevity and distinctness but not necessarily truea saying which flies direct to the mind and being of a cutting nature carves an indelible impression there said mrs kilroyan impression which numbs the intellect and prevents us reasoning for ourselves opinion is formed for the most part of phrases not of knowledge and observation the things people say smartly are quoted not because they are true but because they are smart a lie well put will carry conviction to the average mind more surely than a good reason if illexpressed because most people have an aesthetic sense that is satisfied by a happy play upon words but few have reason enough to discriminate when the brilliant ingenuity of the phrasemaker is pitted against a plain statement of the bald truth as for instance asked sir george mans love is of his life a thing apart tis womans whole existence mrs kilroy responded glibly that is quoted everywhere and i have never heard it questioned yet it is a flagrant case of confounding smartness with accuracy love of the kind that byron meant is quite as much a thing apart from womans life as from mans more men in fact make the pursuit of it their whole existence than women do you are right said sir george thoughtfully love is certainly not a modern womans whole existence and she never dies of it she feels it strongly but it does not swamp her in a bad attack she may go to bed young one night and rise next day with grey hairs in her head and write a book about it but then she recovers and i think you are right about phrases too syllables govern the world john selden said but phrases would have been the better word phrases are the keynotes to life they set the tune to which men insensibly shape their course and so rule us for good and ill this is a time of talk and formidable is the force of phrases catchwords are creative they do not prove that a thing isthey cause it to be then an unscrupulous phrasemaker may be a danger to the community beth observed yes said sir george but on the other hand one who is scrupulous would be a philanthropist of extraordinary power now isnt that like his craft and subtlety evadne said mrs kilroy to lady galbraith he has been gradually working up to that in order to make mrs maclure suppose i intended to pay him a compliment when i called him a phrasemaker you are taking a mean advantage of an honest attempt on my part to arrive at the truth said sir george i believe you blundered into that without seeing in the least where you were going beth observed naively everybody smiled except dan who told her on the way home she had made a great mistake to say such a thing and she must be careful in future or she would give offence and make enemies for him no fear with people like that said beth they all understood me which is as much as to say that your husband does not said dan assuming his hurt expression very well go your own way but youll be sorry for it what a delightful person mrs orton beg is beth observed to make a diversion and so nicelooking too you are easily pleased why shes forty if shes a day dan ejaculated speaking as if that were to her discredit and must deprive her of any consideration from him the next excitement was a military ball dan determined to go and beth was ready enough she had never been to a ball but how about a dress she said there has been such a sudden change in the fashion since mine were made im afraid i have nothing that will do then get a new one dan said what and add to the bills beth objected oh bother the bills he answered in the tone he called cheery ive had them coming in all my life and im still here get a thing when you want it and pay for it when you canthats my motto why my tailors bill alone is up in the hundreds but that was the bill mamma gave you the money to settle beth exclaimed i know he answered casually i got the money out of her for that but i had to spend it on your amusement in town my dear oh beth ejaculatedhow could you how could i he answered coolly well i couldnt of course if i hadnt been clever but i can always get anything i like out of old ladies they dote on me youve only got to amuse them you know and pour in a little sentiment on occasion let them understand youve been rather a naughty man but you know whats rightthat always fetches them your mother would have sold out all she had to help me when she found i meant to repent and settle but of course i wouldnt take anything that was not absolutely necessary he added magnanimously beth compressed her lips and frowned do you mean to say you obtained money from a poor woman like my mother for a special purpose which she approved and spent that money on something else she asked dan changed countenance i got the money from your mother to pay my tailors bill but the circumstance of your spending more money in town than i could afford compelled me to use it for another purpose he answered in rather a blustering tone i spent no money in town beth said i had to spend it on you then he rejoined and a nice lament you would have made if i hadnt but its all the same husband and wife are one and i maintain that the money was given to me to pay a just debt and i paid a just debt with it now what have you to say against that to the disparagement of your husband he looked beth straight in the face as he spoke as if the nature of the transaction would be changed by staring her out of countenance and she returned his gaze unflinchingly but not another word would she say on the subject there is a sad majority of wives whose attitude towards their husbands must be one of contemptuous tolerationtoleration of their past depravity and of their present deceits whatever form they may take such a wife looks upon her husband as a hopeless incurable because she knows that he has not the sense even if he had the strength of character to mend his moral defects beth fully realised her husbands turpitude with regard to the money and also realised the futility of trying to make him see his own conduct in the matter in any light not flattering to himself and she was deeply pained she had taken it for granted that dan would pay interest on the money but had not troubled herself to find out if he were doing so as she now thought that she ought to have done for clearly she should have paid it herself if he did not true she never had any money but that was no excuse for there were honest ways of making money and make it she would she was on her way upstairs to her secret chamber to think the matter out undisturbed when she came to this determination and as soon as she had shut herself in she sank upon her knees and vowed to god solemnly to pay back every farthing and the interest in full if she had to work her fingers to the bone curiously enough it was with her fingers she first thought of working not with her brain she had seen an advertisement in a daily paper of several depots for the sale of ladies work in london and other places and she determined at once to try that method of making money work of all kinds came easily to her and happily she still had her two sovereigns which would be enough to lay in a stock of materials to begin with her pinmoney dan regularly appropriated as soon as it arrived with the facetious remark that it would just pay for her keep and so far beth had let him have it without a murmur yielding in that as in all else however much against her own inclinations for gentleness and also with a vague notion of making up to him in some sort for his own shortcomings which she could not help fancying must be as great a trouble to him as they were to her she had grown to have a very real affection for dan as indeed she would have had for any one who was passably kind to her but her estimate of his character as she gradually became acquainted with it was never influenced by her affection except in so far as she pitied him for traits which would have made her despise another man since her marriage she had given up her free wild wandering habits she would go into the town to order things at the shops in the morning and take a solitary walk out into the country in the afternoon perhaps but without any keen enjoyment her natural zest for the woods and fields was suspended she had lost touch with nature instead of looking about her observantly as had been her wont she walked now as a rule with her eyes fixed on the ground thinking deeply she was losing vitality too her gait was less buoyant and she was becoming subject to aches and pains she had never felt before dan said they were neuralgic and showed that she wanted a tonic but troubled himself no more about them he always seemed to think she should be satisfied when he found a name for her complaint she had also become much thinner which made her figure childishly young but in the face she looked old for her agefiveandtwenty at leastalthough she was not yet eighteen there was one particularly strong and happy point in beths character she wasted little or no time in repining for the thing that was done all her thought was how to remedy the evil and make amends so now when she had recovered from the first shock of her husbands revelation she put the thought of it aside pulled herself together quickly and found relief in setting to work with a will the exertion alone was inspiriting and rearoused the faculty which had been dormant in her of late she went at once to get materials for her work and stepped out more briskly than she had done for many a day she perceived that the morning air was fresh and sweet and she inhaled deep draughts of it and rejoiced in the sunshine just opposite their house across the road on the other side of a wooden paling the parklike meadow was intensely green old horsechestnuts dotted about it made refreshing intervals of shade in the hedgerows the tall elms stood out clear against the sky and the gnarled oaks cast fantastic shadows on the grass while beyond it at the farther side of the meadow by the brook the row of canadian poplars which bordered it kept up a continuous whispering as was their wont even on the stillest days when beth first heard them they spoke a language to her which she comprehended but could not translate but the immediate effect of her life with dan had been to deaden her perception so that she could not comprehend then the whispering became a mere rustle of leaves appealing to nothing but her sense of hearing and her delight in their murmur lapsed when its significance was lost to her spirit but that morning nature spoke to her again and her eyes were opened she saw the greygreen poplars the gnarled oaks the dark crests of the elms upraised against the radiant blue of the sky and felt a thrill like triumph as she watched the great masses of cloud dazzlingly white floating in infinite space majestically the life about her toothe twittering of birds in the hedgerows an alderney cow with its calf in the fields a young colt careering wildly startled by a passing train a big dog that saluted her with friendly nose as he trotted byall these said something to her which made her feel that let what might happen it was good to be alive on her way into town she thought out a piece of work something more original and effective than the things usually sold in fancywork shops which did not often please her when she had bought all the materials that she required there was very little of her two pounds left but she returned in high spirits carrying the rather large parcel herself lest if it were sent it should arrive when dan was at home and excite his curiosity he always appeared if he heard the doorbell ring and insisted on knowing who or what had come an inquisitive trick that irritated beth into baffling him whenever she could she carried her precious packet up to her secret chamber and set to work at once dan when he came in to lunch was surprised to find her unusually cheerful after the temper she had displayed at breakfast he had expected to have anything but a pleasant time of it for a little seeing her in good spirits put him also into a genial mood and he began at once to talk about himselfhis favourite topic well ive had a rattling hard day he observed youd be surprised at the amount ive done in the time i dont believe any other man here could have done it i was at that confounded hospital a couple of hours and after that i had a round people are beginning to send for me now as the last from school they think im up to the latest dodges the old men wont like it i had to go out to the pettericks to see that girl bertha again their family doctor could make nothing of her case but its simple enough the girls hysterical thats what she is and i know what id like to prescribe for her and thats a husband heehee soon cure her hysterics as to the old girl her mother shes gotthen followed a minute description of her ailments told in the baldest language of two words dan always chose the coarsest in talking to beth now that they were married which had made her writhe at first but when she had remonstrated he assumed an injured air after which she silently endured the infliction for fear of wounding him and it was the same with regard to his patients the first time he described the ailment of a lady patient and made gross comments about her beth had exclaimed o dan what would she think of you if she knew you had told me surely it is a breach of confidence well he exclaimed trying to wither her with a look you have a nice opinion of your husband is it possible that i cannot speak to my own wife without bringing such an accusation upon myself well well and im slaving for you morning noon and night to keep you in some sort of decency and comfort and when i come home and do my best to be cheery and amuse you instead of being morose after the strain of the day as most men are all the thanks i get is a speech like that o holy matrimony i did not mean to annoy you dan im sorry beth protested so you should be he said so you should be its mighty hard for me to feel that my own wife hasnt confidence enough in me to be sure that i should never say a word either to her or anybody else about any of my patients to which theyd object people feel differently on the subject perhaps beth ventured i only know that if i had a doctor who talked to his wife about my complaints i shoulddespise him was what she was going to say but she changed the phrasei should not like it but you should know what your own patients feel about it better than i do even as she spoke however her mothers remark of long ago about a talking doctor recurred to her and she felt lowered in her own estimation by the kind of concession she was making to him the tragedy of such a marriage consists in the effect of the mans mind upon the womans shut up with him in the closest intimacy day and night and all the time imbibing his poisoned thoughts beths womanly grace pleaded with her continually not to hurt her husband since he meant no offence not to damp his spirits even when they took a form so distasteful to her to check him was to offend him and provoke a scene for nothing since his taste was not to be improved and she would have to have checked him perpetually and made a mere nag of herself for to talk in this way to her to tell her objectionable stories and harp on depravity of all kinds was his one idea of pleasurable conversation it was seldom therefore that she remonstratedespecially in those early days when she had not as yet perceived that by tacitly acquiescing she was lending herself to inevitable corruption just at that time too she did not trouble herself much about anything she was entirely absorbed in her new object in lifeto get the work done to make the money to pay her mother with interest there was continual exaltation of spirit in the endeavour every moment that she could safely secure she spent in her secret chamber hard at work her outlook was on the sky above for ever changing on the gay garden below whence light airs wafted the fragrance of flowers from time to time to her delight and on a gentle green ascent covered and crowned with trees which shut out the world beyond here there was a colony of rooks where the birds were busy all day long sometimes and from which they were sometimes absent from early morning till sundown when they came back cawing by ones and twos and threes a long straggling procession of them their dark iridescent forms with broad black wings outspread distinct and decorative against the happy blue beth loved the birds and even as she worked she watched them their housekeepings and comings and goings and heard their talk and often as she worked she looked out at the fair prospect and up at the sky hopefully and vowed again to accomplish one act of justice at all events she stopped her regular studies at this time because she conceived them to be for her own mere personal benefit while the task which she had set herself was for a better purpose but although she did not study as had been her wont while she sewed she occupied her mind in a way that was much more beneficial to it than the purposeless acquisition of facts the solving of mathematical problems or conning of parts of speech beside her was always an open book it might be a passage of scripture a scene from shakespeare a poem or paragraph rich in the wisdom and beauty of some great mind and as she sewed she dwelt upon it repeating it to herself until she was wordperfect in it then making it even more her own by earnest contemplation these passages became the texts of many observations and in them was also the light which showed her life as it is and as it should be lived in meditating upon them she taught herself to meditate and in following up the clues they gave her in the endeavour to discriminate and to judge fairly by slow degrees she acquired the precious habit of clear thought this lifted her at once above herself as she had been and what she had lost of insight and spiritual perception since her marriage she began to recover in another and more perfect form wholesome consideration of the realities of life now took the place of fanciful dreams her mind wonderfully fertilised teemed againnot with vain imaginings however as heretofore but with something more substantial purposeful thought was where the mere froth of sensuous seeing had been and it was thought that now clamoured for expression instead of the verses and storiesfireworks of the brain pleasant transient futile distractions with nothing more nourishing in them than the interest and entertainment of the momentwhich had occupied her chiefly from of old it was natural to beth to be open to discuss all that concerned herself with her friends but having no one to talk to now she began on a sudden to record her thoughts and impressions in writing and having once begun she entered upon a new phase of existence altogether she had discovered a recreation which was more absorbing than anything she had ever tried before for her early scribbling had been of another kind not nearly so entrancing then it had been the idle gossip of life and the mere pictorial art of wordpainting an ingenious exercise that had occupied her now it was the more soulstirring themes in the region of philosophy and ethics which she pursued and scenes and phases of life interested her only as the raw material from which a goodly moral might be extracted art for arts sake she despised but in art for mans sake she already discovered noble possibilities but her very delight in her new pursuit made her think it right to limit her indulgence in it duty she conceived to be a painful effort necessarily but writing was a pleasure she therefore attended first conscientiously to her embroidery and any other task she thought it right to perform although her eager impatience to get back to her desk made each in turn a toil to her like many another earnest person she mistook the things of no importance for things that matter because the doing of them cost her much and it was the intellectual exercise the delicate fancy work of her brain a matter of enormous consequence that she neglected not knowing that if a man love the labour of any trade apart from any question of success or fame the gods have called him she made the fitting of herself for the work of her life her last exercise at the tired end of the day she rose early and went to bed late in order to gain a little more time to write but never suspected that her delight in the effort to find expression for what was in her mind of itself proclaimed her one of the elect when she had finished her embroidery she despatched it secretly to the depot in london but then she found that she would have to pay a small subscription before she could have it sold there and she had no money she wrote boldly to the secretary and told her so and asked if the subscription could not be paid out of the price she got for her work the secretary replied that it was contrary to the rules but the committee thought that such an artistically beautiful design as hers was sure to be snapped up directly and they had therefore decided to make an exception in her case while these letters were going backwards and forwards beth suffered agonies of anxiety lest dan should pounce upon them and discover her secret but he happened to be out always at posttime just then so she managed to secure them safely as she had no money she could not buy any more materials for embroidery so she was obliged to take a holiday the greater part of which she spent in writing she was deeply engrossed by thoughts on progress which had been suggested by a passage in one of emersons essays all conservatives are such from natural defects they have been effeminated by position or nature born halt and blind through luxury of their parents and can only like invalids act on the defensive even in her own little life beth had seen so much of the ill effects of conservatism in the class to which she belonged and had suffered so much from it herself already that the subject appealed to her strongly and she pursued it with enthusiasmmore from the social than the political point of view however but unfortunately in all too short a time her holiday came to an end her beautiful embroidery had sold for six guineas and she found herself with the money for more materials and three pounds in hand besides clear profit towards the debt she had also received an order from the depot for another piece of work at the same price which caused her considerable elation and set her to work again with a will and it was only when she could no longer ply her needle that she allowed herself to take up her pen chapter xxxix beth had no more zest for the ball after that conversation with daniel about the money her mother had given him she felt obliged to go to it because he insisted that it was necessary for the wives of professional men to show themselves on public occasions but she would not get a new dress she had never worn her white silk trimmed with myrtle and when she came to look at it again she decided that it was not so much out of the fashion after all and at any rate it must do when she came down to dinner dressed in it on the night of the ball she looked very winsome and smiled up at dan in shy expectation of a word of approval but none came in the early days of their acquaintance he had remarked that she was much more easily depressed than elated about herself and would be the better of a little more confidencenot to say conceit but since their marriage he had never given her the slightest sympathy or encouragement to cure her of her diffidence if anything were amiss in her dress or appearance he told her of it in the offensive manner of an illconditioned underbred man generally speaking when they were out of doors or in some house where she could do nothing to put herself right as if it were some satisfaction to him to make her feel ill at ease and if she were complimented by any one else about anything he had usually something derogatory to say on the subject afterwards now when he had inspected her he sat down to table without a word is there anything wrong beth asked anxiously no he answered that stuff on your sleeves might have been fresher thats all this will be my first ball beth ventured breaking a long silence well dont go and tell everybody he rejoined theyll think you want to make yourself interesting and its nothing to boast about just lay yourself out to be agreeable to people who will further your husbands interests for once but am i not always agreeable beth exclaimed much mortified it doesnt appear so he answered drily at any rate you dont seem to go down here how do you mean beth asked why the ladies in the place all seem to shun you for some reason or other not one of them ever comes near you in a friendly way they were all very nice to me the other day at beg beth protested her heart sinking at this recurrence of the old reproach for to be shunned or in any way set apart seemed even more dreadful to her now than it had done when she was a child see that they keep it up then he answered grimly if it depends upon me they will said beth setting her sensitive mouth in a hard determined line that added ten years to her age and did not improve her beauty and it was with a sad heart and sorely dissatisfied with herself that she drove to her first ball when they entered the ballroom however and dan beamed about him on every one in his thoroughly good fellow way her spirits rose the decorations the handsome uniforms the brilliant dresses and jewels the flowers and foliage plants and above all the bright dancemusic and festive faces delighted her and she gazed about her with lips just parted in a little smile wondering to find it all so gay a young military man was brought up to her and introduced by one of the stewards before she had been five minutes in the room he asked for the pleasure of a dance but alas thanks to the scheme of education at the royal service school for officers daughters having been designed by the authorities to fit the girls for the next world only beth could not dance she had had some lessons at miss blackburnes but not enough to give her confidence so she was obliged to decline another and another wouldbe partner and some quite important people as dan said offered but in vain and he looked furious well he exclaimed this is nice for me i am sorry beth answered nervously she was beginning to have a painful conviction that a man had to depend almost entirely on his wife for his success in life and the responsibility made her quail i shall have to go and do my duty at any rate he proceeded i must leave you alone yes do said beth mrs kilroy and mrs orton beg have just come in i will go and join them she naturally expected dan to escort her and he probably would have done so had he waited to hear what she was saying but his marital manners were such that he had taken himself off while she was speaking and left her to fend for herself she was too glad however to see her charming new acquaintances who had been so kindly to care much and she crossed the room to them smiling confidently as she approached she saw that they recognised her and said something to each other when she came close they both bowed coldly and turned their heads in the opposite direction beth stopped short and her heart stood still the slight was unmistakable but what had she done she looked about her as if for an explanation and saw lady beg close beside her talking to mrs carne ah how do you do nice ball isnt it lady beg observed but without shaking hands how do you do said mrs carne and then they resumed their conversation taking no further notice of beth who would probably have turned and fled from the dreadful place incontinently if mrs petterick had not come up at that moment and spoken to her as one human being to another seizing upon beth as beth might have seized upon her in despair for mrs petterick had also been having her share of snubs oh those christians how they do love one another how tender they are to one anothers feelings how careful to make the best of one another how gentle good and kind and true how singular it is that when the wicked unbeliever comes to live amongst them and sees them as they are he is not immediately moved by admiration to adopt their religion in order that he also may acquire the noble attributes so conspicuously displayed by them youre not dancing my dear mrs petterick said come along and sit with me on that couch against the wall yonder we shall see all thats going on from there beth was only too thankful to go a waltz was being played and dan passed them dancing with bertha petterick they glided over the floor together with the gentle voluptuous swing dreamy eyes and smiling lips of two perfect dancers conscious of nothing but the sensuous delight of interwoven paces and clasping arms my but they do step well together him and bertha mrs petterick exclaimed hes a handsome man your husband and a gay oneflirting about with all the ladies i wonder youre not jealous jealous beth answered smiling not i indeed jealousy is a want of faith in ones self well my dear if you always looked as well as you do just now you need not want confidence in yourself mrs petterick observed but what would you do if your husband gave you cause for jealousy despise him beth answered promptly mrs petterick looked as if she could make nothing of this answer then she became uneasy the music had stopped but bertha had not returned to her i must go and look after my daughter she said rising from her comfortable seat with a sigh gels are a nuisance youve got to keep your eye on them all the time or you never know what theyre up to beth stayed where she was and soon began to feel uncomfortable people stared coldly at her as they passed and she could not help fancying herself the subject of unpleasant remark because she was alone she prayed hard that some one would come and speak to her dan had disappeared after a time she recognised sir george galbraith among the groups of people at the opposite side of the room he was receiving that attention from every one which is so generously conferred on a man or woman of consequence whose acquaintance adds to peoples own importance and to whom it is therefore well to be seen speaking but although his manner was courteously attentive he looked round as if anxious to make his escape and finally to beths intense relief he recognised her and leaving the group about him unceremoniously came across the room to speak to her would it be fair to ask you to sit out a dance with me he said i do not dance i would rather sit out a dance with you than dance it with any one else i know here she answered naively but as it happens i do not dance either indeed how is that i should have thought you would like dancing so i should i am sure if i could she replied but i cant dance at all they would not let me learn dancing at one school where i was and i was not long enough at the other to learn properly now that is a pity he said considering beth his professional eye having been struck by her thinness and languor but have some lessons dancing in moderation is capital exercise and it exhilarates and anything that exhilarates increases ones vitality why dont you make your husband teach you he seems to know all about it yes beth answered smiling but i shouldnt think teaching me is at all in his line why dont you dance yourself oh i am far too clumsy he said goodnaturedly my wife says if i could even learn to move about a room without getting in the way and upsetting things it would be something is she here tonight beth asked no she was not feeling up to it he answered she tired herself in the garden this afternoon helping me to bud roses oh can you bud roses beth exclaimed i should so like to know how it is done ill show you with pleasure will you really said beth how kind of you not at all let me see when will you be at home we mustnt lose any time or it will be too late in the year im pretty nearly always at home beth said then if i came tomorrow morning would that be convenient quite and i hope you will stay lunch beth answered dan returned to the ballroom just then and on seeing who was with her he immediately joined them but sir george only stayed long enough to exchange greetings politely you seem to get on very well with galbraith dan observed dont you like him beth asked in surprise detecting a note of enmity in his voice i havent had much chance he said bitterly he doesnt play the agreeable to me as he does to you beth missed the drift of this remark in considering the expression play the agreeable which was unpleasantly suggestive to her of underbred gentility you will be able to give him an opportunity tomorrow then she said if you are in at lunchtime for he is coming to show me how to bud roses and i have asked him to stay have you indeed dan exclaimed obviously displeased but why or wherefore beth could not conceive i hope to goodness theres something to eat in the house he added upon reflection fussily there is as much as there always is beth placidly rejoined well thats not enough then just think what a man like that has on his own table a man like that wont expect our table to be like his youd better make it appear so for once then or youll be having our hospitality criticised as i heard the barrack fellows criticise mrs jefferys the other day a couple of them called about lunchtime and she asked them to stay and they said there was nothing but beer and sherry and the fragments of a previous feast and they were blessed if theyd go near the old trout again an elegant expression said beth it gives the measure of the mind it comes from please dont introduce the person who uses it to me but as to sir george galbraith you need not be afraid that he will accept hospitality and criticise it in that spirit he will neither grumble at a cutlet nor describe his hostess by a vulgar epithet after eating it she shut her mouth hard after speaking disillusion is a great enlightener our insight is never so clear as when it is turned on the character of a person in whom we used to believe and as dan gradually revealed himself to beth trait by trait a kind of distaste seized upon her a want of respect which found involuntary expression in trenchant comments upon his observations and in smart retorts she did not seek sympathy from him now for the way in which she had been slighted at the ball knowing perfectly well that he was more likely to blame her than anybody else he had in fact by this time so far as any confidence she might have reposed in him was concerned dropped out of her life completely and left her as friendless and as much alone as she would have been with the veriest stranger that night when she went home she felt worldworn and weary but next morning out in the garden with sir george galbraith budding roses she became young again before they had been together halfanhour she was chatting to him with girlish confidence telling him about her attempts to cultivate her mind her reading and writing to all of which he listened without any of that condescension in his manner which dan displayed when perchance he was in a goodhumour and beth had ventured to expand sir george was genuinely interested dan came in punctually to lunch for a wonder he glanced at beths animated face sharply when he entered but took no further notice of her he was one of those husbands who have two manners a coarse one for their families and another much more polished which they assume when it is politic to be refined but dans best behaviour sat ill upon him because it was lacking in sincerity and beth suffered all through lunch because of the obsequious pose he thought it proper to assume towards his distinguished guest after lunch when sir george had gone he took up his favourite position before the mirror over the chimneypiece and stood there for a little looking at himself and caressing his moustache you talk a great deal too much beth he said at last do you think so she rejoined yes i do he assured her of course galbraith had to be polite and affect to listen but i could see that he was bored by your chatter he naturally wanted to talk to me about things that interest men then why on earth didnt he talk to you beth asked how could he when you monopolised the conversation it was he who kept me talking she protested oh yes i notice you are very animated when anything in the shape of a man comes in dan sneered beth got up and left the room less affected by the insinuation however than by the vulgar expression of it the following week sir george came in one morning with some cuttings and stayed a while in the garden with beth showing her how to set them but he would not wait for lunch dan showed considerable annoyance when he heard of the visit he should come when i am at home he said it is damned bad taste his coming when you are alone the next time sir george came dan happened to be in to beths relief she had brought her writing down that day and was working at it on the diningroom table not expecting dan till much later he was in a genial mood for a wonder what on earth are you scribbling about there he asked just something i was thinking about beth answered evasively going in for authorship eh why not said beth dan laughed you are not at all ambitious he remarked then added patronisingly a little of that kind of thing will do you no harm of course but my dear child your head wouldnt contain a book and if you were just a little cleverer you would know that yourself beth bit the end of her pencil and looked at him dispassionately and it was at this moment that sir george galbraith was announced dan received him with effusion as usual and also as usual sir george responded with all conventional politeness but the greeting over he turned his attention to beth he had brought her a packet of books this looks like work in earnest he said glancing at the table i see you have a good deal of something done is it nearly finished all but beth rejoined what are you going to do with it beth looked at him and then at her manuscript vaguely i dont know she said what can i do with it publish it if it is good he answered but how am i to know beth asked eagerly do you think it possible i could do anything fit to publish before he could reply dan chimed in ive just been telling her he said that little heads like hers cant contain books its all very well to scribble a little for pastime and all that but she mustnt seriously imagine she can do that sort of work shell only do herself harm literature is mens work yet how many women have written and written well too beth observed oh yes of courseexceptional women and why maynt i be an exceptional woman beth asked smiling coarse and masculine dan exclaimed no thank you we dont want you to be one of that kinddo we galbraith there is not the slightest fear sir george answered dryly besides i dont think any class of women workersnot even the pitbrow womenare necessarily coarse and masculine and i differ from you too with regard to that head he added fixing his keen kindly eyes deliberately on beths cranium till she laughed to cover her embarrassment and put up both hands to feel it i should say there was good promise both of sense and capacity in the size and balance of itnot to mention anything else well you ought to know if anybody does said dan with a facetious sort of affectation of agreement which left no doubt of his insincerity i wish sir george continued addressing beth you would let me show some of your work to a lady a friend of mine whose opinion is well worth having i would rather have yours beth jerked out oh mine is no good he rejoined but if you will let me read what you give me to show my lady i should be greatly interested we were talking about style in prose the other day and i have ventured to bring you these bookssome of our own stylists and some modern frenchmen you read french i know there is nothing like the french dan chimed in we have no literature at all now look at their work compared to ours how short crisp and incisive it is how true to life a frenchman will give you more real life in a hundred pages than our men do in all their interminable volumes more sexuality you mean i suppose said galbraith personally i find them monotonous and barren of happy phrases to enrich the mind of noble sentiments to expand the heart of great thoughts to help the soul without balance with little of the redeeming side of life and less aspiration towards it if france is to be judged by the tendency of its literature and art at present one would suppose it to be dominated and doomed to destruction by a gang of lascivious authors and artists who are sapping the manhood of the country and degrading the womanhood by idealising selfindulgence and mean intrigue the man or woman who lives low or even thinks low in that sense of the word will tend always to descend still lower in times of trial moral probity is the backbone of our courage without it we have nothing to support us when a call is made upon our strength the truth of this assertion was lately proved in a terrible manner at the burning of the charity bazaar in the rue jean goujon when the nerves of the luxurious gentlemen present debilitated by close intimacy with the haute cocotterie in and out of society betrayed them and they displayed the white feather of vice by fighting their own way out not only leaving the ladies to their fate but actually beating them back with their sticks and trampling on them in their frantic efforts to save themselves as many a bruised white arm or shoulder afterwards testified there was scarcely a man burnt on the occasion husbands lovers and fathers escaped leaving all the heroic deeds to be done by some few devoted menservants some workmen who happened to be passing a stray englishman or american and mothers who perished in attempting to rescue their children i cant stand english authors myself was dans reply theyre so devilish longwinded dont you know poverty of mind accounts for the shortness of the book as a rule said galbraith i like a long book myself when it is rich in thought the characters become companions then and i miss them when we are forced to part beth nodded assent to this she had been turning over the books that galbraith had brought her with the tender touch of a true booklover and that evident interest and pleasure which goes far beyond thanks mere formal thanks she forgot to express but she had brightened up in the most wonderful way since galbraith appeared and was all smiles when he took his leave not so dan however but beth was too absorbed in the books to notice that how kind he is she exclaimed dan wont it be delightful if i really can write i might make a career for myself rot said dan sir george differs from you beth rejoined i say thats all rot what does he know about it i tell you youre a silly fool and your head wouldnt contain a book i ought to know doctors differ again then it seems beth said but in this case the patient is going to decide for herself what is the use of opinion in such matters one must experiment im going to write and if at first i dont succeedi shall persevere oh of course dan sneered youll take anybodys advice but your husbands however go your own way as i know you will only i warn you youll regret it beth was dipping into one of the books and took no notice of this dans illhumour augmented did you know the fellow was coming today he asked noif by fellow you mean sir george galbraith she answered casually still intent on the book you know well enough who i mean and thats just a nag he retorted and it looks uncommonly as if you did expect him and had set all that rubbish of writing out to make a display beth bit the end of her pencil and looked at dan contemptuously i dare say hed like to get hold of you to make a tool of you he pursued hes in with lord dawne and the whole of that advanced womans party at morne who are always interfering with everything how beth asked by poking their noses into things that dont concern them he asseverated things they wouldnt know anything about if they werent damned nastyminded theres that fanatical lady fulda guthrie and mrs orton beg and mrs kilroy besides madam idealatheyre all busybodies and if they succeed in what theyre at just now by jove theyll ruin me ill have my revenge though if they do ill attack your distinguished friend he has established himself as a humanitarian and travels on that reputation but he has an hospital of his own where i have no doubt some pretty games are played in the way of experiments which the public dont suspect i know the kind of thing patients mustnt ask questions the good doctor will do his best for themtrust him hell try nothing that he doesnt know to be for their good and when theyre under chloroform hell take no unfair advantage in the way of cutting a little more for his own private information than theyve consented to oh i know galbraith seems to be by way of slighting me but ill show him up if it comes to thatand at any rate im on the way to discoveries myself and i bet ill teach him some things in his profession yet that will make him sit upthings he doesnt suspect clever and all as he is beth knew nothing of the things to which dan alluded and therefore missed the drift of this tirade but the whole tone of it was so offensive to her that she gathered up her books and papers and left the room silence and flight were her weapons of defence in those days chapter xl there was a gap of six months between that last visit of sir george galbraiths and the next and in the interval beth had worked hard reading and rereading the books he had lent her writing and perhaps most important of all reflecting as she sat in her secret chamber busy with the beautiful embroideries which were to pay off that dreadful debt she had made seven pounds by this time and aunt grace mary had sent her five for a present surreptitiously advising her to keep it herself and say nothing about itaunt grace mary knew what husbands were beth smiled as she read the letter she too was beginning to know what husbands arehusbands of the uncle james kind she added the five pounds to her secret hoard and thanked goodness that the sum was mounting up little by little but she wished sir george would return he was a busy man and lived at the other side of the county so that she could not expect him to come to slane on her account but surely something more important would bring him eventually and then she might hope to see him she knew he would not desert her and she had some manuscript ready to confide to him now if he should repeat his offer but she was too diffident to send it to him except at his special request she was all energy now that the possibility of making a career for herself had been presented to her but it was the quietly restrained energy of a strong nature she never supposed that she could practise a profession without learning it and she was prepared to serve a long apprenticeship to letters if necessary she meant to write and write and write until she acquired power of expression about what she should have to express she never troubled herself it was the need to express what was in her that had set her to work she would never have to sit at a writingtable with a pen in her hand waiting for ideas to come she had discovered by accident that she could have books in plenty and of the kind she required from the free library at slane dan never troubled himself to consult her taste in books but he was in the habit of bringing home threevolume novels for himself from the library a form of literature he greatly enjoyed in spite of his strictures he made beth read them aloud to him in the evening one after the otheran endless successionwhile he smoked and drank whiskiesandsodas he brought them home himself at first but soon found it a trouble to go for them and so sent her and then it was she discovered that there were other books in the library the librarian an educated and intelligent man helped her often in the choice of books they had long talks together during which he made many suggestions and gave beth many a hint and piece of information that was of value to her he was her only congenial friend in slane and her long conversations with him often took her out of herself and raised her spirits he little suspected what a help he was to the lonely little soul for the most part she took less interest in the books themselves than in the people who wrote them biographies autobiographies and any scrap of anecdote about authors and their methods she eagerly devoured life as they had lived it not as they had observed and imagined it seemed allimportant to her and as she read and thought sitting alone in the charmed solitude of her secret chamber her selfrespect grew her mind which had run riot fancyfed with languorous dreams in the days when it was unoccupied and undisciplined came steadily more and more under control and grew gradually stronger as she exercised it she ceased to rage and worry about her domestic difficulties ceased to expect her husband to add to her happiness in any way ceased to sorrow for the slights and neglects that had so wounded and perplexed her during the first year of her life in slane and learnt by degrees to possess her soul in dignified silence so long as silence was best feeling in herself that something which should bring her up out of all this and set her apart eventually in another sphere among the electfeeling this through her further faculty to her comfort although unable as yet to give it any sort of definite expression as she read of those who had gone before she felt a strange kindred with them she entered into their sorrows understood their difficulties was uplifted by their aspirations and gloried in their successes their greatness never disheartened her on the contrary she was at home with them in all their experiences and at her ease as she never was with the petty people about her it delighted her when she found in them some small trait or habit which she herself had already developed or contracted such as she found in the early part of george sands histoire de ma vie and in the lives of the brontes under the influence of nourishing books her mind sustained and stimulated became nervously active it had a trick of flashing off from the subject she was studying to something wholly irrelevant she would begin emersons essay on fate or beauty with enthusiasm and presently with her eyes still following the lines her thoughts would be busy forming a code of literary principles for herself in those days her mind was continually under the influence of any author she cared about particularly if his style were mannered involuntarily while she was reading macaulay for instance her own thoughts took a dogmatic turn and jerked along in short sharp sentences she caught the peculiarities of de quincey too of carlyle and also some of the simple dignity of ruskin which was not so easy and she had written things after the manner of each of these authors before she perceived the effect they were having upon her but it was unfortunate for her that her attention had been turned from the matter which she had to express to the manner in which she should express it from the time she began to think of the style and diction of prose as something to be separately acquired the spontaneous flow of her thoughts was checked and hampered and she expended herself in fashioning her tools as it were instead of using her tools to fashion her work when in her reading she came under the influence of academic minds she lost all natural freshness and succeeded in being artificial her english became turgid with latinities she took phrases which had flowed from her pen and were telling in their simple eloquence and toiled at them turning and twisting them until she had laboured all the life out of them and then mistaking effort for power and having wearied herself she was satisfied being too diffident to suspect that she had any natural faculty she conceived that the more trouble she gave herself the better must be the result and consequently she did nothing worth the doing except as an exercise of ingenuity she was serving her apprenticeship howevermaking her mistakes it was late in the autumn before she saw her good friend sir george galbraith again he came on a bright clear frosty morning and found her out in the garden pacing up and down briskly and looking greatly exhilarated by the freshness when she saw him coming towards her she uttered a little joyful exclamation and hurried forward to meet him i have been longing to see you she said in her unaffected way but i know what the distance is and how fully your time is occupied it is very good of you to come at all only the time and distance have prevented me coming sooner he rejoined but tell me how have you been getting on and have you thought any more of making a career for yourself i have thought of nothing else beth answered brightly and i wonder i ever thought of anything else for the idea has been in me i believe all my life i must have discussed it too at a very early age for i have remembered lately that i was once advised by an old aunt of mine the best and dearest friend i ever had to write only that which isor aims at beingsoulsustaining he nodded his head approvingly from such seed a good crop should come he said but what line shall you take i dont know not novels then for certain nothing for certainwhatever comes and calls for expression they were pacing up and down together and there was a pause did you expect i should try to write novels and do you think i ought beth asked at last i think i did expect it he answered but as to whether you ought or ought not that is for you to decide there is much to be said against novel reading and writing i think it was de quincey who said that novels are the opium of the west and i have myself observed that novelreading is one of those bad habits that grow upon people until they are enslaved by it demoralised by it and if that is the case with the reader what must the writer suffer beth bent her brows upon this but that is only one side of it is it not she asked after a moments reflection i notice in all things a curious duality a right side and a wrong side confusion is the wrong side of order misery of happiness falsehood of truth evil of good and it seems to me that novelreading which can be a vice i know may also be made a virtue it depends on the writer and on the taste of the reader he suggested but i believe the taste of the intelligent general reader is much better than one supposes the mind craves for nourishment and the extraordinary success of books in which any attempt however imperfect is made to provide food for thought as distinguished from those which merely offer matter to distract the attention bears witness it seems to me to the involuntary effort which is always in progress to procure it i believe myself that good fiction may do more to improve the mind enlarge the sympathies and develop the judgment than any other form of literaturepartly because it looks into the hidden springs of action and makes all that is obscure in the way of impulse and motive clear to us biography for instance merely skims the surface of life as a rule and in history where man is a puppet moved by events there can be very little human nature i wonder if you read many novels said beth i have to read them aloud to my husband until i am satiated and i am determined if i ever do try to write one to avoid all that is conventional i never will have a faultlessly beautiful heroine for instance i am sick of that creature when i come to her especially if she has golden hair yards long a faultless complexion and eyes of extraordinary dimensions i feel inclined to groan and shut the book i have met her so often in the weary ways of fiction i know every variety of her so well she consists of nothing but superlatives and is as conventional as the torso of an egyptian statue with her everlasting physical perfection i think her as repulsive as a barbers block i confess that a woman who has golden hair and manages to look like a lady or to be like one even in a book is a wonder considering all that is associated with golden hair in our day but i should avoid the abnormal as much as the conventional i would not write plottyplotty books either nor make a pivot of the everlasting lovestory which seems to me to show such a want of balance in an author such an absence of any true sense of proportion as if there was nothing else of interest in life but our sexual relations but oh she broke off how i do appreciate what the difficulty of selection must be in writing a life if one could present all sides of it and not merely one phasethe good and the bad of it the joys and the sorrows the moments of strength and of weakness of wisdom and of folly of misery and of pure delightwhat a picture yes and how utterly beyond the average reader who never understands complexity he answered but i think it a good sign for your chances of success that you should have complained of the difficulty of selection in the matter of material rather than bemoan your want of experience of life most young aspirants to literary fame grumble that they are handicapped for want of experience they are seldom content with the material they have at handthe life they know they want to go and live in london where they seem to think that every one worth knowing is to be found that isnt my feeling at all said beth the best people may be met in london but i dont believe that they are at their best the friction of the crowd rubs out their individuality in a crowd i feel mentally as if i were in a maze of telegraph wires the thoughts of so many people streaming out in all directions about me entangle and bewilder me you do not seem to like anything exceptional no i do not said beth i like the normalthe everyday great events are not the most significant nor are great people the most typical it is the little things that make life livable the person who comes and talks clever is not the person we love nor the person who interests us most those we love sympathise with us in the ordinary everyday incidents of our lives and discuss them with us merely touching if at all on the thoughts they engender i dont want to know what people think as a rule i want to know what they have experienced people who talk facts i like people who talk theories i fly from and i think upon the whole that i shall always like the kind people better than the clever ones i believe we owe more to them too and learn more from themmore human nature which after all is what we want to know but the clever people are kind also sometimes said sir george when they are of course it is perfect beth answered but judging the clever ones of today by what they write i cannot often think them so the works of our smartest modern writers particularly the french satiate me with their cleverness but they are vain hollow cynical dyspeptic they appeal to the head but the heart goes empty away few of them know or show the one thing needfulthat happiness is the end of life and that by trying to live rightly we help each other to happiness that is the one thing well worth understanding in this world but that with all their ingenuity they are not intelligent enough to see you are an optimist i perceive sir george said smiling and i entirely agree with you so long as we understand that happiness is the end of life and that the best way to secure it for ourselves is by helping others to attain to it we are travelling in the right direction by happiness i do not mean excitement of course nor the pleasure we owe to others altogether but that quiet content in ourselves that large toleration and love which should overflow from us continually and make the fact of our existence a source of joy and strength to all who know us they walked up and down a little in silence then sir george asked her what she thought of some of the specimens of style and art in literature he had lent her to study i dont know yet beth said my mind is in a state of chaos on the subject i seem to reject style and art i ask for something more or something else and am never satisfied but tell me what you think of the stylists i think them brilliant he rejoined but their work is as the photograph is to the painting the lifeless accuracy of the machine to the nervous fascinating faultiness of the human hand no i dont care for the writers who are specially praised for their style i find their productions cold and bald as a rule i want something warmermore fullblooded most of the stylists write as if they began by acquiring a style and then had to sit and wait for a subject i believe style is the enemy of matter you compress all the blood out of your subject when you make it conform to a studied style instead of letting your style form itself out of the necessity for expression this is rank heresy i know and i should not have ventured on it a few years ago but now i say give me a style that is the natural outcome of your subject your mind your character not an artificial but a natural product and even though it be as full of faults as human nature is faults of every kind so long as there is no fault of the heart in it that being the one unpardonable fault in an authorif you have put your own individuality into your workill answer for it that you will arrive sooner and be read longer than the most admired stylist of the day be prepared to sacrifice form to accuracy to avoid the brilliant and the marvellous for the simple and direct what matters it how the effect is got so that it comes honestly but of course it will be said that this that and the other person did not get their effects so they will compare you to the greatest to humiliate you oh that would be nothing to me so that i produced my own effects beth broke in that is just where i am at present i mean to be myself but please do not think that i have too much assurance if i go wrong i hope i shall find it out in time and i shall certainly be the first to acknowledge it i do not want to prove myself right i want to arrive at the truth then you will arrive he assured her but above everything mind that you are not misled by the cant of art if you have anything special to say if a writer would be of use in his day and not merely an amuser of the multitude he must learn that right thinking right feeling and knowledge are more important than art when you address the blockhead majority you must not only give them your text you must tell them also what to think of it otherwise there will be fine misinterpretation you may be sure of the heart of the multitude if you can touch it but its head in the present state of its development is an imperfect machine manoeuvred for the most part by foolishness people can see life for themselves but they cannot always see the meaning of it the why and wherefore whence things come and whither they are tending so that the lessons of life are lostor would be but for the efforts of the modern novelist beth reflected a little then she said i am glad you think me an optimist it seems to me that healthy human nature revolts from pessimism the work that lasts is the work that cheers give us something with hope in itsomething that appeals to the best part of ussomething which while we read puts us in touch with fine ideals and makes us feel better than we are that is it precisely said he the school of artandstyle books wearies us because there is no aspiration in it nothing but a deadly dull artistic presentment of hopeless levels of life it is all cold polish as i said before with never a word to warm the heart or stir the better nature that is what i have felt said beth and i would rather have written a simple story full of the faults of my youth and ignorance but with some one passage in it that would put heart and hope into some one person than all that brilliant barren stuff and im going to write for women not for men i dont care about amusing men let them see to their own amusements they think of nothing else men entertain each other with intellectual ingenuities and art and style while women are busy with the great problems of life and are striving might and main to make it beautiful now that is young in the opprobrious sense of the word said sir george it is only when we are extremely young that we indulge in such sweeping generalisations beth blushed i am always afraid my judgment will be warped by my own narrow personal experiencei must guard against that she exclaimed conscious that she had had her husband in her mind when she spoke sir george nodded his head approvingly and looked at his watch i must go he said but i hope there will not be such a long interval before i come again my wife is sorry that she has not been able to call she is not equal to such a long drive but she desired me to explain and apologise and she has sent you some flowers and fruit which she begs you will accept have you some of your work ready for me this time i have asked my friend ideala to give you her opinion which is really worth having and she says she will with pleasure you must know her i am sure you would like her extremely but would she like me slipped from beth unawares now that is young again he said with his kindly smileindulgent it is the outcome of sad experience beth rejoined with a sigh no woman i have met here so far has shown any inclination to cultivate my acquaintance i think i am being punished for some unknown crime sir george became thoughtful but said nothing as they approached the house beth saw dan peeping at them from behind the curtain of an upstairs window the halltable was covered with the fruit and flowers sir george had brought beth sent a servant for dan the girl came back and said that the doctor was not in nonsense said beth i saw him at one of the windows just now if you will excuse me sir george i will find him myself she called him as she ran upstairs and dan made his appearance looking none too well pleased he went down to sir george and beth ran on up to her secret chamber for her manuscripts and the books sir george had lent her which had been waiting ready packed for many a day when he had gone beth danced round the diningroom clapping her hands i cant contain myself she exclaimed i do feel encouraged strengthened uplifted she caught a glimpse of dans face and stopped short whats the matter she said the matter is that ill have no more of this he answered in a brutal tone no more of what beth demanded no more of this mans philandering after you he retorted i dont understand you beth gasped oh youre mighty innocent he sneered youll be telling me next that he comes to see me lends me books walks up and down by the hour together with me brings me fruit and flowers you think im blind i suppose youre a nice person and so particular too and so fastidious in your conversation oh trust a prude but i tell you he bawled coming up close to her and shaking his fist in her face i tell you i wont have it now do you understand that beth did not wince but oh what a drop it was from the heights she had just left to this low level be good enough to explain your meaning precisely she said quietly i understand that you are bringing some accusation against me it is no use blustering and shaking your fist in my face i am not to be frightened just explain yourself and i advise you to weigh your words for you shall answer to me in public for any insult you may offer me in private dr maclure was sobered by this unexpected flash of spirit they had been married nearly three years by this time and beths habitual docility had deceived him hitherto men have been able to insult their wives in private with impunity when so minded and dan was staggered for a moment to find himself face to face with a mere girl who boldly refused to suffer the indignity he was not prepared for such a display of selfrespect youre very high and mighty he jeered at last i am very determined beth rejoined and set her lips he tried to subdue her by staring her out of countenance but beth scornfully returned his gaze then suddenly she stamped her foot and brought her clenched fist down on the diningroom table beside which she was standing come come sir she said weve had enough of this theatrical posing you are wasting my time explain yourself he took a turn up and down the room look here beth he began lowering his tone you cannot pretend that galbraith comes to see me why should i she asked well it isnt right that he should come to see you and i wont have it he reiterated do you mean that i am not to have any friends of my own she demanded he is not to be one of your friends dan answered doggedly and what explanation am i to give him please she asked politely i wont have you giving him any explanation my dear dan she rejoined when you speak in that way you show an utter want of knowledge of my character if i will not allow you to insult me and bully me and bluster at me it is not likely that i will allow you to insult my friends if sir george galbraiths visits are to stop i shall tell him the reason exactly he at least is a gentleman that is as much as to say that i am not dan blustered you certainly are not behaving like one now beth coolly rejoined but there you have my ultimatum i am not going to waste any more time in vulgar scenes with you ultimatum indeed he jeered well you are you know youll write and explain to him will you that your husbands jealous of him that shows the terms you are on it is jealousy then is it said beth thank you now i understand you dans evil mood took another turn his anger changed to selfpity oh dear oh dear what am i to do with you he exclaimed and after all ive done for youto treat me like this he took out his pockethandkerchief and wiped away the tears which any mention of his own goodness and the treatment he received from others always brought to his eyes beth watched him contemptuously yet her heart smote her he was a poor creature but for that very reason and because she was strong surely she should be gentle with him look here dan she said i have never knowingly done you any wrong in thought or word or deed all you have said to me today has been ridiculously wrongheaded but never mind stop crying do and dont let us have any more idiotic jealousy why it was lady galbraith who sent me the flowers and fruit with a kind message of apology because she has not been able to call why should not she be jealous oh shes a fool dan rejoined recovering himself she leads him the life of a dog with her fears and fancies and she wont take any part in his philanthropic work though he wishes it shes a pretty pill the servant came in at this moment to lay the table for lunch and dan went to the lookingglass with the inconsequence of a child and forgot his grievance in the contemplation of his own beloved image and in abusing lady galbraith abusing somebody was mental relaxation of the most agreeable kind to him feeling that he had gone too far he was gracious to beth during lunch and just before he went out he kissed her and said we wont mention that fellow again beth i dont believe youd do anything dishonourable i should think not said beth when he had gone she returned to her secret chamber the one little corner sacred to herself to her purest noblest thoughts her highest aspirations and as she looked round it seemed as if ages had passed since she last entered it full of happiness and hope it was as if she had been innocent then and was now corrupted her selfcontrol did not give way but she could do nothing and just sat there wan with horror and as she sat every now and then she shivered from head to foot she had known of course in a general way that such things did happen that married women did give their husbands cause for jealousy but to her mind they were a kind of married women who lived in another sphere where she was not likely to encounter them she had never expected to be brought near such an enormity let alone to have it brought home to herself in a horrible accusation and the effect of it was a shock to her nervous systemone of those stunning blows which are scarcely felt at first but are agonising in their after effects when the reaction set in beths disgust was so great it took a physical form and ended by making her violently sick it was days before she quite recovered and in one sense of the word she was never the same again chapter xli dan said no more about sir george galbraith and indeed he had no excuse for sir george did not come again there were other men however who came to the house dans own friends and now that beths eyes were opened she perceived that he watched them all suspiciously if they paid her any attention and if she showed the slightest pleasure in the conversation of any of them he would be sure to make some sneering remark about it afterwards dan was so radically vicious that the notion of any one being virtuous except under compulsion was incomprehensible to him your spirits seem to go up when mr vanrickards is here he observed one day thank you for warning me beth answered descending to his level in spite of herself i will be properly depressed the next time he comes but although she could keep him in check so that he dared not say all that he had in his mind she understood him and the worst of it was that his coarse and brutal jealousy accustomed her to the suspicion and made her contemplate the possibility of such a lapse as he had in his mind she began to believe that he would not have tormented himself so if husbands did not ordinarily have good reason to be jealous of their wives she concluded that such treachery of man to man as he dreaded must be normal and then also she realised that it was thought possible for a married woman to fall in love and even wondered at last if that would ever be her own case dan had in fact destroyed his own best safeguard if a man would keep his wife from evil he should not teach her to suspect herselfneither should he familiarise her with ideas of vice since their marriage dans whole conversation and the depravity of his tastes and habits had tended towards the brutalisation of beth married life for her was one long initiation into the ways of the vicious dr maclures sordid jealousy made him the laughingstock of the place though he never suspected it his conceit was too great to let him suppose that any sentiment of his could provoke ridicule it became matter for common gossip however and from that time forward gentlemen ceased to visit the house men of a certain kind came still men who were bound to dan by kindred tastes but not such as he cared to introduce to beth these boon companions generally came in the evening and were entertained in the diningroom where they spent the night together smoking drinking and talking after the manner of their kind beth could not use her secret chamber after dark for fear of the light being seen so she stayed in the drawingroom alone till she went to bed she found those evenings interminable and the nights more trying still she could not read or write because of the noise in the diningroom and had to fall back on her sewing for occupation but sewing left her mind open to any obsession and only too often with the gross laughter from the next room scraps of the lewd topics her husband delighted in came to her recollection when dan discoursed about such things he was at the highwater mark of pleasure his countenance glowed and enjoyment of the subject was expressed in all his person beths better nature revolted but alas she had become so familiar with such subjects by this time that although she loathed them she could not banish them life from her husbands point of view was a torment to her yet under the pressure of his immediate influence it was forced upon her attention more and morefrom his point of view when she went to bed on his festive nights she suffered from the dread of being disturbed if her husband were called out at night professionally it was a pleasure to her to lie awake so that she might be ready to rise the moment he returned and get him anything he wanted on those occasions she always had a tray ready for him with soup to be heated or coffee to be made over a spiritlamp and any little dainty she thought would refresh him she was fully in sympathy with him in his work and would have spared herself no fatigue to make it easier for him but she despised him for his vices and refused to sacrifice herself in order to make them pleasanter for him when he stayed up smoking and drinking half the night she resented the loss of sleep entailed upon her which meant less energy for her own work the next day the dread of being disturbed made her restless and the futility of it under the circumstances exasperated her she suffered too more than can be mentioned from the smell of alcohol and tobacco of which he reeked and from which he took no trouble to purify himself often and often when she had tossed herself into a fever on these dreadful nights she craved for long hours with infinite yearning to be safe from disturbance in purity and peace and thought how happily how serenely she would have slept until the morning and how strong and fresh she would have arisen for another days work had she been left alone only once however did she complain dan was going out in a particularly cheerful mood that night shall you be late she asked yes probably why i was thinking if you wouldnt mind i would have a bed made up for you in the spare room i only sleep in snatches when you are out and i am expecting you every sound rouses me i think it is the door opening and then when you do come it disturbs me and i do not sleep again if you dont mind i should prefer to be aloneon your late nightsyour late festive nights dr maclure stood looking gloomily into the fireplace have i annoyed you dan beth asked at last he walked to the door stood a moment with his back to her then turned and looked at her annoyed is not the word he said you have wounded me deeply he opened the door as he spoke and went out when he had gone beth sat and suffered she could not bear to hurt him she was not yet sufficiently brutalised for that so she said no more on the subject but patiently endured the long lonely night watches and the after companionship which had in it all that is most trying and offensive to a refined and delicate woman after that first display of jealousy beth discovered that her husband pried upon her continually he was very high and mighty on the subject of women spying upon men but there seemed no meanness he would not compass in order to spy upon a woman he had duplicate keys to her drawers and boxes and rummaged through all her possessions when she went out one day she came upon him standing before her wardrobe feeling in the pockets of her dresses and on another occasion she discovered him unawares in her bedroom picking little scraps of paper out of the sloppail and piecing them together to see what she had been writing to beth accustomed to the simple honourable principles of her parents and to the confidence with which her mother had left her letters lying about because she knew that not one of her children would dream of looking at them dans turpitude was revolting on those occasions when she caught him he did not hear her enter the room and she made her escape without disturbing him and stole up to her secret chamber and sat there suffering from one of those attacks of nausea and shivering which came upon her in moments of deep disgust after that she had an attack of illness which kept her in bed for a week but even then feverish and suffering as she was and yearning for the coolness and liberty of a room to herself she dared not suggest such a thing for fear of a scene while she was still in bed dan brought her some letters one morning he made no remark when he gave them to her but he had opened them as usual and stood watching her curiously while she read them the first she looked at was from her sister bernadine and had a black border round it but she took it out of its envelope unsuspiciously and read the words that were uppermost mamma died this morning in a moment it flashed upon her that dan had read the letter and was waiting now to see the effect of the shock upon her she immediately but involuntarily set herself to baffle his cruel curiosity with a calm illegible face she read the letter from beginning to end folded it and put it back in its envelope deliberately then took up another which had also been opened but suppressed feeling finds vent in some form or other and beth showed temper now instead of showing grief i wish you would not open my letters she said irritably all the freshness of them is gone for me when you open them without my permission and read them first besides it is an insult to my correspondents what they say to me is intended for me and not for you i have a perfect right to open your letters he retorted i should like to see the scripture that gives you the right and i should advise you to waive it if you do not wish me to assume the right to open yours your petty prying keeps me in a continual state of irritation i shall be lowered to retaliate sooner or later so stop it please once and for all my petty prying indeed he exclaimed well that is a nice thing to say to your husband why even when i do open your letters which is not often i never read them without your permission indeed said beth who had ceased to be stunned by falsehoods then be good enough not even to open them in future dan tried to express injury and indignation in a long hard look but beth was reading another letter and took no further notice of him he hung about a little watching her any news he ventured at last with an imperfect assumption of indifference you know quite well what my news is she answered bluntly and i am not going to discuss it with you i wish you would leave me alone well youre a nice pill said dan discomfited beth looked up at him what are you doing with your hat on in my bedroom she asked sharply i thought i had made you understand that you must treat me with respect even if i am your wife dan uttered a coarse oath and left the room banging the door after him thank heavenat last beth ejaculated she had been too anxious to get rid of him to scruple about the means but when he had gone a reaction set in and she lay back on her pillows flushed excited furious with him disgusted with herself she felt she was falling away from all her ideals as the husband is the wife isthe words flashed through her mind but she would not believe it inevitable but even if she should degenerate her own nature was too large too strong too generous to cast the blame on any one but herself no she exclaimed we are what we allow ourselves to be swift following upon that thought came the recollection of a bad fall she had had when she was a little child in ireland and the way her mother had picked her up and cuddled her and comforted her beth burst into a paroxysm of tears she had understood her mother better than her mother had understood her had felt for her privations had admired and imitated her patient endurance and now to think that it was too late to think that she had gone and it would never be in beths power to brighten her life or lessen the hardship of it that was all she thought of every week since her marriage she had sent her mother a long cheerful amusing letter full of pleasant detailsan exercise in that form of composition but with never a hint of her troubles and mrs caldwell died under the happy delusion that it was well with beth she never suspected that she had married beth to a lowborn mannot lowborn in the sense of being a tradesmans son for a tradesmans son may be an honest and upright gentleman just as a peers son may be a cheat and a snob but lowborn in that he came of parents who were capable of fraud and deceit in social relations and had taught him no scheme of life in which honour played a conspicuous part beth had done her best for her mother but there was no one now to remind her of this for her comfort poor miserable girl her courageous toil had gone for nothingher mother would never even know of it and it seemed to her in that moment of deep disheartenment as if everything she tried was to be equally ineffectual hours later minna the housemaid found beth sitting up in bed sobbing hopelessly and got her tea and stayed with her making her put some restraint upon herself by the mere fact of her presence and presently beth in her human way began to talk about her mother to the girl which relieved her mrs caldwell had only been ill a few days and not seriously as it was supposed the end had come quite suddenly so that beth had never been warned dan did not come in till next morning which was a great relief to her she meant to speak about the news to him when he appeared but somehow the moment she saw him her heart hardened and she could not bring herself to utter a word on the subject the position was awkward for him but he got out of it adroitly by pretending he had seen an announcement of the death in the paper i suppose i ought to go to the funeral he said there is doubtless a will doubtless said beth but you will not benefit by it if that is what you are thinking of mamma considered that i was provided for and therefore she left the little she had to bernadine she told me herself because she wanted me to understand her reason for making such a difference between us and i think she was quite right she may have left me two or three hundred pounds but it will not be more than that but even that will be something towards the bills said dan his countenance which had dropped considerably clearing again beth looked at him with a set countenance but said no more she had begun to observe that the bills only became pressing when her allowance was due chapter xlii some one in slane gave sir george galbraith a hint of dans coarse jealousy and he had judged it better for beth that he should not call again but his interest in her and his desire to help her increased if anything he had read her manuscript carefully himself and obtained idealas opinion of it also but beth had not done her best by any means in the one she had given him she had written it for the purpose for one thing which was fatal for her style had stiffened with anxiety to do her best and her ideas instead of flowing spontaneously had been forced and formal as her manner was when she was shy it is one thing to have a fine theory of art and high principles and an excellent thing too but it is quite another to put them into effect especially when youre in a hurry to arrive hurry misplaced is hindrance if beth had given sir george some one of the little things which she had written in sheer exuberance of thought and feeling without hampering hopes of doing anything with them he would have been very differently impressed but even as it was what she had given him was as full of promise as it was full of faults and he was convinced that he had not been mistaken in her especially when he found that ideala thought even better of her prospects than he did ideala who was an impulsive and generous woman wrote warmly on the subject and sir george sent her letter to beth with a few lines of kindly expressed encouragement from himself he returned her manuscript but when beth saw it again she was greatly dissatisfied the faults her friends had pointed out to her she plainly perceived and more also but she could not see the merits praise only made her the more fastidious about her work but in that way it helped her sir georges kindness did not stop at criticism however he was cut off from her himself and could expect no help from his wife whose nervous system had suffered so much from the shock of unhappy circumstances in her youth that she could not now bear even to hear of let alone to be brought in contact with any form of sorrow or suffering but there were other ladiesmrs kilroy of ilverthorpe for instance sir george had known her all her life and went specially to ask her as a favour to countenance beth i want you to be kind to mrs maclure angelica he said shes far too good for that plausible bounder of a barbers block shes married then why did she marry him angelica interrupted in her vivacious way pitchforked into it at the suggestion of her friends in her infancy i should say reasoning by induction he answered thats generally the explanation in these cases but at any rate shes not going to be happy with him and shes a charming little creature very sweet and docile naturally and with unusual ability or im much mistaken and plenty of spirit too when shes roused i should anticipate but at present in her childish ignorance shes yielding where she should resist and shell be brutalised if no one comes to the rescue i dont trust that man maclure a man who speaks flippantly of things that should be respected is not a man who will be scrupulous when his own interests are concerned and such a man has it in his power to make the life of a girl a hell upon earth in ways which she will not complain of if she has no knowledge to use in selfdefence and girls seldom have as i have learnt alas from bitter experience in my work amongst the victims of holy matrimony angelica interposed bitterly oh how sickening it all is sometimes i envy evadne in that she is able to refuse to know sir george was silent for a little then he said this is likely to be a more than usually pathetic case because of the girls unusual character and promise and also because her brain is too delicately poised to stand the kind of shocks and jars that threaten her you will take pity on her angelica mrs kilroy shrugged her shoulders how can i countenance a woman who acquiesces in such a position as her husband holds and actually lives on his degrading work i dont believe she knows anything about it he rejoined if i were sure of that said angelica meditating it is easy enough to make sure he suggested mrs carne wife of the leading medical man in slane conceived it to be her duty to patronise beth to the extent of an occasional formal call as she was the wife of a junior practitioner and beth duly returned these calls because she was determined not to make enemies for dan by showing any resentment for the slights she had suffered in slane feeling depressed indoors one dreary afternoon she set off alone as usual to pay one of these visits she rather hoped perhaps to find some sort of satisfaction by way of reward for the brave discharge of an uncongenial duty on the way into town dan passed her in his dogcart with a casual nod bespattering her with mud youll have your carriage soon please god and never have to walk i hate to see a delicate woman on foot in the mud beth remembered the words so well and dans pious intonation as he uttered them and she laughed she had a special little laugh for exhibitions of this kind of divergence between dans precepts and his practices but even as she laughed her face contracted as with a sudden spasm of pain and she ejaculatedbut i shall succeed mrs carne was at home and beth was shown into the drawingroom where she found several other lady visitorsmrs kilroy mrs orton beg lady fulda guthrie and ideala the last two she had not met before where will you sit said mrs carne who was an effusive little person what a day you were brave to come out though perhaps it will do you good my husband says go out in all weathers and battle with the breeze theres nothing like exercise battling with the breeze and an umbrella on a wet day is not exercise it is exasperation beth answered and at the sound of her peculiarly low clear cultivated voice the conversation stopped suddenly and every one in the room looked at her she seemed unaware of the attention in fact she ignored every one present except her hostess this was her habitual manner now assumed to save herself from slights when she entered mrs kilroy had half risen from her seat and endeavoured to attract her attention but beth passed her by deliberately chose a seat and sat down her demeanour so apparently cold and selfcontained was calculated to command respect but it cost beth a great deal to maintain it she felt she was alone in an unfriendly atmospherea poor little thing shabbily dressed in homemade mourning and despised for she knew not what offence and she suffered horribly she had grown very fragile by this time and looked almost childishly young her eyes were unnaturally large and wistful her mouth drooped at the corners and the whole expression of her face was pathetic mrs kilroy looked at her seriously and thought to herself that girl is suffering mrs carne offered beth tea but she refused it she could not accept such inhuman hospitality she had come to do her duty not to force a welcome she glanced at the clock five minutes more and she might go the conversation buzzed on about her she was sitting next to a strange lady a serene and dignified woman dressed in black velvet and sable beth glanced at her the first time with indifference but looked again with interest mrs carne bustled up and spoke to the lady in her effusive way you are better i hope she said as she handed her some tea it really is sweet to see you looking so much yourself again oh yes i am quite well again now thanks to your good husband the lady answered but he has given me so many tonics and things lately i always seem to be shaking bottles i am quite set in that attitude everything i touch i shake i found myself shaking my watch instead of winding it up the other day ah then you are quite yourself again i see mrs carne said archly but why didnt you come to the wilmingtons last night oh you know i never go to those functions if i can help it the lady answered her gentle rather drawling voice lending a charm to the words quite apart from their meaning i cannot stand the kind of conversation to which one is reduced on such occasionsif you can call that conversation which is but the cackle of geese each repeating the utterances of the other when the lord loves a woman i think he takes her out of society by some means or other and keeps her out of it for her good beth knew that if she had said such a thing mrs carne would have received it with a stony stare but now she simpered that is so like you she gushed but the wilmingtons were dreadfully disappointed they will get over it the lady answered glancing round indifferently how are you getting on with your new book ideala mrs kilroy asked her across the room beth instantly froze to attention this was her friend then sir georges ideala i have not got into the swing of it yet ideala answered it is all dotandgoonea uniform ruggedness which is not true either to life or mind our ways in the world are stony enough at times but they are not all stones there are smooth stretches along which we gallop and sheltered grassy spaces where we rest what i love about your work is the style said mrs carne do you ideala rejoined somewhat dryly as it seemed to beth but what is style i am so bad at definitions said mrs carne but i feel it you know as if it were a thing in itself to be adopted or acquired ideala asked yes quite so said mrs carne in a tone of reliefas of one who has acquitted herself better than she expected and is satisfied i am sure it is not beth burst out forgetting herself and her slights all at once in the interest of the subject i have been reading the lives of authors lately together with their works and it seems to me in the case of all who had genius that their style was the outcome of their characterstheir principlesthe view they took of the subjectthat is if they were natural and powerful writers only the secondrate people have a manufactured style and force their subject to adapt itself to itthe kind of people whose style is mentioned quite apart from their matter in the great ones the style is the outcome of the subject each emotion has its own form of expression the language of passion is intense of pleasure jocund easy abundant of content calm of happiness strong but restrained of love warm tender the language of artificial feeling is artificial there is no mistaking insincerity when a writer is not sincere and the language of true feeling is equally unmistakable it is simple easy unaffected and it is the same in all ages the artificial styles of yesterday go out of fashion with the dresses their authors wear and become an offence to our taste but shakespeares periods appeal to every generation he wrote from the heart as well as the head and triumphed in the grace of nature beth stopped short and coloured crimson finding that every one in the room was listening to her mrs carne stood while she was speaking with a cup of tea in her hand and tried to catch idealas eye in order to signal with raised eyebrows her contempt for beths opinion but ideala was listening with approval that is exactly what i think she exclaimed only i could not have expressed it so you write yourself doubtless but beth had become confused and only gazed at her by way of reply she felt she had done the wrong thing to speak out like that in such surroundings and she regretted every word and burned with vexation then suddenly in herself as before something seemed to say or rather to flash forth the exclamation for her comfort i shall succeed i shall succeed she drew herself up and looked round on them all with a look that transformed her such an assurance in herself was not to be doubted the day would come when they would be glad enough to see her when she too would be heard with respect and quoted she the least considered she in her shabby gloves neglected slighted despised alone she would arrive would have done somethingmore than them all she arose with her eyes fixed on futurity and was halfway home before she came to and found herself tearing along through the rain with her head forward and her hands clasped across her chest urged to energy by the cry in her heart i shall succeed i shall succeed who was that said ideala in a startled voice when beth jumped up and left the room the wife of that dr maclure you know mrs carne replied her manners seem somewhat abrupt she forgot to say goodbye i did not know she was by way of being clever by way of being clever ideala ejaculated i wish i had known who she was why didnt you introduce her by way of being clever indeed why she is just what i have missed being with all my cleverness or i am much mistaken and that is a genius and what is more important to us i suspect she is the genius for whom we are waiting why why didnt you name her it is the old story she came unto her own and her own received her not ii never dreamt you would care to know herher position you know mrs carne stammered disconcerted her position what is her position to me ideala exclaimed it is the girl herself i think of besides i daresay she doesnt even know what her position is that is what sir george says and he knows her well mrs kilroy interposed but i never suspected that she was in the least interesting mrs carne protested and im sure she doesnt look attractivesuch an expression you are to blame for that all of you ideala rejoined with something in her gentle way of speaking which had the effect of strength and vehemence i know how it has been she is sensitive and you have made her feel there is something wrong you have treated her so that she expects no kindness from you and so from diffidence and restraint of tenderness her face has set hard into coldness but that is only a mask how you treat each other you women and you are as wanting in discernment too as you are in kindness and sympathy she has had to put on that mask of coldness to hide what you make her suffer and it will take long loving to melt it now and make her look human again you misinterpret her silence too how can you expect her to be interesting if you take no interest in her but look at her eyes any one with the least kindly discernment might have seen the love and living interest there if she had been in a good position everybody would have found her as singularly interesting as she without caring a rap for our position has found us she sees through us all with those eyes of hersay and beyond she sees what we have never seen and never shall in this incarnation hers are the vision and the dream that are denied to us were she to come forward as a leader tomorrow i would follow her humbly and do as she told me i read some of her writings the other day but i thought they were the work of a mature woman had i known she was such a child i should have wondered dear me does she really write said mrs carne well you surprise me i should never have dreamt that she had anything in her you make me feel ashamed of myself ideala said mrs kilroy with contrition i ought to have known but i could think of nothing see nothing in her but that horrible business i shall certainly do my best now however when we return from town to cultivate her acquaintance if she will let me let you mrs carne ejaculated with her insinuating smile i should think she would be flattered i am not so sure of that said ideala neither am i said mrs kilroy i only wish i were but she ignored us all rather pointedly when she came in to save herself from being ignored i suppose said ideala bitterly the girl is selfrespecting i confess i liked her the first time i saw her said mrs orton beg but afterwards when i heard what her husband was i felt forced to ignore her how can you countenance her if she approves it was a mistake to take her approval for granted said mrs kilroy ideala would have inquired yes said ideala i take nothing for granted if i hear anything nice i believe it but if i hear anything objectionable about any one i either inquire about it or refuse to believe it pointblank and in a case like this i should be doubly particular for in one of its many moods genius is a young child that gazes hard and sees nothing and you really think the little woman is a genius and will be a great writer some day mrs carne asked with exaggerated deference to idealas opinion i dont know about being a writer said ideala genius is versatile there are many ways in which she might succeed it depends on herselfon the way she is finally impelled to choose but great she will be in somethingif she lives let us hope that she will be a great benefactor of her own sex then and do great good said the gentle lady fulda amen ideala ejaculated fervently mrs carne tried to put off her agreeable society smile and put on her sundayinchurch expression but was not in time when we only assume an attitude once a week be it mental or physical we do not fall into it readily on a sudden not that working for women as a career is what i should wish her for her own comfort said ideala after a pause women who work for women in the present period of our progressi mean the women who bring about the changes which benefit their sexmust resign themselves to martyrdom only the martyr spirit will carry them through men will often help and respect them but other women especially the workers with methods of their own will make their lives a burden to them with pinpricks of criticism and every petty hindrance they can put in their way there is little union between women workers and less tolerance each leader thinks her own idea the only good one and disapproves of every other they seldom see that many must be working in many ways to complete the work and as to the bulk of women those who will benefit by our devotion they bespatter us with mud stone us slander us calumniate us and even in the very act of taking advantage of the changes we have brought about ignore us slight us push us under and step up on our bodies to secure the benefits which our endeavours have made it possible for them to enjoy i know i have worked for women these many years and could i show you my heart you would find it covered with scarsthe scars of the wounds with which they reward me when beth got in that day she found dan standing in the hall examining a letter addressed to herself she took it out of his hand without ceremony and tore it open hurrah she exclaimed its accepted whats accepted he asked an article i sent to sunshine and the editor says he would like to see some more of my work beth rejoined almost dancing with delight i dont suppose that will put much in your pocket dan observed he wouldnt praise you if he meant to pay you but he has sent me a cheque for thirty shillings said beth dans expression changed then you may be sure its worth double he said but you might get some nice notepaper for me out of it and have it stamped with my crest like a good girl its necessary in my profession and ive finished the last you got beth laughed as she had laughedthat same peculiar mirthless little laughwhen he drove past her and splashed her with mud on the road it never seems to occur to you that i may have some little wants of my own dan she said you are a perfect horseleechs daughter dan gazed at her blankly he never seemed to understand any such allusion youve got a grievance have you he snarled do i ever prevent you getting anything you like beth shrugged her shoulders by way of answer and went into the diningroom he followed her bent on making a scene and she perceiving this set herself down on a chair and folded her hands he took a turn up and down the room and this is my fine marriage into a county family which was to have done so much for me he ejaculated at last but i might have known better considering the hole i took you out of youve soon forgotten all ive done for you beth smiled enigmatically oh yes its a laughing matter he proceeded ive just ruined myself by marrying you thats what ive done not a soul in the place will come to the house because of you nobody could ever stand you but me and what have i got by it not a halfpenny it was just a swindle the whole business be careful beth flashed forth if you make such assertions you must prove them the day is past when a man might insult his wife with impunity i have already told you i wont stand it it would neither be good for you nor for me if i did it was a swindle he bawled where are the seven or eight hundred a year i married you for beth looked at him a moment then burst out laughing dear dan she said offering him the cheque you shall have the thirty shillings all to yourself you deserve it for telling the truth for once i consider i have had the best of the bargain though thirty shillings is cheap for such valuable information oh damn you said dan leaving the room and banging the door after him beth signed the cheque and left it lying on his writingtable she never saw it again then she went up to her secret chamber and spent long hourssobbing sobbing sobbing as if the marks of her married life on her character could be washed away with tears chapter xliii beth had made fifty pounds in eighteen months by her beautiful embroideries but after her mothers death she did no more for sale neither did she spend the money she had suffered so many humiliations for want of money it made her feel safer to have some by her she gave herself up to study at this time and wrote a great deal it was winter now and she was often driven down from her secret chamber to the diningroom by the cold when dan came in and found her at work he would sniff contemptuously or facetiously according to his mood at the moment wasting paper as usual eh better be sewing on my buttons was his invariable remark not that his buttons were ever off or that beth ever sewed them on either she was too good an organiser to do other peoples work for them she made no reply to dans sallies with him her mind was in a state of solitary confinement alwaysnot a good thing for her health but better on the whole than any attempt to discuss her ideas with him or to talk to him about anything indeed but himself beth fared well that winter howeverfared well in herself that is she had some glorious moments revelling in the joy of creation there is a mental analogy to all physical processes fertility in life comes of love and in art the fervour of production is also accompanied by a rapture and preceded by a passion of its own when beth was in a good mood for work it was like lovelove without the lover she felt all the joy of love with none of the disturbance when the idea of publication was first presented to her it robbed her of this joy as she wrote she thought more of what she might gain than of what she was doing visions of success possessed her and the ideas upon which her attention should have been fully concentrated were thinned by anticipations and during that period her work was indifferent later however she worked again for works sake loving it and then she advanced she saw little of dan in those days and thought less but when they met she was as usual gentle and tolerant patiently enduring his cheeriness and entering into no quarrel unless he forced one upon her one bright frosty morning he came in rather earlier than usual and found her writing in the diningroom well ive had a rattling good ride this morning he began plunging into his favourite topic as usual without any pretence of interest in her or in her pursuits nothing like riding for improving the circulation i wish to goodness i could keep another horse it would add to my income in the long run but im so cursedly handicapped by those bills they keep me awake at night thinking of them beth sucked the end of her pencil and looked out of the window wondering inwardly why he never tried to pay them i calculate that they come to just three hundred pounds he proceeded looking keenly at beth as he spoke but she remained unmoved dont you think he ventured it would be a good thing to expend that three hundred pounds your mother left you on the debts i know i could make money if i once got my head above water that three hundred brings me in fifteen pounds a year said beth it is well invested and i promised my mother not to touch any of my little capital there is the interest however it arrived this morning you can have that if you like well that would be a crumb of comfort at all events he said pouncing on the lawyers letter which was lying beside beth on the table and gloating on the cheque but dont you think now that you have the interest it would be a good time to sell and get the principal of course your mother was right and wise to advise you not to part with your capital but this wouldnt be parting with it because i should pay you back in time you know it would only be a loan and id give you the interest on it regularly too just think what a relief it would be to me to get those bills paid he ran his fingers up through his hair as he spoke and gazed at himself in the glass tragically any news said beth after a little pause dan baffled turned and began to walk up and down the room no there never is any news in this confounded hole he answered venting his irritation on the place oh by the way though i am forgetting i was at the pettericks today that girl bertha is not getting on as i should like the hysterical one said beth yeyes he answered hesitating the one who threatened to be hysterical at one time but thats all gone off now shes just weak and she should have electricity but i cant be going there every day to apply ittakes too much time so i suggested to her people that she should come here for a while as a paying patient you know and is she coming beth said rather in dismay yes tomorrow he replied i said youd be delighted but you must write and say so yourself just for politeness sake it will be a good thing for you too you know you are too much alone and shell be a companion for you shes not half a bad girl shall i be obliged to give her much of my time beth asked lugubriously oh dear no shell look after herself dr maclure cheerfully assured her ill hire a piano for her must launch out a little on these occasions you know its setting a sprat to catch a whale the piano arrived that afternoon beth wished dan had let her choose it but a piano of any kind was a delight she had not had one since her marriage dan had said at first that a piano was a luxury which they must not think of when they could not afford the necessaries and a luxury he had considered it ever since bertha petterick was not the kind of person that beth would have chosen for a companion and she dreaded her coming but before bertha had been in the house a week she had so enlivened it that beth wondered she had ever objected to her bertha fawned upon beth from the first and was by way of looking up to her and admiring her intellect she was four or five years older than beth but gave herself no airs on that account she was a dark girl good looking in a common kind of way with a masculine stride in her walk a deep mannish voice and not at all intellectual but very practical what some people consider a fine girl and others a coarse one according to their taste she was a good shot could make a dress cook a dinner ride to hounds and play any game and she was what is called goodnatured that is to say ready to do for any one anything that could be done on the spur of the moment things she might promise to do or things requiring thought she did not trouble herself about but she would finish a pretty piece of work for beth gather flowers or buy them and do the table decorations and keep things tidy in the sittingrooms she played and sang well and was ready to do both at any time if she were asked which was a joy to beth and her bright chatter kept dan in a good humour which was a relief she had plenty of money and spent it lavishly every time she went out she bought beth something a piece of music she had mentioned a book she longed for materials for work besides flowers and fruit and sweets in unlimited quantities beth remonstrated but bertha begged beth not to deprive her of the one pleasure she had in life just then the pleasure of pleasing beth and of acknowledging what she never could repay but dearly appreciatedbeths sisterly sympathy her consistent kindness such sayings were tinged with sadness which made beth suspect that bertha had some secret sorrow but if so it was most carefully concealed for there was not a trace of it in her habitual manner she showed no physical delicacy either but then as she said herself she was picking up in such a wonderful way under the treatment she really began to feel that there was very little the matter with her dan managed to be at home a great deal to look after his patient and was most attentive to her he hired a brougham three times a week to do his rounds in that she might accompany him and so get the air without fatigue or risk of cold and he would have her to sit with him in the diningroom when he was smoking and rolled cigarettes for her or would spend the evening with her in the drawingroom listening to her playing and singing or playing bezique with her and seemingly well content although in private he sometimes said to beth it was all a beastly bore but he must go through with it as a duty since he had undertaken it it being his way to do a thing thoroughly if he did it at all whatever your hand finds to do do it with all your might he added piously if a things worth doing at all its worth doing well i always think that was his formula for the time being but beth judged him by his demeanour which was gay and not by his professions and did not pity him she was in excellent spirits herself for her writing was going well and it varied the monotony pleasantly for her to have bertha to talk to and walk play or sew with after her work berthas demonstrations of affection too were grateful to beth who had had so little love either bestowed upon her or required of her bertha had been in the house three months when one day her mother called and found beth alone dan and bertha having gone for a drive together mrs petterick had just returned from abroad where the whole family had been living most of the time that bertha had been with the maclures really mrs petterick said i dont know how to thank you for your kindness to my girl shes quite a different person i can see by her letters thanks to the good doctor before he took her in hand she was quite hysterical and had to lie down two or three times a day because she said she had no strength for anything but really three months is an abuse of hospitality and i think she should be coming home now oh no do let her stay a little longer if you can spare her beth pleaded it is so nice to have her here well it is good of you to say so said mrs petterick but it must be a great expense to you we werent well off ourselves at one time mr pettericks a selfmade man and i know that every additional mouth makes a difference but however you being proud i wont offend you by offering money in exchange for kindness which cant be repaid but shant be forgotten when mrs petterick had gone beth sat awhile staring into the fire she was somewhat stunned for dan had assured her that bertha was a paying patient and that it seemed had been a gratuitous lie she was roused at last by minna the parlourmaid please maam a lady wishes to see you minna said show her in beth answered listlessly but the next moment she stiffened with astonishment for the lady who entered was mrs kilroy of ilverthorpe i am afraid i have taken you by surprise mrs kilroy began rather nervously will you sit down beth said coldly you cannot wonder if i am surprised to see you this is the first visit you have paid me although we met directly after i came to slane some years ago you were kind and cordial on that occasion but the next time i saw youat that ballyou slighted me and after that you shunned me until i met you the other day at mrs carnes and then you seemed inclined to take me up again i do not understand such caprices and i do not like them it was not caprice mrs kilroy assured her i liked you very much the first time we met and i should have called immediately but when i asked for your address i was told that your husband was in charge of the lock hospital yes the hospital for the diseases of women beth said but what difference does that make it made me jump to the hasty conclusion that you approved of the degradation of your own sex said angelica the degradation of my own sex said beth bewildered what is a lock hospital angelica explained the whole horrible apparatus for the special degradation of women now perhaps you will understand what we felt about you angelica concludedwe who are loyal to our own sex and have a sense of justicewhen we thought you were content to live on the means your husband makes in such a shameful way an extraordinary look of relief came into beths face then it was not my faultnot because i was horrid she exclaimed all the slights were as nothing the moment she gathered that she had not deserved them angelica stared at her but it was not in beths nature to think long about herself only the full force of what she had just heard as it concerned others did not come to her for some seconds when it did she was overcome how could you suppose that i knew she gasped at last this is the first hint i have had of the loathsome business my husband talks to me aboutmany things that he had better not have mentionedbut about this he has never said a word then he must have suspected that you would disapprove said mrs kilroy disapprove beth ejaculated the whole thing makes me sick i ought to have been told before i married him i never would have spoken to a man in such a position had i known you did well to avoid me no said angelica i did ill and i feel humiliated for my own want of penetrationfor my hasty conclusion it was sir george galbraith who first made me suspect that you knew nothing about it and i would have come at once to make sure but we were just leaving the neighbourhood and we only returned yesterday ideala did not believe that you knew it either and she rated us all for the way we had treated you she has been in america ever since she met you at mrs carnes but she is coming home next week and has written to entreat me to ask you to meet her will you will you come and stay with me do and talk this over with us i can see that it has been a great shock to you i cannot answer you now said beth i must thinki must think what i had better do yes think it over said angelica then write and tell me when you will come only do come you will find yourself among friendscongenial friends i venture to prophesy when mrs kilroy had gone beth went to her bedroom and waited there for dan it was the only place where she could be sure of seeing him alone he dressed for dinner now that miss petterick was with them dan came in whistling hilariously he stopped short when he saw beths face whats up he asked mrs kilroy has been here i hope you thanked her for nothing im afraid i forgot to thank her at all beth said although she has put me under an obligation to her may i ask what the obligation is she told me frankly why no decent woman will associate with us it is not my fault after all it seems but yoursyou and your lock hospital it is against the anglosaxon spirit to admit panders into society oh she told you about that did she the meddling busybody he answered coolly i was afraid they would some of them damn them and i knew you would go into hysterics she didnt tell you the necessity for it i suppose nor the good it is doing but i will so just listen to me then youll see perhaps that i know more about it than these canting sentimentalists beth sitting in judgment on him set her mouth and listened in silence until he stopped in his own defence he gave her many revolting details couched in the coarsest language but then in the name of justice she exclaimed what means do you take to protect those poor unfortunate women from disease what do you do to the men who spread it what becomes of diseased men oh they marry i suppose anyhow that is not my business doctors cant be expected to preach morals sanitation is our business but arent morals closely connected with sanitation beth said and why if sanitation is your business do you take no radical measures with regard to this horrible disease why do you not have it reported never mind who gets it as scarlet fever smallpox and other diseasesall less disastrous to the general health of the communityare reported dan shrugged his shoulders its a deuced awkward thing for a man to be suspected of disease its a stigma and might spoil his prospects women are so cursedly prying nowadays theyve got wind of its being incurable and many a one wont marry a man if a suspicion of it attaches to him i see said beth the principles of the medical profession with regard to sanitation when women are in question seem to be peculiar i wish to heaven i had known them sooner she hid her face in her hands and suddenly burst into tears dan scowled well this is nice he exclaimed i have had a devilish hard days work and come in cheery as usual to do my best to make things pleasant for you and this is the reception i get youre a nice pill indeed he went off muttering into his dressingroom and slammed the door when he appeared in the drawingroom he found beth and bertha chatting together as usual and as during the rest of the evening he could detect no difference in beths manner he congratulated himself that she was going to accept the position as inevitable and say no more about it it was not beths way to return to a disagreeable subject once it had been discussed unless she meant to do something in the matter and dan conceived that there was nothing to be done in this instance he considered that he was not the sort of man it was safe for women to interfere with and he guessed she knew it he was mistaken however when he supposed that she had let the subject drop and was going to resign herself to an invidious position she was merely letting it lapse until she understood it it was all as new to her as it was horrifying and she required time to study both sides of the question her own sense of justice was too acute to let her accept at once the accusation that socalled civilised men who boast of their chivalrous protection of the weaker sex had imposed upon women a special public degradation while the most abandoned and culpable of their own sex were not only allowed to go unpunished but to spread vice and disease where they listed the iniquitous injustice and cruelty of it all made her sick and sorry for men and reluctant to believe it a few days after mrs kilroys visit mrs carne called on beth mrs carne always followed the county people to her they were a sacred set her faith in all they did was touching and sincere the stupidest remark of the stupidest county lady impressed her more than the most brilliant wit of a professional mans wife when she stayed at a countryhouse whatever the tone of it she felt like a shriven saint so uplifted was she by reverence for rank on finding therefore that some of the most influential ladies in the county were diffidently anxious to win beth into their set rather than prepared to admit her with confident patronage as mrs carne would have expected it was natural that she should revise her own opinion of beth and also seek to cultivate her acquaintance she called in the morning by way of being friendly but beth who was hard at work at the time did not feel grateful for the attention minna showed mrs carne straight into the diningroom where beth usually worked now that bertha was on the premises bertha happened to be out that morning and mrs carne surprised beth sitting alone at a table covered with books and papers and so the little woman is going to be a great one mrs carne exclaimed playfully well i was surprised to hear it i know i am not flattering to my own discernment when i say so but there i should never have supposed you were a genius you are such a quiet little mouse you know you dont give yourself away much if you will excuse the expression i always say what i think i hope you will not call me a genius again mrs carne beth said stiffly all exaggeration is distasteful to me and to me too my dear child mrs carne hastened to assure her blandly but i always say what i think you know beth fixed her eyes on the clock absently when dan came in to lunch that day he seemed pleased to hear that mrs carne had been what had she to say for herself he asked she said i always say what i think beth replied until it struck me that i always say what i think is a person who only thinks disagreeable things well i like her said dan and i always get on with her if shes going to show up friendly at last i hope you wont snub her we cant afford to make enemies according to your own account he concluded significantly what do you think of her miss petterick he added by way of giving a pleasanter turn to the conversation he and his patient always addressed each other with much formality beth asked him once in private why he was so stiff with bertha and he explained that he thought it wiser as a medical man not to be at all familiar formality helped to keep up his authority i have had no opportunity of thinking anything about her bertha rejoined she has never spoken to me i have heard her speak though and like her voice its so cooing she makes me think of a dove and i shouldnt be surprised to find said beth with cruel insight that like the dove she conceals a villainous disposition and murderous proclivities by charms of manner and a winning voice what are you going to do this afternoon bertha bertha glanced at dan i am going to read the moonstone out in the garden the whole afternoon she replied then you wont mind if i disappear till teatime said beth i want to do some work upstairs no i would rather be alone bertha answered frankly that books entrancing i shall go round on foot this afternoon for exercise dan announced as he left the room beth saw bertha settled on a seat in the garden and then retired to her secret chamber she had not yet come to any conclusion with regard to mrs kilroys invitation and she felt it was time she decided she took her sewing her accustomed aid to thought and sat down on a high chair near the window she always sat on a high chair that she might not be enervated by lolling that was one of her patient methods of selfdiscipline and while she meditated she did quantities of work for herself making mending remodelling that she might get all the wear possible out of her clothes and not add a penny she could help to those terrible debts the thought of which had weighed on her youth and threatened to crush all the spirit out of her ever since her marriage dan had never considered her too young to be worried from where she sat she could see bertha on a seat just below with the moonstone on her lap but bertha could not see her because of the curtain of creepers that covered the iron rail which formed a little balcony round the window besides it was supposed that that was a blank window it was the only one on that side of the house too and bertha had settled herself in that secluded corner of the garden precisely because she thought she could not be overlooked beth glanced at her from time to time mechanically but without thinking of her it struck her at last however that bertha had never opened her book which seemed odd after the special point she had made of being left alone to read it undisturbed then beth noticed that she seemed to be on the lookout as if she were expecting something or somebody and presently dan appeared walking quickly and with a furtive air as if he were afraid of being seen bertha flushed crimson and became all smiles as soon as she saw him beths work dropped on her lap she clasped her hands on it her own face flushed and her breath became laboured dan after carefully satisfying himself that there was nobody about sat down beside bertha put his arm round her waist and kissed her she giggled and made a feeble feint of protesting then he took a jewelcase from his pocket opened it and held it out to her admiring gaze it contained a handsome gold bracelet which he presently clasped on her arm she expressed her gratitude by lifting up her face to be kissed then he put his arm round her again and she sat with her head on his shoulder and they began to talk but the conversation was interrupted by frequent kisses beth had seen enough she turned her back to the window and sat quite still with her hands clasped before her it was her first experience of that parasite the girl who fastens herself on a married woman accepts all that she can get from her in the way of hospitality and kindness and treacherously repays her by taking her husband for a lover beth pitied bertha but with royal contempt it all seemed so sordid and despicable jealous she was not jealousy is a want of faith in ones self she had said to berthas mother once and now in the face of this provocation she was of the same mind she had no words to express her scorn for a man who is false to his obligations nor for the petty frauds and deceits which had made the position of those two tenable as for dan he was beneath contempt buti shall succeed the words sprang to her lips triumphantly let him wallow with his own kind in congenial mire as much as he likes no wonder he suspects me but ii shall succeed meanwhile down in the garden dan was gurgling to bertha what should i do without you darling life wasnt worth having till i knew you i wont say a word against beth she has her good points as you know and i believe she means well but shes spoilt my life and my career too im one that requires a lot of sympathy but she never shows me any she thinks of nobody but herself her own mother always said so and after all ive done for her too if only you knew but of course i cant blow my own trumpet theyre all alike in that family though her mother used to keep me playing cards till i was ruined and beth has no gratitude and you cant trust her she comes of a lying lot and im of the same mind as my old father who used to say hed rather have a thief any day than a liar you can watch a thief but you cant watch a liar still dan bertha murmured i somehow think you ought to stick to her so i would said dan no one can accuse me of not sticking to my duty im an honourable man it was she who cast me off im nothing to her and i should have been brokenhearted but for you bertha i should indeed dans fine eyes filled with tears which bertha tenderly wiped away of course it makes a great difference her having cast you off bertha conceded after a little interlude it makes all the difference dan rejoined she set me at liberty and you are free too so who have we to consider but ourselves i admire a woman who has the pluck to be free he added enthusiastically then why dont you encourage beth more to go her own way bertha reasonably demanded shes always yearning for a career dan hesitated because ive been a fool i think he said at last ill encourage her now though it would be a great blessing to us if she could get started as a writer i see that now shed think of nothing else and it would be a blessing to her too he added feelingly thats what i like about you dan bertha observed you always make every allowance for her and consider her interests although she has treated you badly dan pressed her hand to his lips ill do what i can for her you may be sure he said quite melted by his own magnanimity i wish i could do more but shes been extravagant and my means are dreadfully crippled then why do you buy me such handsome presents you naughty man bertha playfully demanded holding up her arm with the bracelet on it i must have a holiday sometimes he rejoined besides i happen to be expecting a handsome cheque an unusual occurrence by any post now beths dividends were due that day just as dinner was announced beth swept into the drawingroom in the best evening dress she had a diaphonous black set off by turquoise velvet a combination which threw the beautiful milkwhite of her skin into delicate relief there was a faint flush on her face on her forehead and neck the tendrils of her soft brown hair seemed to have taken on an extra crispness of curl and her eyes were sparkling she had never looked better bertha petterick in her common handsomeness was as a barmaid accustomed to beer beside a gentlewoman of exceptional refinement she wore the showy bracelet dan had given her that afternoon and it shone conspicuous in its tawdry newness on her arm her dress was tasteless too and badly put on and altogether she contrasted unfavourably with beth and dan observed it are you expecting any one in particular tonight he asked no beth answered smiling i dressed for my own benefit nothing moves me to selfsatisfaction like a nice dress i have not enjoyed the pleasure much since i married but i am going to begin now and have a good time she turned as she spoke and led the way to the diningroom alone dr maclure absently offered his arm to miss petterick he was puzzled to know what this sudden fit of selfassertion combined with an unaccountable burst of high spirits on beths part might portend to conceal a certain uneasiness he became extra facetious not to say coarse there was a public ball coming off in a few days and he persisted in speaking of it as the dairy show dont you begin to feel excited about it i do miss petterick said to beth i wish it were tonight i am indifferent beth answered blandly because i am not going not going dan exclaimed then whos to chaperon me i should scarcely suppose beth answered looking at him meditatively that you are in the stage of innocence which makes a chaperon necessary bertha how you are loving that new bracelet youve done nothing but fidget with it ever since we sat down ah bertha answered archly you want to know where i got it madam curious well ill tell you it was sent me only todayby my young man dan looked at his plate complacently but presently beth saw a glance of intelligence flash between thema glance such as she had often seen them exchange before but had not understood and she was thankful that she had notthankful that she had been able to live so long with dr maclure without entertaining a single suspicion without thinking one low thought about him it was a hopeful triumph of cultivated nicemindedness over the most evil communications when they were at dessert the postmans knock resounded sharply dr maclure who had been anxiously listening for it and was peeling a pear for miss petterick at the moment waited with the pear and the knife upheld in his hands watching the door till the servant entered she brought a letter on a salver and was taking it to her master when beth said authoritatively that letter is for me minna bring it here the girl obeyed dan put down the knife and the pear whats yours is mine i thought he observed with a sorry affectation of cheeriness not on this occasion beth answered quietly taking up the letter and opening it as she spoke this happens to be peculiarly my own why its a cheque he rejoined with an affectation of surprise what luck i havent been able to sleep for nights thinking of the butchers bill for shame beth said banteringtalking about bills before your guest but since you introduced the subject i may add that the butcher must wait i want this myself i am going to stay with mrs kilroy at ilverthorpe on wednesday and it will just cover my expenses this is the first i have heard of the visit dan ejaculated i only decided to go this afternoon beth replied you decided without consulting me wellim damned if you shall go i shall not allow it the word allow is obsolete in the matrimonial dictionary friend daniel beth rejoined goodhumouredly but you are bound to obey me and im ready to obey you when you endow me with all your worldly goods she said then suddenly dropping her bantering tone she spoke decidedly i am going to stay with mrs kilroy on wednesday understand that at once and do not let us have any vulgar dispute about it but you cant leave miss petterick here alone with me he remonstrated no but she can go home beth answered coolly her mother wants her you know and i have written to tell her to expect her tomorrow now if you please we will end the discussion she put the letter in her pocket and began to crack nuts and eat them but dan could not keep away from the subject gad he ejaculated i thought theyd get hold of you that lot and flatter you and make a convenience of youthats what they do i know them they think youre cleverhow easy it is to be mistaken but youll see for yourself in time and then youll believe mewhen its too late for then youll have got your name mixed up with them and youll not get over that i can tell youthey are well known for a nice lot your mrs kilroy was notorious before she married she was angelica hamiltonwells and she and her brother were called the heavenly twins they are grandchildren of that blackguard old duke of morningquest nobody ever speaks of any of the family with the slightest respect its well known that miss hamiltonwells asked old kilroy to marry her and when a girl has to do that you may guess what she is but they are all besmirched that lot dan concluded with his most highminded manner on i never believe anything i hear against anybody said beth unconsciously quoting ideala so please spare me the recital of all invidious stories youll only believe what suits yourself i know he said and ive no doubt youll enjoy yourself galbraith will be there and mr theodore hamiltonwells the fairhaired diavolo who will suit your book exactly i should think i beg your pardon said beth politely dan poured himself out another glass of wine and said no more he and bertha managed to have a moments conversation together before they retired that night what does it mean bertha anxiously demanded does she suspect anything god knows dan said piously then added after a moments consideration how the devil can she weve played our cards too well for that no shes just bent on making mischief thats the kind of pill she is if she keeps that money it will be downright robbery but now you see what i have to put up with and you can judge for yourself if i deserve it when he went to beth however he assumed a very different tone he entered the room with an air of deep dejection and found her sitting beside her dressingtable in a white wrapper reading quietly she smiled when she saw his pose it was what she had expected i cant do without that money beth on my word he began plaintively ive been reckoning on it i wouldnt take it from you god knows if i could help it but im sore pressed he took out his handkerchief and wiped his eyes imagining that he still had to deal with the gentle sensitive girl upon whom he had imposed so long and so successfully beth watched him a moment with contempt and then she laughed it is no use friend daniel she said in her neat incisive straightforward way i am not going to take you seriously any more i am neither to be melted by your convenient tears nor dismayed by your bogey bills i have never seen any of those bills by the way the next time you mention them please produce them let us be businesslike and in the meantime just understand once for all like a good man that i am not going to be domineered over by you as if i were a common degraded wife with every spark of spirit and selfrespect crushed out of me by one brutal exaction or another i shall do my dutydo my best to meet your reasonable wishes but i will submit to no ordering and no sort of exaction she rose and faced him and as we are coming to an understanding she pursued just explain why did you tell me that miss petterick was to be a paying patient i never told you anything of the kind said dan losing his head and lying stupidly in his astonishment beth shrugged her shoulders it is your own business she rejoinedat least it is you who will have to pay for her entertainment she returned to her book as she spoke and continued to read with apparent calmness now that she had taken up her position she found herself quite strong enough to hold it against any dan maclure or bertha petterick but beth was being forced into an ugly and vulgar phase and she knew and resented it and was filled with dismay she was taking on something of the colour of her surroundings involuntarily inevitably as certain insects do in selfdefence she had spoken to dan in his own tone in order to make him understand her but was it necessary surely if she had resisted the impulse to try that weapon she might have found another as effective the use of which would not have compromised her gentlehood and lessened her selfesteem her dissatisfaction with herself for the part she had played was a cruel ache and she thanked heaven for the chance which would mercifully remove her from that evil atmosphere for a while and prayed for time to reflect for strength to be her better self she was angry with herself and grieved because she had fought dan with his own weapons and it did not occur to her for her comfort that she had only done so because he was invulnerable to that which she would naturally have usedearnest reasonable calm discussionand that fight him she must with something somehow or sink for ever down to the degraded level required of their wives by husbands of his way of thinking chapter xliv ilverthorpe was at the other side of the county and beth had to go from slane to morningquest by train in order to get there dan continued to be disagreeable in private about her going but he took her to the station and saw her off so that the public might know what an admirable husband he was on his way from the station he met sir george galbraith and greeted him with effusion i hope you were coming to see us he said for that would show that you dont forget our humble existence but my wife isnt at home i am sorry to say she has just gone to stay with mrs kilroy sir george looked keenly at him i hope she is quite well he said formally not too well dan answered lugubriously and that is why i encouraged her to go the fact is sir george i think ive been making a mistake with beth my mother was my perfection of a woman she didnt care much for books but she had good sound commonsense and she attended to her husband and her household and preferred to stay at home and i confess i wanted my wife to be like her especially i wanted to keep her pureminded and unsuspicious of evil and that she could not remain if she got drawn into mrs kilroys set and mixed up with the questions about which women are now agitating themselves i know youre with them and not with me in the matter but youll allow for my point of view well with regard to beth i find ive made a mistake i should have let her follow her own bent see for herself and become a woman of the day if shes so minded as it is she is growing morbid for want of an outlet and hanging back herself and it is i who have to urge her on its an heroic operation so far as im concerned for the whole thing is distasteful to me but i shall go through with it and let her be as independent as she likes this sounds like selfsacrifice said sir george i sincerely hope it may answer we are going different ways i think goodmorning he raised his hand to his hat in a perfunctory way and hurried off the next time he saw mrs kilroy he described this encounter with dr maclure this is a complete change of front said angelica what does it mean when a man of that kind tells his wife to make the most of her life in her own way and be independent he means dont bother me another woman is the delight of my senses when he says to the other woman be free he means throw yourself into my arms angelica sighed poor beth she said what a fate to be tied to that plausible hog from having been so much shut up in herself beth showed very little of the contrasts of her temperament on the surfaceher joy in life her moments of exaltation of devotion of confidence of harshness of tenderness her awful fits of depression her doubts her fears her selfdistrust her gusts of passion and the disconnected impulses wedged into the welldisciplined routine of a consistent life ordered for the most part by principle reason and reflection few people meeting her casually would have suspected any contrasts at all and even of those who knew her best only one now and then appreciated the rate at which the busy mind was working and the changes wrought by the growth which was continually in progress beneath her equable demeanour those about her for want of discernment expected nothing of her and suffered shocks of surprise in consequence which they resented blaming her for their own defects but it was of much more importance to beth that she should be able to pass on with ease from one thing to another than that she should have the approval of people who would have had her stay where they found her not for her benefit but for their own convenience in classifying her beth made steppingstones of her knowledge of other people rather than of her own dead self she picked to pieces the griefs they brought upon her dissected them and moralised upon them and in so doing forgot the personal application while in the midst of what might have been her own life tragedy she compared herself with those who had been through theirs and did not seem a bit the worse or the better which observation stimulated her fortitude when she contemplated the march of events that mighty army of atoms any one of which may be in command of us for a time none remaining so for ever under healthy conditions she perceived that life is lived in detail not in the abstract the kind of thing that makes the backbone of a threevolume novel is but a phase or an incident everything is but an incident with all of us a heartbreak today a recollection tomorrow a source of encouragement and of inspiration eventually perhaps the which if some would remember there would be less despair and fewer suicides the recognition of this fact had helped beths sense of proportion and was making her philosophical she believed that life could be lived so as to make the joys as inevitable as the sorrows we are apt to cultivate our sense of pleasure less than our sense of suffering by appreciating small pleasures little while heeding small pains excessively beths deliberate intention as well as her natural impulse was to reverse this in her own case as much as possible she would not let her physical sense of wellbeing on a fine morning and her intellectual delight in a good mood for work be spoilt because of some trouble of the night before the trouble she would set aside so that it might not detract from the pleasure but fine mornings and good moods for work had not come to her aid since she discovered the mean treachery of dan and bertha and when she left slane she was still oppressed by the sense of their hypocrisy and deceit as the train bore her swiftly away from them both however her spirits rose the sun shone the country looked lovely in its autumn bravery of tint and tone she felt well and the contemplation of such people as dan and bertha was not elevating they must out of her mind like any other unholy thought that she might be worthy to associate with the loyal ladies and noble gentlemen whose hands were outheld to help her the people we cling to are those with whom we find ourselves most at home it is not the people who amuse us that we like best but those who stir our deeper emotions rouse in us possibilities of generous feeling which lie latent for the most part and give form to our higher aspirations and beth anticipated with a happy heart that it was with such she was bound to abide mrs kilroy met her at the station at morningquest what a bonny thing you are she exclaimed in her queer abrupt way i didnt realise it till i saw you walking up the platform towards me theres a cart to take your luggage to ilverthorpe do you mind coming to lunch with mrs orton beg she has a dear little house in the close and we thought you might like to see the cathedral heres the carriage no you get in first but does mrs orton beg want me beth asked when they were seated we all want you said mrs kilroy if you will forgive our first mistake with regard to you and come out of yourself and be one of us and youll be specially fond of mrs orton beg when you know her i fancy shes just sweet she used to hate our works and ways and be very conventional but edith beales marriage opened her eyes she would never have believed that men countenanced such an iniquity had she not seen it herself the first effect of the shock was to narrow her judgment and make her severe on men generally but she will get over that in time man like woman is too big a subject to generalise about he has his faults you know but he must be educated that is all he wants he must be taught to have a better opinion of himself at present he wallows because he thinks he cant keep out of the mire but of course he can when he learns how hes not a bit worse than woman naturally only he has a lower opinion of himself and that keeps him down with his training we shouldnt be a bit better than he is in all things that concern men and women you dear you will find that when they start fair one is not a bit better or worse than the other here we are mrs orton beg came into the hall to greet her guest she was a slender elegant middleaged woman in graceful black draperies with hair prematurely grey and a face that had always been interesting but never handsomea refined intellectual but not strong face the face of a patient selfcontained longenduring person of settled purpose slowly arrived at and then not easily shaken she welcomed beth cordially and placed her at table so that she might look out at the old grey cathedral it was the first time beth had seen it and she could have lost herself in the sensation of realising its traditions its beauty and its age but the conversation went on briskly and she had to take her part lady fulda guthrie an aunt of mrs kilroys was the only other guest she was a beautiful saint with a soul which had already progressed as far as the most spiritual part of catholicism could take it and she could get no farther in this incarnation i hope you are prepared to discuss any and every thing mrs maclure mrs orton beg warned beth for that is what you will find yourself called upon to do among us the peculiarity of man is that he will do the most atrocious things without compunction but would be shocked if he were called upon to discuss them do what you like is his principle but dont mention it people form their opinions in discussion and opinions are apt to be adverse our principle is very much the opposite i have just begun to know the necessity for open discussion beth answered tranquilly i do not see how we can arrive at happiness in life if we do not try to discover the sources of misery i know of nothing that earnest men and women should hesitate to discuss openly on proper occasions oh im thankful to hear you say men and women angelica broke in that is the right new spirit let us help one another any attempt to separate the interests of the sexes as women here and there and men generally would have them separated is fatal to the welfare of the whole race the efforts of foolish people to divide the interests of men and women make me writheas if we were not utterly bound up in one another and destined to rise or fall together but this woman movement is towards the perfecting of life not towards the disruption of it i asked a sympathetic woman the other day why she took no part in it and she answered profoundly because i am a part of it and i am sure she was right i am sure it is evolutionary it is an effort of the race to raise itself a step higher in the scale of being for see what it resolves itself into men respond to what women expect of them when warriors were the womens ideal men were warriors when women preferred knights priests or troubadours a mans ambition was to be a knight priest or troubadour when women thought drunkenness fine men were drunken now women want husbands of a nobler nature strong in all the attributes moral and physical of the perfect man that their children may be noble too and thus the ascent of man to higher planes of being become assured great is the power of thought said lady fulda by thinking these things the race is evolving them thought married to suggestion is a creative force if the race believed it would have wings in the course of ages wings would come of the faith and discussion is not enough beth resumed we should experiment it is very well to hold opinions and set up theories but opinions and theories are alike valueless until they are tested by experiment i see you are a true radical said mrs orton beg you would go to the root of the matter oh yes i am a radical in that sense of the word beth answered i have a horror of conservatism nothing is stationary all things are always in a state of growth or decay and conservatism is a state of decay yes said angelica that is very true especially as applied to womenif they are ever to advance then dont you think they are advancing beth asked yes said angelica but not as much as they might when you mix more with them in the way of work you will be disheartened women are their own worst enemies just now they dont follow their leaders loyally and consistently they have little idea of discipline their tendency is to go off on side issues and break up into little cliques they are largely actuated by petty personal motives by petty jealousies by pettinesses of all kinds one amongst them will arise here and there and do something great that is an honour to them all but they do not honour her for itperhaps because something in the way she dresses or some trick of manner does not meet with the approval of the majority women are for ever stumbling over trifling details to prove themselves right pleases them better than to arrive at the truth and a vulgar personal triumph is of more moment than the triumph of a great cause in these things they are practically not a bit better than men they seem worse in fact because we expect so much more of them in the way of loyalty and disinterestedness said mrs orton beg and their power is so much greater too in social matters when they misuse it they do much more harm this will not always be so of course as their minds expand they will see and understand better at present they do not know enough to appreciate their own deficienciesthey do not measure the weakness of their vacillations by comparing it with the steady strength of purpose that prevails and for want of comprehension they aim their silly animadversions today at some one whose work they are glad enough to profit by tomorrow they make the task of a benefactress so hard that they kill her and then they give her a public funeral i pity them oh do not be hasty said lady fulda human beings are not like packs of cards to be shuffled into different combinations at will and nobody the worse there are feelings to be considered the old sores must be tenderly touched even by those who would heal them and when we uproot we must be careful to replant under more favourable conditions when we demolish we should be prepared to rebuild or no comfort will come of the changes these things take time and are best done deliberately and even then the most cautious make their mistakes but still i believe that the force which is carrying us along is the force that makes for righteousness we women have in our minds now what will culminate in the recognition by future generations of the beauty of goodness woman is to be the mother of god in man beths heart swelled at the words this attitude was new to her and yet all that was said she seemed to have heard before and known from the first and she knew more also away back in that region beyond time and space to which she had access and where she found herself at happy moments transported by an impulse outside herself which she could not control by any effort of will that day with those new friends she felt like one who returns to a happy home after weary wanderings and is warmly welcomed a great calm settled upon her spirit she said little the whole time but sat sure of their sympathetic tolerance and listened to them with that living light of interest in her eyes to which the heart responds with confidence more surely than to any spoken word the evil influences which had held her tense at slane had no power to trouble her here she was high enough above dan and bertha to look down upon them dispassionately knowing them for what they were yet personally unaffected by their turpitude it was as if she had heard of some bad deed and knew it to be repulsive a thing intolerable meriting punishment yet because it did not concern her it had lapsed from her thoughts like a casual paragraph read in a paper which had not brought home to her any realisation of what it recorded during the afternoon her mind was stored with serene impressionsservice in the venerable cathedral the fluting of an anthem by a boy with a birdlike voice some strong words from the pulpit not on the dry bones of doctrine nor the doings of a barbarous people led by a vengeful demon of perplexing attributes whom they worshipped as a deity but on the conduct of lifea vital subject then as they drove through the beautiful old city there came impressions of grey and green grey gateways ancient buildings ivy and old trees and over all sounding slow calm and significant the marvellous chime the message which morningquest heard hourly year by year and heeded no more than it heeded death at a distance or political complications in peru the same party met again at ilverthorpe but there were others there as wellideala mrs kilroys father and mother mr and lady adeline hamiltonwells and lady galbraith but not sir george in the drawingroom after dinner beth was intent upon a portfolio of drawings and ideala seeing her alone went up to her are you fond of pictures she said to beth yes that is just the word beth answered i am so fond of them that even such a collection as this which shows great industry rather than great art i find full of interest and delight in happy for me perhaps that i dont know anything about technique subject appeals to my imagination as it used to do when i was a child and loved to linger over the pictures on oldfashioned pieces of music those pictures lure me still with strange sensations such as no others make me feel i wish i could realise now as vividly as i realised then the beauty of that lovely lady on the song and the whole pathetic storythe gem that decked her queenly brow and bound her raven hair remained a sad memorial of blighted loves despair and that other young creature who wore a wreath of roses on the night when first we met and the one who related that we met twas in a crowd and i thought he would shun me he came i could not breathe for his eye was upon me and concluded that twas thou that had caused me this anguish my mother there was the gallant corsair too just stepping out of a boat waving his hat his curly hair open shirt collar and black tie with flying ends remain in my mind intimately associated with byron young love some who never smiled again the sapphire night crisp clear cold thickstrewn with stars all sparkling with frosty brightnessimpressions i would not exchange for art understood or anything i am capable of feeling now before the greatest work of art in the worldso strangely am i blunted what already ideala said compassionately but that is only a phase you will come out of it and be young again and feel strongly which is better than knowing i concede the truest appreciation of a work of art does not take place in the head but in the heart not in thinking but in feeling when we stand before a picture it is not by the thoughts formulated in the mind but by the appreciation which suffuses our whole being with pleasure that we should estimate it but isnt that a sensuous attitude beth objected yes of the right kind ideala rejoined the senses have their uses you know and it is exactly your attitude as a child towards the pictures on the songs you felt it allall the full significancelong before you knew it so that you could render it into words and felt more probably than you will ever be able to express feeling is the first stage of fine thought mr hamiltonwells strolled towards them he was a rather tall exceedingly thin man with straight thick greybrown hair parted in the middle and plastered down on either side of his head he was dressed in black velvet his long thin white hands were bedecked with handsome antique rings art treasures in their way one intaglio carved in red coral caught the eye especially on the first finger of his right hand as he talked he had a trick of shaking his hands back with a gesture that suggested lace ruffles getting in the way and in his whole appearance and demeanour there was something that recalled the days when velvet and lace were in vogue for gentlemen he spoke with great preciseness and it was not always possible to be sure that he at all appreciated the effect of the extraordinary remarks he was in the habit of making which apparent obliviousness enabled him to discourse about many things without offence which other people were obliged to leave unmentioned nowadays when i see two ladies together in a corner talking earnestly he observed i always suspect that they are discussing the sex question oh the sex question ideala exclaimed i am sick of sex sex is a thing to be endured or enjoyed not to be discussed indeed said mr hamiltonwells nodding slowly as if in profound consideration and shaking back his imaginary ruffles is that your opinion mrs maclure i keep a separate compartment in my mind for the sex question beth answered colouringa compartment which has to be artificially lighted there is no ray of myself that would naturally penetrate to it when i take up a book and find that it is nothing but she was beautiful he loved her i put it down again with a groan the monotony of the subject palls upon me it is the stockintrade of every author as if there were nothing of interest in the lives of men and women but their sexual relations indeed yes said mr hamiltonwells with bland deliberation but society thinks of nothing else blatant sexuality is the predominant characteristic of the upper classes and the rage for the sexual passion is principally set up and fostered by a literature inflated with sexuality and by costumes which seem to be designed for the purpose in the evening now just think even quite elderly ladies with a laudable desire to please offer themselves in evening dressand a very great deal of themselves sometimesto the eye that may be attracted when he had spoken he shook back his imaginary ruffles brought his hands together in front of him with the fingers tip to tip in a pious attitude and strolled up the long room slowly shaking his head at intervals with an intent expression as if he were praying for society what a bomb beth gasped is he always so generally ideala rejoined and i can never make out whether he means well but is stupid and tactless or whether he delights to spring such explosives on inoffensive people he sits on a board of guardians composed of ladies and gentlemen and the other day at one of their meetings he proposed to remove the stigma attaching to illegitimacy he said that illegitimacy cannot justly be held to reflect on anybodys conduct since so he had always understood illegitimacy was birth from natural causes and what happened ideala slightly shrugged her shoulders the proposition was seriously discussed and a parson and one or two other members of the board threatened to retire if he remained on it but remain he did and let them retire and i cannot help fancying that his whole object was to get them to go sometimes i think that he must have a peculiar sense of humour which it gives him great gratification to indulge as others do good by stealth he makes questionable jests for himself only and enjoys them alone but apart from this eccentricity he is a kind and generous man always ready to help with time and money when there is any good to be done when beth went to her room that night she experienced a strange sense of satisfaction which she could not account for until she found herself alone with no fear of being disturbed it seemed to her then that she had never before known what comfort was never slept in such a delightful bed so fresh and cool and sweet she was like one who has been bathed and perfumed after the defilements of a long dusty journey and is able to rest in peace as she stretched herself between the sheets she experienced a blessed sensation of relief which was a revelation to her until that moment she had never quite realised the awful oppression of her married life the inevitable degradation of intimate association with such a man as her husband the next day the ladies went out to sit on the lawn together in the shade of the trees with their books and work there were no sounds but such as in the country seem to accentuate the quiet and are aids not to thought but to that higher faculty which awakes in the silence and is to thought what the mechanical instrument is to the voice how heavenly still it is beth ejaculated it stirs mefills mehow shall i express itmakes me cognisant in some sortconscious of things i dont knowthings beyond all this and even better worth our attention the stillness here in these surroundings has the same benign effect on me that perfect solitude has elsewhere what a luxury it is thoughsolitude i mean the privilege of being alone when one feels the necessity i am fortunate however she added quickly lest she should seem to be making a personal complaint in that i have a secret chamber all to myself and so high up that i can almost hear what the wind whispers to the stars to make them twinkle i go there when i want to be alone to think my thoughts and no one disturbs menot even my nearest neighbours the angels though if they did sometimes i should not complain they come closer than you think perhaps said lady fulda who had just strolled up with a great bunch of lilies on her arm consider the lilies she went on holding them out to beth look into them think about them no though do not think about themfeel there is purification in the sensation of their beauty is purification always possible beth said can evil ever be cast out once it has taken root in the mind are you speaking of thoughts or acts i wonder lady fulda rejoined sitting down beside beth and looking dreamily into her flowers you know what we hold here that no false step is irretrievable so long as we desire what is perfectly right it is not the things we know of nor even the things we have done if the act is not habitualbut the things we approve of that brand us as bad the woman whose principles are formed out of a knowledge of good and evil is better is more to be relied upon than the woman who does not know enough to choose between them it is not what the body does but what the mind thinks that corrupts us but from certain deeds evil thoughts are inseparable beth sighed and surely toleration of evil comes from undue familiarity with it yes if you do not keep your condemnation side by side with your knowledge of it lady fulda agreed the night before she returned to slane beth attended a meeting of the new order which ideala had founded it was the first thing of the kind she had been to and she was much interested in the proceedings only women were present beth was one of a semicircle of ladies who sat on the platform behind the chair there were subjects of grave social importance under discussion and most of the speaking was exceedingly good wise temperate and certainly not wanting in humour towards the end of the evening there was an awkward pause because a lady who was to have spoken had not arrived mrs kilroy who was in the chair looked round for some one to fill the gap and caught beths eye may i speak beth whispered eagerly leaning over to her i have something to say angelica nodded gave the audience beths name and then leant back in her chair the shorthand writers looked up indifferently not expecting to hear anything worth recording beth went forward to the edge of the platform with a look of intentness on her delicate face and utterly oblivious of herself or anything else but her subject she never thought of asking herself if she could speak all she considered was what she was going to say she clasped her slender hands in front of her and began slowly with the formula she had heard the other speakers use madam chairman ladies she paused then suddenly spoke out on the desecration of marriage at the first resonant notes of her clear dispassionate voice there was a movement of interest a kind of awakening in the hall and the ladies on the platform behind her who had been whispering to each other writing notes and passing them about and paying more attention to the business of the meeting generally than to the speakers paused and looked up suddenly ideala with kindling eyes leant over to mrs orton beg grasped her arm and said something eagerly mrs orton beg nodded the word went round beth held the hall and was still rising from point to point carrying the audience with her to a pitch of excitement which finally culminated in a great burst of applause beth taken aback stopped short surprised and bewildered by the racket looked about her faltered a few more words and then sat down abruptly the applause was renewed and prolonged what does it mean beth asked ideala in an agony did i say something absurd my dear child ideala answered laughing they are not jeering but cheering is that cheering beth exclaimed in an awestricken tone overcome to find she had produced such an effect i feared they meant to be derisive i didnt know you were a speaker mrs orton beg whispered i am not beth answered apologetically i never spoke before nor heard any one else speak till tonight only i have thought and thought about these things and i could not keep it back what i had to say that is the stuff an orator is made of some strange lady muttered approvingly chapter xlv when beth returned to slane dan received her so joyously she wondered what particularly successful piece of turpitude he had been busy about he was always effusive to her when evil things went well with him at first she had supposed that this effusiveness was the outcome of affection for her but when she began to know him she perceived that it was only the expression of some personal gratification he had been quite demonstrative in his attentions to her during the time that bertha petterick stayed in the house by the way there is a letter for you he said when they were at lunch is there beth answered who from how the devil am i to know he rejoined glancing up at the mantelpiece i cant tell who your correspondents are by instinct beths eye followed his to the mantelpiece where she saw a large square envelope propped up against an ornament in a conspicuous position and recognised the unmistakable big clear firm hand of bertha petterick and the thick kind of paper she always used beth had been thinking about bertha on the way home she knew that if bertha had been as wrong in body as in mind and moral nature she would have had compassion on her and she had determined to tolerate her as it was to do what she could for her maimed soul just as she would have ministered to her had her malady been physical but dans hypocrisy about the letter ruffled her into opposition he knew berthas handwriting as well as she did and was doubtless equally well acquainted with the contents of the letter and this affectation of ignorance must therefore mean something special probably he was anxious to propitiate her with regard to whatever bertha might be writing about but beth was not to be managed in that way and so she let the letter be as she was leaving the room after lunch dan called after her you have forgotten your letter it doesnt matter beth answered any time will do for that the letter was left there for days unopened and it had the effect of stopping the conversation at meals for although dan did not allude to it again he constantly glanced at it and it was evident that he had it on his mind at last one day when he came in he said i have just seen mrs petterick and she tells me bertha wrote to you days ago and has had no answer indeed beth observed indifferently i shouldnt think she could have anything to say to me that specially required an answer dan fidgeted about a little then burst out suddenly why the devil dont you open the girls letter because you pretended you didnt know who it was from beth said i declare to god i never pretended anything of the kind dan answered hotly beth laughed then she went to the mantelpiece took down the letter turned it over and displayed the huge monogram and scroll with bertha printed on it with which it was bedizened laughed again a little and threw the letter unopened into the fire there she said let that be an end of the letter and bertha petterick too so far as i am concerned she bores me that girl i will not be bothered with her well well dan exclaimed pathetically looking hard at the ashes of the letter on the coals thats gratitude i do my best to make an honest living for you and you repay me by affronting one of my best patients and what the unfortunate girl has done to offend you the devil only knows im sure she would have blacked your boots for you when she was here she was so devoted she was pretty servile i grant that beth answered dispassionately but that is enough of bertha petterick please here is the butchers bill for the last month and the bakers the milk the wine the groceries all nearly doubled on berthas account if adding to your expenses in every way makes a good patient she was excellent certainly ill leave you the bills to console you but if you value your peace of mind dont dare to worry me about them you were quite right when you said i was too young to be troubled about money matters and i shall not let myself be troubledespecially when they are matters like these bills for which i am not responsible she was leaving the room as she spoke but stopped at the door and dan she added quoting his favourite phrase id be cheery if i were you theres nothing like being cheery why look at me i never let anything worry me she left dan speechless and went to her secret chamber where she sat and suffered for an hour blaming herself for her lightness her contrariness her want of dignity and all those faults which were the direct consequence of dans evil influence she was falling farther and farther away from her ideal in everything and knew it but seemed to have lost the power to save herself the degeneration had begun in small matters of discipline apparently unimportant but each one of consequence in reality as part of her system of selfcontrol from the moment we do a thing thinking it to be wrong we degenerate if it be a principle that we abandon it does not matter what the principle is our whole moral fibre is loosened by the gap it makes beth who had hitherto shunned easychairs as aunt victoria had taught her lest she should be enervated by lolling now began to take to them and so lost the strengthening effect of a wholesome effort other little observances too little regular habits which discipline mind and body to such good purpose slipped from hersuch as the care of her skin after the manner of the ladies of her family who had been renowned for their wonderful complexions this had been enjoined upon her by her mother in her early girlhood as a solemn duty and had entailed much selfdenial in matters of food and drink quantities being restricted and certain things prohibited at certain times while others were forbidden altogether she had had to exercise patience also in the concoction and use of delicately perfumed washes of tonic and emollient properties home distilled so as to be perfectly pure all of which had been strictly practised by her like sacred rites or superstitious observances upon the exact performance of which good fortune depends in such matters she now became lax and besides the care of her person she neglected the care of her clothes which had been so beneficial to her mind for it must be remembered that it was during those long hours of meditation while she sat sewing that her reading had been digested her knowledge assimilated her opinions formed and her random thoughts collected and arranged ready to be turned to account on an emergency until this time too she had kept sunday strictly as a day of rest books and work and all else that had occupied her during the week were put away on saturday night and not taken out again until monday morning and the consequence was complete mental relaxation but now she began to do all kinds of little things which she had hitherto thought it wrong to do on sunday so that the sanitary effect of the day of restor of change of occupation for sometimes sunday duties are arduouswas gradually lost and she no longer returned to her work on monday strengthened and refreshed little by little her good reading was also neglected and instead of relying upon her own resolution as had hitherto been her wont she began to seek the prop of an odd cup of tea or coffee at irregular hours to raise her spirits if she felt down or stimulate her if she were out of sorts and work was not easy all of which tended to weaken her will then by degrees she began to lose the balance of mind which had been wont to carry her on from one little daily doing to another with calm deliberation taking them each in turn without haste or rest and finding time for them all now the things that she did not care about she began to do with a rush so as to get to her writing she wanted to be always at that and the consequence was a wearing sensation as of one who is driven to death and has never time enough for any single thing but it was in these days nevertheless that she began to write with decision hitherto she had been merely trying her penfeeling her way but now she unconsciously ceased to follow in other peoples footsteps and struck out for herself boldly she had come back from ilverthorpe with a burning idea to be expressed and it was for the shortest crispest clearest way to express it that she tried foreign phrases she discarded and she never attempted to produce an eccentric effect by galvanising obsolete words rightly discarded for lack of vitality into a ghastly semblance of life her own language strong and pure she found a sufficient instrument for her purpose when the true impulse to write came her fine theories about style only hampered her so she cast them aside as habitual affectations are cast aside and natural emotions naturally expressed in moments of deep feeling and from that time forward she displayed what had doubtless been coming to her by practice all along a method and a manner of her own she produced a little book at this time the first thing of any real importance she had accomplished as yet and during the writing of it she enjoyed an interval of unalloyed happiness the most perfect that she had ever known the world without became as nothing to her it was the world within that signified the terrible sense of loneliness from which she had always suffered more or less was suspended and she began to wonder how it was she had ever felt so desolate that often in the streets of slane she would have been grateful to anybody who had spoken to her kindly now she said to herself sincerely never less alone than when alone and up in the quiet of her secret chamber with the serene blue above the green earth and the whispering trees below and all her little treasures about her the books the pictures the pretty hangings and little ornaments for flowers things she had indulged in by degrees since her mothers death had left her with the money in her hands which she had made to discharge dans debtup there at her ease in that peaceful shrine secure from intrusion there is no joy but calm was her constant ejaculation then again too she felt to perfection the fine wonder the fine glow of a great inspiration and realised anew that therein all the pleasures of the senses added together are contained that inspiration in its higher manifestations is like lovethat it is love in factlove without the lover there being all the joy of love in it but none of the trouble but like most young writers when they set up a high ideal for themselves and are striving conscientiously to arrive at it because the thing came easily she fancied she had not done her best and was dissatisfied she talked to herself about fatal facility without reflecting that in time ease comes by practice nor did she discriminate between the flow of cheap ideas pumped up from any source for the occasion which satisfies the conceit of shallow workers and the deep stream that bubbles up of itself when it is once released and flows freely from the convictions the observations and the knowledge of an earnest thinker diffidence is a help to some but to beth it was a hindrance a source of weakness there was no fear of her taking herself for a heavenborn genius her trouble had always been her doubt of the merit of anything she did she should have been encouraged but instead she had always been repressed accordingly when she had finished her little masterpiece she put it away with the idea of rewriting it and making something of it when she should be able and then she began a much more pretentious work and thought it must be better because of the trouble it gave her gradually from now she gave up all her time to reading and writing and she overdid it work in excess is as much a vice as idleness and it was particularly bad for beth whose constitution had begun to be undermined by dutiful submission the consulting rooms of specialists are full of such cases there are marriages which for the ignorant girl preached into dutiful submission whose innocence has been carefully preserved for the purpose mean prostitution as absolute as repugnant as cruel and as contrary to nature as that of the streets beths marriage was one of those until she went to ilverthorpe she had never heard that there was a duty she owed to herself as well as to her husband and as sir george galbraith had said her brain was too delicately poised for the life she had been leading work had been her opiate but unfortunately she did not understand the symptoms which should have warned her that she was overdoing it and her nerves became exceedingly irritable noises which she had never noticed in her life before began to worry her to death very often when she was spoken to she could hardly answer civilly at meals everything that was handed to her was just the very thing she did not want she quarrelled with all her food drank quantities of strong coffee for the sake of the momentary exhilaration and even tried wine but as it only made her feel worse she gave that up writing became a rage with her and the more she had to force herself the longer she sat at it she would spend hours over one sentence turning it and twisting it and never be satisfied and when she was at last obliged to stop and go downstairs lest she should be missed she went with her brain congested and her complexion which was naturally pale and transparent all flushed or blotched with streaks of crimson whats the matter with your face dan said to her one day apt as usual to comment offensively on anything wrong i should like you to tell me beth answered youd better take some citrate of iron and quinine youve prescribed citrate of iron and quinine for everything ive ever had since i knew you said beth if i have any more of it i shall be like the man in the quack advertisement who felt he could conscientiously recommend a tonic because he had taken it for fourteen years i should like something that would act a little quicker dan left the room and banged the door that afternoon beth up in her shrine at work suddenly began to wonder what he was doing as a rule she did not trouble herself about his pursuits but now all at once she became anxious the thought of all the unholy places that he might be at and the unfortunate girl knew all about all of them for there was no horror of life with which her husband had not made her acquainted filled her with dreadwith a sensation entirely new to her and absolutely foreign to her normal nature her feeling for dan and bertha when she discovered their treachery had been one of contempt their disloyalty and the petty mean deceits which it entailed made it difficult to tolerate their presence and she was always glad to get rid of them wherever they might go now however she was seized upon with a kind of rage at the recollection of their intrigue of the scene in the garden the glances she had intercepted their stolen interviews clandestine correspondence and impudent security it was all retrospective this feeling but the torment of it was none the less acute for that she recalled the scene in the garden and her heart throbbed with anger she regretted her own temperate conduct and imagined herself stealing out upon them standing before them and pouring forth floods of invective till they cowered she wished she had refused to let bertha enter the house again and had threatened to expose dan if he did not meekly submit to her dictation she ought to have exposed him too she should have gone to berthas mother but where was dan at that moment she jumped up rushed down to her room put on her outdoor things in hot haste and ran downstairs determined to go and see but as she entered the hall at one end of it dan himself came in by the halldoor at the other the relief was extraordinary hallo where are you off to he said just going for a little walk she answered speaking ungraciously and without looking at him now that she saw him her ordinary feeling for him returned but instead of being quiet and indifferent as usual she found herself showing in her manner something of the contempt she felt and it pleased her to do it she was glad to go out and be in the open air away from him but she had not gone far before the torment in her mind began again why had he come in so unusually early was there anything going on in the house he was always very familiar with the servants she stopped short at this turned back and went in as hurriedly as she had gone out in the hall she stood a moment listening the house seemed unusually quiet a green baize door separated the kitchen and offices from the hall she opened it and saw minna in the butlers pantry cleaning the plate minna was parlourmaid now a housemaid having been added to the establishment when miss petterick came so that that young lady might be well waited on i think we should give the girl full value for her money you know even if we do without something ourselves dan had said in the generous thoughtful way that had so often imposed upon beth beth asked minna where drew the housemaid was its her afternoon out maam minna answered so it is said beth i had forgotten do you want anything maam minna asked youre looking poorly would you like a cup o tea no thank you beth rejoined then changed her mind yes i should though get me one while im taking my things off and bring it to me in the diningroom where is your master i dont know maam ive not heard if hes come in but its full early for him yet minna replied as she took off her working apron while she was talking to the girl the worry in beths head stopped and she felt as usual going quietly upstairs she fancied she heard some one moving in her bedroom and entering it by way of the dressingroom she discovered dan on his knees on the floor prying into one of the boxes she had had with her at ilverthorpe and kept locked until she should feel inclined to unpack it he seemed to have had all the contents out and was just deftly repacking it as he replaced the dresses he felt in the pocket of each and in one he found an old letter which he read beth withdrew on tiptoe and went downstairs again wondering at the man she took off her hat and jacket and ensconced herself with the newspaper in an easychair minna came presently with fragrant tea and hot buttered toast and talked cheerfully about some of her own interests beth treated her servants like human beings and rarely had any trouble with them she had learnt the art from harriet who had awakened her sympathies and taught her practically when she was a child what servants have to suffer and well loved and well served exactly described what beth was as a mistress when minna withdrew and beth had had her tea and toast she felt quite right again and read the paper with interest the shock of the real trouble had ousted the imaginary one for the moment the next morning however as she toiled with flushed face and weary brain stultifying her work with painful elaboration she was seized with another fit of jealous rage just as she had been the day before her mind in a moment like a calm sea caught by a sudden tempest seethed with horrible suspicions of her husband his gross ideas expressed in coarse language had hitherto been banished from her mind by her natural refinement but now like the works of a disordered machine whirling with irresponsible force thoughts suggested by him came crowding in the language he habitually used and she found herself accusing him with conviction of all she had ever heard others accused of by him for a little she pursued this turn of thought then all at once she jumped up and rushed downstairs goaded again to actto avenge herselfto dog him down to one of his haunts and there confront him revile him expose him it was a tranquil grey day in early autumn the kind of day full of quiet charm which had always been grateful to beth but now as she stood on the doorstep with wrinkled forehead dilated eyes and compressed lips putting her gloves on in feverish haste she felt no tranquillising charm and saw no beauty in the tangled hedgerows bright with briony berries the tinted beeches the canadian poplars whispering mysteriously by the watercourse at the end of the meadow the glossy iridescent plumes of the rooks that passed in little parties silhouetted darkly bright against the empty sky it was all without significance to her her further faculty was suspended and even the recollection of anything she had been wont to feel had lapsed and she perceived no more in the scene surrounding in the colours and forms of things the sounds and motions than those perceive whose eyes have never been opened to anything beyond what appears to the grazing cattle in many a heavy hour she had found delight in nature but now again she had lost that solace the glory had departed and she had sunk to one of the lowest depths of human pain not understanding the frightful affliction that had come upon her she made no attempt to control her disordered fancy but hurried off into the town and hovered about the places which dan had pointed out as being of special evil interest and searched the streets for him acting upon the impulse without a doubt of the propriety of what she was doing had the obsession taken another form had it seemed right to her to murder him the necessity would have been as imperative and she would have murdered him not only without compunction but with a sense of satisfaction in the deed she pursued her search for hours but did not find him then went home and there he was standing on the doorstep looking out for her where on earth have you been he said where on earth have you been yourself she rejoined minding my own business he answered so have i she retorted pushing past him into the hall he had never seen her like that before and he stood looking after her in perplexity she went upstairs and threw herself on her bed the worry in her head was awful turn and toss as she would the one idea pursued her until at last she groaned aloud o god release me from this dreadful man after a time being thoroughly exhausted she dropped into a troubled sleep when she awoke dan was standing looking at her arent you well beth he said youve been moaning and muttering and carrying on in your sleep as if youd got fever i dont think i am well she answered in her natural manner the pressure on her brain being easier at the moment of awakening he felt her pulse youd better get into bed he said and ill fetch you a sedative draught youll be all right in the morning beth was only too thankful to get into bed when he returned with the draught she asked him if he were going out again no not unless im sent for he said where the devil should i be going to its close on dinnertime beth shut her eyes if he is sent for and goes she reflected i shall know it is a ruse to deceive me and i shall get up and follow him he left her to sleep and went downstairs but beth could not sleep the draught quieted her mind for a little then the worry began again as bad as ever and she found herself straining her attention to discover to whom he was talking for she fancied she heard him whispering with some one out in the passage she bore the suspicion awhile then jumped out of bed impetuously and opened the door the gas was burning low in the passage but she could see that there was no one about surely though there were voices downstairs barefooted and only in her nightdress she went to see yes there were voices in the diningroomnow she flung the door wide open dan and another man a crony of his who had dropped in casually were sitting smoking and chatting over their whiskeysandsodas beth becoming conscious of her nightdress the moment she saw them turned and fled back to her bed greatly relieved in her mind by the shock of her own indiscretion what a mad thing to do she thought i hope to goodness they didnt see me a mad thing to do the words when they recurred to her were a revelation what had she been doing all day mad things what was this sudden haunting horror that had seized upon her why madness dan was just as he had always been the change was in herself and only madness could account for such a change there was madness in the family she remembered her father and the moonfaced bessiethe familiarities with servants too surely her mother had suffered and doubtless this misery which had come upon her had been communicated to her before her birth jealousmad she was that was what it meant the one idea goading her on to do what would otherwise have been impossible possessing her in spite of herself and not to be banished by any effort of will heaven help me she groaned what will become of me then as if in reply there rose to her lips involuntarily the assurance which recurred to her now for her help and comfort in every hard moment of her life like a refrain i shall succeed and she set herself bravely to conceal her trouble whatever it cost her and to conquer it but it was a hard battle for months the awful worry in her head continued the same thoughts haunted her the same jealous rage possessed her and she knew no ease except when dan was at hand the trouble always passed when she had him under observation she could not read she could not write she was too restless to sit and sew for more than a few moments at a time up and down stairs she went out of the house and in again fancying always when in one place that she would be better in another but finding no peace anywhere no brightness in the sunshine no beauty in nature no interest in life through the long solitary hours of the long solitary days she fought her affliction with her mouth set hard in determination to conquer it she met the promptings of her disordered fancy with answers from her other self he and bertha petterick are together that is why he is so late the fiend would asseverate very likely her temperate self would reply but they may have been together any day this two years and i knew it and pitied and despised them but felt no pain why should i suffer now because my mind is disordered but i shall recover i shall succeed she would look at the clock however every five minutes in an agony of suspense until dan came in then she had to fight against the impulse to question him which beset her as strongly as the impulse to follow him and that was always upon her except when his presence arrested it never once through it all however did she think of death as a relief it was life she looked to for help more life and fuller she could interest herself in nothing care for nothing all feeling of affection for any one had gone and was replaced by suspicion and rage in her torment her cry was oh if some one would only care for me for me as i am with all my faults if they would only forgive me my misery and help me to care againhelp me also to the luxury of loving forgive her her misery the world will forgive anything but that it tramples on the wretched as the herd turns on a wounded beast not to put it out of its pain but because the sight of suffering is an offence to it if we cannot enliven our acquaintances they will do little to enliven us sad faces are shunned and signs of suffering excite less sympathy than repulsion the spirit of christ the consoler has been driven out from among us beth poured herself out in letters at this time rather more than was her habit it was an effort to get into touch with the rest of the world again in one to jim speaking of her hopes of success she said she should get on better with her work if she had more sympathy shown her to which he replied by jeering at her what did she mean by such nonsense but that was the way with women they were all sickly sentimental sympathy indeed she should think herself devilish lucky to have a good husband and a home of her own many a girl would envy her he wrote also to other members of the family on the subject as if it were a rare joke worth spreading that beth wanted more sympathy and beth received several letters in which the writers told her what their opinion was of her and her complaints as compared to that good husband of hers who was always so bright and cheery all their concern was for the worthy man who had done so much for beth they had no patience with her could scarcely conceal their amusement with this last absurdity but thought she should be laughed out of her fads and fancies that was the only time beth sought sympathy from any of her relations afterwards she took to writing them bitter letters in which she told them what she thought of them as freely as they told her what is the use she said to jim what is the use of sisters and wives being refined and virtuous if their fathers brothers husbands are barloafers men of corrupt imagination and depraved conversation surely if we must live with such as these all that is best in us adds to our misery rather than helps us if we did not love the higher life ourselves it would not hurt us to be brought into contact with the lower on receiving this letter jim wrote kindly to dan and said many things about what women were coming to with their ridiculous notions but men were men and women were women and that was all about ita lucid conclusion that appealed to dan who quoted it to beth in discussions on the subject ever afterwards beth broke down and despaired many times during the weary struggle with her mental affliction she felt herself woefully changed and not only had the light gone out of her life but it seemed as if it never would return when she awoke in the morning she usually felt better for awhile but the terrible torment in her mind returned inevitably and rest and peace were banished for the day it was then she learnt what is meant by the inner calm and how greatly to be desired it isdesired above everything the power to pray left her entirely during this phase she could repeat prayers and extemporise them as of old but there was no more satisfaction in the effort than in asking a favour of an empty room sometimes and especially during the hideous nights when she slept but little and only in short snatches she felt tempted to take something stimulant or sedative but this temptation she resisted bravely and the whole time an extra cup of tea or coffee for the sake of the momentary relief was the only excess she committed if she had not exercised her will in this her case would have been hopeless but as it was her selfdenial and the effort it entailed kept up her mental strength and helped more than anything to save her to beguile the long hours she often stood in the diningroom window looking out the window was rather above the road so that she looked down on the people who passed and she could also see over the hedge on the opposite side of the road into the meadow beyond small things distracted her sometimes though nothing pleased her if two rooks flew by together she hoped for a better day if one came first she would not accept the omen but waited watching for two by a curious coincidence they generally passed first one for sorrow then two for mirth then three for a wedding and she would say to herself first bad luck then good luck then a marriage and wonder how it would come about but anyhowi shall succeed would flash from her and stimulate her one day as she stood there watching she saw a horseman come slowly down the road a bowshot from her bowereaves he rode between the barley sheaves the sun came dazzling through the leaves and flamed upon the brazen greaves of bold sir launcelot beths attention sharpened to sudden interest as he came abreast of the window the rider looked up and beths heart bounded at the sight of his face which was the face of a man from out of the long ago virile knightly highbred refined the face of one that lives for others and lives openly he had glanced up indifferently but on seeing beth a look of interest came into his eyes it was as if he had recognised her and she felt herself as if she had seen him before but when or where in what picture in what dream she could not tell with the first flush of healthy interest she had experienced for a long time she watched him till he was all but out of sight then shut her eyes that she might not see him vanish for fear of bad luck a superstition she had not practised since she was a child when he had gone she found herself with a happy impression of him in her mind an impression of quiet dignity and of strength in repose a man to be trusted she thought true and tender a perfect knight the flash of interest or recognition that came into his countenance when he saw her haunted her she recalled the colour of his blue eyes noted the contrast they were to his dark hair and clear dark skin and was pleased in the afternoon she sat and sewed and smiled to herself over her work with an easy mind her restlessness had subsided dan scarcely cost her a thought the tension was released and a reaction had set in but at the time she herself was quite unaware of it all she felt was a good appetite for her tea minna she said to the parlourmaid bring me a big cup of tea and a good plate of buttered toast im famishing thats good news maam minna answered for it was long since beth had had any appetite at all the next day beth stood at the window again but without intention she was thinking of her knight of the noble mien however and at about the same hour as on the day before he came again riding slowly down the road and again he looked at beth with a flash of interest in his face to which she involuntarily responded when he was out of sight she opened the window and perceived to her glad surprise that the air was balmy and on all things the sun shone shedding joy the horrid spell was broken chapter xlvi a bowshot from her bowereaves he rode between the barleysheaves the words made music in beths heart as she dressed next morning and instead of the torment of mind from which she had suffered for so long there was a great glad glow dan went and came as usual but neither his presence nor absence disturbed her she had recovered her selfpossession her own point of view and he and his habits resumed their accustomed place in her estimation during that dreadful phase she had seen with dans suspicious eyes and seen evil only but had not acquired his interest and pleasure in it on the contrary her own tendency to be grieved by it had been intensified now however she had recovered herself her sense of proportion had been restored and she balanced the good against the evil once more and rejoiced to find that the weight of good was even greater than she had hitherto supposed but although the spell had been broken in a moment her right mind was not permanently restored all at once it was only gradually as the tide goes out after a tempest and leaves the stormbeaten coast in peace that the worry in her head subsided she had lapse after lapse she would lie awake at night a prey to horrible thoughts or start up in the early morning with her mind all turgid with suspicions which goaded her to rush out and act actsee for herselfdo something but the great difference now was that although she was still seized upon by the evil it no longer had the same power to grieve her she had valiantly resisted it from the moment she recognised its nature but now she not only resisted it she conquered it and found relief when her imagination insisted on pursuing dan to his haunts she deliberately and successfully turned her attention to other things she turned her attention to the friends she loved and trusted she dwelt on the kindness they had shown her she forced herself to sit down and write to them and she would rise from this happy task with her reason restored the mere expression of affection having sufficed to exorcise the devils of rage and hate but it was the strange exalted sentiment which her knight had inspired that began continued and completed her cure day after day he came riding down the road riding into her life for a moment then passing on and leaving her not desolate but greatly elated she had known no feeling like this feeling no hope or faith like the hope and faith inspired by that mans mien she did not know his name she had never heard his voice their greetingwhich was hardly a greeting so restrained was the glance and the brightening of the countenance which was all the recognition that passed between themwas merely momentary yet in that moment beth was imbued with joy which lasted longer and longer each time until at last it stayed with her for good restored the charm of life to her rearoused her dormant further faculty and quickened the vision and the dream anew she prayed again in those days fervently and in full faith as of old for when we pray with love in our hearts our prayers are granted and her heart was full of lovea holy impersonal love such as we feel for some great genius adored at a distance for the grace of goodness he has imparted to us and her heart being full of love her brain teemed with ideas the love she lived on the ideas she held in reserve for she had been so weakened by all she had suffered that the slightest exertion in the way of work exhausted her in any case however great ideas must simmer long in the mind before they come to the boil and the time was not lost in those days fewer people than ever came to the house for weeks together beth never spoke to a soul except the servants and her husband and through the long hours when her head troubled her and she could not work she felt her isolation extremely mrs kilroy and her other new friends sent her pamphlets and papers and hurried notes to keep her heart up and inform her of their progress and beth knowing what the hurry of their lives was and not expecting any attention was grateful for all they paid her she had no fear of losing touch with such friends after they had once received her into their circle as one of themselves however seldom she might see them and it was well for her mental health that she had them to rely on during that time of trial for without them she would have had no sense of security in any relation in life she was gradually growing to be on much more formal terms with dan than she had been thanks to her own strength of character she found she was able to reduce the daily jar and even to keep his coarseness in check by extreme politeness in any difference his habit had been to try and shout her down but the contrast of her own quiet dignified demeanour checked him in that beth had the magnetic quality which when steadily directed acts on people and forces them into any attitude desired and dan accommodated his manner and conversation to her taste more now than he had ever done before but he felt the restraint and was with her as little as possible which as she began to recover was also a relieffor his blatant selfabsorption the everlasting i i i of his conversation and his low views of life rasped her irritable nerves beyond endurance one day coming into the drawingroom about teatime with muddy boots and his hat on he found her lying on the sofa prostrated with nervous headache the days closed in early then and she had had the fire lighted and the curtains drawn but could not bear the gaslight because of her head well this isnt brilliant he began at the top of his voice a little more light would suit me he struck a match and turned the gas full on thats better he said and some tea would be refreshing after my walk ive done the whole trudge on foot this afternoon and i consider thats a credit to me you wont find many rising young men economising in the matter of horseflesh as i do or in anything else ill undertake to say i spend less on myself than any other man in the diocese he went to the door instead of ringing the bell and shouted down the passage to minna to bring him some tea beth shut her eyes and groaned inwardly when the tea came dan poured some out for himself remarking i suppose youve had yours beth had not but she was beyond making any effort to help herself at the moment dan who always ate at a greedy rate left off talking for a little and during the interval beth was startled by something cold touching her hand she opened her eyes and found a dainty little blackandtan terrier standing up with its forepaws on the couch looking at her youre a pretty thing she said where have you come from oh is that the dog said dan looking round to see to whom she was talking he followed me in i dont know who he belongs to but as i happen to want a little dog hes welcome but hes very wellbred isnt he said beth and valuable look at his pencilled paws and thin tail and sharp ears pricked to attention hes listening to what we are saying with the greatest intelligence im sure hes a pet and his owners will want him back let them come and fetch him then said dan then it occurred to beth that dan had probably bought him to present to somebody but chose to lie about it for reasons of his own so she said no more the next night about ten oclock dan was called out and did not return beth being very wideawake sat up late playing patience first of all and then reading a shilling shocker of dans which she had taken up casually and become interested in the story was of an extremely sensational kind and she found herself being wrought up by it to a high pitch of nervous excitement at the slightest noise she jumped and then she became oppressed by the silence and found herself peering into the dark corners of the room and hesitating to glance over her shoulder as if she feared to see something she supposed the servants had not yet gone to bed for she heard at intervals what seemed to be a human voice after a time however it struck her that there was something unusual in the regularity of the sound and although she continued to read she found herself waiting involuntarily with strained attention for it to be repeated when it occurred again she thought it sounded suspiciously like a cry of pain and the next time it came she was sure of it instantly forgetting herself and her nervous tremors she threw down her book and went to see what was the matter she stood a moment in the hall where the gas had been left burning and listened but all was still then she opened the door of communication into the kitchen regions and found that that part of the house was all in darkness the servants had gone to bed holding the door open she stood a little and listened again but as she heard nothing she began to think her fancy had played her a trick when just beside her as it seemed some one shrieked beth gasping with terror ran back into the hall and struck a match to light one of the bedcandles that stood on a table her impulse being to go to the rescue in spite of her deadly fright it seemed an age before she could get the candle lit with her trembling hands and in the interval the horrible cry recurred and this time she thought it came from the surgery could any sick person have been left there locked up dan always kept the room locked up and beth had hardly ever been in it she went to the door now bent on breaking it open but she found that for once the key had been left in the lock she turned it and entered boldly but her candle flickered as she opened the door so that at first she could see nothing distinctly she held it high above her head however and as the flame became steady she looked about her there was no one to be seen the room was large and bare all that it contained was a bookcase some shelves with books on them a writingtable and chair an armchair a couch and another table of common deal like a kitchen table on which was a variety of thingsbottles books and instruments apparentlyall covered up with a calico sheet beth checked again in her search was considering what to do next when the horrid cry was once more repeated it seemed to come from under the calico sheet beth lighted the gas put down her candle and going to the table took the sheet off deliberately and saw a sight too sickening for description the little blackandtan terrier the bonny wee thing which had been so blithe and greeted her so confidently only the evening before lay there fastened into a sort of frame in a position which alone must have been agonising but that was not all beth had heard of these horrors before but little suspected that they were carried on under that very roof she had turned sick at the sight a low cry escaped her and her great compassionate heart swelled with rage but she acted without hesitation snatching up her candle she went to the shelves where the bottles were looked along the row of red labels found what she wanted went back to the table and poured some drops down the poor little tortured creatures throat in a moment its sufferings ceased then beth covered the table with the calico sheet mechanically put the bottle back in its place turned out the gas and left the room locking the door after her her eyes were haggard and her teeth were clenched but she felt the stronger for a brave determination and more herself than she had done for many months maclure only came in to bathe and breakfast next morning and she scarcely exchanged a word with him before he went out again but in the afternoon he came into the drawingroom where she was writing a letter and began to talk as if he meant to be sociable he had his usual air of having lavished much attention on his personal adornmenttoo much for manliness and in spite of the night work his hair shone as glossy black his complexion was as bright and clear and his general appearance as fresh and healthy as care of himself and complete indifference to other people except in so far as his own wellbeing might be affected by them could make it beth watched him surveying himself in the glass from different points of view with a complacent smile and felt that his physical advantages and the superabundant vitality which made the business of living such an easy enjoyable farce to him made his inhuman callousness all the more repulsive i should go out if i were you he said peering close into the glass at the corner of his eye where he fancied he had detected the faint crisscross of coming crows feet id never stay mugging up in the house withering look at me i go out in all weathers and ill undertake to say im a pretty good specimen both of health and spirits it was so unusual for dan to recommend beth to do anything for her own good that she began to wonder what he wanted she had observed that he always felt kindly disposed towards people when he was asking a favour of them and bythebye he pursued turning his back to the mirror and craning his neck to see the set of his coattails you might do something for me when you are out wilberforce is worrying for his money its damned cheek i sent him a large order for whisky the other day to keep him quiet but it hasnt answered i wish you would go and see himgo with a long face like a good girl and tell him im only waiting till i get my own accounts in have a little chat with him you know and all that sort of thinglay yourself out to please him in fact hes a gentlemanly fellow for a winemerchant and has a weakness for pretty women if you go ill take my dick hell not trouble us with a bill for the next six months it seems to me said beth in her quietest way that when a husband asks his wife to make use of her personal appearance or charm of manner to obtain a favour for him from another man he is requiring something of her which is not at all consistent with her selfrespect dan stopped short with his hand up to his moustache to twist it his bonhomie cast aside in a moment oh damn your selfrespect he said brutally your cursed booktalk is enough to drive a man to the devil anybody but you with your views and opinions and fads and fancies generally would be only too glad to oblige a good husband in such a small matter and surely to god i know what is consistent with your selfrespect i should be the last person in the world to allow you to compromise it but your eyes will be opened and the cursed conceit taken out of you some day madam i can tell you youll live to regret the way youve treated me i promise you my eyes have been pretty well opened as it is beth answered you left the key in the surgery door last night and you went in there spying on me did you that was honourable he exclaimed in a voice of scorn i heard the wretched creature you had been vivisecting crying in its agony and i thought it was a human being and went to see beth answered speaking in the even dispassionate way which she had found such an effectual check on dans vulgar bluster you killed that dog then he exclaimed turning on her savagely how dare you beth rose from the writingtable and went and stretched herself out on the sofa deliberately facing him how dare you she inquired how dare i indeed in my own house he bawled now look here madam im not going to have any of your damned interference and so i tell you please i am not deaf she remonstrated gently and now look here sir i am not going to have any of your damnable cruelties going on under the same roof with me i have endured your sensuality and your corrupt conversation weakly partly because i knew no better and partly because i was the only sufferer as it seemed to me in the narrow outlook i had on life until lately but i know better now i know that every woman who submits in such matters is not only a party to her own degradation but connives at the degradation of her whole sex our marriage never can be a true marriage the spiritual intellectual physical union of a man and a woman for the purpose of perfect companionship we have none of the higher aspirations in common we should be none the happier for tender experiences of parenthood none the holier for any joy or sorrow pain or pleasure that might come to us to strengthen and ennoble us if rightly enjoyed or endured and this i think is not altogether my fault but however that may be it is out of my power to remedy it now all i can do is to prevent unedifying scenes between us by showing you such courtesy and consideration as is possible on this occasion i will show you courtesy but the consideration is due to me a woman does not marry to have her heart wrung her health destroyed her life made wretched by anything that is preventable and i intend to put a stop to this last discovered hellish practice of yours i will not allow it and if you dare to attempt it again i will call in the townsfolk to see you at your brutal work she spoke with decision in the tone of one who has determined on her plan of action and will fearlessly pursue it a great gravity settled on daniel maclure he stood still a little reflecting then came to the fire beside which beth who had risen restlessly as she spoke was now sitting in an armchair he drew up another chair and sat down also having resolved in face of the gravity of the situation to try some of his old tactics and some new ones as well his first pose was to gaze into the fire ruefully for awhile and then his fine eyes slowly filled with tears it must have been a brutal sight he said at last and i cant tell you how sorry i am you saw it i dont wonder youre shaken poor little girl and its natural that the shock should have made you unreasonable and uncharitableunlike yourself in fact for i never knew a more reasonable woman when you are in your right mind or a more charitable im not so bad however as you think me i never intended to inflict suffering on the creature i didnt know hed recover i had given him a dose of curare the drug that paralyses without deadening the sense of pain beth interposed i have heard of the tender mercies of the vivisector he saves himself as much as he can in the matter of distracting noises dan had mentioned curare to give a persuasive touch of scientific accuracy to his explanation not suspecting that she knew the properties of the drug and he was taken aback for a moment but he craftily abandoned that point and took up another these experiments must be made in the interests of suffering humanity mores the pity he said sighing in the interests of cruel and ambitious scientific men struggling to outstrip each other and make money and win fame for themselves regardless of the cost they were ready enough in old days to vivisect human beings when it was allowed and they would do it again if they dared now look here beth dont be rabid said dan temperately just think of the sufferings medical men are able to relieve nowadays in consequence of these researches good authorities say that nothing useful has been discovered by vivisection that could not have been discovered without it beth rejoined and even if it had been the means of saving human life that would not justify your employment of it there never could be a human life worth saving at such an expense of suffering to other creatures it isnt as if you made an experiment and had done with it either one generation after another of you repeats the same experiments to verify them to see for yourselves for practice and so countless helpless creatures are being tortured continually by numbers of men who are degraded and brutalised themselves by their experiments had i known you were a vivisector i should not only have refused to marry you i should have declined to associate with you to conceal such a thing from the woman you were about to marry was a cruel injusticea fraud i concealed nothing from you that you were old enough to understand and take a right view of dan protested according to custom said beth anything that might prevent a woman accepting a man is carefully concealed from her that kind of cant is wearisome you did not think me too young to put at the head of a house or to run the risk of becoming a mother although i have heard you dilate yourself on the horrors of premature motherhood but that is the way with men for anything that suits their own convenience they are ingenious in finding excuses as a rule they see but one side of a social question and that is their own i cannot understand any but unsexed women associating with vivisectors dont pretend you pursue such experiments reluctantlyyou delight in them but whatever the excuse for them i am sure that the time is coming when the vivisector will be treated like the people who prepared the dead for embalming in ancient egypt you will be called in when there is no help for it but your task accomplished you will be driven out of all decent society to consort with the hangmanif even he will associate with you well well dan ejaculated gazing into the fire sorrowfully but i suppose this is what we should expect its the way of the world a scientific man who devotes all his time and talents to relieving his fellowcreatures must expect to be misunderstood and reviled by way of reward you send for us when you want ustheres nobody like the doctor then but youll grudge every penny youve got to give us and youd not pay at all if you could help it i should know i was not speaking of doctors beth rejoined i was speaking of vivisectors but after all what is the great outcome of your extraordinary science what do you do with it keep multitudes alive and suffering who would be happily dead and at rest but for you if you practised with the honest intention of doing as much good as you could you would not be content merely to treat effects as you do for the most part you would strike at causes also and we should hear more of prevention and less of wonderful cures you dazzle the blockhead public with a showy operation and no one thinks of asking why it is that the necessity for this same operation recurs so often you know probably but you disclaim responsibility in the matter it is not your place to teach the public you modestly protest i dont know how you can say that in the face of the effort we have made to stamp out disease why look at zymotic diseases alone exactly beth answered zymotic diseases alone but why draw the line there and what are you doing to improve the race to strengthen its power to resist disease you talk about nature when it suits you but it is the cant of the subject you employ for you are at variance with nature your whole endeavour is to thwart her nature decrees the survival of the fittest you exercise your skill to preserve the unfittest and stop thereat the beginning of your responsibilities as it seems to me let the unfit who are with us live and save them from suffering when you can by all means but take pains to prevent the appearance of any more of them by the reproduction of the unfit the strength the beauty the morality of the race is undermined and with them its best chances of happiness yes you certainly do your best to stamp out measles smallpox scarlet fever and all that groupdiseases that do not necessarily leave any permanent mark on the constitution but at the same time you connive at the spread of the worst disease to which we are liable about that you preserve the strictest professional secrecy only today in the times there is the report of a discussion on the subject at a meeting of the international congress of legal medicinewhere is it she took up the paper and readthere was an important debate on the spread of an infamous disease by wet nurses this question is all the more urgent because though the greatest dangers and complications are involved it is very generally neglected when a doctor knows that the parents of a child are tainted should he so far disregard the professional secrecy to which he is bound as to warn the nurse of her danger in suckling the child apparently not the poor woman must take her chance as the childs unfortunate mother had to do when she married ah now you see for yourself and will become reasonable it is to be hoped he interrupted rubbing his hands complacently for it is precisely in order to check that particular disease that appointments like mine are made it is precisely in order to make vice safe for men that such appointments are made she answered medical etiquette would not stop where it does at the degradation of those unfortunate women if you were honestly attempting to put a stop to that disease you would have it reported irrespective of the sex of the sufferer like any other disease that is dangerous to the health of the community it is not contrary to etiquette to break your peculiar professional secrecy in the case of a woman but it would be in the case of a man so you punish the women and let the men go free to spread the evil from one generation to another as they like o justice o consistency i dont wonder we have been shunned since we came to slane a man in your position is a mere pander and right glad am i of what i have suffered from the scorn and contempt of the people who would not associate with us it shows that the right spirit is abroad in the community pander dan ejaculated i am sorry to hear you use such a word beth it is the right word unfortunately she answered you oughtnt to know anything about these things the chaste daniel observed with an air of offended delicacy women cant know enough to see the matter from the right point of view and so they make mischief ah you dont appreciate that women have grown out of their intellectual infancy beth said and have opinions and a point of view of their own in social matters especially where their own sex is concerned you are still in the days of old chavasse who expatiates in his advice to a wife on the dangers of men marrying unhealthy women but says not a word of warning to women on the risk of marrying unhealthy men you would keep us blindfolded as we were in his day and abandon us to our fate in like manner but it cant be done any more my friend you can hide nothing from sensible women now that concerns the good of the community we know there is no protection for women against this infamous disease and no punishment for the men who spread it and we consider the fact a disgrace to every medical man alive you have a nice opinion of the men of your husbands profession dan observed sarcastically i have the highest opinion of medical mensuch medical men as sir george galbraith she replied i have seen something of their highmindedness their courage their devotion and their genuine disinterestedness and i feel sure that in time their efforts will leaven the whole mass of callousness and cruelty against which they have to contend in their profession the hope of humanity is in the doctors and they will not fail us like christ they will teach as well as heal rubbish said dan as ive told you before it isnt our business to mind the morals of the people its for the parsons to fight the devil but said beth as i answered you before you cannot attend to the health of the community properly without also minding its morals the real old devil is disease dan left his seat and walked to the window where he stood with his hands in his pockets looking out for awhile well this is enough jawbation for one day i hope he said at last turning round marrying a woman like you is enough to drive a man to the devil ive a jolly good mind to go and get drunk i declare to god if i could get drunk overnight and feel all right again in the morning id be drunk every night but it cant be done he added regretfully there are drawbacks to everything beth looked at him imperturbably while he was speaking then turned her attention to the fire you know my views now on the subject of vivisection she said at last if there is any more of it here i shall leave the house and publish the reason and you also know what i consider i owe myself in the way of selfrespect you must beguile your creditors by other means than my personal appearance she had spoken all through in the most temperate tone and now when she had finished she leaned back in her chair and folded her hands with a sigh as of one who had finished a hard task and would rest dan looked at her with evident distaste and considered a little searching for something more to say that might move her some argument that should persuade or convince but as nothing occurred to him he left the room banging the door after him in his illconditioned way because he knew that the noise would be a racking offence to her overwrought nerves but from that time forward everything he did was an offence to beth a source of irritation in spite of herself she detected all the insincerity of his professions the mean motives of his acts up to this time she had been more kindly disposed towards him than she herself knew all she had wanted was to be able to care for him to find some consistency in him something to respect and to which she could pin her faith but now she knew him for what he was exactlyshallow pretentious plausible vulgarminded without principle a man of false pretensions and vain professions utterly untrustworthy saying what would suit himself at the moment or just what occurred to him not what he thought but what he imagined he was expected to say beth had never heard him condemn a vice or habit which she did not afterwards find him practising himself she used to wonder if he deceived himself or was only intent on deceiving her but from close observation of him at this period she became convinced that for the time being he entered into whatever part he was playing and hence his extreme plausibility beth found herself studying him continually with a curious sort of impersonal interest he was a subject that repelled her but from which nevertheless she could not tear herself away his hands in particular his handsome white hands had a horrid sort of fascination for her she had admired them while she thought of them as the healing hands of the physician bringing hope and health but now she knew them to be the cruel hands of the vivisector associated with torture from which humanity instinctively shrinks and when he touched her her delicate skin crisped with a shudder she used to wonder how he could eat with hands so polluted and once at dessert when he handed her a piece of orange in his fingers she was obliged to leave it on her plate she could not swallow it after that last scene the days dragged more intolerably than ever but happily for beth there were not many more of them without a break for just as it seemed that endurance must end in some desperate act mrs kilroy sent her a pressing invitation to go and pay her a long visit in london and beth accepted it and went with such a sense of relief as an invalid feels who after long suffering finds herself well and out in the free fresh air once more chapter xlvii when beth went to stay with the kilroys in london it was a question whether she might not end by joining the valiant army of those who are in opposition to everything but before she had been there a week she had practically recovered her balance and began to look out upon life once more with dispassionate attention her depression when she first arrived was evident and the kilroys were concerned to see her looking so thin and ill but by degrees she expanded in that genial atmosphere and although she said little as a rule she had begun to listen and to observe again with her usual vivid interest she could not have been better situated for the purpose for people of all kinds came to the kilroys and in moving among them merely as an onlooker she was bound to see and hear enough to take her out of herself her own personality was too distinct however for her to remain for long an onlooker merely that mesmeric quality in her which whether it fascinates or displeases attracts or repels marks a distinct personality which is not to be overlooked made people ask at once who she was in the hope that her acquaintance might be worth cultivating for there was a certain air of distinction about her which made her look like a person with some sort of prestige whom it might be useful to knowdont you know one afternoon soon after beths arrival mrs kilroy being at home to visitors and the rooms already pretty full beth noticed among the callers an oldlooking young man whose face seemed familiar to her he wore a pointed beard upon his chin and a small moustache cut away from his upper lip and waxed and turned up at the ends his face was thin and narrow his forehead high and bald what hair he had grew in a fringe at the back of his head and was curly and of a nondescript brown colour had he worn the dress of the elizabethan period he might have passed for a bad attempt to look like shakespeare and beth thought that that perhaps might be the resemblance which puzzled her while she was looking at him a lady was announced a most demurelooking little person in a grey costume and a small closefitting princess bonnet tied under her chin and trimmed with a big alsatian bow in front she entered smiling slightly and she continued to smile as if she had set the smile on her lips as she put the bonnet on her head to complete her costume after she had shaken hands with angelica she looked round as if in search of some one else and seemed satisfied when she discovered the oldlooking young man of shakesperian aspect he was watching her and their eyes met with a momentary significance but they took no further notice of each other most people would have perceived no more in the glance than showed on the surfacea lady and gentleman who looked at each other and then looked away like indifferent acquaintances or casual strangers but beths infallible intuition revealed to her an elaborate precaution in this seeming unconcern it was clear to her that the two had expected to meet each other there and their apparent insensibility to each others presence was a pose which however betrayed to her the intimacy it was affected to conceal she hated herself for seeing so much and burned with blame of dan for opening her eyes to behold the inward wickedness beneath the conventional propriety of the outward demeanour but therein she was unjust to dan he had opened her eyes sooner than they should have been opened but in any case she must have seen for herself eventually nothing in life can be concealed from such a mind what books could not teach her she discovered from people by sympathy by insight by intuition but she did not come into full possession of her faculties all at once the conditions of her life had tended rather to retard than to develop the best that was in her and the wonder was that her vision had not been permanently distorted so that she could see nothing but evil in all thingssee it too till her eyes were accustomed and her soul corrupted so that she not only ceased to resent it but finally accepted it as the inevitable order to which it is best to accommodate oneself if one is to get any good out of life this is the fate of most young wives situated as beth had been the fate she had only narrowly escaped by help of the strength that came of the brave selfcontained habits she had cultivated in her life of seclusion and thought it was the result of this training and her constancy in pursuing it that her further faculty hitherto so fitful at last shot up a bright and steady light which made manifest to her the thoughts of others that they were not all evil and helped her by the grace in her own heart to perceive hidden processes of love at work in other hearts all tending to purification and by the goodness of her own soul to search out the goodness in other souls as the elements find their constituent parts in the atmosphere beth was looking her best that afternoon although she had taken no pains with herself she seemed well dressed by dint of looking well in her clothes but she had not chosen to make herself look well in the exasperated phase of revolt through which she was passing she could not have been persuaded to dress so as to heighten the effect of her appearance and so make of herself a trap to catch admiring glances to be neat and fresh was all her care but that was enough the young man with the pointed beard who had been looking about the room uneasily seemed to have found what he wanted when he noticed her he asked an elderly man standing near him who the young lady of distinguished appearance might be a friend of mrs kilroys i believe the gentleman answered and moved off as if he resented the question but pointed beard was persistent he asked two or three other people strangers who did not know either and then he made his way to mrs kilroy but she was so surrounded he could not get near her at last he bethought him of the servants who were handing tea about and learnt beths name from one of them when beth next noticed him he was making his way towards her with a cup of tea in one hand and a plate of cakes in the other i have ventured to bring you some tea he said but i do not know if it is as you like it i can easily get you some more however if it is not thank you i do not want any beth answered somewhat coldly ill put it here then on this console he rejoined if i move away i shall not be able to get near you again in this crowd i wonder why mrs kilroy has so many people now i like just a few eight or ten for a dinner you know and twenty or so on these sort of occasions and they must all be interesting people worth talking to i am exceedingly fastidious about the kind of people i know even as a boy i was fastidious as he uttered that last sentence beth was again aware of something familiar in his appearance and she felt sure she had heard him make that same remark more than once beforebut when but where that is lord fitzkillingham he continued that tall man who has just come insee thereshaking hands with mrs kilroy he looks like a duke dont you know i admire people of distinguished appearance much more than goodlooking peoplepeople who are merely goodlooking i mean of course i saw you directly i came into the room and was determined to find out who you were and i asked i cant tell you how many people whether i knew them or not what do you think of that for perseverance you certainly seem to be persistent beth answered with a smile oh im nothing if not persistent he rejoined complacently ill undertake to find out anything i want to know do you see that lady there in black i wanted to know her age so i went to somerset house and looked it up what did you do that for beth asked i wanted to know but did she want you to know well naturally not or she would have told me but it is no use trying to conceal things from me i am not to be deceived you must be quite a loss to scotland yard beth ventured you would have been admirably fitted for thaterdelicate kind of work well i think i should he rejoined you see i found you out and it was not so easy forerno one seemed to know you however that does not matter well soon introduce you beth smiled thank you she said drily that will be very nice ill bring fitzkillingham presently hell do anything for me he was one of our set at the varsity thats the best of going to the varsity you meet the right kind of people there people who can help you you know if you can get in with them as i did youll like fitzkillingham hes a very good fellow indeed said beth what has he done done he echoed oh nothing that i know of consider his position the earl of fitzkillingham with a rentroll of fifty thousand a year has no need to do he has only to be there hes caught my eye ill go and fetch him pray do nothing of the kind said beth emphatically i have no wish to know him the young man disconcerted turned and looked her full in the face why not he gasped first of all because you were going to present him without asking my permission beth said which is a liberty i should have had to resent in any case by refusing to know him and secondly because a man worth fifty thousand a year who has done no good in the world is not worth knowing i dont think he should be allowed to be unless he can be made to do pray excuse me if i shock your prejudices she added smiling you do not know perhaps that in our set knowing people for position rather than for character is quite out of date the young man smiled superciliously that is rather a bourgeois sentiment is it not he said on the contrary said beth it is the other that is the huckster spirit what is called knowing the right people is only the commercial principle of seeking some advantage certain people make a mans acquaintance and pay him flattering attentions not because their hearts are good and they wish to give him pleasure but because there is some percentage of advantage to be gained by knowing him that is to be bourgeois in the vulgar sense if you like and that is the trademark stamped upon most of usselfishness snobbishness one sees it in the conventional society manners which are superficially veneered fundamentally bad the outcome of selfinterest not of good feeling one knows exactly how where and when they will break down what are you holding forth about beth said mrs kilroy coming up behind her the best people beth answered smiling you mean the people who call themselves the best peoplesociety that is to say said mrs kilroy cheerfully society is the scum that comes to the surface because of its lightness and does not count except in sets where ladies papers circulate i am surprised to hear you talk so mrs kilroy said pointed beard in an offended tone as if society had been insulted in his person i am sorry if i disappoint you said mrs kilroy and i confess i like my own set and their pretty manners but i know their weaknesses there is no snob so snobbish as a snob of good birth the upper classes will be the last to learn that it is sterling qualities which are wanted to rule the worldhead and heart this gentleman will tell you that all that is bourgeois said beth i believe that at heart the bourgeois are sound said angelica bourgeois signifies good sound selfrespecting qualities to me and steady principles but scarcely pretty manners i should suppose said pointed beard superciliously why not said angelica sincerity and refinement make good manners and principle is the parent of both dont you think that for the most part englishwomen are singularly lacking in charms of manner he asked precisely just as englishmen are and for the same reason said angelica because they only try to be agreeable when it suits themselves a good manner is a decoration that must be kept on always if it is to be worn with ease good manners are rare because good feeling is rare for good manners are the outcome of good feeling manners are not the mere society show of politeness but the inward kindly sympathy of which politeness is the natural outward manifestation given these grace and charm of manner come of themselves she moved off as she spoke to attend to other guests mrs kilroy is obvious said pointed beard in a tone that suggested sympathy with beth for being bored i wonder she did not give us for manners are not idle et cetera or something equally banalthe kind of thing we are taught in our infancy and fail to apply ever after said beth i see you are ready he observed fatuously striking the personal note again which she resented i dislike that cant of the obvious which there is so much of here in town she rejoined it savours of preciosity all that is finest in thought is obvious a great truth well put when heard for the first time is so crystal clear to the mind one seems to have known it always no one fears to be obvious who has anything good to say he stroked his beard in silence for some seconds i suppose you go in for politics and all that sort of thing he said at last why beth asked in her disconcerting way oh judging by your friends not a safe guide she assured him my friends have the most varied interests and even if they had not it would be somewhat monotonous for them to associate exclusively with people of the same pursuits then you do not take an interest in politics he jerked out almost irritably as if he had a right to know for a moment beth had a mind to baffle him for his tasteless persistency but her natural directness saved her from such smallmindedness if i must answer your catechism she said smiling social subjects interest me more i find generalisations bald and misleading and politics are a generalisation of events i rarely read a political speech through and remember very little of what it is all about when i do details individuals and actions fascinate me but the circumstances of a people as a state rarely interest me much ah i fear that isera feminine point of view ratheris it not he rejoined patronisingly yes she said and a scientific method we go from the particular to the general and only draw broad conclusions when we have collected our facts in detail but excuse me i see a friend she broke off hastily seizing the chance to escape a little later beth saw that the demurelooking little person in the princess bonnet was taking her leave she passed down the room with her set little smile on her lips looking about her but apparently without seeing any one in particular till she got to the door when her eye lighted on the young man of shakesperian mien and her smile flickered a moment and went out the young man turned and looked at a picture with an elaborately casual air then sauntered across the room to mrs kilroy shook hands with her spoke to one or two other people and finally reached the door and opened it with the same solemn affectation of not being in a hurry and disappeared beth wondered if he kept his caution up before the footmen in the hall or if he made an undignified bolt of it the moment he was out of sight of society at dinner that evening she asked mrs kilroy who and what that thinnosed man that sort of reminiscence of shakespeare was he is by way of being a literary man i believe angelica answered he is not a friend of ours and i cannot think why he comes here i never ask him he got himself introduced to me somehow and then came and called which i thought an impertinence did you notice that woman with an alsatian bow in her bonnet that made her look like a horse with its ears laid back her pose is to improve young men she improves them away from their wives and i object to the method and i do not ask her here either yet she comes his wife i have much sympathy with but he keeps her in the country out of the way so i see very little of her what is his name beth asked alfred cayley pounce why beth exclaimed he must be a youth i knew long ago when i was a child i was sure i had seen him before but what a falling off i wondered if he were an old young man or a young old man when i first saw him he was refined as a boy and had artistic leanings i should have thought he might have developed something less banal in the time than a bald forehead that kind of man spends most of his time in cultivating acquaintances said mr kilroy when he hasnt birth his pose is usually brains but pounce took a fair degree at the university and hes not such a bad fellow really hes precious of course and by way of being literarythat is to say he is literary to the extent of having written some little things of no consequence upon which he assumes the right to give his opinion with appalling assurance of the works of other people which are of consequence there is a perfect epidemic of that kind of assurance among the clever young men of the day and its wrecking half of them a man who begins by having no doubt of the worth of his own opinion gets no further for want of room to move in next day beth was alone in a sunny sittingroom at the back of the house looking out into grounds common to the whole square it was about teatime the windows were wide open the sunblinds were drawn down outside and the warm air fragrant with mignonette streamed in over the window boxes angelica had given this room up to beth and here she worked or rested read wrote or reflected as she felt inclined soothed rather than disturbed by the faroff sounds of the city and eased in mind by the grace and beauty of her surroundings for the room was a work of art in itself an adams room with carved white panels framing spaces of rich brocade delicately tinted on the walls with furniture chosen for comfort as well as elegance and no more of it than was absolutely necessary no crowding of chairs and tables no congestion of useless ornaments no plethora of pictures putting each other outonly two in fact one a summer seascape with tiny waves bursting on shining sands the other a corner of a beautiful old garden shady with trees glowing with flowers whence two young lovers sitting on an old stone seat looked out with dreamy eyes on a bright glimpse framed in foliage of the peaceful country beyond angelica had thought that room out carefully for beth every detail being considered so that the whole should make for rest and refreshment and she had succeeded perfectly nothing could have eased beths mind of the effect of her late experiences or strengthened it again more certainly than the harmony the quiet and the convenience of everything about herbooks on the shelves needlework on the worktable writing materials in abundance on the bureau exquisite forms of flowers and prevailing tints of appleblossom white and pink and green music when she chose to play comfort of couch and chairs when she wished to repose and above all freedom from intrusion the right to do as she liked gladly conceded the respect which adds to the dignity of selfrespect and altogether the kind of independence that makes most for pleasure and peace before she had been there three weeks she was happily released from herself by the recovery of her power to work she began to revise the book she had thought so little of when it was first written she had brought it to town because it was not very bulky rather than because she had any hope of it but when she took it out and read it here alone in peace it seized upon her with power and in her surprise like galileo she exclaimed but it does turn round the book was already radiant with inborn genius but it still lacked the acquired art and feeling this she sat down to it regularly and rewrote it from beginning to end greatly enriching it she had no amateur impatience to appear in print and become known the thought of production induced her to delay and do her utmost rather than to make indiscreet haste her delight was in the doing essentially she was not one to glory in public successes however great or find anything but a tepid satisfaction therein compared to the warm delight that came when her thoughts flowed and the material world melted out of mind she had been busy with her book that afternoon and very happy until tea came then being somewhat tired she got up from the bureau at which she worked and went to the teatable leaving her papers all scattered about and she was in the act of pouring herself out a cup of tea when the door opened and the footman announced mr alfred cayley pounce very much surprised she put the teapot down deliberately and looked at him he held his hat to his breast and bowed with exaggerated deference in an affected foreign way i insisted on seeing you he began as if that were something to boast of perhaps i ought to apologise beth not knowing what to say asked him to sit down then there was a little pause he looked at the teatable i see that you do take tea he observed why did you refuse it when i offered you some yesterday i am afraid i am not prepared to give you a reason beth answered stiffly would it be out of place if i were to ask for some tea he said beth silently poured him out a cup and he got up took what he wanted in the way of sugar and cream and cake and sat down again making himself very much at home do take some yourself he pleaded you are making me feel such an outsider i beg your pardon said beth helping herself she did not know whether to be annoyed or amused by his assurance had she not known who he was she would certainly have been annoyed but the recollection of their days together when the world was young and life was all pure poetry came upon her suddenly as she found something of the boy in the face and voice of the man before her making it impossible for her to treat him as a stranger and melting her into a smile confess that you were surprised to see me he said i was she answered and not glad perhaps he pursued surprised means neither glad nor sorry she observed dyou know the moment i saw you he began sentimentally but never mind that now he broke off let me give you my reason for coming which is also my excuse i hope you will accept it beth waited quietly i told you i could always find out anything i wanted to know about anybody he pursued and last night i happened to sit next a lady at a dinnerparty who turned out to be a great friend of yours i always talk to strange ladies about what ive been doing that kind of thing interests them you know and i described the party here yesterday afternoon and said i only met one lady in the whole assembly worth looking at and worth speaking to and that was mrs maclure who was staying in the house oh i know her quite well the lady said shes a neighbour of mine at slane her husband is a doctor but i hear she is connected with some of the best county people in the north shes very clever i believe and by way of being literary and all that sort of thing dont you know but i dont think she has any one to advise her oh said beth enlightened i know who my great friend is thenmrs carne yes said mr pounce and when i heard you were literary i felt a further affinity for as i daresay you have heard i am a literary man myself yes i heard you were by way of being literary too beth rejoined who told you so he demanded quickly his whole thought instantly concentrated on the interesting subject when it concerned himself i do not feel at liberty to tell you she replied was it mrs kilroy beth made no sign was it mr kilroy he persisted i have already said that i shall not tell you mr pounce she answered frigidly he sat in silence for a little looking extremely annoyed beth to relieve the tension offered him some more tea which he refused curtly but as she only smiled at the discourtesy and helped herself he saw fit to change his mind and then resumed the conversation when mrs carne heard that i was a literary man he said with importance she begged me to do what i could to help you she said it would be a great kindness so i promised i would and here i am so it seems said beth he stared at her i mean it he said i dont doubt it beth answered you and mrs carne are extremely kind oh not at all he assured her blandly to me at all events it will be a great pleasure to help and advise you how do you propose to do it beth asked relaxing such obtuseness was not to be taken seriously he glanced over his shoulder at the bureau where her papers were spread i shall get you to let me see some of your work he said and then i can judge of its worth what have you done yourself she asked iwell i write regularly for the patriarch he said with the complacency of one who thinks that he need say no more the editor himself came to stay with us last week and that means something just now however i am contemplating a work of fiction an important work if i may venture to say so myself it has been on my mind for years indeed said beth what is its purpose purpose he ejaculated had you said purport instead of purpose it would have been a sensible question it is hardly likely i shall write a novel with a purpose i leave that to the ladies i have read somewhere that milton said the poets mission was to allay the perturbation of the mind and set the affections in right tuneis not that a purpose beth asked and one in our own day has talked of that great social duty to impart what we believe and what we think we have learned among the few things of which we can pronounce ourselves certain is the obligation of inquirers after truth to communicate what they obtain but not in the form of fiction alfred cayley pounce put in dogmatically yet there is always purpose in the best work of the great writers of fiction beth maintained not being able to deny this he supposed sarcastically that she had read all the works to which she alluded i see you suspect that i have not she answered smiling i suspect you did not find that passage you quoted just now from milton in his works he rejoined i said as much she reminded him well but you ought to know better than to quote an author you have not read he informed her do you mean that i should read all a mans works before i presume to quote a single passage i do he replied women never understand thoroughness he observed largely some of us see a difference between thoroughness and niggling beth answered i should say beware of endless preparation we have heard of mr casaubon and the key to all mythologies i understand now what your friend mrs carne meant about the manner in which you take advice mr alfred cayley pounce informed her in a slightly offended tone beth wondering inwardly why so many people assume they are competent to advise prayed that she herself might always be modest enough to wait at least until her advice was asked i hope i have not discussed your opinion impolitely she said pray excuse me if you think i have mollified he turned his attention once more to the littered bureau you have a goodly pile of manuscript there he remarked may i ask what it is it is a little book into which i am putting all my ignorance she said i hope you are not going to be diffident about letting me see it he answered encouragingly i could certainly give you some useful hints you are too kind she said and he accepted the assertion without a suspicion of sarcasm she rose when she had spoken drew the lid of the bureau down over her papers and locked it deliberately but the precaution rather flattered him than otherwise you need not be afraid he said i promise to be lenient and if we are as fast friends when the book appears as i trust we shall be the patriarch itself shall proclaim its merits if not i suppose it will discover my faults beth put in demurely i wonder by the way she added who told you you are so much cleverer than i am but fortunately mrs kilroy came in and interrupted them before he had had time to grasp the remark for which beth from whom it had slipped unawares was devoutly thankful when he had gone she sat and wondered if she had really understood him aright with regard to the patriarch certainly he had seemed to threaten her but it was hard to believe that he had sunk so low as to be capable of criticising her work not on its own merits but with regard to the terms he should be on with its author she was too upright herself however to think such dishonest meanness possible so she put the suspicion far from her and tried to find some charitable explanation of the several signs of paltriness she had already detected and to think of him as he had seemed to her in the old days when she had endowed him with all the qualities she herself had brought into their acquaintance to make it pleasant and of good effect beth had taken to rambling about alone in the quiet streets and squares for exercise and as she returned a few days later from one of these rambles she encountered mr alfred cayley pounce coming out of a florists with a large bouquet of orchids in his hand you see i do not forget you he said holding the bouquet out to her every lady has her flower these delicate orchids are for you but beth ignored the offering you are still fond of flowers then slipped from her we do not leave a taste for flowers behind us with our toys he rejoined if we like flowers as children we love them as men the taste develops like a talent when we cultivate it to love flowers with true appreciation of their affinities in regard to certain persons is an endowment a grace of nature which bespeaks the most absolute refinement of mind and what would life be without refinement of mind beth had walked on and he was walking beside her and how does the book progress he inquired it is finished she answered what already he exclaimed why it takes me a week to write five hundred words but then of course my work is highly concentrated i have sent home for some of it to show you you see i am pertinacious i said i would help you and i will i hope you will live to be glad that we have met but you must not write at such a rate you can only produce poor thin stuff in that way beth shrugged her shoulders and let him assume what he liked on the subject they walked on a little way in silence then he began again about the flowers flowers he informed her were the great solace of my boyhoodthe sole solace i may say for i had no friends no companions except a poor little chap a cripple on whom i took pity my people did not think me strong enough for a public school so they sent me to a private tutor a man of excellent family rector of a large seaside parish in the north he only took me as a favour he had no other pupils but it was very lonely in that great empty house and the seashore although it filled my mind with poetry was desolate desolate beth as she listened to these meanderings of his fancy and recalled old vicar richardson and the house full of children thought of mr pounces remarks about feminine accuracy but had you no girlfriend she asked only the lady of my dreams he answered there was no other lady i should have looked at in the place i was always refined i met the lady of my dreams eventually it was among the mountains of the tyrol imagine a lordly castle with drawbridge and moat portcullis and pleasaunce and sauntering in the pleasaunce among the flowers a ladydressed in white samite beth ventured controlling her countenance i cannot recall the texture he said seriously how could one think of textures at such a moment that would have been too commercial all i noted was the lily whitenessand her eyes dark eyes all the poetry and passion of her race shone in them and on the spot i vowed to win her i went back to the varsity and worked myself into the best set lord fitzkillingham became as you know my most intimate friend he was my best man at the wedding then you married your ideal said beth you should be very happy he sighed i would not say a word against her for the world he asserted when i compare her with other women i see what a lucky man i must be thought but he sighed again i was very young and youth has its illusions as we grow older mere beauty does not satisfy mere cleverness and accomplishments do not satisfy nor wealth nor rank a man may have all that and yet may yearn for a certain something which is not thereand that something is the one thing needful they were opposite to the house by this time and he looked up at the windows sentimentally which is yours he asked i pass by daily and look up they had stopped at the door i cannot ask you in beth said hastily please excuse me this is my time for work ah the time and the mood he ejaculated i know it all so well inspiration inspiration comes of congenial conversation as i hope you will find you will take my flowers i cannot claim to have culled them for you but at least i chose them as the door had been opened and the footman in the hall stood looking on beth thought it better to take the flowers in a casual way as if they belonged to her a card tied to the bouquet by a purple ribbon fell out from among the flowers as she took them on it was written mrs merton merivale beth held the flowers out to mr pounce with the card dangling and raised her eyebrows interrogatively ah yes he began slowly detaching the card as he spoke to gain time and changing countenance somewhat i confess some one else had had the good taste to choose these orchids before i saw them but i always insist on having just what i want so i took them and suggested that another bouquet might be made for the lady i overlooked the card beth bowed and left him without further ceremony she tossed the flowers under the table in the hall on her way upstairs and never knew what became of them later in the day she described her mornings adventure to angelica and asked her if she knew who mrs merton merivale was oh that woman in the princess bonnet with the big alsatian bow you know angelica said mr alfred cayley pounces sometime intellectual affinity poor alfred he is too crude beth ejaculated how i have outgrown him ideala called next day and found angelica alone i hear that beth is with you she said what is she doing writing a book what kind of a book not a book for babes i should say said angelica she does not pretend to consider the young person in the least it is for parents and guardians she says not for authors to see to it that the books the young person reads are suitable to her age she thinks it very desirable for her only to read such as are but personally she does not see the sense of writing down to her or of being at all cramped on her account she means to address mature men and women that is brave and good said ideala what is the subject i dont know said angelica but she is certain to put some of herself into it if by that you mean some of her personal experiences i should think you are wrong said ideala genius experiences too acutely to make use of its own past in that way it would suffer too much in the reproduction and besides it can make better use and more telling of what it intuitively knows than of what it has actually seen i do not think you believe that beth will succeed said angelica on the contrary ideala rejoined i expect her success will be unique only i dont know if it will be a literary success genius is versatile but we shall see having finished her book beth collected her friends and read it aloud to them i dont know what to think of it she said advise me is it worth publishing or had i better put it aside and try again publish it by all means was the unanimous verdict and mr kilroy took the manuscript himself to a publisher of his acquaintance who read it and accepted it oh beth exclaimed when she heard the readers report i do know now what is meant by all in good time if i had been able to publish the first things i wrote how i should have regretted it now and i did think so much of myself at that time too you should have heard how i dogmatised to sir george galbraith and he was so good and kindhe never snubbed me but i believe i am out of the amateur stage now and far advanced enough to begin all over again humbly and learn my profession but i find my point of view unchanged manner has always been less to me than matter when i think of all the preventable sin and misery there is in the world i pray god give us books of good intentionnever mind the style polished periods put neither heart nor hope in us theirs is the polish of steel which we admire for the labour bestowed upon it but by which we do not benefit the inevitable ills of life strengthen and refine when they are heroically borne it is the preventable ones that act on our evil passions and fill us with rage and bitterness and what we want from the written word that reaches all of us is help and advice comfort and encouragement if art interferes with that then art had better go it would not be missed by the wretchedthe happy we need not consider i am speaking of art for arts sake of course we need not trouble about that said ideala the works of art for arts sake and style for styles sake end on the shelf much respected while their authors end in the asylum the prison and the premature grave i had a lesson on that subject long ago which enlarged my mind i got among the people who talk of style incessantly as if style were everything till at last i verily believed it was i began to lose all i had to express for worry of the way to express it then one day a wise old friend of mine took me into a public library and we spent a long time among the books looking especially at the ones that had been greatly read and at the queer marks in them the emphatic strokes of approval the notes of admiration the ohs of enthusiasm the ahs of agreement at the end of one volume some one had written this book has done me good it was all very touching to me very human very instructive i never quite realised before what books might be to people how they might help them comfort them brighten the time for them and fill them with brave and happy thoughts but we came at last in our wanderings to one neat shelf of beautiful books and i began to look at them there were no marks in them no signs of wear and tear the shelf was evidently not popular yet it contained the books that had been specially recommended to me as best worth reading by my stylist friends there is style for you said my friend style lasts you see style is engraved upon stone all the other books about us wear out and perish but here are your stylists still as fresh as the day they were bought because nobody reads them i exclaimed precisely he said there is no comfort in life in them they are the mere mechanics of literature and nobody cares about them except the mechanicians after that i prayed for notable matter to indite and tried only for the most appropriate words in which to express it and then i arrived if you have the matter the manner will come as handwriting comes to each of us and it will be as good too as you are conscientious and as beautiful as you are good chapter xlviii mr alfred cayley pounce called on beth continually he was announced one day when she was sitting at lunch with the kilroys really i do not think i ought to let you be bored by that man mr kilroy exclaimed i once had ten minutes of the academic platitudes of mr alfred cayley pounce and that was enough to last me my life you are too goodnatured to see him so often it is a weakness of yours i believe to suffer yourself rather than hurt other peoples feelings however much they may deserve it but really you must snub him there is nothing else for it send out and say you are engaged if i do he will wait until i am disengaged or call again or write in an offended tone to ask when i can be so good as to make it convenient to see him beth answered in comical despair i dont believe he bores her a bit at present angelica observed he is merely an intellectual exercise for beth she watches the workings of his mind quite dispassionately draws him out with little airs and graces and then adjusts him under the microscope it interests her to dissect the creature when she has studied him thoroughly she will cast him out as a worthless specimen oh i hope that isnt true said beth with a twinge of conscience i own it has interested me to see what he has developed into but surely that isnt unfair she looked at mr kilroy deprecatingly it is vivisection said angelica but under such agreeable anaesthetics that i should think he enjoys it said mr kilroy i should have no objection myself daddy be careful angelica cried a rare specimen like you is never safe when unscrupulous naturalists are about but no microscope is needed to demonstrate mr kilroys position in the scale of being beth put in it is writ large all over him good and true beth said angelica smiling you can go and gloat over your worthless specimen as a reward if you like but the scientific mind is a mystery to me and i shall never understand how you have the patience to do it beth found mr alfred cayley pounce pacing about her sittingroom biting his nails in an irritable manner you were at lunch i think he said i wonder why i was not asked in beth said nothing i consider it a slight on mr and mrs kilroys part he pursued huffily why should i be singled out for this kind of thing arent you just a little touchy beth suggested i confess i am sensitive if that is what you mean he replied well yes if you like she said hypersensitive but i thought you asked for me it is true i came to see you but that is no reason why i should be slighted by your friendsespecially when i came because i think i have something to show you that will interest you he took a little packet from the breastpocket of his coat as he spoke and began to undo it i took the trouble to go all the way home to get them to show you my mother was the only person who had them they are photographs of myself when i was a boy i wonder your mother parted with them beth said i persuaded her with difficulty he rejoined complacently i have often tried before but nothing would induce her to part with them until this time when a bright idea occurred to me i told her they were to be published among portraits of celebrated people when my new book comes out and naturally she liked the idea her only son you know and are they to be published beth asked ohwellof course i hope sosome day he answered smiling and hesitating but the truth is i got them for you beth did not thank him but he was too engrossed with his own portraits to notice the omission she was interested in them too when at last he let her look at them what do you think of that he asked showing her a good likeness of himself as she remembered him i was a pretty boy then i think with my curls burning the midnight oil had not bared my forehead in those days and my beard had not grown life was all poetry then he sighed affectedly what had once been spontaneous feeling in him had become a mere recollection only to be called up by an effort later it became all excesses i suppose said beth ah he ejaculated in a tone of pleased regret i had to live like other men of my standing you know and i had to pay for it the boy was lost but the man developed you may think the change a falling off he waited for beth to express an opinion but as it was impossible for her to say what she thought of the difference between the conceited dissipatedlooking hysterical man of many meannesses and the diffident unspoilt promising boy she held her peace when she had seen the photographs and he had looked at them himself to his hearts content he did them up again and then formally presented her with the packet will you keep them he said solemnly oh no she answered with decision i am not the proper person to keep them if they did not belong to your mother they would be for your wife and children ah my wife he ejaculated bitterly i havent a word to say against my wife remember that onlyyou are the one to whom i would confide them i decline the responsibility beth said keeping her countenance with difficulty he returned the packet to the breastpocket of his coat i shall carry them here then he said tapping his chest with the points of his fingers until you ask for them as usual he stayed a preposterous time that day and when at last he went even beths kindly forbearance was exhausted and she determined to see no more of him he was not the man to take a hint however and it was no easy matter to get rid of him he sent her flowers for which she did not thank him books which she did not read wrote her long letters of the clever kind discussing topics of the day or remarks she herself had made which she left unanswered called but never found her at home yet still persisted until she was fain to exclaim will no one rid me of this troublesome priest it is your own fault said angelica i warned you that goodnature is wasted on that sort of man but surely he must see that i wish to avoid him beth exclaimed of course he sees it angelica rejoined but you may be sure that he interprets your reluctance in some way very flattering to himself i shall really be rude to him beth said desperately he is a most exasperating person the kind of man to drive a woman mad and then blame her for it i pity his wife beth stayed with the kilroys until the end of june when the season was all but over and everybody was leaving town and it was the busiest and happiest time she had ever known she had enjoyed the work the play the society the solitude and had blossomed forth in that congenial atmosphere both mentally and physically and become a braver and a better woman the kilroys were to go abroad the day that beth returned to slane the evening before she went with angelica to a theatre but angelica being much occupied at the moment with arrangements that had to be made for the carrying on of her special work during her absence was not able to stay for the whole performance so she left beth alone at the theatre and sent the carriage back to take her home beth sitting in the corner of a box had eyes for nothing the whole time but the play which being one of those that stimulate the mind had appealed to her so powerfully that even after it was over she remained where she was a little deep in thought on leaving the theatre she found the footman on the steps looking out for her and he remained standing a little behind her till the carriage came up while she waited she was annoyed to see mr alfred cayley pounce making his way towards her officiously you are alone he exclaimed with a note of critical disapproval in his voice as if the circumstance reflected on somebody hardly beth said glancing up at her escort but even if i were mr pounce i am in london not in the dark ages and as sure of respect here at the doors of a theatre as i am in my own drawingroom i believe by the way she added lightly not liking to hurt him by too blunt a snub i believe this is the only big city in europe of which so much can be said and english women may thank themselves for it we demand not protection but respect here is the carriage good night she stepped in as she spoke and took her seat oh pray you really must allow me to see you safe home he exclaimed following her into the carriage and taking the seat beside her before she could remonstrate the servant shut the door and they drove away beth boiled with indignation but she thought it more dignified not to show it and she dreaded to have a scene before the servants her demeanour was somewhat frigid and she left him to open the conversation but when he spoke she answered him in her usual tone he on the contrary was extremely formal he stroked his pointed beard looked out of the window and made remarks about the weather and the people in the streets not avoiding the obvious which was a relief the halldoor was opened as soon as the carriage stopped and they got out thank you for your escort and good night beth said holding out her hand to him but he ignored it i feel faint he said and he looked it will you let me come in and sit down a minute and give me a glass of water why of course beth said but have something stronger than water come this way into the library roberts bring mr pounce something to revive him what will you have sir the butler asked a glass of water nothing but a glass of water mr pounce said most preciously sinking into an easychair as he spoke the butler brought the water and told beth that mr and mrs kilroy had not come in she ordered some tea for herself mr pounce sipped the water and appeared to revive i have suffered terribly during the last three weeks he said at last have you really beth rejoined with concern what was the matter need you ask he ejaculated why why have you treated me so really mr pounce i do not see that you have any claim on my special consideration beth answered coldly i have the claim of one who is entirely devoted to you he said i have never accepted your devotion and i will not have it forced upon me beth answered decidedly i should like you better to tell the truth if you were a little more devoted to your duty you allude to my wife he said oh how can i make you understand but you have said it yourselfduty what is duty the conscientious performance of uncongenial tasks but if a man does his duty then he deserves his reward i do my duty with what heart i have for it no fault can be found with me either as a husband or a citizen therefore as a man i consider myself entitled to claim my reward i am afraid you are not well beth said dont you think you had better go home and rest not until we come to an understanding he answered tragically beth shrugged her shoulders resignedly folded her hands and waited more interested in him as a human specimen in spite of herself than disturbed by anything his attitude foreboded there was a bright wood fire burning on the hearth mrs kilroy liked to have one to welcome her when they had been out late not for warmth so much as for cheerfulness the summer midnight was chilly enough however for the gentle heat to be grateful and beth turned to the blaze and gazed into it tranquilly the clock on the mantelpiece struck one roberts brought in a tray with refreshments on it and set it down on a small table beside beth before she helped herself she asked mr pounce what he would have but he curtly declined to take anything she shrugged her shoulders and fellto herself with a healthy appetite how can youhow can you he ejaculated several times im hungry she said laughing and i really dont see why i shouldnt eat you have no feeling for me he complained i have a sort of feeling that you are posing she answered bluntly and i wish you wouldnt youd better have some sandwiches how terribly complex life is he muttered life is pretty much what we make of it by the way we live it she rejoined taking another sandwich we are what we allow ourselves to be the complexities come of wrong thinking and wrong doing right and wrong are quite distinct there is no mistaking one for the other in any dilemma we have only to think what is right to be done and to do it and there is an end of all perplexities and complexities principle simplifies everything i see you have never loved he declared or you would not think the application of principle such a simple thing it is principle that makes love last beth answered and introduces something permanent into this weary world of change there is nothing in life so well worth living for as principle the most exquisite form of pleasure is to be found in the pain of sacrificing ones inclinations in order to live up to ones principlesso much so that in time when principle and inclination become identical and we cease to feel tempted something of joy is lost some gladness that was wont to mingle with the trouble but principles themselves are mutable he maintained they get out of date and there are besides exceptional characters that do not come under the common law of humanity exceptional temperaments and exceptional circumstances to which common principles are inapplicable or for which they are inadequate that is the hypocrisy of the vicious beth said with her eyes fixed meditatively on the fire the people who lay down excellent principles and publicly profess them for the sake of standing well with society but privately make exceptions for themselves in any arrangement that may suit their own convenience your people of exceptional temperament settle moral difficulties by not allowing any moral consideration to clash with their inclinations and misery comes of it the plea of exceptional character exceptional circumstances exceptional temperament and what not is merely another way of expressing exceptional selfishness and excusing exceptional selfindulgence surely you are not content to be a mere slave to social convention he exclaimed i am talking of fundamental principles not of social conventions she replied please to discriminate selfcontrol is not slavery but emancipation to control our passions makes us lords of ourselves and free of our most galling bondsthe bonds of the flesh what a drawback the want ofera proper philosophic training is he observed culture does a great deal it makes us more modest for one thing i dont suppose you know for instance that you are setting up an opinion of your own in opposition to such men as schopenhauer schopenhauer maintained that as the man of genius gave his whole life for the profit of humanity he had a license of conduct which was not accorded to the rest of mankind if culture leaves us liable to be taken in by a false postulate of any mans however well turned the postulate or able the man then i have no respect for culture the fact that schopenhauer said such a thing does not prove it true an assertion like that is a mere matter of opinion half the worry in the world is caused by differences of opinion let us have the facts and form our own opinions have the men of genius who allowed themselves license of conduct been any the better for it the happier the greater schopenhauer himself for instance she smiled at him with honest eyes when she had spoken and took another sandwich but dont let us talk sophistry and silliness she proceeded nor the kind of abstract that serves as a cover for unrighteousness those tricks dont carry conviction to my uncultivated mind i know how theyre done you are lowering yourself in my estimation he said severely and what comes after that she asked he shook his head and gazed at her reproachfully how can you be so trivial he said in a moment like thisyou who are situated even as i am if we were to die now in six months it would be as though we had never been no one would remember us but what have we done for any one beth asked in her equable way that we should be specially remembered he made no reply and beth went on with the sandwiches i thought he began at last i did think that you at least would understand and feel for me beth stopped eating and considered a moment are you in any real trouble she asked at last he rose and began to pace up and down i will tell you he said and leave you to judge for yourself beth looked somewhat ruefully at the tray and wished that the conversation had been more suited to the satisfaction of an honest appetite i have made it plain to you what my marriage is without blaming anybody he proceeded it is the rock upon which all my hopes were wrecked i found my ideal i won her like a man i havent a word to say against her she is a woman who might have made any ordinary man happy but she has been no help to me it is not her fault she has done her best and it is not my fault then whose fault is it said beth it must be somebodys i think of marriage as i think of life it is pretty much what people choose to make it it does not fail when husband and wife have good principles and live up to them and good manners in private as well as in publicnot to mention high ideals when we are not happy in the intimate relations of life it is generally for some trivial reasonas often as not because we dont take the trouble to make ourselves agreeable as because we fail in other duties i consider it a duty to be agreeable in married life happiness depends on loyalty to begin with the loyalty that will not even let its thoughts stray all that we want in everyday intercourse is truth and affection kindness consideration and unvarying politeness if people practised these as a duty from the first sympathy would eventually come of the effort marriage is the state that develops the noblest qualities and that is why happily married people are the best worth knowing the most delightful to live amongst you have no fault to find with your wife therefore the fault must be in yourself if you are not happy do your duty like a man and cure yourself of it it surprises me to hear you talk in that way he exclaimed you who have suffered so much yourself i make no pretence of having suffered she answered i have no patience with people who do we have our destiny in our own hands to make or mar most of us if we fail in one thing we shall succeed in another life is a fertile garden full of plants that bud and blossom and bear fruit not once but every season while it lasts if the crop of happiness fails one year we should set to work bravely and cultivate it all the more diligently for the next all this is beside the mark he responded peevishly you are offering me the generalisations that only apply to ordinary people allowance must be made for exceptional natures look at me i tell you if i had met the right woman i should have been at the top of the tree by this time i have the greatest respect for woman i believe that her part in life is to fertilise the mind of man and if the able man does not find the right woman for this purpose he must remain sterile and the world will be the loser i never knew such a woman till i met you but in you i have discovered one rich in all womanly attributes mental moral and physical and beyond these dowered also with genius the divine giftthe very woman to help a man to do his best and what is the man going to do for me beth inquired with a twinkle in her eyes he would surround you with every comfort every luxuryjewels like a balletgirl she interjected i am really afraid you are oldfashioned you begin by offering me gewgawsthe paltry price women set on themselves in the days of their intellectual infancy we know our value better now you should have all that an ideal woman ought to have he put in what more can a woman require she would like to know what all she ought to have consists of beth replied as a rule a mans ideal woman is some one who will make him comfortable and he thinks he has done all that is necessary for her when he allows her to contribute to his happiness ah be serious he ejaculated you should be above playing in that cruel way with a man who is in earnest hear what i have to say remember we are the people who make history you talk about knowing your own value you do not know it without me you never will know it you do not know what is being said already about your unpublished work those who have read it tell me you promise to be to england what georges sand was to france when she appeared a new light on the literary horizon but where would georges sand have been without de musset they owe half their prestige to each other while they were alive every one talked of them and now that they are dead reams are written about them let us also go down to posterity together all i want is you what you want is me will youwill you let me be to youde musset what you really do want said beth is a sense of humour for gods sake do not be trivial he exclaimed you cannot think what this means to mehow i have set my heart on ithow i already seem to hear the men at the clubs mention my name and yours when i pass night after night i have paced up and down outside this house looking up at your window thinking it all out beth flushed angrily i consider that a most improper proceeding she said and i do not know how you can excuse it to yourself imuch may be excused when a man feels as strongly as i do he protested and how about your wife said beth where do you place her in your plans has she no feelings to be considered i shall not hurt her feelings i assure you i never do he answered i keep her in a quiet country place so that she may hear no gossip and i excuse my long absences from home on the plea of work she understands that my interests would suffer if i were not on the spot in other words you lie to your wife said beth aghast at the shabby deceit that is scarcely polite language he rejoined in an offended tone it is correct language she retorted we shall understand what we are talking about much better if we call things by their right names but are you never afraid of what your wife may be driven to in the dulness of the country while you are here in town dancing attendance on other mens wives never in the least he answered complacently she is entirely devoted to me and to her duty her faith in me is absolute and so you deceive her i am not bound to tell her all my doings he protested you are in honour bound not to deceive her beth said and if you deceive her it is none the less low because she does not suspect you on the contrary it seems to me that one of the worst things that can happen to a man is to have docile women to deal with i am grieved to hear you talk like that he said i am really grieved it shows a want of refinement that surprises and shocks me i maintain that i do her no injury these things can always be arranged so that no one is injured that is all that is necessary these things can never be arranged so that no one is injured beth replied we injure ourselves if no one else we are bound to deteriorate when we live deceitfully how can you be honest and manly and lead a double life the false husband in whom his wife believes must be a sneak and for the man who rewards a good faithful wife by deceiving her i have no term of contempt sufficiently strong i am disappointed in you he said i should never have suspected that you were so narrow and conventional are you prepared to defy public opinion beth asked no that would be gross he said outwardly we must conform only the elite understand these things and only the elite need know of them you are of the elite yourself you must know you must feel the power the privilege conferred by a great passion pray do not class me with the elite if passion is what they respect beth said passion at the besthonourable passionis but the efflorescence of a mere animal function the passion that has no honourable object is a gaudy unwholesome weed rapid of growth swift and sure to decay passion is more than that the passion of which i speak it is a great mental stimulant he declared yes said beth passion is a great mental stimulantpassion resisted georges sand whom i would have you follow always declared that she only wrote her best under the influence of a strong passion he assured her but how do we know that she might not have written better than that best under some holier influence beth rejoined george eliots serener spirit appeals to me more i believe it is only those who renounce the ruinous riot of the senses and find their strength and inspiration in contemplation who reach the full fruition of their powers ages have not talked for nothing of the pains of passion and the pleasures of love love is a great ethical force but passion which is compact of every element of doubt and deceit is cosmic and brutal a tyrant if we yield to it but if we master it an obedient servant willing to work i would rather die of passion myself as i might of any other disease than live to be bound by it pounce who had been pacing about the room restlessly until now sat down by the fire and gazed into it for a little discomfited he had come primed with the old platitudes the old sophistries the old flatteries come to treat amicably and found himself met with armed resistance his flatteries and platitudes ridiculed his sophistries exposed and his position attacked with the confidence and courage of those who are sure of themselves have you no feeling for me he said at last after a long pause speaking somewhat hoarsely i feel sorry for you was the unexpected answer pity is akin to love he said pity is also akin to contempt she rejoined and how can a woman feel anything else for a man who is false to the most sacred obligations who makes vows and breaks them according to his inclination if we make a law of our own inclinations what assurance can we give to any one that we shall ever be true i have found at last what i have yearned for all my life long he protested i know i shall never waver in my devotion to you that may be she answered but what guarantee could you give me that i should not waver what comfort would your fidelity be if i tired of you in a month again he was discomfited and there was another pause if you did change he said at last i should be the only sufferer beth sat silent for a little then she said slowly what you have ventured to propose to me tonight mr cayley pounce is no more credit to your intelligence than it is to your principles you come here and find me living openly in an assured position with powerful friends whose affection and respect for me rest on their confidence in me and with brilliant prospects besides as you say which however depend to a great extent upon my answering to the expectations i have raised you allow that i have some ability some sense and yet you offer me in exchange for all these i offer you love he exclaimed fervently love she ejaculated with contempt you offer me yourself for a lover and you seek to inspire confidence in me by deceiving your wife you would have me sacrifice a position of safety for a position of dangerone that might be changed into an invidious position by the least indiscretionand all for what for love of you he pleaded that i may help you to develop the best that is in you all for the prestige of having your name associated with mine by men about town in the event of mine becoming distinguished she interrupted he winced i only ask you to do what george eliot did greatly to her advantage he answered reproachfully you asked me to do what georges sand did greatly to her detriment beth said george eliot is an afterthought and you certainly have no intention of asking me to do what she did for she acted openly she deceived no one and injured no one and you do not blame her he exclaimed with a flash of hope beth answered indirectly when i think about that i ask myself have church and state arranged the relations of the sexes successfully enough to convince us that they cannot be better arranged are marriages holier now than they were in the days when there were no churches to bless them or happier here than in other countries where they are simple private contracts and it seems to me that we have no historical proof that the legal bond is necessarily the holiest between man and woman or that there is never justification for a more irregular compact i know that holy matrimony is often a state of absolute degradation especially for the woman and i believe that two honourable people can live together honourably without the conventional bond so long as no one else is injured no previous compact broken but all the same i think the legal bond is best it is a safeguard to the family and a restraint on the unprincipled and at any rate all my experience all my thought all my hope argue for the dignity of permanence in human relations anything else is bad for the individual for the family for the state as civilisation as evolution advances from lower to higher we find it makes more and more for monogamy our highest types of men and women are monogamous those whose contracts are lightly made and lightly broken are trivial people that useful oneida creek experiment proved that the instinct if not the ideal of modern humanity is monogamous what was that he asked a number of people formed a community at oneida creek to live together in a kind of ordered promiscuity but the experiment failed because it was found eventually that the members were living together secretly in pairs no the more i know of life the less i like the idea of allowing any laxity in the marriage relation in certain cases of course there is good and sufficient reason for two people to separate but i believe that rightminded people can generally and almost always do make their marriages answer marriage is compact of every little incident in life it is not merely made up of one strong feeling otherwise men and women would be as the animals who pair and part casually therefore if two people are disappointed in each other in some things they must have other things in common to fall back upon my ideal of life is love in marriage and loyal friends it is interesting to hear you express these views he said bitterly considering what your experience has been i dont see that my petty personal experience has anything to do with the truth of the matter said beth bridling somewhat you really have a poor opinion of me if you think i shall allow my judgment to be warped by anything that may happen to myself because my own experience is not a happy one you would have me declare that family life is a mistake doubtless many an outcry is raised for no better reason but do you not see yourself that the tranquil homelife is the most beautiful the most conducive to the development of all that is best in usthat there is nothing like the delight of being a member of a large and united family can you come into a house like this and not see it this house was not always a model of domestic felicity he sneered that proves my point she rejoined the difficulties can be lived down if people are rightminded your argument does not alter the fact that i am a miserable man he said dejectedly you were not born to be a miserable man she answered gently and we always may be what we might have been but you have lost much ground alfred cayley pounce since the days when you roamed about the cliffs and sandy reaches of rainharbour with beth caldwell making plans you had your ideals then and lived up to them you cultivated your flowers for delight in their beauty and went to your modelling for love of the work you gave your flowers to your friends with an honest intention to please you modelled with honest ambition to do good work in those days you were above caring to cultivate the acquaintance of the best people you had touched the higher life at that time you had felt such rapture in it as has never come to you sinceeven among the best peoplei am sure yet you fell away you deserted bethnot basely perhaps but weakly and you have been deteriorating ever since he had started straight in his chair when she mentioned beth caldwell and was staring at her now with puzzled intentness what do you know about beth he said quickly have you ever met her she smiled i can honestly say i never have she answered but she looked away from him into the fire as she spoke and he recognised the set of her head on her shoulders as she turned it he had noted it often god he exclaimed what a blind idiot i have beenbeth beth he threw himself down on his knees beside her chair caught her hand and covered it with kisses beth snatched her hand away and he returned embarrassed to his seat and sat gazing at her for a little then took out his handkerchief and suddenly burst into tears what a mess i have made of my life he exclaimed everything that would have been best for me has been within reach at some time or other but i invariably took the wrong thing and let the right one go but beth i was only a boy then and i suffered when they separated us this reflection seemed to ease his mind on the subject that she might also have suffered did not occur to him as usual his whole concern was for himself yes you are right beth he proceeded i have deteriorated but we always may be what we might have beenand you have been sent to me again as a sign that it is not too late for me you were my first love my earliest ideal and i have not changed you see i have been true to you for although i never suspected you were beth i recognised my rightful mate in you the moment we met yes i was on the right road when we were boy and girl together but the promise of that time has not been fulfilled all the poetry in me has lain dormant since the days when you drew it forth i gave up modelling when i went to the varsity because they didnt care for that kind of thing in my set you know they were all men of position who wouldnt associate with artists unless they were at the top of the tree clever fellows and good themselves at squibs and epigrams if youd ever been to the varsity youd know that a man must adapt himself to his environment if he means to get on my dream had been to make my visions of beauty visible as you used to suggest but i had to give that up there was nothing else for it still i was not content to do nothing to be nobody therefore when i abandoned the clay i took to the pen i gave up the marble for the manuscript many men of position have written you know and so long as you didnt mug fellows didnt mind in fact they thought you smart if they fancied you could dash things off without an effort you understand now why i am a literary man instead of a sculptor perfectly beth said drily it was in those days i suppose that you were bitten by french literature and began to idealise mean intrigues and to delight in foul matter if the manner of its presentation were an admirable specimen of style ah he said solemnly style is everything it is all work of wordturning and little play of fancy with those who make style everything said beth glad to get away from love and that makes your jackofstyle a dull boy and morbid in spite of his polish less style and more humour would be the saving of some of you the making of others flaubert wrote madame bovary six times he assured her impressively i wonder how much it lost each time said beth but you know what flaubert himself said about style before he had donejust what i am saying i cannot understand your being insensible to the charms of style he said evading the thrust i am not i only say it is not of the most vital importance thackeray was a titanwell look at his slipshod style in places his careless grammar his constant tautology he knew better and he could have done better and it would have been well if he had i dont deny it but his work would not have been a scrap more vital nor he himself the greater i have seen numbers of people here in town studying art they go to the schools to learn to draw not because they have ideas to express apparently but in the hope that ideas will come when they know how to express them and i think it is the same in literature one school talks of style as if it were the end and not the means they form a style but have nothing to express that is worth expressing it would be better to pray the gods to send them the matter if the matter is there in the mind it will out and the manner will form itself in the effort to produce itso said the great there was a pause during which alfred cayley pounce sighed heavily and beth looked at the clock you were stimulating as a child beth he said at last and you are stimulating still think what it would be to me to have you always by my side i cannoti cannot let you go again now that i have found you we were boy and girl together that does not alter anything in our present position beth answered nor does it affect my principles in any way but even if i had been inclinedif i had had no principles i should have been just clever enough to know better than to run any risk of the kind you suggest you do not know perhaps that you have injured your own standing alreadythat there are houses in which you are not welcome because you are suspected of intrigue mesuspected of intrigue he exclaimed it isnt possible beth laughed if it is so disagreeable to be suspected she said what would it be to be found out and what have you gained by it what says the dhammapada there is bad reputation and the evil way to hell there is the short pleasure of the frightened in the arms of the frightened and the king imposes heavy punishment therefore let no man think of his neighbours wife it is evident that you dont trust me he said in an injured tone ah beth does the fact that we were boy and girl together not weigh with you well it would beth said soberly even if worldly wisdom were my only guide in life i should think of the time that we got into that scrape and you wriggled out of it leaving me to shift for myself as best i could and i should remember the boy is father to the man but i have been trying to show you that worldly wisdom is not my only guide in life i have professed the most positive puritan principles of conduct and given you the reasons upon which they are based yet you persist you ignore what i say as if you had not heard me or did not believe me and pursue the subject as if you were trying to weary me into agreement and you have wearied me but not into agreement so if you please we will not discuss it any longer you will be sorry i think some day for the way you have treated me he exclaimed showing temper and what you expect to gain by it i cannot imagine oh please beth protested i am not imbued with the commercial spirit of the churches i do not expect a percentage in the way of reward on every simple duty i do virtue is its own reward he sneered it has been said that the pleasure of virtue is one which can only be obtained on the express condition of its not being the object sought she rejoined goodnaturedly try it alfred and see if you do not become a happier man insensibly order your thoughts to other and nobler ends for thoughts are things and we are branded or beautified by them an american scientist has been making experiments to test the effect of thought on the body and has found that a continuous train of evil thought injures the health and spoils the personal appearance but high and holy thoughts have a beautifying effect be a man and embrace a manly creed live for others live openly deceit is treachery and treachery is cowardice of the most despicable kind life has to be lived it might as well be lived earnestly life is better lived when it is held earnestly personally i detest all flippancy and cynicism all cheapening of serious subjects by lack of reverence irreverence portends defects of character and poverty of intellect all serious subjects are sacred subjects and to treat them with levity or insincerity is to prove yourself a person to be avoided alfred cayley pounce was stooping forward with his elbows on his knees and his face between his hands gazing blankly into the fire the light shone on his bald forehead and accentuated the lines which wounded vanity petty purposes thwarted and an ignoble life had written prematurely on his face and his attitude emphasised the attenuation of his body he looked a poor peevish neurotic specimen and although he had only himself to thank for it beth remembering the promise of his youth felt a qualm of pity what a mistake my marriage has been he ejaculated at last but i doubt if i should ever have found a woman who would have understood me enough to be all in all to me for a man of my temperament there is nothing but celibacy i dont believe in celibacy at all beth said cheerfully celibacy is an attempt to curb a healthy instinct with a morbid idea he is the best man and the truest gentleman who honourably fulfils every function of life and i dont believe your marriage was of necessity a mistake either but if you must be miserable be loyal as well you will find that the best in the end if being miserable we are also disloyal then we are insensibly degradedso insensibly perhaps that we are not conscious of any part of the process and only become aware of what has been going on when we have to face a crisis and find ourselves prepared to act ignobly and to justify the act with specious excuses she glanced up at the mantelpiece come she said it is four oclock and i am sleepy i must go to bed he started to his feet good heavens he exclaimed you can talk of being sleepy when i never mind about that now said beth yawning frankly everybody has gone to bed and forgotten us i suppose i shall have to let you out she gathered the evening cloak she had come back in from the theatre about her as she spoke and led the way he let her open the halldoor for him it was grey daylight in the street at the foot of the steps a policeman was standing on the pavement making a note in a little book is it any use whistling for a hansom at this hour beth asked the policeman looked up at her ill try miss if you like he said he whistled several times but there was no response and alfred cayley pounce at last crammed his hat down on his head with a peevish show of impatience and walked off down the street without a word of leavetaking the fact that beth was sleepy had wounded his vanity more than any word she had said she smiled and shrugged her shoulders as she watched him depart then went down on to the pavement and strolled about enjoying the freshness the policeman kept watch and ward meanwhile at the open door and before she went in beth stood and talked to him a little in her pretty kindly way she found his tone and manner in their simple directness strengthening and refreshing to the mind after the tortuous posings of mr alfred cayley pounce chapter xlix at breakfast next morning beth described the way in which mr alfred cayley pounce had forced his attentions upon her the night before mr kilroy was exceedingly angry he shall not come into any house of mine again he declared and gave the old butler roberts who happened to be the only servant in the room at the moment orders to that effect do you mean to say he asked beth that the fellow had the assurance to tell you he had actually been hanging about the house he seemed rather proud of that as of something poetical and romantic beth answered i suppose the illness was all an excuse angelica observed i dont know beth said he certainly looked ill but hes a poor neurotic creature now and might easily work himself up into a state of hysterical collapse i should think what was your impression roberts he looked real bad maam and well he might the way hes been goin on anging about alf the night weve all seen im roberts rejoined imperturbably why didnt you report it to me mr kilroy wanted to know well sir i couldnt be sure it was this ouse sir in particlar you see theres a good many in the square sir i was just waitin to make sure he come after youd gone last night and said he ad to meet the ladies but hed forgotten where they were goin to and james suspectin nothin told im well i dont think he will trouble me again beth said cheerfully concerned to see mr kilroy so seriously annoyed i told him what i thought of him in such unmistakable terms that he walked out of the house without any form of farewell angelica looked grave i am afraid youve made a spiteful enemy beth she observed that kind of catman is capable of any meanness if his vanity is wounded if he can injure you he will oh as to that i dont see what he can do said mr kilroy he can supply the press with odious personal paragraphs spread calumnies at the clubs and write scratchcat criticisms on the book when it appears angelica said there are plenty of people who will listen to that kind of man and take their opinions from him but what does it matter said beth in her tolerant way all you whom i love and respect will judge me and my work for yourselves if you are pleased i shall rejoice if you find fault i shall be grateful and profit but i should be a poor shallow thing like society itself if i allowed myself to be disturbed or influenced by the alfred cayley pounces of the press and as to society beth laughed at first when i went anywhere i used to ask myself all the time when would the pleasure begin but now i am younger thanks to you and i enjoy everything i look on and laugh but for the rest i must be indifferent it would be an insult to ones intellect to set any store on such tinsel as that of which the verdicts of society are made beth had been thinking a good deal about dan lately and had come to the conclusion that with all his faults he was very much to be preferred to the alfred cayley pounce kind of creature she had more hope of him somehow and she went back determined that it should not be her fault if they did not arrive at a better understanding he gave her a good opportunity on the evening of her arrival they were sitting out in the garden after dinner on that comfortable seat by the privet hedge which beth overlooked from her secret chamber behind them the hedge was thick and in front a border of flowers surrounded a little green lawn which was shut in beyond by a belt of old trees in full foliage it was an exquisite evening warm and still and dan having dined well and begun a good cigar was in a genial mood as he grew older he attached a more enormous importance than ever to meals if the potatoes were boiled when he wanted them mashed or baked it made a serious difference to him and he would grow red in the face and shout at the servants if his eggs for breakfast were done a moment more or less than he liked he was a ridiculous spectacle in his impatience if dinner were late and a sad one in his sensual satisfaction if it answered to his expectations beth watched him at such times with sensations that passed through various degrees of irritation from positive contempt to the kindly tolerance one feels for the greed of a hungry child dan had been doing himself well as he called it during her absence and was looking somewhat bloated and blotched his wonderful complexion was no longer so clear and bright as it had been the red was redder and the white opaque a few more years and his character would be seen distinctly in the shape and colour of his face and beth who had marked the first signs of deterioration slowly set in was saddened by the progress it had made alfred cayley pounce would succumb to his nerves daniel maclure to his tissues the one was earning atrophy for himself the other fatty degeneration beth was right the real old devil is disease and our evil appetites are his ministers you seem solemn this evening daniel said to her i suppose youre regretting your friends yes said beth but i have been away long enough and i am glad to be back i saw some things in the great wicked city that made me thinkdan she broke off abruptly i wish you and i were better friends so very little would bring us to a right understanding and i am sure we should both be the better and the happier speak for yourself said dan complacently personally i feel good enough and happy enough we have our differences like other people i suppose but whose fault is that i should like to know partly mine beth acknowledged i dont think i should have been so defiant but if you had been different i should have been different if i had been different he ejaculated knocking the ash from the end of his cigar well id like to know what fault you have to find with me different indeed that is the principal one beth answered smiling your great fault is that you dont believe you have any faults oh well he conceded of course i know ive my faults who hasnt but ill undertake to say that theyre a mans faults now come this reflection seemed to deepen his selfsatisfaction as if it must be allowed that he was all the better for the faults to which he alluded as he spoke beth seemed to see him at her wardrobe with his hand in the pocket of one of her dresses hunting for treasonable matter to satisfy his evil suspicions and she sighed she would not acknowledge to herself that she was fighting for the impossible yet even at the outset she half despaired of ever making him understand it is pitiful to think of her with her tender human nature seeking a true mate where human law required that she should find one only to be repulsed and baffled and bedraggled herself in the end if she persevered a good man might have failed to comprehend beth but a good man would have felt the force of goodness in her and would have reverenced her maclure recognised no force in her and felt no reverence all that was not animal in her was as obscure to him as to the horse in his stable that whinnied a welcome to her when she came because he expected sugar it is pleasant to give pleasure but there must be more in marriage for it to be satisfactory than free scope to exercise the power to please well look here dan beth pursued ill make a bargain with you if you will do your best to correct your faultswhat i think your faultsill do my best to correct all you find in me only let us discuss them temperately and try conscientiously to live up to some ideals of thought and conduct dan smoked on silently for a little then he said with some show of irritation tempering his selfsatisfaction well all i can say is i cannot for the life of me see what you have to complain of i have to complain of your conduct with bertha petterick for one thing beth answered desperately let us be frank with each other i know that you have not been loyal to me i saw you together here on this seat the day you gave her the bracelet i saw you put it on her arm and kiss her and that decided me to go to ilverthorpe dan looked round about him with an altered countenance but nothing that he knew to be a window overlooked the spot neither was it possible to see through the thickness of the privet hedge nor from any other point without being seen you must have imagined it he exclaimed i did not imagine that bracelet beth replied well even if i did give her the bracelet he said youre not going to be nastyminded enough to insinuate that there was anything in that there was deceit in it beth answered and in your whole attitude towards that girl while she was under this roof if we act so that we cannot be open and honest about our dealings with people then there must be something wrong life would be intolerable if it had to be lived among people any one of whom while professing friendship for us was deceiving us in some vital particular from the moment that we act on our own inclinations rather than up to what the noblest of our friends expect of us we have gone wrong but you and i are both young enough dan to put the past behind us and forget it let us start together afresh in another place where there will be no evil associations nothing to vex us by reminding us of unhappy days and let us be loyal to each other and honest and open in every act making due allowance for each other and doing our best to help and please each other we shall be happy i am sure you will see we shall be very happy dan took his cigar out of his mouth and flicked the ash from the end of it with his little finger youd have me give up my appointment here i suppose and the half of my income with it most of all i would have you give up your appointment here she answered earnestly no honest woman can endure to have her husband pandering to vice it would not be so much of a sacrifice either she added for the next session will end this iniquity thanks to the influence of you cursed women he exclaimed thanks to our influence yes she answered dispassionately and to some sense of justice in men if you knew how men talk about women who meddle in these matters he said you would keep out of them i think oh i know the kind of thing they say she answered smiling but the people you mean have no influence nowadays the blatant protest of the debauched against our demand for a higher standard of life is not the voice of the community it is the cry of those who feel their existence threatened who only live upon lies and must be extinguished when the inevitable day of reckoning comes which shall expose them even now the kind of man who catches at every straw of opinion which shall secure to him his sacred carnal rights at no matter what cost of degradation and disease to women is out of date and we pay no attention to him oh women dan jeered that is all very fine but who the devil cares what women think now dont be oldfashioned dan beth answered laughing when women only did what they were told men used to vow at their feet that there was nothing they couldnt accomplish their influence was so great but now that women have proved that what they choose to do they can do men sneer at their pretensions to power and try to depreciate them by comparing the average woman with men in the front rank of their professions really men are disheartening the evening calm had deepened about them a big bright star was shining above the belt of trees and waves of perfume from the flowers made the air a delight to inhale what a heavenly night beth pursued who would live in london when they might be here well thats consistent he exclaimed after entreating me to leave the place this is not the only peaceful spot in the world she said with a little sigh and i would rather live in london even than have you here in an invidious position dan give it up theres a good fellow and learn to look on life from this newer wider point of view you will find interests and pleasures in it you have never even suspected i assure you and you will never regret it for the life of me he said again throwing the end of his cigar into the bushes with an irritated jerk of his armfor the life of me i cannot see what you have to complain of and i shall certainly not give up any bird in the hand for two such birds in the bush as you promise me he rose as he spoke and shook out first one leg and then the other to straighten his trousers im going out he added ive a patient to see ta ta take care of yourself some little time after beths return they were sitting at lunch together and maclure was reading a daily paper matters look bad for that fellow cayley pounce he observed why what has he been doing beth asked poking a fellows eye out with his umbrella dan answered he was talking to a girl in the street one night and got into a row with some roughs and jabbed one in the eye with his umbrella and the fellow died the inquiry is now going on and its likely the coroners jury will bring in a verdict of manslaughter against mr cayley pounce his defence is that he wasnt anywhere near that part of london on that particular night and its a case of mistaken identity but as he refuses to say where he was and produces no evidence by way of an alibi that story wont avail him much what night was it said beth on the th just after midnight dan read out of the paper why that was the night he insisted on escorting me home from the theatre beth exclaimed he did not leave the kilroys until four oclock in the morning then why on earth doesnt he say so dan asked i cant imagine beth said i let him out myself everybody else had gone to bed and im sure of the time because i thought he was never going away and i was tired and i looked at the clock and said its four oclock and i must go to bed dans face had darkened do you mean to say you were sitting up with him alone he demanded yes for my sins beth answered in a tone of disgust the kilroys were out when i returned from the theatre and did not come in till very late and they went straight upstairs supposing i had gone to bed as a rule they come into the library first so mr cayley pounce was left on my hands then said dan pushing his plate away from him with a clatter it is obvious why he is holding his tongue he is determined not to compromise you thank you said beth bridling i should think i am not so easily compromised gad dan ejaculated i dont know what you call easily compromised a man takes you home from a theatre and stays with you alone till four oclock in the morning if that isnt compromising i dont know what is no jury in the world would acquit you and the fellow knows that perfectly well and is holding his tongue to screen you i should think its a great deal more likely hes holding his tongue in order to get the credit of it beth observed drily it is a mere pose he knows i shall have to come forward to clear him if he doesnt explain himself i suppose i must go at once and stop the case but if it were not for his wife i declare i should hesitate what is the form of procedure you will come with me of course i go with you dan exclaimed brutally and see you make a public exhibition of yourself and bring disgrace on my name in a court of justice im damned if i do and whats more if you go you dont return to this house ive too much selfrespect for that you hadnt much of a reputation when i married you and if you lose the little youve got you can go and i shall divorce you my wife must be above suspicion beth folded her serviette slowly while he was speaking and when he stopped she rose from the table it is unfortunate for me she said that the kilroys have gone abroad they know the man and the facts of the case and would have advised me in their absence i must do what seems right without advice i cannot see that i have any choice in the matter you could make it perfectly easy for me by supporting me if you do not support me i must go alone i shall pack up and go to town at once in order to appear in court tomorrow morning and i shall telegraph to roberts the kilroys butler to meet me there and confirm my story there are the coachman and footman too and the police constablewitnesses enough in all conscience you are determined to go dan demanded angrily i must go she rejoined it is going to the devil then said dan deliberately and i always said you would remember you dont return to this house when beth arrived in town she found that there would be no need to appear in the case at all for the kilroys old butler roberts had seen the name of mr alfred cayley pounce in the papers and had unwittingly frustrated his manoeuvre by going to the coroners court himself and volunteering to give evidence he was accompanied by the footman who had been out with the carriage on the night in question and the two together had no difficulty in proving an alibi thus in an ordinary commonplace manner what had promised to be the triumph of his life the moment when he should stand confessed to the world a chivalrous gentleman sacrificing himself to save a lady of prepossessing appearance was converted into another of the many failures of mr alfred cayley pounce this ended the case so far as he and beth were concerned but with regard to dan beth recognised that her position remained the same there was no return for her from the step she had taken and she would have to begin her life anew chapter l beth went out into the world alone knowingly and willingly the prospect had no terrors for her neither did she feel any regret for the past she took it all as a matter of course the days with dan at slane were over but life had still to be lived and she set to work to arrange it and live it to the best of her ability what she most urgently felt being merely that there were things she must see to at once and settle about and that she was rather pushed for time the first thing she did in london was to buy a map so that she might find her way about economically and some newspapers recommended to her by the stationers as likely to have advertisements of respectable lodgings in them she studied these over a cup of coffee and a roll cut all the promising addresses out of the papers found on the map the best way to go by omnibus or railway and then set off on her quest taking the red hammersmith bus first of all and explored west kensington her efforts in that direction were not successful everything she saw at first was dear dingy and disheartening landladies judging her by her appearance would only show her their best rooms when she explained that all she wanted was a nice clean roomy attic because she was poor they became suspicious and declared that she wasnt likely to get anything of that sort in a good neighbourhood beth wondered what the bad neighbourhoods were like if the one she was in were a good one later in the afternoon she found herself on the bayswater side in a street of tall houses off the main thoroughfare they were good houses that must have been built for the families of affluent people and beth was afraid it would be useless to ask at any of them for the modest kind of accommodation which was all she could afford while she hesitated however standing in the street before the one she had come to find the halldoor opened and a young man came out he and beth looked at each other as he ran down the steps and beth saw something so attractive in his face that she spoke to him without hesitation can you tell me she said if they have any attics to let at a moderate price in this house well i got one out of them he said smiling and i guess theres another empty that would just about hold you dress boxes and all ill ring the bell if youll allow me and get ethel maud mary to show you up youll make a better bargain with her than with her ma the door was opened at this moment by a grimy servant gwendolen will you give my compliments to miss ethel if you please the young man said with grave formality and ask her if she will be so good as to speak to me here for a moment gwendolen nodded and retired to the back regions whence presently a plump faircomplexioned yellowhaired young person came hurrying with a look of inquiry on her face oh miss ethel the young man began taking off his hat im real sorry to trouble you but i want to introduce this young lady ive been recommending her to get a room here i know shell find you moderate and comfortable and the situation is one of the best for getting into town beth recognised the wording of the advertisement that had brought her to the house it is handy miss ethel agreed but weve nothing but an attic unlet are you in art miss no literature beth answered with presence of mind ladys i suppose ethel maud mary observed meaning ladys papers and glancing at beths dress youve got to be smart for that and it doesnt leave much for living come this way miss please and thank you mr brock for mentioning us she led the way upstairs talking all the time with cheerful inconsequence hes a real gentleman is mr brock as doubtless you know though an american and dry and you never know which is his fun and in art which is not much to reckon on and thats why i thought that you might be though you do look more like fashion art is apt to be towzled but why goodness knows youre not used to the stairs i see i wish it wasnt such a height up oh i dont mind the height if the price is proportionately low beth said i must live within my means and keep out of debt you know thats a rhymelow and you know did you do it on purpose ethel maud mary asked with interest no said beth then thats for luck said ethel youll keep out of debt all right i see it in your face and i know a face when i see it theyll keep you on the ladys for the sake of your appearance even if youre not much use youre elegant and speak nice and thats what they want to go about for them particularly if its a man if what is a man beth asked the editor you know we ad a young lady here who used to say shed undertake to get an extra halfsovereign out of any editor in town but editresses there was no managing which is yours i dont know yet said beth ive only just arrived what are you getting a pound a week beth answered that being her exact income but i have a little by me besides to keep me going till i get started you know ethel maud mary nodded her yellow head intelligently and began to climb the narrow flight of stairs which led to the attics moving her lips the while as if she were making calculations there was no carpet on this last flight of stairs but the boards were well washed and the attic itself smelt sweet and clean this is it ethel explained mr brock is in the other next door theres only two of them this is the biggest room but the other is north and has the biggest window and being in art hes got to think of the light if you look out there to the right youll see some green in the park youll like the park its no distance if youre a walker now just lets see ive been calculating about the money mr brock pays fourteen shillings but youll not be able to afford more than seven out of a pound you shall have it for seven but surely that will be a loss to you beth exclaimed ethel sat herself down on the side of the bed and smiled up at her ill not pretend we couldnt get more if we waited she said but waitings a loss and were doing very well downstairs and can afford to pick and choose youll find in business that it pays better in the end to get a good tenant you can trust wholl stay than one who gives you double the amount for a month and then goes off with the blankets you dont deceive me a bit said beth sitting down opposite to her on a canebottomed chair your goodheartedness shines out of your face but im not going to take a mean advantage of it theres an honest atmosphere in this house that would suit me i feel and i am sure i shall do well here but all the same i wont come unless you make a bargain with me if i take the rooms for such a small sum now while i am poor will you let me make it up to you when i succeed i shall succeed the last words burst from her involuntarily forced from her with emphasis in spite of herself thats what i like to hear thats spirit that is ethel maud mary exclaimed nodding approvingly youll do all right so its a bargain washings included you know you didnt bring your box did you no i left my luggage at charing cross when i arrived last night i slept at the hotel beth answered at the charing cross hotel gracious that must have cost you a small fortune i didnt know what to do beth explained apologetically you should have tried the strand surrey street and there youd have got bed and breakfast for five shillings and thats more than enough however its no use crying over spilt milk youll have to fetch your luggage i suppose you can go by train from nottinghill gate to charing cross its about as cheap as the bus and much quicker ill come with you and show you the way if you like a breath of fresh air will do me good yes do come beth answered gratefully glad of the kindly human fellowship what is your name may i ask ethel maud mary gill and what is yours if you please elizabeth caldwell maclure beth had emptied her secret chamber and packed all her little possessions before she left slane she had sometimes suspected that dan would be glad of an excuse to get rid of her to relieve himself of the cost of her keep and that he would do it in some gross way and so as to put all the blame of it upon her if possible she also expected she was therefore prepared to consider the matter settled the moment he threatened her and would have felt it useless to remonstrate even had she been inclined but she was not inclined she had for years done everything patiently that any one in any code of morality could expect of her in such a marriage and no good had come of it as daniel maclure was so would he remain for ever and to associate with him intimately without being coarsened and corrupted was impossible beth had fought hard against that and had suffered in the struggle but she had been lowered in spite of herself and she knew it and resented it she was therefore as glad to leave maclure as he was to get rid of her and already it seemed as if with her married life a great hampering weight had fallen from her and left her free to face a promising future with nothing to fear and everything to hope poverty was pleasant in her big bright attic where all was clean and neat about her there she could live serenely and purify her mind by degrees of the garbage with which dans habitual conversation had polluted it the settlingin occupied her for some days and the housekeeping was a puzzle when she first began she had only been able to bring the most precious of her possessions her books and papers and clothes enough for the moment away with her from slane the rest she had left ready packed to be sent to her when she should be settled when she wrote to maclure for them she sent him some housekeeping keys she had forgotten to leave behind and an inventory of everything she had had charge of which she had always kept carefully checked he acknowledged the receipt of this letter and informed her that he had gone over the inventory himself and found some of the linen in a bad state and one silver teaspoon missing beth replied that the linen had been fairly worn out but she could not account for the missing spoon and offered to pay for it dr maclure replied by return of post on a postcard that the price was seven shillings beth sent him a postal order for that amount he then wrote to say that the cost of the conveyance of the luggage to the station was halfacrown beth sent him halfacrown and then the correspondence ended she received letters from some of her relations however to whom maclure had hastened to send his version of the story poor old aunt grace mary was the only one who did not accept it write and tell me the truth of the matter my dear she said the others took it for granted that beth could have nothing to say for herself and her brother jim was especially indignant and insulting his opinion of her being couched in the most offensive language having lived with disreputable women all his life he had the lowest possible opinion of the whole sex his idea being that any woman would misconduct herself if she had the chance and was not well watched he warned beth not to apply to him if she should be starving or to claim his acquaintance should she meet him in the street beths cheeks burned with shame when she read this letter and some of the others she received and she hastened to destroy them but the horror they set up in her brought on a nervous crisis such as she had suffered from in the early days when dan first brought her down to his own low level of vice and suspicion and turned her deadly sick she answered none of these letters and by dint of resolutely banishing all thought of them and of the writers she managed in time to obliterate the impression but she had to live through some terrible hours before she succeeded once settled in her attic home she returned to the healthy regular industrious habits which had helped her so much in the days when she had been at her best her life was of the simplest but she had to do almost everything for herself such time as gwendolen could command for attendance being wholly insufficient to keep the attic in order her daily duties kept her in health however by preventing indolence either of mind or body and so were of infinite use she had added a few things to the scanty furniture of her attica new bath a secondhand writingtable bookshelves with a cupboard beneath for cups saucers and glasses and a grandfather chairall great bargains as ethel maud mary assured her ethel maud marys kindness was inexhaustible she took beth to the secondhand shop herself and showed her that the writingtable and bookshelves would be as good as new when they were washed and rubbed up a bit and all the grandfather chair wanted was a new cretonne cover at sixpence a yardfour yards two shillings and she could make it herself she also advised beth to buy a little oilstove the only one she knew of that really didnt smell if you attended to it yourself and a tin to hold oil for itcrystal oil at sevenpence a gallon the best you can do all you want with that and keep yourself warm enough too when the weathers bad she said and theres no waste for you can turn it out when youve done with it fires are too dear for you at sixpence a scuttle for coals and theyre dirtier besides and a trouble to light and look after youll find it as good as a lamp too if youre doing nothing particular at night when beth had made a cosy corner of the window for work arranged her books put her ornaments about on mantelpiece and brackets hung her pictures and the draperies she had used in her secret chamber spread the rugs and covered the grandfather chair her attic looked inviting the character of her little possessions gave the poor place a distinction which enchanted ethel maud mary beth fetched up the water overnight for her bath in the morning and made coffee for her breakfast on the little oilstove she lived principally on bread and butter eggs sardines salad and slices of various meats bought at a cookshop and carried home in a paper sometimes when she felt she could afford it she had a hot meal at an eatinghouse for the good of her health but she scarcely required it for she never felt stronger in her life and so long as she could get good coffee for her breakfast and tea for her evening meal she missed none of the other things to which she had been accustomed she made delicious coffee in a tin coffeepot and brewed the best tea she had ever drunk in brown earthenware which ethel maud mary considered the best thing going for tea she used to join beth in a cup up in the attic but she never came emptyhanded dull wet days likely to be depressing were the ones on which her yellow head appeared oftenest at the top of the attic stairs miss maclure may i come in she would say after knocking and beth would answer rising from her work with a smile of welcome yes by all means im delighted to see you you take the big chair and ill make the tea im dying for a cup then ethel maud mary would uncover something she held in her hand which would prove to be cakes or hot buttered toast and watercresses or a bag of shrimps and some thin bread and butter and beth sparkling at the kindness would exclaim i never was so spoilt in my life to which ethel maud mary would rejoin therell not be much to boast about between two of us beth was busy with another book by this time but found the work more of a task and less of a pleasure than it used to be ethel maud mary still took it for granted that she was a journalist and showed no interest in her work beyond hoping that she got her pay regularly and would soon be making more beth wondered sometimes when the little book which had been accepted in the summer would appear and what she would get for it if anything and she thought of inquiring but she put it off her new work took all her time and strength and wearied her so that nothing else seem to signify besides ethel maud mary and gwendolen the only person she had to talk to was arthur milbank brock the young american her neighbour in the next attic she met him coming upstairs with his hat in his hand soon after her instalment and was even more attracted by his face than she had been when she first saw him in the street youve settled in by this time i hope he said yes and very comfortably too thanks to you beth answered ah ethel maud marys a good sort he replied golden hair blue eyes and all she has the looks of a ladys novel and the heart of a holy mother her grammar and spelling are defective but her sense is sound i wouldnt give much for her opinion of a work of art but id take her advice in a difficulty if it came anywhere within range of her experience she knows this world well but picks her steps through it in such a way that i guess shell reach the threshold of the next with nice clean shoes he stepped aside for beth to pass when he had spoken and stood a moment watching her thoughtfully as she descended and may you too he said to himself as he turned to go up then perceiving that the hope implied a doubt he began to wonder whence it came as beth went out she reflected on his face on a certain gravity which heightened its refinement it was a young face but worn as by some past trial or present care and with an habitually sober expression which contrasted notably with the cheery humour of his speech adding point to it as is frequently the case with his countrymen he wore his thick brown hair rather longer than is usual but was clean shaven his features were delicate and regular his eyes deep and dark his head large and finely formed in figure he was tall and slim and in his whole appearance there was something almost ethereal as of a young poet or philosopher still moving among his fellowmen yet knowing himself to be prematurely smitten set apart and consecrated to death by some insidious slow disease from which there is no escape this was beths first notion of him but she always hoped it was fanciful she thought about him a good deal in the solitary walks which were her principal recreation when she was tired of working or wanted to think she used to go out and wander alone at first she was afraid to venture far for she had always been assured that she had no head for topography and would never be able to find her way and so long as she went about under escort with some one to save her the necessity of observing she never knew where she was now however that she had to look after herself she found no difficulty after her first timidity wore off and this little experience taught her why it is that the intelligence of women seems childishly defective as regards many of the details of the business of life they have the faculty but when they are not allowed to act for themselves it remains imperfectly developed or is altogether atrophied for want of exercise it was in these days of peace that the ugly downward droop of the corners of beths mouth which had always spoilt the expression of her face entirely disappeared and her firmset lips softened into keeping with the kindliness of her beautiful grey eyes but she still wanted much loving to bring out the natural tenderness which had been so often and so cruelly nipped back in its growth beth had been born to be a woman but circumstances had been forcing her to become a career strangely enough some of the scenes she saw during her rambles in london helped to soften her while she was under her husbands influence she saw the evil only and was filled with bitterness london meant for her in those days the dirt and squalor of the poor the depravity of the rich the fiendish triumph of the lust of man and the horrible degradation of her own sex but now that her mind was recovering its tone and she could see with her own eyes she discovered the good at war with the evil the courage and kindliness of the poor signs of the growth of better feeling in the selfish and greedy rich the mighty power of purity at war with the license of man and the noble attitude of women wherever injustice was rife the weak oppressed and the wronged remained unrighted then her heart expanded with pity and instead of the torment of unavailing hate she began to revive in the glow of strengthening gleams of hope it was in those days too that she learnt to appreciate the wonder and beauty of the most wonderful and beautiful city ever seen and her eyes grew deep from long looking and earnest meditating upon it she occasionally experienced the sickening sensation of being followed about by one of those specimens of mankind so significantly called sly dogs by their fellowmen they made themselves particularly objectionable in kensington gardens and hyde park but she found that an appeal to a policeman or a parkkeeper or to any decent workman was enough to stop the nuisance genuine respect for women which is an antidote to the moral rottenness that promotes the decay of nations and portends the indefinite prolongation of the life of a race is of slow growth but it is steadily increasing among the englishspeaking peoples during her rambles beth composed long letters to her friends but somehow none of them were ever written she had managed to send a few hurried lines of explanation to mrs kilroy in the midst of her packing before she left slane as she had not known where she would be she had asked angelica to address her letters to slane to be forwarded but no reply had come as yet and beth was just a little sore and puzzled about it however she knew that what with her public and private duties angelica was overwhelmed with work and might well have overlooked the fact that she had not answered beths letter so beth determined to write again time passed however and she got into such a groove of daily duties that anything outside the regular routine required a special effort which she always postponed and letters were quite outside the regular routine after the first no one wrote to her except the old lawyer who sent her halfyearly dividend and she had written to no one she had dropped altogether out of her own world yet because of her work and of her power to interest herself in every one about her and to appreciate the goodness of her humblest friends her life was full and she had not known a moments discontent little things were great pleasures now to be able to get on the top of an omnibus at piccadilly circus when the sun was setting and ride to hammersmith broadway engrossed in watching the wonderful narrow cloudscape above the streets changing from moment to moment in form and colour the mystery of the hazy distances the impression of the great buildings and tall irregular blocks of houses appearing all massed together among the trees from different points of view and taking on fine architectural effects now transformed into huge grey palaces large and distinct now looming in the mist sketchily with uncertain outlines and all the fascination of the fabrics innocent of detail that confront the dreamer in enchanted woods or lure him to the edge of fairy lakes with twinkling lights all multiplied by their own reflection in the water beth had rolled in that direction in luxurious carriages often and never joyed in the scene her mind being set on other thingsthings prosaic such as what she should wear or whether she was late scraps of society gossip conversations which had satiated without satisfying her and remained in her mind to be items of weariness if not of actual irritation she had noticed in those days how very seldom she saw a happy face in a carriage unless it was a very young face full of expectation even the very coachmen and footmen in the park looked enervated as the long lines of carriages passed in wearisome procession and in everything there had been that excess which leaves no room for healthy desire at first the shop windows set out with tasteless profusion no article in the heterogeneous masses telling however beautiful each being eclipsed by the other in the horrible glut had interested her and she had looked at everything but she soon sickened at the sight the vast quantities of things crowded together robbed her of all pleasure of choice and made her feel as if she had eaten too much occasionally she would see two or three things of beauty displayed with art in a large window but everywhere else excessive quantity produced indifference disgust or satiety according to the mood of the moment and even in the days of her poverty and obscurity when her faculties were sharpened into proper appreciation by privation those congested windows teeming with jewels with wearing apparel with all things immoderately set up a sort of mental dyspepsia that was distressing and she was glad to turn away to relieve the consequent brainfag but by degrees she became accustomed to the tasteless profusion it did not please her any better but at all events it did not afflict her by always obtruding itself upon her attention she saw it not in detail but as a part of the picture and she found in the new view of london and of london life from the top of omnibuses more of the unexpected of delight of beauty for the eyes and of matter for the mind of humour pathos poetry of tragedy and comedy suggestive glimpses caught in passing and vividly recollected than she could have conceived possible when she rolled along with society on carriage cushions soothed by the stultifying ease into temporary sensuous apathy winter set in suddenly and with terrible severity that year london became a city of snow cruelly cold but beautiful all its ugliness disguised by the white mantle all its angles softened all its charms enhanced commonplace squares parks gardens and dirty streets were transformed into fairyland by the delicate disposition of snow in festoons on doorpost and railing ledge and lintel from roof to cellar the trees especially all frosted with shining filigree were a wonder to look upon and beth would wander about the alleys in kensington gardens and gaze at the glory of the white world under the sombre grey of the murky clouds piled up in awesome magnificence until she ached with yearning for some word of human speech some way to express it to make it manifest she returned one afternoon somewhat wet and weary from one of her rambles the little window of her attic was half snowed up and the gloom under the sloping roof struck a chill to her heart as she entered but when she had lighted the lamp a new investment that helped up the temperature besides giving light and set her little oilstove going with the kettle on it her surroundings took on an air of homely comfort that was grateful as she busied herself preparing the tea she noticed that her neighbour in the next attic was coughing a good deal and then it occurred to her that she had not seen him about lately and she wondered if he could be ill the thought of a young man of small means ill alone in a london lodging probably without a bell in the room and certainly with no one anxious to answer it if he should ring though not cheering is stimulating to the energy of the benevolent and beth went downstairs to ask as soon as the notion occurred to her mr brock there now gwendolen exclaimed in dismay if i didnt forget altogether ive so much to see to and the missus ill in bed with bronchitis and miss ethel run off her feet and not too fit erself with that cold as ud be called influenza if it wasnt for frightening the lodgers whatever it is its going through the ouse and mr brock seems to have got it bad e ast me when i went wiv is shyvingwater this morning to tike im some coals and mike im some tea an i never thought no more about iti clean forgot this morning beth cried why that was at eight oclock and now it is four ill get em at once gwendolen said with contrition but the girl herself looked worn to death she had been on her feet since early morning and had no prospect of a rest till she dropped on her bed late at night too exhausted to undress never mind beth said give me the coals and ill carry them up and see to the rest i have nothing else to do bless you gwendolen muttered beth found mr brock in bed with bright eyes and burning spots of colour on each cheek a lamp was burning beside him when he saw who it was he raised his eyebrows but smiled at the same time as if he were both surprised and pleased the room struck cold to beth what no fire she exclaimed i tried to light the pesky thing he said but it wouldnt burn gwendolen forgot you altogether beth said she has far too much to do poor girl and i have only just heard that you were ill why didnt you call me he smiled again we are all of the same family here you know beth said the great human family you had only to say sister and i should have come the smile faded from his lips but it was replaced by another expression which when she saw it caused beth to ejaculate inwardly surely of such are the kingdom each had seen in the others face at the same time something there is no human utterance to describe and recognising it had reverently held their peace beth fetched her oilstove first with the kettle on it and while the water was boiling she cut bread and butter and lighted the fire well have tea together if you please she said cheerfully ive a horrible suspicion that youve had nothing to eat or drink all day her sympathy recalled his pleasant patient smile my appetite is not devouring he said but my thirst is talk about selling ones birthright id sell my brains i believe for a cup of tea at this moment theres a bowl full for nothing then beth rejoined sip it while i boil you an egg he took the bowl in both hands and tried the tea oh he exclaimed with a longdrawn sigh its nectar its mead its nepenthe its all the drinks ever brewed for all the gods in one but im afraid to touch it lest i should finish it dont be afraid then said beth for youll find it like liquor for the gods in another respect it will be to be had whenever you want it whats the matter did i make lament he asked i didnt know it but im all one ache i cant lie still for it and i cant move without adding to it ive been watching the icefloes on the river from the embankment and bridges by all lights lately i never saw finer effectssuch colour its wonderful what colour there is under your sombre sky if you know how to look for it and it has the great advantage over the colour other countries teem with of being unexpected its not obvious you have to look out for it but when you have found it you rejoice in it as in something rare and precious and it excites you to enthusiasm beyond your wontwhich should prevent chills but it doesnt as witness my aches beth felt his hand and found it dry and burning the doctor is the next and only thing for you young man after this frugal meal she said and ill go and fetch him i hope to goodness these are the right things to give you he objected to the doctor but she paid no attention to his remonstrance and when she had done all she could think of for the moment she put on her wet boots and walking things again got the address of a good man from ethel maud mary and sallied out into the snow once more rheumatic fever was the doctors diagnosis and his directions to beth concluded with a long list of expensive medical comforts which it seemed were absolutely necessary she went out again when he had gone and brought back everything toiling up the long flights of stairs with both arms full breathless but cheerful and having set all in order for usesheets of medicated cottonwool medicines valentines extract clinical thermometer and chartshe settled herself to watch the patient the clock and the temperature of the room which had to be equable with the exactness and method of a capable nurse before the household retired she went downstairs to fetch more coals fearing they might run short in the night hes ad one scuttle today gwendolen reminded her warningly he must have two more then if necessary said beth theyre sixpence a scuttle you know gwendolen remonstrated two for a shilling and no charge for delivery said beth as she toiled up the long ascent once more with her heavy burden eh it would be a gay glad world if they all took it like you gwendolen muttered as she stood with the pencil in her mouth studying the slate that hung outside the coalcellar and let her generosity war with her accuracy and honesty for a little before she made two more strokes on the line that began with the name of brock and no sooner done than regretted i wish to goodness id put em down to old piggot and mother hauseman she thought theyd never miss the money and it ud be a good deed for the likes of them to help their betters and might likely profit their own souls though unbeknown for many weeks beth watched beside the sick mans bed doing all that was possible to ease his pain day and night snatching brief intervals of rest when she could and concealing her weariness at all times she used to wonder at the young mans uncomplaining fortitude his gentleness gratitude and unselfish concern about her fatigue even when he was at his worst he would struggle back to consciousness in order to entreat her to lie down and when to please him she had settled herself on a little couch there was in his room he would make a superhuman effort to keep still as long as his flickering consciousness lasted there was only one thing he was ever exacting aboutto keep her in sight so long as he could see her he was satisfied and would lie for hours patiently controlling himself for fear of disturbing her by uttering exclamations or making other signs of suffering but when she had to leave him alone he broke down and moaned in his weakness and pain for her to come back and help him the doctor having declared that the northeast aspect of his attic was all against the patient beth insisted on changing with him and as soon as he could be moved she ethel maud mary and gwendolen with the doctors help carried him into her room in a sheet an awkward manoeuvre because of his length which made it hard to turn him on the narrow landing his weight was nothing for he was mere skin and bone by that timeall eyes as beth used to tell him it was christmas eve when they moved him and late that night beth kept her vigil by him sitting over the fire with her elbows on her knees and her face between her hands listening dreamily to the clang and clamour of the churchbells which floated up to her over the snow mellowed by distance and fullfraught with manifold associations as she sat there she pondered she thought of the long way she had drifted from the days when she knelt in spirit at the call of the bells and lost herself in happy prayer she thought of her husbands hypocrisy and the way in which when it dawned upon her her own faith had melted from her and she pondered on the difference it would have made if only she had been married earlyjust to a good man it would not have been necessary for her to have loved himnot with passiononly to have relied upon him some one to trust she craved for more than some one to love yet she allowed that a loveless marriage is a mock marriage she did not regret the loss of her conventional faith but she wished she could join the congregation just for the human fellowship she felt the need of union of some central station a centre of peace unlike the church the house of disunion without knowing it she leant to quakercatholicism the name assumed for her religious principles by caroline foxquakercatholicism having direct spiritual teaching for its distinctive dogma what are you thinking about arthur brock said suddenly from the bed beth started she thought he was asleep god she said with a gasp and going to church she added laughing at her own abruptness i was wanting a church to go to you dont belong to the established church then he said well i dont go to church myself but i make a difference on sundays i dont work and i read another kind of book it is my day for the plains of heaven i should like to be there all the time if i could manage it but i cant not being a monk in a cell when i can i make the ascent however with the help of the books that take one there i used to read religious books too said beth but i found little illumination in them most of them being but the dry husks of the subject uninformed of the spirit containing no vital spark and stained with blood how he exclaimed this god of the hebrews beth began looking dreamily into the fire what is his history he loved cruelty and bloodshed the innocent animals first suffered in his service but not content with that he went from bad to worse as men do and ended by demanding human sacrifice the sacrifice of his own son and for that specially we are required to adore him although it must be clear to the commonest capacity today that the worship of such a deity is devilworship i do not say there is no god i only say this is not godthis bloodlover this sonslayer this blind omniscience this impotent omnipotence this merciful cruelty this meek arrogance this peaceful combatant this is not god but man the mind of man wars with the works of god to mar them man tries to make us believe that he is made in the image of god but what happened was just the reverse man was of a better nature originally a more manifold nature he had intellect for a toy to play with on earth and spirit for a power to help him to heaven but instead of toiling to strengthen his spirit he preferred to play with his intellect and he played until he became so expert in the use of it and so interested in the game that he forgot his origin and then it was that he projected an image of himself into space and was so delighted with his own appearance from that point of view that he called it god and fell down and worshipped it if you would understand man consider god if you would know his god study man arthur brock reflected for a little what you say sounds real smart he said at last and theres a kind of glamour in your words that dazzles and prevents one seeing just how much they mean at first it is true that religion culminates in human sacrifice both here and in africa and for refinement of horror we have here the literal bloody sacrifice of a son by his father but that is not god as you say that is the ultimate of the priest and the priest is the same at all times in all ages beneath all veneers of civilisation his credit depends upon a pretence to power he is not a humble seeker after truth but a bigoted upholder of error and an impudent timeserver he destroys the scientific discoverer in one age in the next he finds his own existence is threatened because he refuses to acknowledge that the discoverer was right then he confesses the truth and readjusts his hocuspocus to suit it he does not ask us to pin our faith to fancies which seem real to a child in its infancy yet he would have us credulous about those which were the outcome of the intellectual infancy of the race what he cant get over in himself is the absence of any sense of humour im real sorry for him at times and i tell him so beth smiled i could not be so kindly courteous she said some things make me fierce the kingdom of heaven is or is not within us i believe and half the time i know it is not in me because there is no room for anything in me but the hate and rage that rend me for horror of all the falsehood injustice and misery i know of and cannot prevent a sense of humour would save the church perhaps but im too sore to see it all i can say is your religion to me is horrifyinghuman sacrifice and devilworship survivals from an earlier day welded on to our own time and assorting ill with it i would not accept salvation at the hands of such futile omnipotence such cruel mercy such bloodstained justice the sight of suffering was grateful to man when the world was young as it still is to savages but we revolt from it now we should not be happy in heaven as the saved were said to be in the old tales within sight of the sinners suffering in hell which is to say that there is more of christ in us now than there was in the days of old he said speaking dispassionately and with the confident deliberation of one who takes time to think i believe those old tales were founded on muddleheaded confusion of mind in the days when dreams were as real to mankind as the events of life there are obscure tribes still on earth who cannot distinguish between what they have done and what they have only dreamt they did and probably every race has gone through that stage of development i dont know if excessive piety be a disease of the nerves as some say although what is piety in one generation does appear to be perversity in the next as witness the sons of the clergy and other children of pious people who dont answer to expectation as a rule and i dont go much on churches or creeds or faith in this personality or that the old ideas have lost their hold upon me as they have upon you but that is no reason why we should give up the old truths that have been in the world for all time the positive right and wrong which are facts not ideas i believe that there is good and evil that the one is at war with the other always and that good can do no evil evil no good ive got beyond all the dogma and fiddlefaddle of the intellect with which the church has overlaid the spirit and all the ceremonial so useful and necessary for individual souls in early stages of development i used to think if i could find a religion with no blood in it i would embrace it now i feel sure that it does not matter what the expression of our religious nature is so that it be religious religion is an attitude of mind the attitude of prayer which includes reverence for things holy and deep devotion to them i would not lose that for anythingthe right of appeal but now when i think of our father in heaven i do not despise our mother on earth beth sat some time looking thoughtfully into the fire go to sleep she said at last abruptly you ought not to be talking at this time of night i wish you would go to sleep yourself he said as he settled himself obediently for i lose half the comfort of being saved while you sit up there suffering for me the expression was not too strong for the strain beth had to put upon herself in those days for she had no help ethel maud mary and gwendolen felt for her and her patient as they said but there of necessity their kindness ended the other lodgers kept gwendolen for ever running to and fro each seemed to think she had nobody else to look after and it was seldom indeed that any of them noticed her weariness or took pity on her beth did everything for herself fetched the coals from the cellar the water from the bathroom swept and dusted cleaned the grate ran out to do the shopping and returned to do the cooking and mending ethel maud mary stole the time to run up occasionally to show sympathy but her own poor little hands were overfull what with her mother ill in bed both ends to be made to meet and lodgers uncertain in money matters she lost all her plumpness that winter her roseleaf complexion faded to the colour of dingy wax and her yellow hair so brightly burnished when she had time to brush it became towzled and dull but her heart beat as bravelykind as ever and she never gave in she climbed up one day in a hurry to mr brocks room which beth occupied snatching a moment to make inquiries and receive comfort and as soon as she entered she subsided suddenly on to a chair out of breath how you do it a dozen times a day miss maclure i cant think she gasped those stairs have taught me what servants suffer beth said as if that at all events were a thing for which to be thankful youd not have driven em even if you hadnt known what they suffer said ethel maud mary thats the worst of this world all the hard lessons have got to be learnt by the people who never needed them to make them good while the bad folk get off for nothing i dont know about not needing them said beth but i do know this that every sorrowful experience i have ever had has been an advantage to me sooner or later i wish i could believe that mas temper would be an advantage to me ethel maud mary said sighing shes that wearing but there poor dear shes sick and theres no keeping the worries from her theres only you and mr brock in the house just now that pays up to the day so you may guess what it is hes getting on nicely now i suppose but you shouldnt be sitting here in the cold a shawl dont make the difference its the air you breathe and you ought to have your oilstove going isnt the fire enough for him i cant think so many degrees it need be in his room always when theres no degree at all in yours oh im hardy said beth i never was better you look it ethel maud mary said sarcastically like a pauper just out of prison what are you worrying about beeftea said beth and so she was and bread and butter fuel light and lodgingeverything in fact that meant money for the money was all but done and she had had a shock on the subject lately that had shaken her considerably she had spread out a newspaper to save the carpet and was kneeling on the floor one morning in front of the window cleaning and filling the little oilstove and arthur was lying contentedly watching hersuperintending her domestic duties he used to call it that being all that he was equal to in his extreme weakness just then youre a notable housekeeper he said i shouldnt have expected you from your appearance to be able to cook and clean as you do i used to do this kind of thing as a child to help a lazy servant we had bless her beth answered the cooking and cleaning she taught me have stood me in good stead if you had a daughter how would you bring her up he asked beth opened the piece of paper with which she was cleaning the oil off the stove and regarded it thoughtfully i would bring her up in happy seclusion to begin with she said she should have all the joys of childhood and then an education calculated to develop all her intellectual powers without forcing them and at the same time to fit her for a thoroughly normal womans life childhood girlhood wifehood motherhood each with its separate duties and pleasures all complete i would have her happy in each steadfast prudent selfpossessed methodical economical and if she had the capacity for any special achievement i think that such an education would have developed the strength of purpose and selfrespect necessary to carry it through i would also have her to know thoroughly the world that she has to live in so that she might be ready to act with discretion in any emergency i should in fact want to fit her for whatever might befall her and then leave her in confidence to shape her own career the life for a woman to long forand a man too i thinkis a life of simple duties and simple pleasures a normal life but i only call that life normal which is suited to the requirements of the womans individual temperament you dont clamour for more liberty then it depends upon what you mean by that the cry for more liberty is sometimes the cry of the cowardly anxious to be excused from their share of the duties and labours of life and it is also apt to be a cry not for liberty but for licence one must discriminate but how by the character and principles of the people you have to deal withobviously she had lighted her little oilstove by this time and set a saucepan of water on it to boil then she fetched a chopping board and a piece of raw beefsteak which she proceeded to cut up into dice and put into a stone jar until it was crammed full her sensitive mouth showed some shrinking from the rawness and her white fingers were soon dyed red but she prepared the meat none the less carefully for that when the jar was filled and the contents seasoned she put it in the pot on the stove for the heat to extract the juice what is it going to be today he asked beefjelly she said you must be tired of beeftea im tired of nothing you do for me he rejoined this is the homiest time ive had in england beth smiled in spite of poverty anxiety and fatigue it was the homiest time she had had since aunt victorias death and she loved it now that she had some one she could respect and care for dependent on her whose every look and word expressed appreciation of her devotion the time never hung heavily on her hands as it used to do in the married days that had been so long in the living it was all as congenial as it was new to her this close association with a man of the highest character and the most perfect refinement she had never before realised that there could be such men so heroic in suffering so unselfish and so good and this discovery had stimulated her strangelyfilled her with hope strengthened her love of life and made everything seem worth while she went on with her work in silence after that last remark of his and he continued to watch her with all an invalids interest in the little details of his narrow life it would be a real relief to me to be able to get up and do all that for you he finally observed i dont feel much of a man lying here and letting you work for me this is womans work beth said womans work and mans work are just anything they can do for each other he rejoined i wonder if i should get on any quicker with a change of treatment resignation is generally prescribed for rheumatism and a variety of drugs which distract attention from the seat of pain to other parts of the person and so relieve the mind my head is being racked just now by that last dose i took i should like to try salisbury what is salisbury beth asked principally beef and hot water to begin with he replied youll find a little work on the subject among my books beth read the volume and then said you shall try salisbury it is easy enough yes he answered it is easy enough with a nurse like you but in order to carry out the treatment some things had to be bought and this led to the discovery which was a shock to beth arthurs income depended principally upon the pictures he sold and no more money came in after he fell ill he had had some by him but not nearly so much as he supposed and it was all gone now in spite of the utmost economy on beths part her own too was running short but she had not troubled about that because she still had some of her secret hoard to fall back upon she had left it in one of the boxes which were sent on after her from slanea box which she had not opened until now when she wanted the money the money however was not there she searched and searched but in vain all she found was the little bag that had contained it she was stunned by the discovery and sat on the floor for a little with the contents of the box all scattered about her trying to account for her loss then all at once a vision of maclure as she had seen him on one occasion with the bunch of duplicate keys peering into her dressbasket with horrid intentness flashed before her but she banished it resolutely with the inevitable conclusion to which it pointed she would not allow her mind to be sullied by such a suspicion and as to the money since it was lost why should she waste her time worrying about it she had better set herself to consider how to procure some more she had still some of arthur brocks but that she kept that she might be able to tell him truthfully that it was not all done when he asked about ita pious fraud which relieved his mind and kept him from retarding his recovery by attempting to begin work again before he was fit for it what money she had of her own would last but a little longer and how to get more was the puzzle her evening dresses had been in the box which she had just unpacked and while she was still sitting on the floor amongst them cogitating ethel maud mary came into the attic out of breath to ask how she was getting on why she exclaimed in admiration of beths finery youve got some clothes theyd fetch something those frocks if you sold them then tell me where to sell them for money i must have beth rejoined precipitately and its no use keeping gowns they only go out of fashion ethel maud mary suggested as if she thought beth should have an excuse gwendolen would manage it best shes great at a bargain and theres a place not far from here id begin with the worst if i was you advise me then theres a dear said beth and ethel maud mary knelt down beside her and proceeded to advise only a few shillings was the result of the first transaction but the better dresses had good trimmings on them and real lace which fetched something as ethel maud mary declared it would if sold separately so with the strictest selfdenial beth was still able to pay her way and provide for the sick mans necessities from the time she put him on the salisbury treatment he suffered less and began to gain strength but the weather continued severe and beth suffered a great deal herself from exposure and cold and privations of all kinds she used to be so hungry sometimes that she hurried past the provision shops when she had to go out lest she should not be able to resist the temptation to go in and buy good food for herself if her sympathy with the poor could have been sharpened it would have been that winter by some of the sights she saw sometimes she was moved by pity to wrath and rebellion as on one occasion when she was passing a house where there had evidently been a fashionable wedding the road in front of the house and the red cloth which covered the steps and pavement were thickly strewed with rice and on this a band of starving children had pounced and were scraping it up with their bony claws of hands clutching it from each other fighting for it and devouring it raw while a supercilious servant looked on as though he were amused beths heart was wrung by the sight and she hurried by cursing the greedy rich who wallow in luxury while children starve in the streets in a squalid road which she had often to cross there was a butchers shop where great sides of good red beef with yellow fat were hung in the doorway coming home one evening after dark she noticed in front of her a gaunt little girl who carried a baby on her arm and was dragging a small child along by the hand when they came to the butchers shop they stopped to look up at the great sides of beef and the younger child stole up to one of them laid her little hand upon it caressingly then kissed it the butcher came out and ordered them off and beth pursued her way through the mire with tears in her eyes she had suffered temptation herself that same evening she had to pass an italian eatinghouse where she used to go sometimes before she had any one depending on her to have a twoshilling dinnera good meal decently served now when she was always hungry this was one of the places she had to hurry past but even when she did not look at it she thought about it and was tormented by the desire to go in and eat enough just for once visions of thick soup and fried fish with potatoes and roast beef with salad whetted an appetite that needed no whetting and made her suffer an ache of craving scarcely to be controlled that day had been a particularly hungry one the coffee was done every precious tealeaf she had to husband for arthur and the butter had also to be carefully economised because a good deal was required for his crisp toast which was unpalatable without it beth lived principally on the crusts she cut off the toast when they were very stale she steeped them in hot water and sweetened them with brown sugar this mess reminded her of aunt victorias breadpuddings and the happy summer when they lived together and she learnt to sit upright on chippendale chairs she would like to have talked to arthur of those tender memories but she could not trust herself being weak the tears were too near the surface that day she had turned against her crusts even with sugar and had felt no hunger until she got out into the air when an imperious craving for food seized upon her suddenly and she made for the italian restaurant as if she had been driven the moment she got inside the place however she recovered her selfpossession she would die of hunger rather than spend two precious shillings on herself while there was that poor boy at home suffering in silence gratefully content with the poorest fare she brought him always making much of all she did beth got no farther than the counter i want something savoury for an invalid she said that evening for the first time arthur sat up by the fire in the grandfather chair with a blanket round him and enjoyed a dainty little feast which had been especially provided as he understood in honour of the event but why wont you have some yourself he remonstrated well you see beth answered i went to the italian restaurant when i was out oh did you he said thats right i wish you would go every day and have a good hot meal will you promise me ill go every day that i possibly can beth answered smiling brightly as she saw him fallto contentedly with the appetite of a thriving convalescent practising pious frauds upon him had become a confirmed habit by this timeof which she should have been ashamed but instead she felt a satisfying sense of artistic accomplishment when they answered and was only otherwise affected with a certain wonderment at the very slight and subtle difference there is between truth and falsehood as conveyed by the turn of a phrase but now the money ran shorter and shorter she had nothing much left to sell and it was a question whether she could possibly hold out until her halfyears dividend was due perhaps the old lawyer would let her anticipate it for once she wrote and asked him but while she was waiting for a reply the pressure became acute out of doors one day walking along dejectedly wondering what she should do when she came to her last shilling her eye rested on a placard in the window of a fashionable hairdressers shop and she read mechanically a good price given for fine hair she passed on however and was halfway down the street before it occurred to her that her own hair was of the finest but the moment she thought of it she turned back and walked into the hairdressers shop in a businesslike way without hesitation a gentleman was sitting beside the counter at one end of the shop waiting to be attended on beth took a seat at the other end and waited too she sat there deep in thought and motionless until she was roused by somebody saying what can i do for you miss then she looked up and saw the proprietor a man with a kindly face can i speak to you for a moment she asked come this way if you please he replied after a glance at her glossy darkbrown hair and shabby gloves when she went in that day arthur uttered an exclamation do you mean to say youve had your hair cut short he asked speaking to her almost roughly are you going to join the unsexed crew that shriek on platforms i dont know any unsexed crew that shriek on platforms she answered and i am surprised to hear you taking the tone of cheap journalism there has been nothing in the woman movement to unsex women except the brutalities of the men who oppose them he coloured somewhat but said no moreonly sat looking into the fire with an expression on his face that cut beth to the quick it was the first cloud that had come to overshadow the perfect sympathy of their intercourse she was getting his tea at the moment and when it was ready she put it beside him and retired to his attic which she occupied and looked at herself in the glass for the first time since she had sacrificed her pretty hair at the first glance she laughed then her eyes filled with tears and she threw herself on the bed and sobbed silentlynot because she regretted her hair but because he was hurt and for once she had no comfort to give him just after she left him an artist friend of his gresham powell came in casually to look him up and was surprised to find he had been so ill i missed you about he said but i thought you had shut yourself up to work whos been looking after you brock gave him the history of his illness powell shook his head when he heard of beths devotion take care my boy he said the girls you find knocking about town in these sort of places are not desirable associates for a promising young man theyre worse than the regular bad onesmore likely to trap you you know especially when youre shorn of your strength and have good reason to be grateful you might think you were rewarding her by marrying her but youll find your mistake look at simpson could a man have done a girl a worse turn than he did when he married florrie crone they havent a thought in common except when hes ill and she nurses him but a man cant be always getting ill in order to keep in touch with his wife i dont know of course what this girls like but half of them are adventuresses bent on marrying gentlemen is she a clergymans daughter by any chance i know nothing about her but her name brock answered coldly she has never tried to excite sympathy in any way well they are of all kinds of course said powell temperately but youd better break away in any case nothing will set you up so soon as a change come with me im going into the country to see the spring come in and the fruit trees flower and to hear the nightingales i know a lovely spot come ill think about it and let you know arthur brock answered to get rid of him when he had gone beth appeared to please arthur she had covered her cropped head with a white muslin mobcap bound round with a pale pink ribbon and put on a high ruffle and a large white apron in which she looked pretty and prim like a sweet little puritan in spite of the pale pink vanity and arthur smiled when he saw her but afterwards grumbled why did you cut your pretty hair off i shouldnt have thought you could do such a tasteless thing beth knelt down beside his chair to mend the fire and then she began to tidy the hearth am i not the same person she asked no not quite he answered you have set up a doubt where all was settled certainty she had taken off the gloves she wore to do the grate and was about to pull herself up from her knees by the arm of his chair when he spoke but paused to ponder his words it was with her left hand that she had grasped the arm of his chair and he happened to notice it particularly as it rested there you wear a weddingring i see he remarked do you find it a protection i never looked at it in that light she answered in this vale of tears i have a husband that is why i wear it there was a perceptible pause then he asked with an effort where is your husband at home i suppose said beth her voice growing strident with dislike of the subject we do not correspond he wishes to divorce me and what shall you do if he tries brock asked nothing she replied and was for leaving him to draw his own conclusions but changed her mind shall i tell you the story she said after a while no dont tell me he rejoined quickly your past is nothing to me nothing that you may have done and nothing that you may yet do can alter my feelingmy respect for you as i have known you so will you always be to methe sweetest kindest friend i ever had the best woman i ever knew men are monotonous creatures given a position and ninetynine out of a hundred will come to the same conclusion about it only by diverse methods according to their prejudices and this is especially the case when women are in question woman is generally out of focus in the mind of man he sees her less as she is than as she ought or ought not to be beth did not thank arthur brock for his magnanimity the fact that he should shrink from hearing the story bespoke a doubt that made his generous expression an offence it may be kind to ignore the past of a guilty person but the innocent ask to be heard and judged and full faith has no fear of revelations beth rose from her knees and began to prepare the invalids evening meal in silence usually they chattered like children the whole time but that evening they were both constrained one of those subtle changes so common in the relations of men and women had set in suddenly since the morning they were not as they had been with each other nor could they continue together as they were there must be a readjustment which was in preparation during the pause you have heard me speak of gresham powell brock began at last he was here this afternoon he thinks i had better go away with him into the country for a change as soon as i can manage it it is a good idea said bethinland of course not near the sea with your rheumatism i will get your things ready at once this immediate acquiescence depressed him he played with his supper a little pretending to eat it then forgot it and sat looking sadly into the fire beth watched him furtively but once he caught her gazing at him with concern whats the matter he asked with an effort to be cheerful the matter is the pained expression in your eyes she answered are you suffering again just twinges he said then set his firm full lips resolute to play the man but the twinges were mental not bodily and beth understood their happy days were done and there was nothing to be said they must each go their own way now and the sooner the better fortunately the old lawyer had consented without demur to let beth have her halfyears dividend in advance so that there was money for arthur he expressed some surprise that there should be but took what she gave him without suspicion and did not count it he was careless in money matters and had forgotten what he had had when he was taken ill youre a great manager he said to beth but i suppose you havent paid up everything you must let me know it will be good to be at work again yes beth answered but dont worry about it you wont want money before you are well able to make it i wish i knew for certain that you would go somewhere yourself to see the spring come in he said looking at her wistfully all in good time she answered in her sprightliest way when the last morning came beth attended to her usual duties methodically she had made every arrangement for him packed the things he was to take and put away those that were to be left behind when the cab was called she went downstairs with him and stood with ethel maud mary and gwendolen on the doorstep in the spring sunshine smiling and waving her hand to him as he drove off her last words to him were you will go home before we meet again give my love to americaand may she send us many more such men beth added under her breath amen ethel maud mary and gwendolen echoed when the cab was out of sight beth turned and went into the house walking wearily at the foot of the stairs she looked up as if she were calculating the distance then she began the long ascent with the help of the banisters counting each step she took mechanically the attic seemed strangely big and bare when she entered itit was as if something had been taken away and left a great gap there was something crude and garish about the light in it too which gave an unaccustomed look to every familiar detail the first thing she noticed was the chair beside the fire the old grandfather chair in which he had been sitting only a few minutes before resting after the effort of dressingthe chair in which she had seen him sit and suffer so much and so bravely she would never see him there again nor hear his voicethe kindest voice she had ever heard at his worst it was always of her he thought of her comfort of her fatigue but all that was over now he had gone and there could be no returnnothing could ever be as it had been between them even if they met again but meet again they never would beth knew and at the thought she sank on the floor beside the senseless chair and resting her head against it broke down and cried the despairing cry of the desolate for whom there is no comfort and no hope the fire she had lighted for arthur to dress by had gone out there were no more coals the remains of his breakfast stood on the table she had not touched anything herself as yet but she felt neither cold nor hunger she was beyond all that the chair was turned with its back to the window and as she cowered beside it she faced the opposite whitewashed wall a ray of sunshine played upon it wintry sunshine still crystal cold and clear beth began to watch it there was something she had to think aboutsomething to see tosomething she must think aboutsomething she ought to see to but precisely what it was she could not grasp it seemed to be hovering on the outskirts of her mind but it always eluded her however she had better not move for fear of making a noise and there was far too much noise as it wasthe wind rising and the waves breaking all down the thundering shores of bude and bos no though it was a procession of camels crossing the desert and in the distance was an oasis surrounded by palms and there was white stonework gleaming between the trees in the wonderful light and those great doors that opened from within they were opening although she had not knocked she was expected thenthere where there was no more weariness nor care nor hunger but that was not where she wished to go no no that did not tempt her take me where i shall not remember she implored poor beth the one boon she had to ask of heaven at fiveandtwenty was oblivion let me be where i shall forget downstairs on the doorstep ethel maud mary and gwendolen lingered a while before they turned to follow beth into the house and as they did so they noticed that a lady had stopped her carriage in the middle of the road jumped out impetuously and was running towards them regardless of the traffic that was mrs maclure who was standing with you here just now and went into the house she exclaimed miss maclure ethel maud mary corrected her oh miss or mrs what does it matter the lady cried it was elizabeth caldwell maclure looking like deathwhere is she take me to her at once she emphasised the request with an imperious stamp of her foot a few minutes later angelica kneeling on the attic floor beside beth cried aloud in horror why she is dead chapter li one warm morning when the appletrees were out arthur brock was sitting with gresham powell in the garden of the farmhouse where they were lodging in the country turning over a portfolio full of powells sketches and powell was looking at them over his shoulder and discussing them with him arthur had just come upon a clever study of the head of a girl in a hat and was looking hard at it thats a study in starvation powell explained its an interesting face isnt it she came into a hairdressers one day when i was there and sat down just in that attitude and i sketched her on the spot she was too far through at the moment to notice me look at her pretty hair particularly youll see why in the next sketch which is the sequel brock took up the next sketch hurriedly it was the same girl in the same hat but with her hair cut short i asked the barber fellow about her when shed gone gresham pursued hed taken her into an inner room and when she came out she was cropped like that she told him she had come to her last shilling and she had an invalid at home depending on her entirely and she entreated him to give her all he could for her hair i believe the chap did too he seemed so moved by her suffering and gentleness whats the matter brock had risen abruptly with the sketches still in his hand the colour had left his face and he looked as pinched and ill as he had done during the early days of his convalescence the matter he ejaculated ive just discovered what a blind fool i am thats whats the matter and ill keep these two studies with your permission to remind me of the fact choose amongst mine any you like instead of them old chap but these you must let me have without waiting for an answer he took the sketches away with him into the house when he returned a short time afterwards he was dressed for a journey and had a travelling bag in his hand im going to town he said to see the original of these sketches ive run up an account with her i shall never be able to settle but at all events i can acknowledge my debt dolt that i am i was that invalid and i thought myself such a gentleman too not counting my change and asking no questions trusting her implicitly that was my pose from the day you came and poisoned my mind before that i had neither trusted nor distrusted but just taken things for granted as they came beautifully i was too selfsatisfied even to suspect that she might be imposing her bounty upon me starving herself that i might have all i required and sending me off here finally with the last penny she had in the world i told you i was wondering she did not answer my letters i expect she hadnt the stamp but you said it was out of sight out of mind and shed be trying it on with some one else in my absence if id the strength id thrash you gresham for an evilminded bounder ill carry your bag to the station old chap gresham replied with contrition and take the thrashing at your earliest convenience ethel maud mary was standing on the steps in the sunshine looking out when arthur brock arrived just as she had stood to watch him depart but in the interval a happy change had pleasantly transformed her her golden hair was brightly burnished again her blue eyes sparkled and her delicate skin had recovered its roseleaf tinge she wore a new frock a new ring a new watch and chain and there was a new look in her face one might say as if the winter of care had passed out of her life with the snow and been forgotten in the spring sunshine of better prospects o mr brock she exclaimed you back but none too well yet judging by appearances where is mrs maclure he demanded i wish i knew ethel maud mary rejoined becoming important all at once shes gone for good thats all i can tell you o mr brock fancy her being tiptop all the time and us not suspecting it though i might have thought something when i saw the dresses she sold when you were ill only id got the fashion papers in my mind and didnt know but what shed been paid in dresses come into the parlour you look faint you said she sold her dresses yes sit down mr brock a glass of port wine is what you want as shed say herself if she was here and youll get it good too for its been sent for ma my the things that have come look at meall presentseverything she ever heard me say id like to have and gwendolen the same she got out the wine and the biscuits from a chiffonier as she chattered and set them before him yes she sold her dresses and her rings and her books and every other blessed thing she possessed except what had belonged to an old aunt she got them out too one day but cried so when it came to parting with them i persuaded her to wait i said something would turn up i was sure and something did for you went away and directly afterthe next minute so to speak for you were scarcely out of sighta lady stopped her carriagea fine carriage and pair and coachman and footman all silvermountedand ran up the steps in a great way shed seen mrs maclure go into the house and she said shed been hunting for her everywhere for months and all her friends were in a way about her not knowing what had happened to her i took the lady up to the attic and there was mrs maclure lying on the floor looking like death with her head up against the big chair where you used to sit we thought she was dead at first but the doctor came and brought her round he said it was just exhaustion from fatigue and starvation arthur brock uttered an exclamation you neednt reproach yourself mr brock ethel maud mary pursued sympathetically you werent worse than the rest of us i saw her every day and never suspected she was denying herself everything she was always so much the samehappy you know in her quiet way do you think she was happy he groaned yes she was happy ethel maud mary said simply shes that dispositioncontented you know and she was happy from the first but she was happier still from the time she had you to care for id read about ladies of that kind mr brock but had not seen one before its being good does it i suppose do you know shed not have told a lie was it ever so mrs maclure wouldnt and she went away with that lady arthur asked after a pause yes if you can call it going ethel maud mary replied for the lady didnt ask her leave but just rolled her up in wraps and had her carried down to the carriage and took her off and thats all we know about her shes written me a letter id like to show you and sent me money pretending she owed it because id let her have her attic too cheap she sent the presents afterwards but no address the lady came back once alone and had the attic photographed with everything arranged just as mrs maclure used to have it and she bought all the things in it that belonged to us and had them and all mrs maclures own things taken away to keep she said she sat a long time in the attic looking at it just as if she was trying to imagine what living in it was like and she kept dabbing her eyes with a little lace handkerchief and then she got up and sighed and said poor beth poor beth several times she talked to me a lot about mrs maclure she seemed to know all about me and treated me as if wed been old friends and she knew all about you too and asked after you kindly she said mrs maclure was going to be a great womana great genius or something of that sortand do a lot for the world and she wanted to know if youd ever suspected it i told her i thought not the two letters you wrote she took to give mrs maclure so shed get them all right and see the particular kind of fatuous ass i am set down clearly in my own handwriting he said to himself then he rose ill just go up and look at the attics he said ethel maud mary waited below and waited long for him when at last he came down he shook hands with her but without looking at her im going to find that ladymrs maclure he said jamming his hat down on his head if i have to spend the rest of my life in the search chapter lii beth surrounded by friends saw the spring come in that year at ilverthorpe and felt it the fairest spring she could remember blackbird and thrush sang in an ecstasy by day and all night long the nightingales trilled in the happy dusk she did not ask herself why it was there was a new note in nature that year nor did she trouble herself about time or eternity her eternity was the exquisite monotony of tranquil days her timekeepers the spring flowers the appleblossom and quince daffodil wallflower lilac and laburnum the perfumed calycanthus forgetmenots pansies hyacinths liliesofthevalley in the woods and early roses on a warm south wall and over all the lark by day and again at night the nightingale in a life like hers after a period of probation there comes an interval of this kind occasionally a pause for rest and renewal of strength before active service begins again while she had been shut up with arthur seeing no papers and hearing no news her book had come out and achieved a very respectable success for the sort of thing it was and she was pleased to hear it but not elated the subject had somehow lapsed from her mind and the career of the book gave her no more personal pleasure than if it had been the work of a friend had it come out when it was first finished she would have felt differently about it but now she saw it as only one of the many things which had happened to her and considered it more as the old consider the works of their youth estimating them in proportion as is the habit of age and moderately rather than in excess for the truth was that a great change had come over beth during the last few months in respect to her writing her enthusiasm had singularly cooled it had ceased to be a pleasure and become an effort to her to express herself in that way mr alfred cayley pounce had been looking out for beths book and while waiting for it to appear he had misled by his own suppositions prepared an elaborate article upon the kind of thing he expected it to be nothing was wanting to complete the article but a summary of the story and quotations from it for which he had left plenty of space he condemned the book utterly from the point of view of art and for the silly ignorance of life displayed in it and the absurd caricatures which were supposed to be people he ridiculed the writer for taking herself seriously but without showing why exactly she should not take herself seriously if she chose he pitied her for her disappointment when she should realise where in literature her place would be and he ended with a bitter diatribe against the works of women generally as being pretentious amateur without originality and wanting in humour like the wretched stuff it had been his painful duty to expose unfortunately for him however the book appeared anonymously and immediately attracted attention enough to make him wish to discover it and before he found out that beth was the author he had committed himself to a highly eulogistic article upon it in the patriarch which he took the precaution to sign that the coming celebrity might know to whom gratitude was due and in which he declared that there had arisen a new light of extraordinary promise on the literary horizon the book as it happened was not a work of fiction at all beth had heard nothing more from dr maclure and knew nothing about him except that he must have lost his degrading appointment the acts having been rescinded he had forwarded none of the letters her friends had addressed to her at slane the kilroys had endeavoured to obtain her address from him but he denied that he knew it unknown to her mr kilroy mr hamiltonwells and sir george galbraith had taken the best legal advice in the hope of getting her a divorce but there was little chance of that as the acute mental suffering her husband had caused her had merely injured her health and endangered her reason which does not amount to cruelty in the estimation of the law the matter was therefore allowed to drop and beth had not yet begun to think of the future when one day she received a letter from dan couched in the most affectionate terms entreating her to return to him you must own that i had cause for provocation he said but i confess that i was too hasty it is natural though that a man should feel it if his wife gets herself into such a position however innocently and the more he has trusted loved and respected his wife the more violent will the reaction be i know however that i have had my own shortcomings since we were married and therefore that i should make every allowance for you so let us be friends beth and begin all over again as you once proposed i am ready to leave slane and settle wherever you like make your own conditions anything that pleases you will please me this letter upset beth very much she would almost rather have had an action for divorce brought against her than have been asked to return to daniel maclure ought i to go back she asked willing with the fatuous persistency of women in like cases to persevere if it were thought right that she should although she knew pretty well that the sacrifice would be unavailing so far as he was concerned and would only entail upon herself the common lot of women so mateda ruined constitution and corroded mind why does he suddenly so particularly wish it was the question the obvious explanation was indirectly conveyed in a letter from her old lawyer he had written to her in her london lodgings first of all but the letter was returned from the dead letter office then he had written to slane but as he received no answer to that letter and it was not returned he went in person to inquire about it dan declared that he knew nothing about the letter or about beth either if she had left london but he thought her intimate friends the kilroys might know where she was the old gentleman applied to the kilroys and having found beth wrote to inform her that her greataunt victoria benchs investments had recovered at last as he had always been pretty sure that they would and she would accordingly for the future find herself in receipt of an income of seven or eight hundred pounds a year dans sudden magnanimity was accounted for beth put his effusion and the lawyers letter before her friends and asked to be advised they decided unanimously that on the one hand dan was not a proper person for her to live with that no decent woman could associate with a man of his mind habits and conversation without suffering injury in some sort while on the other they pointed out that although it would be nice it would not be good for dan to have the benefit of beths little income while he was forced to work he would have to conduct himself with a certain amount of propriety but if beth relieved him of the necessity there would be nothing to restrain him this episode roused beth from her tranquil apathy and made her think of work once more but first she had to settle somewhere and make a home for herself and although she had ample means for all her requirements now it was not an easy thing to find the special conditions on which she had set her heart the first impulse of a woman of noble nature is to be consistent to live up to all she professes to admire as beth grew older to live for others became more and more her ideal of lifenot to live in the world however or to be of it but to work for it i must be quiet she said to angelica one day when they were discussing her future i am done for so far as work is concerned when i come into contact with crowds i want to live things then i dont want to think about them excitement makes me content to be and careless about doing my truest and best life is in myself and i can only live it in circumstances of tranquil monotony people talk so much about making the most of life but their attempts are curiously bungling what they call living is for the most part more pain than pleasure to them for the truth is that life should not be lived by men of mind but contemplated it is the spectator not the actor who enjoys and profits the actor has his moment of applause but all the rest is misery people rush to great centres to obtain a knowledge of life and do not succeed for there they see nothing but broad effects we find our knowledge of life in individuals not in crowds there is no more individuality in a crowd of people than there is in a flock of sheep all i know of life of its infinite diversity i have learnt here and there from some one person or another known intimately a solitary experience rightly considered in all its bearings teaches us more than numbers of those incidents of which we see the surface only in the joy of eventful living and if the truth were known i expect it would be found that each one of us had obtained the most valuable part of our experience in such homely details of simple unaffected human nature as came under our observation in our native villages yes angelica answered thoughtfully the lookeron sees most of the game but i dont think you allow enough for differences of temperament you are thinking of the best conditions for creative work you mustnt lose sight of all the active service that is going on no but it is in retirement that the best preparation is made for active service also and i was thinking of active service more than of creative work just then the truth is i am in a state of being oppressed by the thought of my new book i dont know what has come to me i am all fretty about it writing has lost its charm i doubt if i shall ever do well enough to make it worth while to write at all and even if i could i dont think mere literary success would satisfy me i have tasted enough of that to know what it would bea sordid triumph a mere personal thing ideala does not think that it is necessarily as a literary woman that you will succeed angelica answered i thought it was because all the indications you have given of special capacity seem to me to lie in that direction however versatile people make mistakes sometimes they dont always begin with the work they are best able to do but there is no time lost for one thing helps anotherone thing is necessary to another i should say perhaps your writing may have helped to perfect you in some other form of expression you cheer me beth exclaimed but what form she reflected a little and then she put the puzzle from her it will come to me i dare say she said if i shut the din of the world far from me and sit with folded arms in contemplation waiting for the moment and the match which shall fire me to the right pitch of enthusiasm nothing worth doing in art is done by calculation i think you are right to keep out of the crowd said angelica you will get nothing but distraction from without i should take one of the privileges of a great success to be the right to refuse all invitations that draw one into the social swim men and women of high purpose do not arrive in order to be crowded into stuffy drawingrooms to be stared at my idea of perfect bliss beth pursued when my work is done and my friends are not with me is to lie my length upon a cliff above the sea listening to the manymurmurous soothed by it into a sense of oneness with nature till i seem to be mixed with the elements a part of sky and sea and shore and akin to the wandering winds this mood for my easy moments but give me work for my live delight i know nothing so altogether ecstatic as a good mood for work what you call work is power of expression said angelica the power to express something in yourself i fancy yeyes beth answered hesitating as if the notion were new to her i believe you are right what i call work is the effort to express myself mr kilroy had come in while they were talking and sat listening to the last part of the conversation i have just the sort of neat little cot in a quiet spot with a distant view of the rolling sea that you yearn for beth he said smiling when she paused and i have come to ask you and angelica to drive over with me to see it you mean ilverthorpe cottage said angelica jumping up o daddy its the very place two storeys beth ivy roses jasmine wisteria without and within space and comfort of every kindand the sea in sight such a pretty garden too grass and trees and shrubs and flowers and near enough for us all to see you as often as you wish beth be excited too i must bring my violin i think and play a triumphal march on the way ilverthorpe cottage was all and more than angelica had said and beth did not hesitate to take it it was mr kilroys property and the rent was suspiciously low but beth supposed that that was because the house was out of the way she and angelica spent long happy days in getting it ready for occupation choosing paper paint and furnishments mr kilroy saw to the stables which he completed with a saddlehorse and a ponycarriage there was a short cut across the fields a lovely walk from ilverthorpe house to the cottage and when angelica could not accompany her beth would stroll over alone to see how things were getting on and wander about her little demesne and love it outside her garden in front of the house the highroad ran a sheltered highroad with a raised footpath bordered on either side with great trees oak and elm chestnut and beech and a high hawthorn hedge just whitening into blossom the fieldpath came out on this highroad down which she had to walk a few hundred yards to her own gate day after day there was an old irish labourer a stonebreaker by the wayside kneeling on a sack beside a great heap of stones who gave her a cheery goodmorrow as she passed once she went across the road and spoke to him he had the face of a saint at his devotions you kneel there all day long she said and as you kneel you pray perhaps will you pray for me pray pray that i mayshe was going to say succeed but stoppedthat i may be good the man raised his calm eyes and looked her in the face you are good lady he said simply yet pray she entreated and pray too that all i do may be good and of good effect all you do is good lady he answered once more in the same quiet tone of conviction but i want all i do to be the best for the purpose that can be done she put some money in his hand and turned away and as she went he watched her she had touched him with her soft gloveless fingers in giving him the money and when she had gone he was conscious of the touch it tingled through him and he looked at the spot on which the impression remained as if he expected it to be in some sort visible now our lady love you and the saints protect you bless your sweet face he muttered and may all you do be the best that can be done for every one amen a few months in her lovely little house sufficed to restore beths mind to its natural attitudean attitude of deep devotion she even began to work again but rather with a view to making herself useful to her friends than to satisfy any ambition or craving of her own whatever she did however she approached in the spirit of the great musician who dressed himself in his best and prayed as at a solemn service when he shut himself up to compose beth had stepped away from the old forms by this time she had escaped from the bondage of the letter that killeth into the realm of the spirit that giveth life it is not faith in any particular fetish that makes a mind religious but the quality of reverence churches beth had come to look upon not with distrust but with indifference as an ineffectual experiment of mans she could find no evidence of a holier spirit or a more divine one in the church than in any other human institution for the propagation of instruction the church has never been superior to the times never as far advanced as the best men of the day never a leader but rather an opposer of progress hindering when ideas were new and only coming in to help when workers without had proved their discoveries and it was evident that credit would be lost by refusing to recognise them there is no cruelty the church has not practised no sin it has not committed no ignorance it has not displayed no inconsistency it has not upheld from teaching peace and countenancing war to preaching poverty and piling up riches true there have been great saints in the church but then there have been great saints out of it saintliness comes of conscientiously cultivating the divine in human nature it is a seed that is sown and flourishes under the most diverse conditions beth thought much on religion in those quiet days and read much looking for spiritual sustenance among the garbage of mind with which man has overlaid it and finding little to satisfy her until one night quite suddenly as she sat holding her mind in the attitude of prayer there came to her a wonderful flash of illumination she had not been occupied with the point that became apparent it entered her mind involuntarily and was made clear to her without conscious effort on her part but it was that which she sought the truth that moves makes evident makes easy props and stays and is the instigator of religious action the source of aspiration the ground of hopethe which was all contained for beth in the one old formula interpreted in a way that was new to her the communion of saints that inexplicable sympathy between soul and soul the forgiveness of sins working out our own salvation in fear and trembling the resurrection of the body reincarnation and the life everlasting which is the crown or glory the final goal but god beth questioned god is love she read in the book that lay open on the table before her then she clasped her hands over the passage and laid her head on them and for a long time she sat so not thinking but just repeating it to herself softly god is love till all at once there was a blank in her consciousness thought was suspended when it returned she looked up and in herself were the words god is loveno love is god in the joy of the revelation she arose and going to the window flung it wide open far down the east the dawn was dimly burning the faint sweet breath of it fanned her cheeks her chest expanded with a great throb and she exclaimed aloud i follow followgodi know not where beth had a task before her that day which she did not relish in the anticipation she was going as a stopgap to speak at a large meeting to oblige angelica she had the credit of being able to speak and she herself supposed that she could in a way because of the success of her first attempt but she did not consent to try again without much hesitation and many qualms and she would certainly not have consented had not her friends been in a difficulty with no one at hand to help them out of it but herself but to be drawn from her hallowed seclusion into such a blaze of publicity even for once was not at all to her mind and much of her wakefulness of the night before had been caused by her shrinking from the prospect late that night after the meeting she returned to her cottage alone cowering in a corner of the kilroys carriage she was cowering from the recollection of a great crowd that rose with deafening shouts and seemed to be rushing at hercowering too from the inevitable which she had been forced to recogniseher vocationdiscovered by accident and with dismay for it was not what she would have chosen for herself in any way had it occurred to her that she had any choice in the matter there were always moments when she would fain have led the life which knows no care beyond the cultivation of the arts no service but devotion to them no pleasure like the enjoyment of thema selfish life made up of impersonal delights such as music which is emotion made audible painting which is emotion made visible and poetry which is emotion made comprehensibleand such a life could not have been anything but grateful to one like beth who had the capacity for so many interests of the kind she was debarred from all that however by grace of nature beth could not have lived for herself had she tried so that now when the call had come and the way in which she could best live for others was made plain to her she had no thought but to pursue it the carriage put her down at her gardengate and she stood awhile in the moonlight listening to it as it rolled away with patter of horses hoofs and rattle of harness listening intently as if the sound concerned her then she let herself in and was hurrying up to her room but stopped short on the stairs cowering from the crowd that rose and cheered and cheered and seemed to be rushing at her her bedroom had windows east west and south so that she had sunrise and sunset and the sun all day when she went in now she found the lamps lighted and all the windows shut and she went round and flung them open with an irritable gesture her nerves were overwrought the slightest contrariety upset her the sweet fresh country air streamed in and the tranquil moonlight these alone would ordinarily have been enough to soothe her but now she paid no heed to them when she had opened the windows she began to take off her things in feverish haste pacing about the room restlessly the while as if that helped her to be quicker everything she wore seemed too hot too heavy or too tight and she flung hat and cloak and bodice down just where she took them off in her haste to get rid of them throwing her things about like that was an old trick of her childhood and becoming conscious of what she was doing she remembered it and began to think of herself as she had been then and so forget her troubled self as she was at that momentfresh from the excitement and terror of an extraordinary achievement a great success for she had spoken that night as few have spokenspoken to a hostile audience and fascinated them by the power of her personality the mesmeric power which is part of the endowment of an orator and had so moved them that they rose at last and cheered her for her eloquence whether they held her opinions or not then there had come friendly handshakes and congratulations and encouragement and one had said beth is launched at last upon her true career but who could have thought that that was her bent another had asked beth did not hear the answer but she knew what it should have been she had been misled herself and so had every one else by her pretty talent for writing her love of turning phrases her play on the music of words the writing had come of cultivation but thisthe last discovered powerwas the natural gift angelica had said that all the indications had pointed to literary ability in beth but there had been other indications hitherto unheeded there was that day at castletownrock when beth invited the country people in to see the house and for the first time found words flowing from her lips eloquently there were her preachings to emily and bernadine in the actingroom of which they never wearied her first harangue to the girls who had caught her bathing on the sands and the power of her subsequent teaching which had bound them to the secret service of humanity for as long as she liked there was her storytelling at school too and her lectures to the girlsnot to mention the charm of her ordinary conversation when the mood was upon her as in the days when she used to sit and fish with the bearded sailors and held them with curious talk as she had held the folk in ireland fascinating them and then there was the unexpected triumph of her first public attemptindications enough of a natural bent had there been any one to interpret them beth as she thought on these things wandered from window to window too restless and excited to sit still but even occupied as she was after she had changed her dress the old trick came upon her and she was all the while observing it was autumn and on the south she overlooked a field of barley standing in stooks waiting to be carted she noticed how the long irregular rows and their shadows showed in the moonlight across the field the farm to which it belonged nestled in an appleorchard from the east end of the house she obtained a glimpse of the sea which was near enough for the drowsy murmur of it reached her even in calm weather to the west the highroad ran and in her wanderings from window to window beth paused to contemplate it to follow it in imagination whither it led to think of the weary way it was to so many weary feet to mourn because she could not offer rest and refreshment to every one that passed the night was clear and the air was crisp with a suspicion of frost in it such as sometimes comes in the late autumn the moon was sinking and the stars shone out ever more brightly down in the roadway a little brazier burned where the road had been taken up and blocked for repairs and over the brazier the old watchman who should have been guarding the tools and materials that had been left lying about dozed in a sort of sentrybox it occurred to beth that the task was long and dreary and that the air grew chilly towards the dawn surely some food would cheer and refresh him and help to pass the time she went down to the pantry and got some then carried it out on a tray but the old man was sound asleep and standing there in her long white wrapper she had to call him several times old man old man before she roused him he awoke at last with a start and seeing the unexpected apparition in the dim light exclaimed holy mother why have you come to me beth silently set the tray before him and slipped away leaving him in the happy certainty that a heavenly vision had been vouchsafed him but the moon set the stars paled and from her window to the east beth watched the dark melt to dusk and the dusk pale to an even grey into which were breathed the burnished colours of the happy dawn then when the sun was high and the accustomed sounds of life and movement that held her ear by day had well begun down the long road beneath the old gnarled trees the postman came beladen and there were brought to her pamphlets papers cards letters telegrams a fine variety of praise abuse sympathy derision insults and admiration quietly beth read and knew what it meant all of itsuccess and the success she had most desired that her words should come with comfort to thousands of those that suffer who when they heard would raise their heads once more in hope in one paper that she opened she read a great teacher has arisen among us a woman of genius hastily she put the paper aside burning with a kind of shame although alone to see so much said of herself beth was one of the first swallows of the womans summer she was strange to the race when she arrived and uncharitably commented upon but now the type is known and has ceased to surprise when she was dressed that morning she went down to her bright little breakfast parlour before her was the harvestfield looking its loveliest in the early morning sunlight as she contemplated the peaceful scene she thought that she should feel herself a singularly fortunate being the dead would be with her no more alas except in the spirit but all else that heart could desire was it not hers the answer came quick no something was wanting but she did not ask herself what the something was the harvesters were not at work that morning and she had not seen a soul since she sat down to breakfast but before she left the table a horseman came out from the farm and rode towards her across the long field deliberately she watched him absently at first but as he approached he reminded her of the knight of her daily vision her saviour who had come to rescue her in the dark days of her deep distress at slane a bowshot from her bowereaves he rode between the barleysheaves the barleysheaves suddenly beths heart throbbed and fluttered and stood still the words had come to her as the interpretation of an augury the fulfilment of a promise it seemed as if she ought to have known it from the first known that he would come like that at last that he had been coming coming coming through all the years as he drew near the rider looked up at her the sun shone on his face he raised his hat in dumb emotion not knowing what she did beth reached out her hands towards him as if to welcome him he was not the knight of her dark days however this son of the morning but the knight of her long winter vigilarthur brock transcribers note the following have been changed as they appear

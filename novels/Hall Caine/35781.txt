which art in heaven the deemster chapter i the death of old ewan thorkell mylrea had waited long for a dead mans shoes but he was wearing them at length he was forty years of age his black hair was thin on the crown and streaked with gray about the temples the crowsfeet were thick under his small eyes and the backs of his lean hands were coated with a reddish down but he had life in every vein and restless energy in every limb his father ewan mylrea had lived long and mourned much and died in sorrow the good man had been a patriarch among his people and never a serener saint had trod the ways of men he was already an old man when his wife died over her open grave he tried to say the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed but his voice faltered and broke though he lived ten years longer he held up his head no more little by little he relinquished all active interest in material affairs the world had lost its light for him and he was traveling in the dusk on his sons thorkell the elder gilcrist the younger with nearly five years between them the conduct of his estate devolved never were brothers more unlike gilcrist resembling his father was of a simple and tranquil soul thorkells nature was fiery impetuous and crafty the end was the inevitable one the heel of thorkell was too soon on the neck of gilcrist gilcrists placid spirit overcame its first vexation and he seemed content to let his interests slip from his hands before he was out thorkell mylrea was in effect the master of ballamona his younger brother was nightly immersed in astronomy and the fathers and the old man was sitting daily in his slippers in the highbacked armchair by the ingle over which these words were cut in the black oak gods providence is mine inheritance they were strange effects that followed people said they had never understood the extraordinary fortunes of ballamona again and again the rents were raised throughout the estate until the farmers cried in the grip of their poverty that they would neither go nor starve then the wagons of thorkell mylrea followed close at their tailboards by the carts of the clergy drove into the cornfields when the corn was cut and picked up the stooks and bore them away amid the deep curses of the barearmed reapers who looked on in their impotent rage nevertheless thorkell mylrea said far and wide without any show of reserve and with every accent of sincerity that never before had his fathers affairs worn so grave a look he told ewan as much time after time and then the troubled old face looked puzzled the end of many earnest consultations between father and son as the one sat by the open hearth and the other leaned against the lettered ingle was a speedy recourse to certain moneys that lay at an english bank as well as the old mans signature to documents of high moment old ewans spirits sank yet lower year by year but he lived on peacefully enough as time went by he talked less and his humid eyes seemed to look within in degree as they grew dim to things without but the day came at length when the old man died in his chair before the slumberous peat fire on the hearth quietly silently without a movement his graspless fingers fumbling a wormeaten hourglass his long waves of thin white hair falling over his drooping shoulders and his upturned eyes fixed in a strong stare on the text carved on the ranneltree shelf gods providence is mine inheritance that night thorkell sat alone at the same ingle in the same chair glancing at many parchments and dropping them one by one into the fire long afterward when idle tongues were set to wag it was said that the elder son of ewan mylrea had found a means whereby to sap away his fathers personalty then it was remembered that through all his strange misfortunes thorkell had borne an equal countenance they buried the old man under the eldertree by the wall of the churchyard that stands over against the sea it seemed as if half of the inhabitants of the island came to his funeral and six sets of bearers claimed their turn to carry him to the grave the day was a gloomy day of winter there was not a bird or a breath in the heavy air the sky was low and empty the long dead sea was very gray and cold and over the unplowed land the withered stalks of the last crop lay dank on the mold when the company returned to ballamona they sat down to eat and drink and make merry for excessive sorrow is exceeding dry no one asked for the will there was no will because there was no personalty and the lands were by law the inheritance of the eldest son thorkell was at the head of his table and he smiled a little and sometimes reached over the board to touch with his glass the glass that was held out toward him gilcrist had stood with these mourners under the empty sky and his heart was as bare and desolate but he could endure their company no longer in an agony of grief and remorse and rage as well he got up from his untouched food and walked away to his own room it was a little quiet nest of a room that looked out by one small window over the marshy curraghs that lay between the house and the sea there gilcrist sat alone that day in a sort of dull stupor the daylight had gone and the revolving lamps on the headland of ayre were twinkling red after black over the blank waters when the door opened and thorkell entered gilcrist stirred the fire and it broke into a bright blaze thorkells face wore a curious expression i have been thinking a good deal about you gilcrist especially during the last few days in fact i have been troubled about you to say the truth said thorkell and then he paused affairs are in a bad way at ballamonavery gilcrist made no response whatever but clasped his hands about his knee and looked steadily into the fire we are neither of us young men now but if you should think ofofanything i should consider it wrong to standto put myself in your wayto keep you here that isto your disadvantage you know thorkell was standing with his back to the fire and his fingers interlaced behind him gilcrist rose to his feet very well he said with a strained quietness and then turned toward the window and looked out at the dark sea only the seas voice from the shore beyond the churchyard broke the silence in that little room thorkell stood a moment leaning on the mantelshelf and the flickering lights of the fire seemed to make sinister smiles on his face then he went out without a word next morning at daybreak gilcrist mylrea was riding toward derby haven with a pack in green cloth across his saddlebow he took passage by the king orry an old seatub plying once a week to liverpool from liverpool he went on to cambridge to offer himself as a sizar at the university it had never occurred to any one that thorkell mylrea would marry but his father was scarcely cold in his grave the old seatub that took his brother across the channel had hardly grounded at liverpool when thorkell mylrea offered his heart and wrinkled hand and the five hundred acres of ballamona to a lady twenty years of age who lived at a distance of some six miles from his estate it would be more precise to say that the liberal tender was made to the ladys father for her own will was little more than a cypher in the bargaining she was a girl of sweet spirit very tender and submissive and much under the spell of religious feeling her mother had died during her infancy and she had been brought up in a household that was without other children in a gaunt rectory that never echoed with childrens voices her father was archdeacon of the island archdeacon teare her own name was joance if half the inhabitants of the island turned out at old ewans funeral the entire population of four parishes made a holiday of his sons wedding the one followed hard upon the other and thrift was not absent from either thorkell was married in the early spring at the archdeacons church at andreas it would be rash to say that the presence of the great company at the wedding was intended as a tribute to the many virtues of thorkell mylrea indeed it was as well that the elderly bridegroom could not overhear the conversation with which some of the homely folk beguiled the way aw the murther of it said one buirdly manxman fiveandforty if hes a day and a wizened old polecat anyway youd really think the gels got no feelins aw shockin shockin extraordinary and a rael good gel too theyre sayin amazin amazin the marriage of thorkell was a curious ceremony first there walked abreast the fiddler and the piper playing vigorously the black and gray then came the bridegrooms men carrying osiers as emblems of their superiority over the bridesmaids who followed them three times the company passed round the church before entering it and then they trooped up toward the communionrail thorkell went through the ceremony with the air of a whipped terrier on the outside he was gay in frills and cuffs and his thin hair was brushed crosswise over the bald patch on his crown he wore buckled shoes and blue laces to his breeches but his brave exterior lent him small support as he took the ungloved hand of his girlish bride he gave his responses in a voice that first faltered and then sent out a quick harsh loud pipe no such gaunt and grim shadow of a joyful bridegroom ever before knelt beside a beautiful bride and while the archdeacon married the spectre of a happy man to his own submissive daughter the whispered comments of the throng that filled nave and aisles and gallery sometimes reached his own ears you wouldnt think it now that the craythurs sold his own gel and him preaching there about the covenant and isaac and rebecca and all that hush man its laban and jacob hes meaning when the ceremony had come to an end and the bridegrooms eyes were no longer fixed in a stony stare on the words of the commandments printed in black and white under the chancel window the scene underwent a swift change in one minute thorkell was like another man all his abject bearing fell away when the party was clear of the churchyard four of the grooms men started for the rectory at a race and the first to reach it won a flask of brandy with which he returned at high speed to the wedding company then thorkell as the custom was bade his friends to form a circle where they stood in the road while he drank of the brandy and handed the flask to his wife custom must be indulged with custom said he or custom will weep after that the company moved on until they reached the door of the archdeacons house where the bride cake was broken over the brides hand and then thrown to be scrambled for by the noisy throng that blew neats horns and fired guns and sang ditties by the way thorkell with the chivalrous bearing of an old courtier delivered up his wife to the flock of ladies who were ready to pounce upon her at the door of the rectory then he mingled freely with the people and chattered and bantered and made quips and quibbles finally he invited all and sundry to partake freely of the oaten cake and ale that he had himself brought from ballamona in his car for the refreshment of his own tenants there present the fare was lenten fare for a wedding day and some of the straggleheaded troop grumbled and some sniffled and some scratched their heads and some laughed outright the beer and bread were left almost untouched thorkell was blind to the discontent of his guests but the archdeacon perceived it and forthwith called such of the tumultuous assemblage as came from a distance into his barns there the creels were turned bottom up and four closejointed gates lifted off their hinges were laid on the top for tables then from pans and boilers that simmered in the kitchen a great feast was spread first came the broth well loaded with barley and cabbage and not destitute of the flavor of numerous sheeps heads this was served in wooden piggins shells being used as spoons then suet pudding as round as a wellfed salmon and as long as a lb cod last of all a fat hog roasted whole and cut with a cleaver but further dissected only by teeth and fingers for the unfastidious manxman cared nothing for knife and fork after that there were liquor and lusty song and all the time there could be heard over the boisterous harmony of the feasters within the barn the yet noisier racket of the people without by this time whatever sentiment of doubtful charity had been harbored in the icy breast of the manxman had been thawed away under the charitable effects of good cheer and thorkell mylrea and archdeacon teare began to appear in truly christian character its none so ould he is yet at all at all ould he hasnt the hayseed out of his hair boy and a shocking powerful headpiece at him for all there were rough jokes and dubious toasts and thorkell enjoyed them all there was dancing too and fiddling and the pipes at intervals and all went merry until midnight when the unharmonious harmonies of fiddle and pipes and unsteady song went off over the curraghs in various directions next morning thorkell took his wife home to ballamona they drove in the open springless car in which he had brought down the oaten cake and ale thorkell had seen that the remains of these good viands were thriftily gathered up he took them back home with him carefully packed under the board on which his young wife sat chapter ii a man child is born three years passed and thorkells fortunes grew apace he toiled early and late time had no odd days or holiday in his calendar every day was working day except sunday and then thorkell like a devout christian went to church thorkell believed that he was a devoutly religious man but rumor whispered that he was better able to make his words fly up than to prevent his thoughts from remaining below his wife did not seem to be a happy woman during the three years of her married life she had not borne her husband children it began to dawn upon her that thorkells sole desire in marriage had been a child a son to whom he could leave what no man can carry away one sunday morning as thorkell and his wife were on their way to church a young woman of about twenty passed them and as she went by she curtsied low to the lady the girl had a comely nutbrown face with dark wavy clusters of hair tumbling over her forehead from beneath a white sunbonnet of which the poke had been dexterously rolled back it was summer and her light blue bodice was open and showed a white underbodice and a full neck her sleeves were rolled up over the elbows and her dimpled arms were bare and brown there was a look of coquetry in her hazel eyes as they shot up their dark lustre under her long lashes and then dropped as quickly to her feet she wore buckle shoes with the open clock tops thorkells quick eyes glanced over her and when the girl curtsied to his wife he fell back the few paces that he was in front of her who is she he asked thorkells wife replied that the girl was a netmaker from near peeltown whats her name thorkells wife answered that the girls name was mally kerruish who are her people has she any thorkells wife explained that the girl had a mother only who was poor and worked in the fields and had come to ballamona for help during the last hard winter humph doesnt look as if the daughter wanted for much how does the girl come by her fine feathers if her mother lives on charity thorkells wizened face was twisted into grotesque lines his wifes face saddened and her voice dropped as she hinted in faltering accents that scandal did saysay well woman what does scandal say asked thorkell and his voice had a curious lilt and his mouth wore a strange smile it saysim afraid thorkell the poor girl is no better than she ought to be thorkell snorted and then laughed in his throat like a frisky gelding i thought she looked like a lively young puffin he said and then trotted on in front his head rolling between his shoulders and his eyes down after going a few yards further he slackened speed again lives near peeltown you saya netmakermallyis it mally kerruish thorkells wife answered with a nod of the head and then her husband faced about and troubled her with no further conversation until he drew up at the church door and said quick woman quick and mind you shut the pew door after you but god remembered rachel and hearkened to her and then for the first time the wife of thorkell mylrea began to show a cheerful countenance thorkells own elevation of spirits was yet more noticeable he had heretofore showed no discontent with the old homestead that had housed his people for six generations but he now began to build another and much larger house on the rising ground at the foot of slieu dhoo his habits underwent some swift and various changes he gave away no gray blankets that winter the itinerant poor who were on the houses often went empty from his door andmost appalling change of allhe promptly stopped his tithe when the parsons cart drove up to ballamona thorkell turned the horses head and gave the flank a sharp cut with his whip the parson came in white with wrath let every pig dig for herself said thorkell ill daub grease on the rump of your fat pig no more thorkells new homestead rose rapidly and when the walls were ready for the roof the masons and carpenters went up to ballamona for the customary feast of cowree and jough and binjean what is it true then as the saying is thorkell exclaimed at the sight of them that when the sport is the merriest it is time to give up they ate no cowree at ballamona that night and they drank no jough weve been going to the goats house for wool grunted one of them as they trudged home aw well man and what can you get of the cat but his skin growled another next day they put on the first timbers of the roof and the following night a great storm swept over the island and the rooftimbers were torn away not a spar or purlin being left in its place thorkell fumed at the storm and swore at the men and when the wind subsided he had the work done afresh the old homestead of ballamona was thatched but the new one must be slated and slates were quarried at and carted to slieu dhoo and run on to the new roof a dead calm had prevailed during these operations but it was the calm that lies in the heart of the storm and the night after they were completed the other edge of the cyclone passed over the island tearing up the trees by their roots and shaking the old ballamona to its foundations thorkell mylrea slept not a wink but tramped up and down his bedroom the long night through and next morning at daybreak he drew the blind of his window and peered through the haze of the dawn to where his new house stood on the breast of slieu dhoo he could just descry its blue wallsit was roofless the people began to mutter beneath their breath aw man its a judgment said one he has been middlin hard on the widda and fatherless and its like enough that theres them aloft as knows it whats that theyre saying said one old crone what comes with the wind goes with the water och i knew his fatherhim and me were same as brothersand a good ould man for all well and many a good cow has a bad calf said the old woman thorkell went about like a cloud of thunder and when he heard that the accidents to his new homestead were ascribed to supernatural agencies he flashed like forked lightning where there are geese theres dirt he said and where there are women theres talking am i to be frightened if an old woman sneezes but before thorkell set to work again he paid his tithe he paid it with a rick of discolored oats that had been cut in the wet and threshed before it was dry thorkell had often wondered whether his cows would eat it the next sunday morning the parson paused before his sermon to complain that certain of his parishioners whom he would not name at present appeared to think that what was too bad for the pigs was good enough for the priests let the church of god have no more of their pigswill thorkell in his pew chuckled audibly and muttered something about paying for a dead horse it was spring when the second roof was blown down and the new house stood roofless until early summer then thorkell sent four lean pigs across to the rectory and got his carpenters together and set them to work the roofing proceeded without interruption the primrose was not yet gone the swallow had not yet come and the young grass under the feet of the oxen was still small and sweet when thorkells wife took to her bed then all ballamona was astir hommybeg the deaf gardener of ballamona was sent in the hot haste of his best two miles an hour to the village commonly known as the street to summon the midwife this good woman was called kerry quayle she was a spinster of forty and she was all but blind im thinking the womanbody is after going on the straw said hommybeg when he reached the street and this was the sum of the message that he delivered then wed better be off as the saying is remarked kerry who never accepted responsibility for any syllable she ever uttered when they got to ballamona thorkell mylrea bustled hommybeg into the square springless car and told him to drive to andreas and fetch the archdeacon without an hours delay hommybeg set off at fine paces that carried him to the archdeaconry a matter of four miles an hour thorkell followed kerry quayle to the room above when they stepped into the bedroom thorkell drew the midwife aside to a table on which a large candle stood in a tall brass candlestick with gruesome gargoyles carved on the base and upper flange from this table he picked up a small testament bound in shiny leather with silver clasps im as great a man as any in the island said thorkell in his shrill whisper for laughing at the simpletons that talk about witches and boaganes and the like of that so you are as the saying is said kerry id have the law on the lot of them if i had my way said thorkell still holding the book aw and shockin powerful luck it would be as the old body said if all the witches and boaganes in the island could be run into the sea said kerry pshaw im talking of the simpletons that believe in them said thorkell snappishly id clap them all in castle rushen aw yes and clean law and clean justice too as the irishman said so dont think i want the midwife to take her oath in my house said thorkell och no of course not you wouldnt bemean yourself as they say but then you know what the saying is kerry custom must be indulged with custom or custom will weep and saying this thorkells voice took a most insinuating tone aw now and im as good as here and there one at standing up for custom as the saying is said the midwife the end of it all was that kerry quayle took there and then a solemn oath not to use sorcery or incantation of any kind in the time of travail not to change the infant at the hour of its birth not to leave it in the room for a week afterward without spreading the tongs over its crib and much else of the like solemn purport the dusk deepened and the archdeacon had not yet arrived night came on and the room was dark but thorkell would not allow a lamp to be brought in or a fire to be lighted some time later say six hours after hommybeg had set out on his sixmile journey a lumbrous jolting sound of heavy wheels came from the road below the curragh and soon afterward the archdeacon entered the room so dark he said on stumbling across the threshold ah archdeacon said thorkell with the unaccustomed greeting of an outstretched hand the church shall bring light to the chamber here and thorkell handed the tinderbox to the archdeacon and led him to the side of the table on which the candle stood in an instant the archdeacon laughing a little or protesting meekly against his clerical honors was striking the flint when thorkell laid a hand on his arm wait one moment of course you know how i despise superstition ah of course of course said the archdeacon but then you know the old saying archdeacon custom must be indulged with custom you know it and thorkells face shut up like a nutcracker so i must bless the candle eh is that it said the archdeacon with a low gurgle and the next moment he was gabbling in a quick undertone through certain words that seemed to be all one word olordjesuschristblessthouthiscreatureofawaxentaperthaton whatplacesoeveritbelightedorsetthedevilmayfleefromthat habitationandnomoredisquietthemthatservethee after the penultimate word there was a short pause and at the last word there was the sharp crack of the flint and in an instant the candle was lighted then the archdeacon turned toward the bed and exchanged some words with his daughter the bed was a mahogany fourpost one with legs like rocks a hood like a pulpit soundingboard and tapestry curtains like a muddy avalanche the archdeaconhe was a small man with a face like a russet appleleaned against one of the bedposts and said in a tone of banter why thorkell and if youre for indulging custom how comes it that you have not hung up your hat my hatmy hat said thorkell in perplexity aw now said the midwife the masters as great a man as any in the island at laughing at the men craythurs that hang up their hats over the straw to fright the boaganes as the old woman said thorkells laughter instantly burst forth to justify the midwifes statement ha ha hang up my hat well now well now drives away the black spirits from the birthbedisnt that what the dunces say its twenty years since i saw the like of it done and id forgotten the old custom must look funny very the good mans hat perched up on the bedpost what dye say archdeacon shall we have it up just for the laugh you know ha ha in another moment thorkell was gone from the room and his titter could be heard from the stairs it ebbed away and presently flowed back again and thorkell was once more by the bedside laughing immoderately and perching his angular soft hat on the topmost knob of one of the posts at the foot of the bed then thorkell and the archdeacon went down to the little room that had once been gilcrists room looking over the curragh to the sea before daybreak next morning a man child was born to thorkell mylrea and an heir to the five hundred acres of ballamona chapter iii the christening of young ewan in the dead waste of that night the old wall of ballamona echoed to the noise of hurrying feet thorkell himself ran like a squirrel hither and thither breaking out now and again into shrill peals of hysterical laughter while the women took the kettle to the room above and employed themselves there in sundry mysterious ordinances on which no male busybody might intrude thorkell dived down into the kitchen and rooted about in the meal casks for the oaten cake and into the larder for the cheese and into the cupboard for the breadbasket known as the peck hommybeg who had not been permitted to go home that night had coiled himself in the settle drawn up before the kitchen fire and was now snoring lustily thorkell roused him and set him to break the oatcake and cheese into small pieces into the peck and when this was done to scatter it broadcast on the staircase and landing and on the gardenpath immediately in front of the house while he himself carried a similar peck piled up like a pyramid with similar pieces of oatcake and cheese to the room whence there issued at intervals a thin small voice that was the sweetest music that had ever yet fallen on thorkells ear what high commotion did the next day witness for the first time since that lurid day when old ewan mylrea was laid under the eldertree in the churchyard by the sea ballamona kept open house the itinerant poor who made the circuit of the houses came again and lifted the latch without knocking and sat at the fire without being asked and ate of the oatcake and the cheese and upstairs where a meek white face looked out with an unfamiliar smile from behind sheets that were hardly more white the robustious statespeople from twenty miles around sat down in their odorous atmosphere of rude health and high spirits and noise and laughter to drink their glass of new brewed jough and to spread on their oaten bread a thick crust of the rumbutter that stood in the great blue china bowl on the little table near the bedhead and thorkellhow nimbly he hopped about and encouraged his visitors to drink and rallied them if they ceased to eat come man come he said a score of times shameful leaving is worse than shameful eatingeat drink and they ate and they drank and they laughed and they sang till the bedroom reeked with the fumes of a pothouse and the confusion of tongues therein was worse than at the foot of babel throughout three long jovial weeks the visitors came and went and every day the blithe bread was piled in the peck for the poor of the earth and scattered on the paths for the good spirits of the air and when people jested upon this and said that not since the old days of their grandfathers had the boaganes and the fairies been so civilly treated thorkell laughed noisily and said what great fun it was that they should think he was superstitious and that custom must be indulged with custom or custom would weep then came the christening and to this ceremony the whole country round was invited thorkell was now a man of consequence and the neighbors high and low trooped in with presents for the young christian kerry the midwife who was nurse as well carried the child to church and the tiny red burden lay cooing softly at her breast in a very hillock of white swaddlings thorkell walked behind his little eyes twinkling under his bushy eyebrows and on his arm his wife leaned heavily after every feeble step her white waxwork face bright with the smile of first motherhood the archdeacon met the company at the west porch and they gathered for the baptism about the font in the aisle halfblind kerry with the infant thorkell and his young wife the two godfathers the vicar general and the high bailiff of peeltown and the godmother the high bailiffs wife and behind this circle a mixed throng of many sorts after the gospel and the prayers the archdeacon in his white surplice took the infant into his hands and called on the godparents to name the child and they answered ewan then as the drops fell over the wee blinking eyes and all voices were hushed in silence and awe there came to the open porch and looked into the dusky church a little fleecy lamb all soft and white and beautiful it lifted its innocent and dazed face where it stood in the morning sunshine on the grass of the graves and bleated and bleated as if it had strayed from its mother and was lost the archdeacon paused with his drooping finger half raised over the other innocent face at his breast thorkells features twitched and the tears ran down the white cheeks of his wife in an instant the babylamb had hobbled away and before the archdeacon had restored the child to the arms of blind kerry or mumbled the last of the prayers there came the hum of many voices from the distance the noise came rapidly nearer and as it approached it broke into a great tumult of mens deep shouts and womens shrill cries the iron hasp of the lychgate to the churchyard was heard to chink and at the same moment there was the sound of hurrying footsteps on the paved way the company that had gathered about the font broke up abruptly and made for the porch with looks of inquiry and amazement there at the head of a mixed throng of the riffraff of the parish bareheaded men women with bold faces and children with naked feet a man held a young woman by the arm and pulled her toward the church he was a stalwart fellow stern of feature iron gray and he gripped the girls bare brown arm like a vise make way there come mistress and no struggling he shouted and he tugged the girl after him and then pushed her before him she was young twenty at most her comely face was drawn hard with lines of pain her hazel eyes flashed with wrath and where her white sunbonnet had fallen back from her head on to her shoulders the knots of her dark hair draggled and tangled in the scuffle tumbled in masses over her neck and cheeks it was mally kerruish and the man who held her and forced her along was the parish sumner the church constable make way i tell you shouted the sumner to the throng that crowded upon him and into the porch and through the company that had come for the christening when the archdeacon stepped down from the side of the font the sumner with his prisoner drew up on the instant and the noisy crew stood and was silent i have brought her for her oath your reverence said the sumner dropping his voice and his head together who accuses her the archdeacon asked her old mother said the sumner here she is from the middle of the throng behind him the sumner drew out an elderly woman with a hard and wizened face her head was bare her eyes were quick and restless her lips firm and long her chin was broad and heavy the woman elbowed her way forward but when she was brought face to face with the archdeacon and he asked her if she charged her daughter she looked around before answering and seeing her girl mally standing there with her white face under the fire of fifty pairs of eyes all her resolution seemed to leave her it isnt natheral i know she said a mother speaking up agen her child and with that her hard mouth softened her quick eyes reddened and filled and her hands went up to her face but nature goes down with a flood when youre looking to have another belly to fill and not a shilling at you this fortnight the girl stood without a word and not one streak of color came to her white cheeks as her mother spoke she denied it and denied it and said no and no but leave it to a mother to know what way her girls going there was a low murmur among the people at the back and some whispering the girls keen ear caught it and she turned her head over her shoulder with a defiant glance who is the man said the archdeacon recalling her with a touch of his finger on her arm she did not answer at first and he repeated the question who is the guilty man he said in a voice more stern its not true let me go said the girl in a quick undertone who is the partner of your sin its not true i say let me go will you and the girl struggled feebly in the sumners grip bring her to the altar said the archdeacon he faced about and walked toward the chancel and entered it the company followed him and drew up outside the communion rail he took a testament from the readingdesk and stepped toward the girl there was a dead hush the church provides a remedy for slander he said in a cold clear tone if you are not guilty swear that you are innocent that he who tampers with your good name may beware with that the archdeacon held the testament toward the girl she made no show of taking it he thrust it into her hand at the touch of the book she gave a faint cry and stepped a pace backward the testament falling open on to the penitentform beneath then the murmur of the bystanders rose again the girl heard it once more and dropped on her knees and covered her face and cried in a tremulous voice that echoed over the church let me go let me go the company that came for the christening had walked up the aisle blinking kerry stood apart hushing the infant in her arms it made a fretful whimper thorkell stood behind pawing the paved path with a restless foot his wife had made her way to the girls side her eyes overflowing with compassion take her to prison at the peel said the archdeacon and keep her there until she confesses the name of her paramour at that thorkells wife dropped to her knees beside the kneeling girl and putting one arm about her neck raised the other against the sumner and cried no no no she will confess there was a pause and a long hush mally let her hands fall from her face and turned her eyes full on the eyes of the young mother at her side in dead silence the two rose to their feet together confess his name whoever he is he does not deserve that you should suffer for him as well said the wife of thorkell mylrea and as she spoke she touched the girls white forehead with her pale lips do you ask that said mally with a strange quietness for one swift instant the eyes of these women seemed to see into each others heart the face of thorkells wife became very pale she grew faint and clutched the communion rail as she staggered back at the next instant mally kerruish was being hurried by the sumner down the aisle the noisy concourse that had come with them went away with them and in a moment more the old church was empty save for the company that had gathered about the font there was a great feast at ballamona that day the new house was finished and the young christian ewan mylrea of ballamona was the first to enter it for was it not to be his house and his childrens and his childrens childrens thorkells wife did not join the revels but in her new home she went back to her bed the fatigue and excitement of the day had been too much for her thorkell himself sat in his place and laughed noisily and drank much toward sunset the sumner came to say that the girl who had been taken to prison at the peel had confessed and was now at large the archdeacon got up and went out of the room thorkell called lustily on his guests to drink again and one stupefied old crony clambered to his feet and demanded silence for a toast to the father of the girls byblow he shouted when the glasses were charged and then the company laughed till the roof rang and above all was the shrill laugh of thorkell mylrea presently the door opened again and the archdeacon with a long grave face stood on the threshold and beckoned to thorkell at the head of his table thorkell went out with him and when they returned together a little later and the master of ballamona resumed his seat he laughed yet more noisily than before and drank yet more liquor on the outside of ballamona that night an old woman hooded and caped knocked at the door the loud laughter and the ranting songs from within came out to her where she stood in the darkness under the silent stars when the door was opened by hommybeg the woman asked for mylrea ballamona hommybeg repulsed her and would have shut the door in her face she called again and again and yet again and at last by reason of her importunity hommybeg went in and told thorkell who got up and followed him out the archdeacon heard the message and left the room at the same moment outside on the gravel path the old woman stood with the light of the lamp that burned in the hall on her wizened face it was mrs kerruish the mother of mally its fine times youre having of it master mylrea she said and you too your reverence but what about me and my poor girl it was yourself that did it woman said thorkell and he tried to laugh but under the stars his laugh fell short me you say me was it for all may the good god judge between us master mylrea dye know what it is that happened my poor girls gone gone eh gonegone offgone to hide her shameful face god help her better luck said thorkell and a short gurgle rattled in his dry throat luck you call it luck take care ballamona the archdeacon interposed come no threats my good woman he said and waved his hand in protestation the church has done you justice in this matter threats your reverence justice is it justice to punish the woman and let the man go free what the woman to stand penance six sabbaths by the churchdoor of six parishes and the man to pay his dirty money six pounds to you and three to me and then no mortal to name his name the old woman rummaged in the pocket at her side and pulled out a few coins here take them back im no judas to buy my own girl here i say take them thorkell had thrust his hands in his pockets and was making a great show of laughing boisterously the old woman stood silent for a moment and her pale face turned livid then by a sudden impulse she lifted her eyes and her two trembling arms god in heaven she said in a hoarse whisper let thy wrath rest on this mans head make this house that he has built for himself and for his children a curse to him and them and theirs bring it to pass that no birth come to it but death come with it and so on and on until thou hast done justice between him and me thorkells laughter stopped suddenly as the woman spoke his face quivered and his knees shook perceptibly under him then he took her by the arms and clutched her convulsively woman woman what are you saying he cried in his shrill treble she disengaged herself and went away into the night for a moment thorkell tramped the hall with nervous footsteps the archdeacon stood speechless then the sound of laughter and of song came from the room they had left and thorkell flung in on the merrymakers go home go home every man of you away with you he shouted hysterically and then dropped like a log into a chair one by one with many wise shakes of many sapient heads the tipsy revelers broke up and went off leaving the master of ballamona alone in that chamber dense with dead smoke and noisome with the fumes of liquor chapter iv the deemster of man twenty times that night thorkell devised expedients to break the web of fate at first his thoughts were of revengeful defiance by fair means or foul the woman kerruish should suffer she should be turned out of house and home she should tramp the roads as a mendicant he would put his foot on her neck then they would see what her uncanny threats had come to he tried this unction for his affrighted spirit and put it aside as useless no no he would conciliate the woman he would settle an annuity of five pounds a year upon her he would give her the snug gate cottage of old ballamona to live in his wife should send her warm blankets in winter and sometimes a pound of tea such as old folks love then must her imprecation fall impotent and his own fate be undisturbed thorkells bedroom in his new house on slieu dhoo looked over the curraghs to the sea as the day dawned he opened the window and thrust out his head to drink of the cool morning air the sun was rising over the land behind a strong breeze was sweeping over the marshes from the shore and the white curves of the breakers to the west reflected here and there the glow of the eastern sky with the salt breath of the sea in his nostrils it seemed to thorkell a pitiful thing that a man should be a slave to a mere idea a thing for shame and humiliation that the sneezing of an old woman should disturb the peace of a strong man superstition was the bugbear of the manxman but it would die of shame at its sheer absurdity only that it was pampered by the law toleration for superstition every man who betrayed faith in omens or portents or charms or spells or the power of the evil eye should be instantly clapped in the castle it was but right that a rabid dog should be muzzled thorkell shut the window closed the shutters threw off his clothes and went back to bed in the silence and the darkness his thoughts took yet another turn what madness it was what pertness and unbelief to reject that faith in which the best and wisest of all ages had lived and died had not omens and portents and charms and spells and the evil eye been believed in in all ages what midget of modern days should now arise with a superior smile and say behold this is folly saul of israel and saul of tarsus and samuel and solomon rose up and lay down in folly thorkell leaped out of bed sweating from every pore the old woman kerruish should be pensioned she should live in the cozy cottage at the gates of ballamona she should have blankets and tea and many a snug comfort her daughter should be brought back and marriedyes marriedto some honest fellow the lark was loud in the sky the rooks were stirring in the lofty ash the swallows pecking at the lattice when sleep came at length to thorkells bloodshot eyes and he stretched himself in a short and fitful slumber he awoke with a start the lusty rap of hommybeg was at the door of his room there was no itinerant postman and it was one of hommybegs daily duties to go to the postoffice he had been there this morning and was now returned with a letter for his master thorkell took the letter with nervous fingers he had recognized the sealit was the seal of the insular government the letter came from castle rushen he broke the seal and read castle rushen june d siri am instructed by his excellency to beg you to come to castletown without delay and to report your arrival at the castle to madam churchill who will see you on behalf of the duchess i have the honor to be etc the letter was signed by the secretary to the governor what did it mean thorkell could make nothing of it but that in some way it boded ill in a bewildered state of semiconsciousness he ordered that a horse should be got ready and brought round to the front half an hour later he had risen from an untouched breakfast and was seated in the saddle he rode past tynwald hill and through foxdale to the south twenty times he drew up and halfreined his horse in another direction but he went on again he could turn about at any time he never turned about at two oclock that day he stood before the low gate of the castle and pulled at the great clanging bell he seemed to be expected and was immediately led to a chamber on the north of the courtyard the room was small and low it was dimly lighted by two lancet windows set deep into walls that seemed to be three yards thick the floor was covered with a rush matting a harp stood near the fireplace a lady rose as thorkell entered she was elderly but her dress was youthful her waist was short her embroidered skirt was very long she wore spangled shoes and her hair was done into a knot on the top of her head thorkell stood before her with the mien of a culprit she smiled and motioned him to a seat and sat herself you have heard of the death of one of our two deemsters she asked thorkells face whitened and he bowed his head a successor must soon be appointed and the deemster is always a manxman he must know the language of the common people thorkells face wore a bewildered expression the ladys manner was very suave the appointment is the gift of the lord of the island and the duchess is asked to suggest a name thorkells face lightened he had regained all his composure the duchess has heard a good account of you mr mylrea she is told that by your great industry andwisdomyou have raised yourself in lifebecome rich in fact the ladys voice dropped to a tone of most insinuating suavity thorkell stammered some commonplace hush mr mylrea you shall not depreciate yourself the duchess has heard that you are a man of enterpriseone who does not begrudge the penny that makes the pound thorkell saw it all he was to be made deemster but he was to buy his appointment the duchess had lost money of late and the swashbuckler court she kept had lately seen some abridgment of its gaieties to be brief mr mylrea the duchess has half an intention of suggesting your name for the post but before doing so she wished me to see in what way your feelings lie with regard to it thorkells little eyes twinkled and his lips took an upward curve he placed one hand over his breast and bent his head my feelings madam lie in one way onlythe way of gratitude he said meekly the ladys face broadened and there was a pause it is a great distinction mr mylrea said the lady and she drew her breath inward the greater my gratitude said thorkell and how far would you go to show this gratitude to the duchess any length madam said thorkell and he rose and bowed the duchess is at present at bath i would go so far andfurther madam further said thorkell and as he spoke he thrust his right hand deep into his pocket and thereby what accident may not be saidit touched some coins that chinked there was another pause and then the lady rose and held out her hand and said in a significant tone i think sir i may already venture to hail you as deemster of man thorkell cantered home in great elevation of soul the milestones fell behind him one after one and he did not feel the burden of the way his head was in his breast his body was bent over his saddlebow again and again a trill of light laughter came from his lips where were his dreams now his omens his spells and the power of the evil eye he was judge of his island he was master of his fate passing through st johns he covered the bleak top of the hill and turned down toward the shady copse of kirk michael where the trees were thickest in the valley he drew rein by a low long house that stood back to the road it was the residence of the bishop of the island but it was now empty the bishopric had been vacant these five years and under the heavy rains from the hills and the strong winds from the sea the old house had fallen into decay thorkell sat in the saddle under the tall elms in the dim light and his mind was busy with many thoughts his memory went back with something akin to tenderness to the last days of old ewan his father to his brother gilcrist and then by a sudden transition to the incidents of that morning at castle rushen how far in the past that morning seemed to be the last rook had cawed out its low guttural note and the last gleam of daylight died off between the thick boughs of the dark trees that pattered lightly overhead as thorkell set off afresh when he arrived at ballamona the night was dark the archdeacon was sitting with his daughter who had not left her room that day thorkell still booted and spurred ran like a squirrel up the stairs and into the bedroom in twenty hot words that were fired off like a cloud of small shot from a blunderbuss thorkell told what had occurred his wifes white face showed no pleasure and betrayed no surprise her silence acted on thorkell as a rebuke and when her eyes rested on his face he turned his own eyes aside the archdeacon was almost speechless but his look of astonishment was eloquent and when thorkell left the room he followed him out at supper the archdeacons manner was that of deep amity they are prompt to appoint a deemster he said has it not struck you as strange that the bishopric has been vacant so long thorkell laughed a little over his plate and answered that it was strange maybe it only needs that a name should be suggested continued the archdeacon that is to say suggested by a man of influencea man of positionby the deemster for instance just that said thorkell with a titter then there was an interchange of further amity when the two men rose from the table the archdeacon said with a conscious smile of course if you should occurif you should ever thinkif that is the deemster should ever suggest a name for the bishopricof course he will remember thatthat blood in short is thicker than waterta fuill my schee na ushtey as the manxman says i will remember it said thorkell in a significant tone and with a faint chuckle satisfied with that days work with himself and with the world thorkell then went off to bed and lay down in peace and content and slept the sleep of the just in due course thorkell mylrea became deemster ballamona he entered upon his duties after the briefest study of the statute laws a manx judge dispensed justice chiefly by the breast laws the unwritten code locked in his own breast and supposed to be handed down from deemster to deemster the popular superstition served thorkell in good stead there was none to challenge his knowledge of jurisprudence as soon as he was settled in his office he began to make inquiries about his brother gilcrist he learned that after leaving cambridge gilcrist had taken deacons orders and had become tutor to the son of an english nobleman and afterward chaplain to the noblemans household thorkell addressed him a letter and received a reply and this was the first intercourse of the brothers since the death of old ewan gilcrist had lately married he held a small living on one of the remote moors of yorkshire he loved his people and was beloved by them thorkell wrote again and again and yet again and his letters ran through every tone of remonstrance and entreaty the end of it was that the deemster paid yet another visit to the lady deputy at castle rushen and the rumor passed over the island that the same potent influence that had made thorkell a deemster was about to make his brother the bishop of man then the archdeacon came down in white wrath to ballamona and reminded his soninlaw of his many obligations touched on benefits forgot hinted at dark sayings and darker deeds mentioned with a significant accent the girl mally kerruish protested that from causes not to be named he had lost the esteem of his clergy and the reverence of his flock and wound up with the touching assurance that on that very morning as he rode from andreas he had overheard a burly manxman say to the tawnyheaded fellow who walked with himboth of them the scabbiest sheep on the hillsthere goes the pazon that sold his daughter and bought her husband thorkell listened to the torrent of reproaches and then said quietly as he turned on his heel near is my shirt but nearer is my skin the deemsters wife held up her head no more after the christening she rarely left her room her cheeks grew thinner paler they could not grow and her meek eyes lost their faint lustre she spoke little and her interest in life seemed to be all but gone there was the same abject submission to her husband but she saw less of him day by day only the sight of her babe when kerry brought it to be nursed restored to her face the light of a fleeting joy if it stayed too long at her breast if it cried if its winsome ways made her to laugh outright the swift recoil of other feelings saddened her to melancholy and she would put the child from her with a sigh this went on for several months and meantime the deemster was too deeply immersed in secular affairs to make serious note of the shadow that hung over his house goll sheese ny lhiargaghshes going down the steep places said kerry it was winter when gilcrist mylrea was appointed to reach the island but he wrote that his wifes health was failing her that it was not unlikely that she was to bear a child and that he preferred to postpone his journey until the spring before the gorse bushes on the mountains had caught their new spears of green and before the fishermen of peeltown had gone down to the sea for their first mackerel thorkells wife was lying in her last illness she sent for her husband and bade him farewell the deemster saw no danger and he laughed at her meek adieu she was soon to be the mother of another of his childrenthat was all but she shook her head when he rallied her and when he lifted the little creeping cooing babbling ewan from the floor to his mothers bed and laughed and held up his long lean hairy finger before the baby face and asked the little one with a puff how he would like a little sister the white face on the pillow twitched and fell and the meek eyes filled and the shadow was over all goodby thorkell and for babys sake but a shrill peal of thorkells laughter rang through the chamber and at the next instant he was gone from the room that day the wife of the deemster passed beyond the sorrows of the life that had no joys the angels of life and death had come with linked hands to the new homestead of ballamona and the young mother had died in giving birth to a girl when the deemster heard what had happened his loud scream rang through every room of the house his soul was in ferment he seemed to be appalled and to be stricken not with sorrow but with fright and horror shes dead why shes dead shes dead he cried hysterically why did not somebody tell me that she would die the deemster buried his wife by the side of old ewan under the eldertree that grew by the wall of the churchyard that stands over by the sea he summoned no mourners and few stood with him by the open grave during the short funeral his horse was tied to the crosstimbers of the lychgate and while the earth was still falling in hollow thuds from the sextons spade thorkell got into the saddle and rode away before sunset he waited by the wooden landing jetty at derby haven the old seatub the king orry made the port that day and disembarked her passengers among them was the new bishop of man gilcrist mylrea he looked much older for the six years he had been away his tall figure stooped heavily his thick hair fell in wavelets on his shoulders and was already sprinkled with gray his long cheeks were deeply lined as he stepped from the boat on to the jetty he carried something very tenderly in his arms he seemed to be alone the brothers met with looks of constraint and bewilderment where is your wife asked thorkell she is gone said gilcrist i have nothing left of her but this and he looked down at the burden at his breast it was a baby boy thorkells face whitened and terror was in his eyes chapter v the manxmans bishop gilcrist mylrea had been confirmed bishop and consecrated in england but he had to be installed in his cathedral church at peeltown with all the honors of the insular decrees the ceremony was not an imposing one few of the native population witnessed it the manxman did not love the church with a love too fervent pazon pazon he would say what can you expect from the like o that never no duck wasnt hatched by a drake it was no merit in the eyes of the people that the new bishop was himself a manxman aw man they would say i knew his father and knowledge of the father implied a limitation of the respect due to the son whats his family would be asked again and again across the hearth that scarcely knew its own family more intimately maybe some of the first thats going would be the answer and then there would be a laugh the bishop was enthroned by archdeacon teare who filled his function with what grace his chagrin would allow thorkell watched his fatherinlaw keenly during the ceremony and more than once his little eyes twinkled and his lips were sucked inward as if he rolled a delectable morsel on his tongue archdeacon teare was conscious of the close fire of his soninlaws gaze and after the installation was done and the clergy that constituted priests and congregation were breaking up he approached the deemster with a benevolent smile and said well thorkell weve had some disagreements but well all meet for peace and harmony in heaven the deemster tittered audibly and said im not so sure of that though no said the archdeacon with elevated eyebrows whywhy because we read in the good book that there will be no more tears archdeacon said thorkell with a laugh like the whinny of a colt the bishop and his brother the deemster got on their horses and turned their heads toward the episcopal palace it was late when they drove under the tall elms of bishops court the old house was lighted up for their reception halfblind kerry quayle had come over from ballamona to nurse the bishops child and to put him to bed in his new home och as sweet a baby boy as any on the island ill go bail as the old body said said kerry and the bishop patted her arm with a gentle familiarity he went up to the little room where the child lay asleep and stooped over the cot and touched with his lips the soft lips that breathed gently the dignity of the bishop as he stood four hours before under the roof of st germans had sat less well on this silent man than the tenderness of the father by the side of his motherless child thorkell was in great spirits that night twenty times he drank to the health of the new bishop twenty times he reminded him of his own gracious offices toward securing the bishopric to one of his own family gilcrist smiled and responded in few words he did not deceive himself his eyes were open he knew that thorkell had not been so anxious to make him a bishop as to prevent a place of honor and emolument from going to any one less near to himself than his own brother near is my shirt as thorkell had told the archdeacon but nearer is my skin next day the bishop lost no time in settling to his work his people watched him closely he found his palace in a forlorn and dilapidated state and the episcopal demesne which was about a square mile of glebe as fallow as the rough top of the mountains the money value of this bishopric was rather less than l a year but out of this income he set to work to fence and drain his lands plant trees and restore his house to comfort if not to stateliness i find my patmos in ruins he said and that will oblige me to interrupt my charity to the poor in some measure he assumed none of the social dignity of a bishop he had no carriage and no horse for riding when he made his pastoral visitations he went afoot the journey to douglas he called crossing the pyrenees and he likened the toilsome tramp across the heavy curraghs from bishops court to kirk andreas to the passing of pilgrims across a desert to speak truth he would say i have a title too large for my scant fortune to maintain his first acts of episcopal authority did not conciliate either the populace or their superiors in station he set his face against the contraband trade and refused communion to those who followed it och terrible wonderful hard on the poor man he is with his laws agen honest trading and his bylaws and his customs and his canons and the like o that messing it was soon made clear that the bishop did not court popularity he started a school in each of the parishes by the help of a lady who settled a bounty payable at the bishops pleasure for the support of the teachers the teachers were appointed by his vicarsgeneral one day a number of the men of his own parish with jabez gawne the sleek little tailor and matthias jubman the buirdly maltster at their head came up to bishops court to complain of the schoolmaster appointed to kirk michael according to the malcontents the schoolmaster was unable to divide his syllables and his home which was the schoolhouse also was too remote for the convenience of the children so we beseech your lordships said little jabez who was spokesman to allow us a fit person to discharge the office and with submission we will recommend one the bishop took in the situation at a glance jabezs last words had let the cat out of the bag and it could not be said to be a manx cat for it had a most prodigious tail next day the bishop went to the school examined master and scholars then called the petitioners together and said i find that james quirk is qualified to teach an english school and i can not remove him but i am of your opinion that his house is in a remote part of the parish and i shall expect the parishioners to build a new schoolhouse in a convenient place near the church within a reasonable time otherwise the bounty can not be continued to them the answer staggered the petitioners but they were men with the saving grace of humor and through the mouth of little jabez which twisted into curious lines they forthwith signified to his lordship their earnest desire to meet his wish by building their schoolhouse within the churchyard though a zealous upholder of church authority the bishop was known to temper justice with mercy he had not been a month in the diocese when his sumner told him a painful story of hard penance a young girl from near peeltown had been presented for incontinence and with the partner of her crime she had been ordered to stand six sundays at the door of six churches the man who was rich had compounded with the archdeacon paying six pounds for exemption and being thenceforward no more mentioned but the woman being penniless and appalled at the disgrace before her had fled from the island the archdeacon had learned her whereabouts in england and had written to the minister of the place to acquaint him that she was under the churchs censure the minister on his part had laid before her the terror of her position if she died out of communion with gods people she resisted all appeals until her time came and then in her travail the force of the idea had worked upon her and she could resist it no more when she rose from bed she returned voluntarily to the island with the sign of her shame at her breast to undergo the penance of her crime she had stood three sundays at the doors of three churches but her health was feeble and she could scarcely carry her child so weak was she and so long the distances from her lodging in peeltown let her be pardoned the rest of her penance said the bishop the churchs censure was not passed on her to afflict her with overmuch shame or sorrow it was not until years afterward that the bishop learned the full facts of the womans case and comprehended the terrible significance of her punishment she was mally kerruish the island was in the province of york and bound by the english canons but the bishop made his own canons and none were heard to demur some of his judgments were strange but all leaned toward the weaker side a man named quayle the gyke a blusterous fellow a thorn in the side of every official within a radius of miles died after a long illness leaving nothing to a legitimate son who had nursed him affectionately this seemed to the bishop to be contrary to natural piety and in the exercise of his authority he appointed the son an executor with the others quayle the younger lived as we shall see to return evil for the bishops good a rich man of bad repute thormod mylechreest died intestate leaving an illegitimate son the bishop ordered the ordinary to put aside a sum of money out of the estate for the maintenance and education of the child but thorkell came down in the name of the civil power reversed the spiritual judgment ordered that the whole belongings of the deceased should be confiscated to the lord of the isle and left the basebegotten to charity we shall also see that the bastard returned good for thorkells evil the canons and customs of bishop mylrea not only leanedsometimes with too great indulgenceto the weaker side but they supposed faith in the people by allowing a voluntary oath as evidence and this made false swearing a terror except in the degree of superstition he encouraged belief in all its forms he trusted an oath implicitly but no man ever heard him gainsay his yea or nay a hoary old dog known as billy the gawk who had never worked within living memory who lived as they said on the houses and frequented the pothouse with more than the regularity of religious observance was not long in finding out that bishops court had awakened from its protracted sleep the bishop had been abroad for his mornings ramble and sitting on the sunny side of a high turf hedge looking vacantly out to sea he heard footsteps on the road behind him and then a dialogue of which this is a brief summary going up to the coort eh ah well its plenty thats there to take the edge off your stomach plenty plenty and a rael welcome too ah its not the stomach thats bothering me its the narves boythe narvesand a drop of the rael stuff is worth a jews eye for studdying a man after a night of it as the saying is aw billy billyaw well well well the conversation died off on the bishops ear in a loud roystering laugh and a low gurgle as undertone half an hour later billy the gawk stood before the bishop inside the gates of bishops court the old dogs head hung low his battered hat was over his eyes and both his trembling hands leaned heavily on his thick blackthorn stick and how do you live my man asked the bishop im getting a bite here and a sup there and ive had terrible little but a bit o barley bread since yesterday morning said the gawk poor man thats hard fare said the bishop but mind you call here every day for the future billy got a measure of corn worth sixpence and went straightway to the village where he sold it at the pothouse for as much liquor as could have been bought for threehalfpence and as billy the gawk drank his drop of the real stuff he laughed very loud and boasted that he could outwit the bishop but the liquor got into his head and from laughing he went on to swearing and thence to fighting until the innkeeper turned him out into the road where under the weight of his measure of corn taken in solution billy sank into a dead slumber the bishop chanced to take an evening walk that day and he found his poor penisioner who fared hard lodged on a harder bed and he had him picked up and carried into the house next morning when billy awoke and found where he was and remembered what had occurred an unaccustomed sensation took possession of him and he stole away unobserved the hoary old dog was never seen again at bishops court but if billy never came again his kith and kin came frequently it became a jest that the bishop kept the beggars from every house but his own and that no one else could get a beggar he had a book which he called his matricula pauperum in which he entered the names of his pensioners with notes of their circumstances he knew all the bits of family historywhen jemmy corkells wife was down with lumbago and when robbie quirk was to kill his little pig billy the gawk was not alone in thinking that he could outwit the bishop when the bishop wanted a new pair of boots or a new coat the tailor or shoemaker came to bishops court and was kept there until his job of work was finished the first winter after his arrival in his patmos he wanted a cloak and sent for jabez gawne the sleek little fox who had been spokesman for the conspirators against james quirk the schoolmaster jabez had cut out the cloak and was preparing it for a truly gorgeous adornment when the bishop ordered him to put merely a button and a loop on it to keep it together jabez thereupon dropped his cloth and held up his hands where he sat crosslegged on the kitchen dresser and exclaimed with every accent of aggrieved surprise my lord what would become of the poor buttonmakers and their families if every one ordered his tailor in that way how so jabez why they would be starved outright do you say so jabez yes my lord i do then button it all over jabez said the bishop the deemster was present at that interview and went away from it tittering audibly give to the raven and hell come again he muttered i forgot that poor jabez would have his buttons in his breechespocket said the bishop the manxman had not yet made up his mind concerning the composite character of bishop mylrea his dignity and his humility his reserve and his simplicity when a great event settled for the manxmans heart the problem that had been too much for his head this was no less a catastrophe than a general famine it came upon the island in the second year of the bishops residence and was the cause of many changes one of the changes was that the bishop came to be regarded by his people with the reverence of israel for samuel and by his brother the deemster with the distrust envy and at length mingled fear and hatred of saul for israels prophet the land of the island had been held under a tenure of straw known as the threelives tenure the third life was everywhere running out and the farms were reverting to the lord of the isle this disheartened the farmers who lost all interest in agriculture let their lands lie fallow and turned to the only other industry in which they had an interest the herring fishing the herrings failed this season and without fish with empty barns and a scant potato crop caused by a long summer of drought the people were reduced to poverty then the bishop opened wider the gates of bishops court which since his coming had never been closed heaven seemed to have given him a special blessing the drought had parched up the grass even of the damp curragh and left bleached on the whitening mold the poor thin dwarfed corn that could never be reaped but the glebe of bishops court gave fair crops and when the people cried in the grip of their necessity the bishop sent round a pastoral letter to his clergy saying that he had eight hundred bushels of wheat barley and oats more than his household required then there came from the north and the south the east and the west long straggling troops of buyers with little or no money to buy and bishops court was turned into a public market the bishop sold to those who had money at the price that corn fetched before the famine and in his barn behind the house he kept a chest for those who came in at the back with nothing but a sack in their hands once a day he inspected the chest and when it was low which was frequently he replenished it and when it was high which was rarely he smiled and said that god was turning away his displeasure from his people the eight hundred bushels were at an end in a month and still the famine continued then the bishop bought eight hundred other bushels wheat at ten shillings barley at six shillings and oats at four shillings and sold them at half these prices he gave orders that the bushel of the poor man was not to be stroked but left in heapedup measure a second month went by the second eight hundred bushels were consumed and the famine showed no abatement the bishop waited for vessels from liverpool but no vessels came he was a poor priest with a great title and he had little money but he wrote to england asking for a thousand bushels of grain and five hundred kischen of potatoes and promised to pay at six days after the next annual revenue a week of weary waiting ensued and every day the bishop cheered the haggard folk that came to bishops court with accounts of the provisions that were coming and every day they went up on to the head of the hill and strained their bleared eyes seaward for the sails of an english ship when patience was worn to despair the old king orry brought the bishop a letter saying that the drought had been general that the famine was felt throughout the kingdom and that an embargo had been put on all food to forbid traders to send it from english shores then the voice of the hungry multitudes went up in one deep cry of pain the hunger is on us they moaned poor once poor forever they muttered and the voice of the bishop was silent just at that moment a further disaster threatened the people their cattle which they could not sell they had grazed on the mountains and the milk of the cows had been the chief food of the children and the wool of the sheep the only clothing of their old men with parched meadows and curraghs where the turf was so dry that it would take fire from the sun the broad tops of the furzecovered hills were the sole resource of the poor at daybreak the shepherd with his six ewe lambs and one goat and the day laborer with his cow would troop up to where the grass looked greenest and at dusk they would come down to shelter with weary limbs and heavy hearts whats it sayin they would mutter a green hill when far from me bare bare when it is near at this crisis it began to be whispered that the deemster had made an offer to the lord to rent the whole stretch of mountain land from ramsey to peeltown the rumor created consternation and was not at first believed but one day the deemster with the governor of the grand enquest drove to the glen at sulby and went up the hillside not long after a light cart was seen to follow the highroad to the glen beyond ballaugh and then turn up toward the mountains by the cart track the people who were grazing their cattle on the hills came down and gathered with the people of the valleys at the foot and there were dark faces and firmset lips among them and hot words and deep oaths were heard lets off to the bishop said one and then went to bishops court half an hour later the bishop came from bishops court at the head of a draggled company of men and his face was white and hard they overtook the cart halfway up the side of the mountain and the bishop called on the driver to stop and asked what he carried and where he was going the man answered that he had provisions for the governor the deemster and the grand enquest who were surveying the tops of the mountains the bishop looked round and his lip was set and his nostrils quivered can any man lend me a knife he asked with a strained quietness a huge knife was handed to him such as shepherds carry in the long legs of their boots he stepped to the cart and ripped up the harness which was rope harness the shafts fell and the horse was free then the bishop turned to the driver and said very quietly where do you live my man at sulby my lord said the man trembling with fear you shall have leather harness tomorrow then the bishop went on his soiled and draggled company following him the cart lying helpless in the cart track behind them when they got to the top of the mountain they could see the governor and the deemster and their associates stretching the chain in the purple distance the bishop made in their direction and when he came up with them he said gentlemen no food will reach you on the mountains today the harness of your cart has been cut and cart and provisions are lying on the hillside at this thorkell turned white with wrath and clenched his fists and stamped his foot on the turf and looked piercingly into the faces of the bishops followers as sure as im deemster he said with an oath the man who has done this shall suffer dont let him deceive himselfno one not even the bishop himself shall step in between that man and the punishment of the law the bishop listened with calmness and then said thorkell the bishop will not intercede for him punish him if you can and so by god i will cried the deemster and his eye traversed the men behind his brother the bishop then took a step forward i am that man he said and then there was a great silence thorkells face flinched his head fell between his shoulders his manner grew dogged he said not a word his braggadocio was gone the bishop approached the governor you have no more right to rent these mountains than to rent yonder sea he said and he stretched his arm toward the broad blue line to the west they belong to god and to the poor let me warn you sir that as sure as you set up one stone to enclose these true gods acres i shall be the first to pull that stone down the grand enquest broke up in confusion and the mountains were saved to the people it blew hard on the hilltop that day and the next morning the news spread through the island that a ship laden with barley had put in from bad weather at douglas harbor and a terrible wonderful sight of corn plenty for all plenty plenty was the word that went round in three hours time hundreds of men and women trooped down to the quay with money to buy to all comers the master shook his head and refused to sell sell mansell sell they cried i cant sell the cargo is not mine im a poor man myself said the master well and whats that its sayin when one poor man helps another poor man god laughs the bishop came to the ships side and tried to treat for the cargo ive given bond to land it all at whitehaven said the master then the peoples faces grew black and deep oaths rose to their lips and they turned and looked into each others eyes in their impotent rage the hunger is on uswe cant starvelet every herring hang by its own gilllets board her they muttered among themselves and the bishop heard their threats my people he said what will become of this poor island unless god averts his awful judgments only god himself can know but this good man has given his bond and let us not bring on our heads gods further displeasure there was a murmur of discontent and then one long sigh of patient endurance and then the bishop lifted his hands and down on their knees on the quay the people with famished faces fell around the tall drooping figure of the man of god and from parched throats and hearts wellnigh as dry sent up a great cry to heaven to grant them succor lest they should die about a week afterward another ship put in by contrary winds at castletown it had a cargo of welsh oats bound to dumfries on the order of the provost the contrary winds continued and the corn began to heat and spoil the hungry populace enraged by famine called on the master to sell he was powerless then the bishop walked over his pyrenees and saw that the food for which his people hungered was perishing before their eyes when the master said no to him as to others he remembered how in old time david being an hungered did that which was not lawful in eating of the showbread and straightway he went up to castle rushen got a company of musketeers returned with them to the ships side boarded the ship put the master and crew in irons and took possession of the corn what wild joy among the people what shouts were heard what tears rolled down the stony cheeks of stern men patience cried the bishop bring the market weights and scales the scales and weights were brought down to the quay and every bushel of the cargo was exactly weighed and paid for at the prime price according to the masters report then the master and crew were liberated and the bishop paid the ships freight out of his own purse when he passed through the marketplace on his way back to the bishops court the people followed with eyes that were almost too dim to see and they blessed in cheers that were sobs and then god remembered his people and their troubles passed away with the opening spring the mackerel nets came back to the boats in shining silver masses and peace and plenty came again to the hearth of the poorest the manxman knew his bishop now he knew him for the strongest soul in the dark hour the serenest saint in the hour of light and peace that hoary old dog billy the gawk took his knife and scratched bm and the year of the lord on the inside of his cupboard door to record the advent of bishop mylrea a mason from ireland a catholic named patrick looney was that day at work building the square tower of the church of the marketplace and when he saw the bishop pass under him he went down on his knees on the scaffold and dropped his head for the good mans blessing a little girl of seven with sunny eyes and yellow hair stood by at that moment and for love of the childs happy face the bishop touched her head and said god bless you my sweet child the little one lifted her innocent eyes to his eyes and answered with a courtesy and god bless you too sir thank you child thank you said the bishop i do not doubt that your blessing will be as good as mine such was gilcrist mylrea bishop of man he needed all his strength and all his tenderness for the trials that were to come chapter vi the cozy nest at bishops court the children of the deemster and bishop spent the first five years as one little brood in the cozy nest at bishops court the arrangement was agreeable to both brothers while it lasted it left ballamona a silent place but the master recked little of that the deemster kept no company or next to none he dismissed all his domestics except one and hommybeg who had been gardener hitherto became groom as well the new ballamona began to gather a musty odor and the old ballamona took the moss on its wall and the lichen on its roof the deemster rose early and went late to bed much of the day was spent in the saddle passing from town to town of his northern circuit for he held a court twice weekly at ramsey and peeltown toward nightfall he was usually back at his house sitting alone by the fireplace whether as in the long nights of winter a peat fire burned there or as in the summer evenings the hearth was empty hardly a sound broke the dead quiet of the solitary place save when some litigious farmer who had caught his neighbor in the act of trespass brought him there and then for judgment to the deemsters house by that most summary kind of summons the force of superior muscles on such occasions the plaintiff and defendant with their noisy witnesses would troop into the hall with the yaps and snaps of a pack of dogs and thorkell would twist in his chair and fine one of them or perhaps both and pocket their money and then drive them all away dissatisfied to settle their dispute by other means in the darkness of the road outside meantime bishops court was musical with childrens voices and with the patter of tiny feet that ferreted out every nook and cranny of the old place there was ewan the deemsters son a slight sensitive boy who listened to you with his head aslant and with absent looks there was wee mona ewans meek sister with the big eyes and the quiet ways who liked to be fondled and would cry sometimes when no one knew why and then there was danieldannydan the bishops boy a braw little rogue with a slice of the man in him as broad as he was long with tousled fair head and face usually smudged laughing a good deal and not crying overmuch loving a good tug or a delightful bit of a fight and always feeling high disdain at being kissed and the bishop god bless him was father and mother both to the motherless brood though kerry quayle was kept as nurse he would tell a story or perhaps sing one while mona sat on his knee with her pretty head resting on his breast and ewan held on to his chair with his shy head hanging on his own shoulder and his eyes looking out at the window listening intently in his queer little absent way and when dan in lordly contempt of such doings would break in on song or story and tear his way up the back of the chair to the back of the bishop mona would be set on her feet and the biggest baby of the four there present would slide down on to his hands and knees and creep along the floor with the great little man astride him and whinny like a horse or perhaps bark like a dog and pretend to leap the fourbar gate of the babys chair tumbled down on its side and when dan would slide from his saddle and the restless horseman would turn coachman and tug the mane of his steed and all the bishops long hair would tumble over his face what shrieks of laughter what rolling on the ground and tossing up of bare legs and then when suppertime came and the porridge would be brought in and little mona would begin to whimper because she had to eat it and ewan to fret because it was barley porridge and not oaten cake and dan to devour his share with silent industry and then bellow for more than was good for him what schemes the good bishop resorted to what promises he made what crafty tricks he learned what an artful old pate his simple head suddenly became and then when kerry came with the tub and the towels and three little naked bodies had to be bathed and the bishop stole away to his unfinished sermon and little monas wet hands clung to kerrys dress and ewan standing boltupright in the three inches of water blubbered while he rubbed the sponge over an inch and a half of one cheek and dan sat on his haunches in the bottom of the tub splashing the water on every side and shrieking at every splash then the fearful commotion would bring the bishop back from the dusky room upstairs where the shaded lamp burned on a table that was littered with papers and at last when the days big battle was done and nights bigger battle began and three nightdresses were popped over three wary heads that dodged them when they could the bishop would carry three sleepless squealing piggies to bedmona at his breast because she was little ewan on his back because he was big and dan across his shoulders because he could not get to any loftier perch presently there would be three little pairs of knees by the cribside and then three little flaxen polls on the pillow tumbling and tossing and with the great dark head of the bishop shaking gravely at them from over the counterpane and then a hush broken by a question lisped drowsily or a babyrime that ran a line or two and stopped and at length the long deep quiet and the silence of sleep and the bishop going off on tiptoe to the dusky room with the shaded lamp and tomorrows sermon lying half written beneath it and so five tearing romping years went by and though they were the years of the famine and the pestilence and of many another dark cloud that hung blackest over bishops court a world of happiness was crowded into them then when ewan was six years old and danny and mona were five and the boys were buttoning their own corduroys the deemster came over from ballamona and broke up the little nest of hummingbirds gilcrist said thorkell you are ruining the children and i must take my own away from you the bishops grave face grew suddenly white and when after a pause he said no no thorkell you dont mean that there was a tremor in his deep voice i do mean it said the deemster let a father treat his children as the world will treat them when they have nothing but the world for their fatherthats my maxim and ill act up to it with my own thats hard treatment thorkell said the bishop and his eyes began to fill spare the rod spoil the child said thorkell maybe youre right said the bishop in a quivering voice and he could say no more but the deemster was as good as his word ewan and mona were removed to ballamona there they had no nurse and shifted a good deal for themselves they ate oaten cake and barley porridge three times a day and that was to build up their bone and brain they were bathed in cold water summer and winter and that was to make them hardy they wore frocks with low necks and that was to strengthen their lungs they went to bed without a light and fell asleep while trembling in each others arms and that was to make them brave and prevent them from becoming superstitious if the spirit and health of the little ones did not sink under their spartan training it was because nature was stronger than custom and because god is very good to the bruised hearts of children they did not laugh too loud when the deemster was near and they were never seen to pull his vest or to tug him by his hair or to ride across his back which was never known to stoop low for their little legs to mount the house was not much noisier or dirtier or less orderly for their presence they did not fill it with their voices or tumble it out of its propriety with their busy fingers as with cousin dannys powerful assistance they had filled and tumbled bishops court until every room in the comfortable old place seemed to say to you with a wink and a nod a child lives here this is his own home and he is master of the whole house but when they stole away to their own little room at the back where no fire burned lest they should grow nesh not all the masks that were ever made to make life look like a sorry tragedy could have hidden the joy that was always wanting to break out on their little faces there they would romp and laugh and crow and sing and ewan would play at preaching with the back of a chair for a pulpit and his pinafore for surplice and mona of the big eyes sitting on the floor below for choir and congregation and if in the middle of their play it happened that all at once they remembered danny then ewans head would fall aside and his look in an instant be far away and monas lower lip would hang suddenly and the sunshine would straightway die out of her laughing face when the bishop lost the deemsters children he found a great void in his heart but little danny troubled his big head not at all about the change that had taken place he laughed just as loud and never cried at all and when he awoke in the morning and his cousins were not there their place forthwith knew them no more in a vague way he missed his playmates but that only meant that the bishop had to be his playmate even more than before and the bishop was nothing loth away they ran through the copse together these boon companions and if the bishop hid behind a tree of course danny found him and if it was danny that hid of course the bishop searched high and low and never once heard the merry titter that came from behind the gorse bush that was armslength away until with a burst of laughter danny leaped out on him like an avalanche they talked one jargon too for dannys industrious tongue could not say its w and it made an s of its f how many heels has your cart got carter sour very srosty today master well then come in to the sire in a strange and unconscious way the bishop developed a sort of physical affinity with this sworn ally when no sound seemed to break the silence he could hear the little mans cry through three stout stone walls and up two flights of stairs if the child fell and hurt himself half a mile from the house the bishop at home felt as if he had himself dropped on a sharp stone and cut his knee if he clambered to the top of a high wall that was out of sight the bishop in his study felt dizzy but extraordinary as was this affinity of the bishop and his boy the intercourse that subsisted between danny and his nurse was yet more marvelous the bishop had merely a prescience of disaster threatening his darling but kerry seemed by an exercise of some nameless faculty to know the childs whereabouts at any moment of day or night half blind at the time of the birth of little ewan kerry quayle had grown stoneblind since and this extraordinary power was in truth her second sight it was confined to danny her nursling but over his movements it was an absolute gift och she cried leaping up from the spinningwheel the wee craythurs into the chapel as the sayin is impossible the bishop answered ive only this moment locked the door but kerry and the bishop went to the chapel to search for him and found the fugitive who had clambered in through an open window lighting the candle at the readingdesk after washing his black hands in the font aw now said kerry lifting up her hands and her blind face in horror whats that its saying the little hemlock is sister to the big hemlock which was as much as to say that the small sin was akin to the great sin and that little danny who had been caught in an act of sacrilege would one day be guilty of worse nonsense womannonsense a child is but a child said the bishop leading the delinquent away that dayit was thursday of whitsun weekconvocation was to be held at bishops court and the clergy had already begun to gather in the library that looked west toward the sea to keep danny out of further mischief the bishop led him to his own room and there he poured water into a bowl and proceeded to bathe his eyes which had latterly shown signs of weakness to do this he had need to remove his spectacles and he set them down on the table by his hand danny watched these proceedings with a roguish look and when the bishops face was in the bowl he whipped up the spectacles and pushed them down his neck between his frock and his breast with a whirr and a puff the bishop shook the water from his face and dried it and when the lash comb had tossed back his long hair he stretched his hand out for his spectacles he could not feel them and when he looked he could not see them and then he called on danny to search for them and straightway the rogue was on hands and knees hunting in every possible and impossible place but danny could not find themnot he convocation was waiting for its chief but the spectacles could not be found and the bishop for all bookish services was blinder than a bat without them high and low up and down on every table under every paper into every pocket and still no spectacles at length the bishop paused and looked steadily into the eyes of the little man sitting on his haunches and tittering audibly where are the glasses danny laughed very loud where are my glasses danny veg danny veg laughed still louder there was nothing to be made of an answer like that so down on his knees went the bishop again to see if the rogue had hidden the spectacles beneath the hearthrug or under the seat of the settle or inside the shaving pot on the hearth and all the time danny with his hands clasped under his haunches hopped about the room like a frog with great starry eyes and crowed and laughed till his face grew scarlet and the tears trickled down his cheeks blind kerry came to say that the gentlemen wanted to know when the bishop would be with them as the saying was and two minutes afterward the bishop strode into the library through a line of his clergy who rose as he entered and bowed to him in silence when his tall figure bent slightly to each of them in turn your pardon gentlemen for this delay he said gravely and then he settled himself at the head of the table hardly had the clergy taken their seats when the door of the room was dashed open with a lordly bang and into the muggy room made darker still by twenty long black coats there shot a gleam of laughing sunshinedanny himself at a hop skip and a jump with a pair of spectacles perched insecurely on the sliding bridge of his diminutive nose the archdeacon was there that day and when the intruder had been evicted by blind kerry who came in hot pursuit of him he shook his head and looked as solemn and as wise as his little russet face would admit and said ah my lord youll kill that child with kindness may you never heap up for yourself a bad harvest the bishop made no answer but breathed on the restored spectacles and rubbed them with his red silk handkerchief i hold with the maxim of my soninlaw the deemster the archdeacon continued let a child be dealt with in his fathers house as the world hereafter will deal with him nay nay but more gently said the bishop if he is a good man ten to one the world will whip himlet him remember his fathers house as a place of love ah my lord said the archdeacon but what of the injunction against the neglect of the rod the bishop bent his head and did not answer once in a way during these early years the bishop took danny across to ballamona and then the two little exiles in their fathers house banished from the place of love would rush into the bishops arms mona at his chin ewan with hands clasped about his leg and flaxen head against the great seals that hung from his fobpocket but as for danny and his cousins and the cousins and danny they usually stood a while and inspected one another with that solemnity and aloofness which is one of the phenomena of child manners and then when the reserve of the three hard little faces had been softened by a smile they would forthwith rush at one another with mighty clinched fists and pitch into one another for five minutes together amid a chorus of squeals in this form of salutation danny was never known to fail and as he was too much of a man to limit his greeting to ewan he always pitched into mona with the same masculine impartiality but the time came again when the salutation was unnecessary for they were sent to school together and they saw one another daily there was only one school to which they could be sent and that was the parish school the same that was taught by james quirk who could not divide his syllables according to the account of jabez gawne the tailor the parishioners had built their new schoolhouse near the church and it lay about midway between bishops court and ballamona it was also about halfway down the road that led to the sea and that was a proximity of neverending delight after school in the long summer evenings the scholars would troop down to the shore in one tumultuous company the son of the bishop with the son of the cobbler the deemsters little girl with the big girl of jabez who sent his child on charity ragged and wellclad clean and dirty and the biggest lad rigging the smallest and not caring a haporth if his name was the name of the deemster or the name of billy the gawk handinhand danny and ewan with mona between would skip and caper along the sands down to where the gray rocks of the head jutted out into the sea and bounded the universe mona prattling and singing shaking out her wavy hair to the wind dragging danny aside to look at a seaweed and pulling ewan to look at a shell tripping down to the waters edge until the big bearded waves touched her boots and then back once more with a halffrightened halfaffected laughterloaded scream then the boys would strip and bathe and mona being only a woman would mind the mens clothes or they would shout all together at the gulls and danny would mock mother carys chicken and catch the doleful cry of the cormorant and pelt with pebbles the longnecked bird as it sat on the rocks or he would clamber up over the slippery seaweed across the sharp slate ribs to where the seapinks grew in the corries and the seaduck laid her eggs and sing out from some dizzy height to where ewan held his breath below and mona stood crying and trembling on the sands what times for danny how the lad seemed to swell and grow every day of life before he was ten he had outgrown ewan by half an inch and gone through a standup fight with every ruffian under twelve then down among the fishermen on the beach what sport knocking about among the boats pulling at the oars like mad or tugging at the sheets baling out and pushing off and riding away over the white breakers and shouting for pure devilment above the plash of the water aw man its all for the happy the lad feels inside said billy quilleash danny and billy quilleash were sworn chums and the little sandboy learned all the old salts racy sayings and went home to bishops court and fired them off at his father theres a storm coming the bishop said one day looking up at the scudding clouds ay ay said danny with his small eye askew the long cats tail was going off at a slant a while ago and now the round thick skate yonder is hanging mortal low the wind is rising the bishop said on another occasion ay davys putting on the coppers for the parson said the young heretic school too was only another playground to danny a little less tumultuous but no less delightful than the shore the schoolmaster had grown very deaf since the days when the bishop pronounced him qualified to teach an english school this deafness he did his best to conceal for he had a lively recollection of the dissatisfaction of the parishioners and he had a natural unwillingness to lose his bread and butter but his scholars were not easily hoodwinked and danny the daring young dog would play on the masters infirmity spell me the word arithmetic the schoolmaster might ask when the boys were ranged about his desk in class and danny would answer with a face of tragic solemnity twice one are two twice two are four very good the schoolmaster would reply and now sir repeat me your multiplication tabletwice times and then while the master held his head aside as if in the act of intent listening and the other boys twisted their faces to hide their grins or sniggered openly danny still with the face of a judge would repeat a paraphrase of the familiar little hymn jemmy was a welshman jemmy was a thief jemmy dont speak so fast sirsay your figures more plainly the schoolmaster would interrupt and danny would begin again with a more explicit enunciation jemmy quirk was a welshman jemmy then the sniggers and the snorts would rise to a tumult and down would come the masters cane on the desk silence boys and let the boy say his table some of you big lads might take example by him and be none the worse go on danielyou are quite right so fartwice five are ten twice six there was one lad in the school who could not see the humor of the situation a slim quiet boy only a little older than danny but a long way ahead of him in learning and one evening this solemn youngster hung behind when school was breaking up and blurted out the mischief to the schoolmaster he did not get the reception he expected for in dire wrath at the imputation that he was deaf mr quirk birched the informant soundly nor did the reward of his treachery end with birching it did not take half an hour for the report of both birching and treachery to travel by that swiftest of telephones the schoolboy tongue through that widest of kingdoms the world of school and the same evening while mona on her way home was gathering the bluebells that grew on the lea of the yellowtipped gorse and ewan was chasing the humming bee through the hot air that was thick with midges danny with a face as white as a haddock was striding alone by a long circuit across the moor to where a cottage stood by the path across the head there he bounded in at the porch caught a boy by the coat dragged him into the road pummeled him with silent vigor while the lad bellowed and struggled to escape in another instant an old woman hobbled out of the cottage on a stick and with that weapon she made for danny and gave him sundry hard raps on the back and head och the craythur she cried get off with yethe damonextraordinarywould the lord think it nowits in the breed of yeget off or ill break every bone in your skin danny paid as little heed to the old womans blows as to her threats and was up with his fist for the twentieth time to come down on the craven traitor who bellowed in his grip when all at once a horses feet were tramping about their limbs where they struggled in the road and a stern voice from over their heads shouted stop stop or must i bring the whip across your flanks it was the deemster danny fell aside on the right of the horse and the old woman and the boy on the left what does this mean asked the deemster turning to his nephew but danny stood there panting his eyes like fire his fists clinched his knuckles standing out like ribs of steel and he made no answer who is this blubbering coward asked the deemster pointing with a contemptuous gesture to the boy half hidden by the old womans dress coward is it said the woman coward you say who is the brat mrs kerruish said the deemster sharply at that mrs kerruish for it was she pulled the boy from behind her plucked off his hat ran her wrinkled hand over his forehead to his hair and held up his face and said look at him deemsterlook at him you dont come this way often but look at him while youre here did you ever see his picture before never never see a face like that no not when you look in the glass deemster get into the house woman said the deemster in a low thick tone and so saying he put the spurs to his horse as for this young demon here said the old woman pushing the boy back and pointing with her stick at danny hell have his heel on your neck yet deemsterand remember the word im saying chapter vii danny the madcap now danny was a great favorite with the deemster and nothing that he could do was amiss the spice of mischief in the lad made him the darling of the deemsters heart his own son disappointed the deemster he seemed to have no joy in him ewan was quiet and his father thought him a milksop there was more than one sense in which the deemster was an indifferent judge of his species but he found no difficulty in comprehending the idiosyncrasy of his brothers son over the pathetic story of dannys maddest prank or the last mournful account of his daring devilry the deemster would chuckle and shake and roll his head between his shoulders then give the boy a slap on his hindmost part accompanied by a lusty name and finally rummage for something in his pocket and smuggle that something into the young rascals palm danny would be about fifteen years of agea lump of a lad and therefore out of the leadingstrings of his nurse kerry quaylewhen he concocted a most audacious scheme whereof kerry was the chief subject and victim this had nothing less for its aim and object than to get kerry married to hommybegthe blind woman to the deaf man now hommy was a gaunt rawboned man dressed in a rough blue jacket and a short gray petticoat his full and proper name was now quite lost he was known as hommybeg sometimes as hommybegbill a name which at once embodied a playful allusion to his great physique and a certain genealogical record in showing that he was little tom the son of bill though scarcely short of stonedeaf he was musical he played two instruments the fiddle and the voice the former squeaked like a rasp and the latter thundered like a foghorn away to ballamona master danny went and found hommybeg thinning a bed of peonies aw man the terrible fond she is of the like o that swate flower said the young rogue who spoke the homespun to the life aw dear the way she smells at them when you bring them up for the bishop what ould kerry smelling is it and never a whiff of a smell at the breed o them och no its not the flowers its the manthe man hommy thatll do thatll do and blind too well well but the swate temper thats at her hommy and the coaxing and coaxing of her and man alive the fond she is of you a fine sort of a man anyways and a rael good voice at him aw extraordinary extraordinary dye raely mane it mane it aw well well and who but you doesnt know it hommy astonishing astonishing come up to the coort and take a cup o tay with her hommybeg scratched his head is it rarely true danny veg ill lave it with you hommy said danny and straightway the young rascal went back to bishops court lighted upon blind kerry and entered upon a glowing description of the personal charms of hommybeg aw the goodlooking he is astonishing my gough you should see him in his sunday hat or maybe with a frill on his shirt and smiling and all to that terrible dacent sort is hommybeg what the loblollyboy in the petticoat aw but the tenderhearted he is for all and bless me kerry woman the swate he is on you what the ould redhead that comes singing as the saying is

tay with you and the like o that do you raely mane it danny my chree the very next day hommybeg arrived at the kitchen door of bishops court in his sunday hat in the shirt with the frill to it and with a peony as big as a march cabbage in his fist the end of it all was that kerry and hommybeg were forthwith asked in church wild as the freak was that made the deaf man and the blind woman man and wife their marriage was none the less happy for their infirmities the deemster heard of the plot on his way to church on sunday morning and he laughed in his throat all through the service and when the first of the askings was solemnly proclaimed from the readingdesk he tittered audibly in his pew danny was tired of the womans second sightfound it inconvenient verywanted to be rid of hergood he chuckled but not long afterward he enjoyed a jest that was yet more to his taste for his own prime butt of ridicule the church itself was then the victim it was an old manx custom that on christmas eve the church should be given up to the people for the singing of their native carols or carvals the curious service was known as oiel verree the eve of mary and at every such service for the last twenty years hommybeg the gardener and mr james quirk the schoolmaster had officiated as singers in the strange manx ritual great had hitherto been the rivalry between these musical celebrities but word had gone round the town that at length their efforts were to be combined in a carol which they were to sing together dan had effected this extraordinary combination of talent by a plot which was expected to add largely to the amusement of the listeners hommybeg could not read a syllable yet he never would sing his carol without having the printed copy of it in his hand of course mr quirk the schoolmaster could read but as we have seen he resembled hommybeg in being almost stonedeaf each could hear himself sing but neither could hear another and now for the plot master dan called on the gardener at his cottage on the brew on the morning of the day before christmas day and hommy said he its morthal strange the way a man of your commonsense cant see that youd wallop that squeaking ould jemmy quirk in a jiffy if youd only consent to sing a ballad along of him bless me man alive its then theyd be seeing what a weak ould cracked pot of a voice is at him hommybegs face began to wear a smile of benevolent condescension observing his advantage the young rascal continued do it at the oiel verree tonight hommy hell sing his treble and youll sing seconds to him it was an unlucky remark the gardener frowned austerely me sing seconds to the craythur no never dan explained to hommybeg with a world of abject apologies that there was a sense in which seconds meant firsts and at length the gardener was mollified and consented to the proposal but one idea was firmly rooted in his mindnamely that if he was to sing a carol with the schoolmaster he must take the best of care to sing his loudest in order to drown at once the voice of his rival and the bare notion that it was he who was singing seconds to such a poor creature as that then master danny trotted off to the schoolhouse where he was now no longer a scholar and consequently enjoyed an old boys privilege of approaching the master on equal terms and jemmy he said its morthal strange the way a man of your commonsense cant see that youd wallop that squeaking old hommybeg in a jiffy if youd only consent to sing a ballad along of him do it at the oiel verree tonight jemmy and bless me thats the when theyll be seeing what a weak ould crackpot of a voice is at the craythur the schoolmaster fell even an easier prey to the plot than the gardener had been a carol was selected it was to be the ancient manx carol on the bad women mentioned in the bible as having from eve downward brought evil on mankind now hommybeg kept his carols pinned against the walls of his cottage the bad women was the carol which was pinned above the mantelpiece just under the pendulum of the clock with the facetious face it resembled the other prints in being worn crumpled and dirty but hommybeg knew it by its position and he could distinguish every other carol by its place on the walls danny had somehow got a skute into this literary mystery and after arranging with the schoolmaster the carol that was to be sung he watched hommybeg out of his cottage and then went into it under pretense of a friendly call upon blind kerry before he left the cottage he had taken down the carol that had been pinned above the mantelpiece and fixed up another in place of it from the opposite side of the room the substituted carol happened oddly enough to be a second copy of the carol on bad women with this radical difference the copy taken from under the clock was the version of the carol in english and the copy put up was the version in manx toward ten oclock that night the church bells began to ring and hommybeg looked at the clock took the carol from under the pendulum put on his best petticoat and went off to church now there were to be seasonable rejoicings at the court on the morrow and kerry had gone over to help at the christmas preparations ewan and mona had always spent their christmas at bishops court since the day when they left it as children that night they had arrived as usual and after they had spent some hours with danny in dressing the house in a greenandred garment of hibbin and hollin the bishop had turned them off to bed dannys bedroom was the little crib over the library and ewans was the room over that all three bade the bishop goodnight and went into their rooms but danny did not go to bed he listened until he heard the bishop in the library twisting his chair and stirring the peats and then he whipped off his boots and crept upstairs to ewans room there in bated breath he told of the great sport that was to come off at the oiel verree announced his intention of going and urged ewan to go with him they could just jump through the little window of his room and light on the soft grass by the library wall and get in again by the same easy means no one would know that they had been out and what high jinks they must have but no ewan was not to be persuaded and danny set off alone hommybeg did not reach the church until the parsons sermon was almost over prayers had been said in a thin congregation but no sooner were they done than crowds of young men and maidens tripped down the aisles the young women went up into the gallery and from that elevation they shot down at their bachelor friends large handfuls of peas to what ancient spirit of usage beyond the ancient spirit of mischief the strange practise was due we must be content to leave as a solemn problem to the learned and curious antiquaries nearly everyboy carried a candle and the candles of the young women were adorned with a red ribbon or rosette in passing out of the church the parson came face to face with hommybeg who was pushing his way up the aisle the expression on his face was not at the moment one of peculiar grace and he stopped the gardener and said sharply in his ear mind you see that all is done in decency and order and that you close my church before midnight aw but the church is the peoples im thinkin said hommybeg with a shake of his tousled head the people are as ignorant as goats said the parson angrily aw well and youre their shepherd so just make sheeps of them said hommybeg and he pushed on danny was there by this time and with a face of mighty solemnity he sat on the right of hommybeg and held a candle in his left hand when everything was understood to be ready and willasthorn the clerk had taken his station inside the communion rail the business of the oiel verree began first one man got up and sung a carol in english then another sung a manx carol but the great event of the night was to be the carol sung by the sworn enemies and rivals hommybeg and mr james quirk at last the time came for these worthies they rose from opposite sides of the church eyed each other with severe looks stepped out of their pews and walked down the aisle to the door of the porch then they turned about in silence and standing side by side faced the communion the tittering in the gallery and whispering in the body were audible to all except the persons who were the cause of both hush hush man alive thats him thats him bless me look at hommybeg and the petticut and the handkercher pinnin round his throat aw dear its what hes used of a regular punch and judy danny was exerting himself at that moment to keep order and silence hush man let them make a start for all the carol the rivals were about to sing contained some thirty verses it was an ancient usage that after each verse the carol singers should take a long stride toward the communion by the time the carol of bad women came to an end the carol singers must therefore be at the opposite end of the church there was now a sublime scorn printed on the features of mr quirk as for hommybeg he looked at this last instant like a man who was rather sorry than otherwise for his rash adversary the rermantic theyre looking whispered a girl in the gallery to the giggling companion beside her expectation was at its highest when hommybeg thrust his hand into his pocket and brought out the printed copy of the carol hommy unfolded it glanced at it with the air of a conductor taking a final look at his score nodded his head at it as if in approval and then with a magnanimous gesture held it between himself and mr quirk the schoolmaster in turn glanced at it glanced again glanced a third time at the paper and up into the face of hommybeg anxiety was now on tiptoe hush dye hear hush whispered danny from his pew hush man or its spoiling it all youll be for sure at the moment when mr quirk glanced into the face of hommybeg there was a smile on that countenance mr quirk mistook that smile he imagined he saw a trick the schoolmaster could read and he perceived that the carol which the gardener held out to him was not the carol for which he had been told by master danny to prepare they were by arrangement to have sung the english version of bad women this was the manx version and though the metre was the same it was always sung to a different tune ah mr quirk understood it all the monster wanted to show that he james quirk schoolmaster could only sing one carol but as sure as his name was jemmy he would be equal with him he could sing this manx version and he would it was now mr quirks turn to smile aw look at themthe two of themgrinnin together like a pair of old gurgoils on the steeple at a motion of the gardeners hand intended to beat the time the singers began hommybeg sang the carol agreed uponthe english version of bad women mr quirk sang the carol they held in their handsthe manx version of bad women neither heard the other and to dispel the bare notion that either was singing seconds each bawled at the utmost reach of his lungpower to one tune hommybeg sang thus from the days of adam her mischief you may trace and to another mr quirk sang she ish van voir ain ooilley son vee da adam ben such laughter how the young women in the gallery lay back in their seats with hysterical shrieks how the young fellows in the body made the sacred edifice ring with guffaws but the singers with eyes steadfastly fixed on the paper heard nothing but each his own voice three verses had been sung and three strides made toward the communion when suddenly the laughter and shouting of the people ceased all eyes had turned toward the porch there the bishop stood with blank amazement printed on his face his head bare and one hand on the halfopened door if a spectre had appeared the consternation had scarcely been greater danny had been rolling in his pew with unconstrained laughter but at sight of the bishop his candle fell from his hand and sputtered on the bookrail the bishop turned about and before the people had recovered from their surprise he was gone at the next moment everybody got up without a word and left the church in two minutes more not a soul remained except hommybeg and mr jemmy quirk who with eyes riveted on the printed carol in their hands still sang lustily oblivious of the fact that they had no audience when danny left the church that night it was through the lancetwindow of the vestry dropping on the turf at the northeast of the church he leaped the wall that divided the churchyard from a meadow on the north and struck upon a path that went round to bishops court by way of the cliffhead the path was a long one but it was lonesome and its lonesomeness was no small merit in dannys view that night the bishop must return to the court by the highway through the village and the bishop must be in front of him the night was dark and dumb and laden with salt scent the dank vapor floated up from the sea danny walked quickly the deep boom of the waters rolling on the sand below came up to him through the dense air late as was the hour he could hear the little sandpiper screaming at orris head the seaswallow shot over him too with its low mournful cry save for these sounds and the quick beat of his own feet all was still around him beneath his stubborn bit of skepticism danny was superstitious he was full to the throat of fairylore and stories of witchcraft he had learned both from old billy quilleash and his mates as they sat barking their nets on the shore and that night the ghostly memories would arise do what he might to keep them down to banish them danny began to whistle and failing to enliven himself much by that exercise he began to sing his selection of a song was not the happiest under the circumstances it was the doleful ballad of myle charaine danny sang it in manx but here is a stave of it in english oh myle charaine where got you your gold lone lone you have left me here oh not in the curragh deep under the mold lone lone and void of cheer he had come up to bishops court on the seafront and there the bishops library stood out from the body of the old house between the chapel porch and the kitchen offices a light was in the library and passing over the soft grass with the soft flight of a lapwing danny peered in at the curtainless window the familiar room was empty on the hearth a turf fire burned without flame and bathed the bookencased walls in a rosy red the bishops easychair in its white covering stood at one side of the ingle his slippers in front of it and beside it on the little threelegged mahogany table were the inkhorn and the long quill and the bishops fourcornered library cap the door stood ajar and the two candles in the two brass brackets at each side of the fireplace were tipped by their extinguishers the bishop had not returned but the faint smile of triumph which at that thought rested like a ray of pale sunshine on dannys face suddenly vanished in a lads vague way danny now realized that it had not been merely because the night was dark and the road lonely that he had whistled and sung he hung his head where he stood in the night and as if by an involuntary movement he lifted his cap and fumbled it at the next instant danny was clambering up the angle of the wall to the lead flat that covered the projecting part of the library from this lead flat there opened the window of his own bedroom and in a moment he was striding through it all was darkness within but he needed no light to see his way in that room he knew every crib and corner the place where he kept his fishing lines the nail from which his mothnet hung the bottle on the drawers in which he had his minnows and the can with the lid well down that contained the newts that were the terror of all the women in the house if danny had been as blind as old kerry he could have found everything his room had in it except perhaps his breeches or his shirt or his other coat or that cap that was always getting itself lost and of course no sight and no light would help a lad to find things like these hardly had danny taken a step into his room before he realized that some one had been there since he left it derry his whiteeyed collie who had been lying on the bed dropped on the floor and frisked about him down derry down he whispered and for a moment he thought it might have been derry that had pushed open the door but the dogs snout could not have turned down the counterpane of the bed or opened the top drawer that held the fishing flies or rummaged among the long rods in the corner the counterpane lay double the drawer stood open the rods were scatteredsome one had been there to look for him and not finding him had tried to find a reason for his absence and that some one had either come into the room in the dark orbeen blind aw its always kerry thats in it danny told himself and with an unpleasant remembrance of kerrys strange faculty whereof he was the peculiar victim he reflected that his race home had been vain then on the instant danny found himself concocting a trick to defeat appearances he had a foot on the stairs to carry out his design when he heard the door at the front of the house open and close and a familiar step pass through the hall the bishop had returned danny waited and listened now there was talking in the library dannys quick ear could scarcely distinguish the words but the voices he could not mistakethey were the voices of the bishop and blind kerry with a stealthy stride danny went up to ewans room ewan was sleeping feeling hot and cold together danny undressed and turned into bed before he had time to bury his head under the clothes he heard the bishop on the stairs the footsteps passed into the room below and then after an interval they were again on the stairs in another moment danny knew though of course his eyes were fast shut and he was sleeping most profoundly that the bishop with a lighted candle in his hand was leaning over him it would wrong the truth to say that master dannys slumber was disturbed that night but next morning when the boys awoke together and ewan rose on his elbow with a puzzled gaze at his unexpected bedfellow danny sidled out of the bed on to the floor and without looking too much into ewans face he began his toilet as was his wont by putting on his cap he had got this length and was standing in cap and shirt when he blurted out the mischief of last nights adventure the singing the sudden appearance of the bishop the race home along the cliff and the coming up to bed but you wont let on ewan will you he said ewan looked at that moment as if the fate of the universe hung on his answer but he gave the promise that was required of him then the boys went downstairs and found mona and imparted the dread secret to her presently the bishop came in to breakfast with a face that was paler than usual and more than ordinarily solemn danny he said why did you not sleep in your own bed last night my boy i slept with ewan father danny answered promptly the bishop said no more then and they all sat down at the table and so you two boys went to bed togethertogether he said and with a dig of emphasis on his last word repeated he looked at ewan ewans face crimsoned and his tongue faltered yes uncle the bishops eyes fell boys he said in another tone would you think it i have done you a great wrong the boys were just then most intent on the tablecloth you must know the bishop went on that there was a most unseemly riot at the oiel verree and all night long i have been sore troubled by the bad thought that danny was in the midst of it the boys held their heads very low over their plates and monas big eyes filled visibly dannys impulse was to blurt out the whole mischief there and then but he reflected that to do so would be to charge ewan with falsehood ewan on his part would have confessed to the deception but he knew that this would mean that danny must be punished the boys wise head could see no way out of a tangle like that the breakfast was the quietest ever eaten on a christmas morning at bishops court and little as the talking was the bishop strangely enough did it all but when they rose from the table and the boys slunk out of the room with most portentous gravity mona went up to the bishop with a face full of liquid grief and turning the whole depths of her great troubled eyes upon him the little maiden said ewan didnt mean to tell you what wasnt trueand cousin danny didnt intend to deceivebut he wasthat is dannyi meandear uncle you wont you mean that danny was at the oiel verree last nighti know it child i know it said the bishop and he patted her head and smiled but the bishop knew also that danny had that day made one more step down the steep of life and left a little ghost of his childself behind him and in his secret heart the bishop saw that shadowy form and wept over it chapter viii passing the love of women now the facts of this history must stride on some six years and in that time the deemster had lost nearly all the little interest he ever felt in his children mona had budded into womanhood tender gracious quieta tall fairhaired maiden of twenty with a drooping head like a flower with a voice soft and low and the full blue eyes with their depths of love and sympathy shaded by long fluttering lashes as the trembling sedge shades the deep mountain pool it was as ripe and beautiful a womanhood as the heart of a father might dream of but the deemster could take little pleasure in it if mona had been his son her quiet ways and tractable nature might have counted for something but a woman was only a woman in the deemsters eyes and the deemster like the bedouin chief would have numbered his children without counting his daughter as for ewan he had falsified every hope of the deemster his spartan training had gone for nothing he was physically a weakling a tall spare youth of twoandtwenty fairhaired like his sister with a face as spiritual and beautiful and hardly less feminine he was of a selftorturing spirit constantly troubled with vague questionings and though in this regard he was very much his fathers son the deemster held his temperament in contempt the end of all was that ewan showed a strong desire to enter the church the deemster had intended that his son should study the law and follow him in his place when his time came but ewans womanly temperament coexisted with a manly temper into the law he would not go and the church he was resolved to follow the bishop had then newly opened at bishops court a training college for his clergy and ewan sought and obtained admission the deemster fumed but his son was not to be moved even by his wrath this was when ewan was nineteen years of age and after two more years the spirituality of his character overcame the obstacle of his youth and the bishop ordained him at twentyone then ewan was made chaplain to the household at bishops court hardly had this been done when ewan took another step in life with the knowledge of the bishop but without consulting the deemster he married being now of age a pretty child of sixteen the daughter of his fathers old foe the vicar of the parish when knowledge of this act of unwisdom reached the deemster his last remaining spark of interest in his son expired and he sent mona across to bishops court with a curt message saying that ewan and his wife were at liberty if they liked to take possession of the old ballamona thus he turned his back upon his son and did his best to wipe him out of his mind ewan took his young wife to the homestead that had been the place of his people for six generations the place where he himself had been born the place where that other ewan his good grandfather had lived and died more than ever for these events the deemster became a solitary man he kept no company he took no pleasures alone he sat night after night in his study at ballamona and ballamona was asleep before he slept and before it awoke he was stirring his daughters presence in the house was no society for the deemster she grew beside him like her mothers youth a yet fairer vision of the old days coming back to him hour by hour but he saw nothing of all that disappointed in his sole hope his son whom truly he had never loved for loves sake but only for his own sorry ambitions he sat down under his disappointment a doubly soured and thricehardened man he had grown noticeably older but his restless energy suffered no abatement biweekly he kept his court but few sought the law whom the law did not first find for word went round that the deemster was a hard judge and deemed the laws in rigor if men differed about money they would say och why go to the deemster its throwing a bone into the bad dogs mouth and then they would divide their difference the one remaining joy of the deemsters lonely life was centred in his brothers son dan that lusty youth had not disappointed his expectations at twenty he was a braw brownhaired browneyed lad of six feet two inches in stature straight and upright and with the thews and sinews of an ox he was the athlete of the island and where there was a tough job of wrestling to be had or a delightful bit of fighting to be done there was dan in the heart of it aw and middling few could come anigh him the people used to say but more than in dans great stature and great strength the little deemster took a bitter pleasure in his daring irreverence for things held sacred in this regard dan had not improved with improving years scores of tricks his sad pugnacity devised to help the farmers to cheat the parson of his tithe and it added not a little to the deemsters keen relish of freaks like these that it was none other than the son of the bishop who perpetrated them as for the bishop himself he tried to shut his eyes to such follies he meant his son to go into the church and in spite of all outbursts of spirit notwithstanding wrestling matches and fights and even some tipsy broils of which rumor was in the air he entered dan as a student at the college he kept at bishops court in due course the time of dans examination came and then all further clinging to a forlorn hope was at an end the archdeacon acted as the bishops examining chaplain and more than once the little man had declared in advance his conscientious intention of dealing with the bishops son as he would deal with any other the examination took place in the library of bishops court and besides the students and the examiner there were some six or seven of the clergy present and ewan mylrea then newly ordained was among them it was a purely oral examination and when dans turn came the archdeacon assumed his loftiest look and first tackled the candidate where he was known to be weakest i suppose sir you think you can read your greek testament dan answered that he had never thought anything about it i dare say for all your modesty that you have an idea that you know it well enough to teach it said the archdeacon dan hadnt an idea on the subject take down the greek testament and imagine that im your pupil and proceed to expound it said the archdeacon dan took the book from the bookcase and fumbled it in his fingers well sir open at the parable of the tares dan scratched his big head leisurely and he did his best to find the place so im to be tutoris that it he said with a puzzled look that is so and you are to be the pupil preciselysuppose yourself my tutorand now begin at this ewan stepped out with a look of anxiety is not that a rather difficult supposition archdeacon he said timidly the archdeacon glanced over his grandson loftily and made no reply begin sir begin he said with a sweep of his hand toward dan and at that he sat down in the highbacked oak chair at the head of the table then on the instant there came into dans quick eyes a most mischievous twinkle he was standing before the table with the greek testament open at the parable of the tares and he knew too well he could not read the parable when do we change places archdeacon he asked we have changed placesyou are now the tutori am your pupilbegin sir oh we have changed places have we said dan and at that he lifted up the archdeacons silvertipped walkingcane which lay on the table and brought it down again with a bang then just you get up off your chair sir he said with a tone of command the archdeacons russet face showed several tints of blue at that moment but he rose to his feet thereupon dan handed him the open book now sir he said first read me the parable of the tares the clergy began to shuffle about and look into each others faces the archdeacons expression was not amiable but he took the book and read the parable very fair very fair indeed said dan in a tone of mild condescensiona few false quantities but very fair on the whole gentlemen gentlemen this is going too far said one of the clergy silence sir said dan with a look of outraged authority then there was dire confusion some of the clergy laughed outright and some giggled under their breath and some protested in white wrath and the end of it all was that the examination came to a sudden termination and rightly or wrongly wisely or foolishly dan was adjudged to be unfit for the ministry of the church when the bishop heard the verdict his pale face whitened visibly and he seemed to see the beginning of the end at that moment he thought of the deemster with bitterness this blow to his hopes did not cement the severed lives of the brothers the forces that had been dividing them year by year since the days of their father appeared to be drawing them yet wider apart in the lives and fortunes of their children each felt that the other was frustrating his dearest expectations in his son and that was an offense that neither could forgive to the deemster it seemed that the bishop was bearing down every ambition of his life tearing him up as a naked trunk leaving him a childless man to the bishop it seemed that the deemster was wrecking the one life that was more to him than his own soul and standing between him and the heart that with all its follies was dearer than the world beside from the time of ewans marriage and dans disgrace the bishop and the deemster rarely met and when they passed on the road they exchanged only the coldest salutation but if the fates were now more than ever fostering an unnatural enmity between the sons of old ewan they were cherishing at the same time the loves of their children never were cousins more unlike or more fondly attached between dan the reckless scapegrace and mona with the big soft eyes and the quiet ways the affection was such as neither understood they had grown up side by side they had seen each other daily they had scampered along the shore with clasped hands they had screamed at the seagulls with one voice and still they were boy and girl together but once they were stooking the barley in the glebe and the day being hot mona tipped back her white sunbonnet and it fell on to her shoulders seeing this dan came stealthily behind and thought very craftily to whisk it away unobserved but the strings by which it was tied caught in her hair and tugged at its knot and the beautiful wavy shower fell ripriprippling down her back the wind caught the loosened hair and tossed it about her and she stood up erect among the corn with the first blush on her cheeks that dan had ever brought there and turned full upon him all the glorious light of her deep blue eyes then then oh then dan seemed to see her for the first time a girl no longer but a woman a woman a woman and the mountains behind her were in one instant blotted out of dans eyes and everything seemed to spin about him when next he knew where he was and what he was doing behold there were monas rosy lips under his and she was panting and gasping for breath but if the love of dan and mona was more than cousinly though they knew it not as yet the love of ewan for dan was wonderful and passing the love of women that pure soul with its vague spiritual yearnings seemed to have nothing in common with the jovial roysterer always fighting always laughing taking disgrace as a duck takes water and losing the trace of it as easily twenty times he stood between the scapegrace and the bishop twenty times he hid from the good father the follies of the son he thought for that thoughtless head that never had an ache or a care under its abundant curls he hoped for that light heart that hoped for nothing he trembled for the soul that felt no fear never was such loyalty between man and man since david wept for jonathan and ewans marriage disturbed this affection not at all for the love he bore to dan was a brotherly passion for which language has yet no name let us tell one story that shall show this friendship in its double bearingsewans love and temper and dans heedless harshness and the great nature beneath it and then we will pass on with fuller knowledge to weightier matters derry the whiteeyed collie that had nestled on the top of his masters bed the night dan sneaked home in disgrace from oiel verree was a crafty little fox with cunning and duplicity bred in his very bones if you were a tramp of the profession of billy the gawk he would look up at you with his big innocent eyes and lick your hand and thrust his nose into your palm and the next moment he would seize you by the hindmost parts and hold on like a leech his unamiable qualities grew as he grew in years and one day dan went on a long journey leaving derry behind and when he returned he had another dog with him a great shaggy scotch collie with bright eyes a happy phiz and a huge bush of a tail derry was at the gate when his master came home and he eyed the newcomer with looks askance from that day derry turned his back on his master he would never answer his call and he did not know his whistle from the croak of a corncrake in fact derry took his own courses and forthwith fell into all manner of dissolute habits he went out at night alone incognito and kept most unchristian hours the farmers around complained that their sheep were found dead in the field torn and worried by a dogs teeth derry was known to be a dog that did not live a reputable life and suspicion fell on him dan took the old fox in hand and thenceforward derry looked out on the world through a rope muzzle one day there was to be a sheepdog match and dan entered his scotch collie laddie the race was to be in the meadow at the foot of slieu dhoo and great crowds of people came to witness it hurdles were set up to make all crooks and cranks of difficulty and then a drift of sheep were turned loose in the field the prize was to the dog that would at the word of its master gather the sheep together and take them out at the gate in the shortest time ewan then newly married was there and beside him was his childwife time was called and dans turn came to try the mettle of his laddie the dog started well and in two or three minutes he had driven the whole flock save two into an alcove of hurdles close to where ewan and his wife stood together then at the word of his master laddie set off over the field for the stragglers and dan shouted to ewan not to stir a hand or foot or the sheep would be scattered again now just at that instant who should pop over the hedge but derry in his muzzle and quick as thought he shot down his head put up his paws threw off his muzzle dashed at the sheep snapped at their legs and away they went in twenty directions before ewan had time to cry out derry was gone with his muzzle between his teeth when dan who was a perch or two up the meadow turned round and saw what had happened and that his dogs chances were gone his anger overcame him and he turned on ewan with a torrent of reproaches thereyouve done it with your lumberingcurse it with complete selfpossession ewan explained how derry had done the mischief then dans face was darker with wrath than it had ever been before a pretty tale he said and his lip curled in a sneer he turned to the people around anybody see the dog slip his muzzle none had seen what ewan had affirmed the eyes of every one had been on the two stragglers in the distance pursued by dan and laddie now when ewan saw that dan distrusted him and appealed to strangers as witness to his word his face flushed deep and his delicate nostrils quivered a pretty tale dan repeated and he was twisting on his heel when up came derry again his muzzle on his snout whisking his tail and frisking about dans feet with an expression of quite lamblike simplicity at that sight ewans livid face turned to a great pallor and dan broke into a hard laugh weve heard of a dog slipping his muzzle he said but who ever heard of a dog putting a muzzle on again then ewan stepped from beside his girlwife who stood there with heaving breast his eyes were aflame but for an instant he conquered his emotions and said with a constrained quietness but with a deep pathos in his tone dan do you think ive told you the truth dan wheeled about i think youve told me a lie he said and his voice came thick from his throat all heard the word and all held their breath ewan stood a moment as if rooted to the spot and his pallid face whitened every instant then he fell back and took the girlwife by the hand and turned away with her his head down his very heart surging itself out of his choking breast and as he passed through the throng to carry away from that scene the madness that was working in his brain he overheard the mocking comments of the people aw well well did ye hear that nowcalled him a liar and not a word to say agen it a liar och a liar and him a parzon too middling chickenhearted anywaysa liar aw well well well at that ewan flung away the hand of his wife and quivering from head to foot he strode toward dan youve called me a liar he said in a shrill voice that was like a cry now you shall prove your wordyou shall fight meyou shall by god he was completely carried away by passion the parzon the parzon man alive the young parzon the people muttered and they closed around dan stood a moment he looked down from his great height at ewans quivering form and distorted face then he turned about and glanced into the faces of the people in another instant his eyes were swimming in tears he took a step toward ewan flung his arms about him and buried his head in his neck and the great stalwart lad wept like a little child in another moment ewans passion was melted away and he kissed dan on the cheek blubbering cowards aw blatherskites och man alive a pair of turtledoves dan lifted his head and looked around raised himself to his full height clinched his fists and said now my lads you did your best to make a fight and you couldnt manage it i wont fight my cousin and he shant fight me but if theres a man among you would like to know for himself how much of a coward i am let him step outim ready not a man budged an inch chapter ix the service on the shore it was the spring of the year when the examining chaplain gave the verdict which for good or ill put dan out of the odor of sanctity then in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes he haunted the shore where old billy and his mates were spreading their nets and barking them in preparation for the herring season that was soon to begin there it was while stretched on the warm shingle with old billy quilleash sitting near smoking his black cutty and mending the meshes broken by the dogfish of last year that dan hit on the idea of a new course in life this was nothing better or worse than that of turning fisherman he would buy a smack and make old billy his skipper he would follow the herrings himself and take up his own share and the share of the boat it would be delightful and of course it would be vastly profitable everything looked plain and straight and simple and though old billy more than half shook his gray head at the project and let fall by several inches his tawny face and took his pipe out of his mouth and cleared his throat noisily and looked vacantly out to sea and gave other ominous symptoms of grave internal dubitation dan leaped to his feet at the sudden access of new purpose and bowled off in hot haste to tell the bishop the bishop listened in silence at first and with a sidelong look out at the window up to the heights of slieu dhoo and when dan in a hangdog manner hinted at certain newborn intentions of reform there was a perceptible trembling of the bishops eyelids and when he gathered voice and pictured the vast scheme of profit without loss the bishop turned his grave eyes slowly upon him and then dans own eyes suddenly fell and the big world began to shrivel up to the pitiful dimensions of an orange with the juice squeezed out of it but the end of it all was that the bishop undertook to become responsible for the first costs of the boat and having made this promise with the air of a man who knows too well that he is pampering the whim of a spoiled boy he turned away rather suddenly with his chin a thought deeper than ever in his breast what hurry and bustle ensued what driving away to north south east and west to every fishing port in the island where boats were built or sold at length a boat was bought on the chocks at port le mary a thirtyton boat of lugger build and old billy quilleash was sent south to bring it up through the calf sound to the harbor at peeltown then there was the getting together of a crew of course old billy was made skipper he had sailed twenty years in a boat of kinvigs with three nets to his share and half that time he had been admiral of the peeltown fleet of herring boats with five pounds a year for his post of honor in dans boat he was to have four nets by his own right and one for his nephew davy fayle davy was an orphan brought up by billy quilleash he was a lad of eighteen and was to sail as boy there were four other handscrennel the cook teare the mate corkell and corlett early and late dan was down at the harbor stripped to the woolen shirt and tackling any odd job of painting or carpentry for the opening of the herring season was hard upon them but he found time to run up to the new ballamona to tell mona that she was to christen his new boat for it had not been named when it left the chocks and then to the old ballamona to persuade ewan to go with him on his first trip to the herrings the day appointed by custom for the first takings of the herring came quickly round it was a brilliant day in early june ewan had been across to slieu dhoo to visit his father for the first time since his marriage more than half a year ago in order to say that he meant to go out for the nights fishing in dans new boat and to beg that his young wife who was just then in delicate health might be invited to spend the night of his absence with mona at the new ballamona the deemster complied with a grim face ewans young wife went across in the early morning and in the afternoon all four the deemster and mona ewan and his wife set off in a lumbering springless coachthe first that the island had yet seento witness the departure of the herring fleet from peeltown and to engage in that days ceremony the salt breath of the sea was in the air and the light ripples of the bay glistened through a drowsy haze of warm sunshine it was to be high water at six oclock when the deemsters company reached peeltown the sun was still high over contrary head and the fishing boats in the harbor to the number of two hundred were rolling gently with their brown sails half set to the motion of the rising tide there was dan in his guernsey on the deck of his boat and as the coach drew up near the bottom of the wooden pier he lifted his red cap from his curly head and then went on to tie a bottle by a long blue ribbon to the tiller there was old billy quilleash in his seaboots and there was davy fayle a shambling sort of lad long rather than tall with fair hair tangled over his forehead and a face which had a simple vacant look that came of a lagging lower lip men on every boat in the harbor were washing the decks or bailing out the dingey or laying down the nets below the harbormaster was on the quay shouting to this boat to pull up or to that one to lie back and down on the broad sands of the shore were men women and children in many hundreds sitting and lying and lounging about an empty boat with a hole in the bottom that lay high and dry on the beach the old fishing town itself had lost its chill and cheerless aspect and no longer looked hungrily out over miles of bleak sea its blind alleys and dark lanes its narrow crabbed crooked streets were bright with little flags hung out of the little stuffedup windows and yet brighter with bright faces that hurried to and fro about five oclock as the sun was dipping seaward across the back of contrary leaving the brown sails in the harbor in shade and glistening red on the sides of the cathedral church on the islandrock that stood twenty yards out from the mainland there was a movement of the people on the shore toward the town behind them and of fisherfellows from their boats toward the beach some of the neighboring clergy had come down to peeltown and the little deemster sat in his coach thrown open blinking in the sun under his shaggy gray eyebrows but some one was still looked for and expectation was plainly evident in every face until a cheer came over the tops of the houses from the marketplace then there was a general rush toward the mouth of the quay and presently there came laboring over the rough cobbles of the tortuous castle street flanked by a tumultuous company of boys and men bareheaded women and children who halloed and waved their arms and tossed up their caps a roughcoated manx pony on which the tall figure of the bishop sat the people moved on with the bishop at their head until they came to the beach and there at the disused boat lying dry on the sand the bishop alighted in two minutes more every fisherman in the harbor had left his boat and gathered with his fellows on the shore then there began a ceremony of infinite pathos and grandeur in the open boat the palefaced bishop stood his long hair sprinkled with gray lifted gently over his drooping shoulders by the gentle breeze that came with its odor of brine from the sea around him on their knees on the sand were the tawnyfaced weatherbeaten fishermen in their seaboots and guernseys bareheaded and fumbling their soft caps in their hands there on the outside stood the multitude of men women and young children and on the skirts of the crowd stood the coach of the deemster and it was half encircled by the pawing horses of some of the blackcoated clergy the bishop began the service it asked for the blessing of god on the fishing expedition which was about to set out first came the lesson and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly and then the story of jesus in the ship when there arose a great tempest while he slept and his disciples awoke him and he arose and rebuked the waves and then that other story of how the disciples toiled all night and took nothing but let down their nets again at christs word and there came a great multitude of fishes and their nets brake restore and continue to us the harvest of the sea prayed the bishop with his face uplifted and the men on their knees on the sand with uncovered heads and faces in their caps murmured their responses in their own tongue yn meailley and while they prayed the soft boom of the unruffled waters on the shore and the seas deep murmur from away beyond the headland and the wild jabbering cries of a flight of seagulls disporting on a rock in the bay were the only sounds that mingled with the bishops deep tones and the mens hoarse voices last of all the bishop gave out a hymn it was a simple old hymn such as every man had known since his mother had crooned it over his cot the men rose to their feet and their lusty voices took up the strain the crowd behind and the clergy on their horses joined it and from the deemsters coach two womens voices took it up and higher higher higher like a lark it floated up until the soft boom and deep murmur of the sea and the wild cry of the seabirds were drowned in the broad swell of the simple old sacred song the sun was sinking fast through a red haze toward the seas verge and the tide was near the flood when the service on the shore ended and the fishermen returned to their boats billy quilleash leaped aboard the new lugger and his four men followed him see all clear he shouted to davy fayle and davy stood on the quay with the duty of clearing the ropes from the blocks and then following in the dingey that lay moored to the wooden steps dan had gone up to the deemsters coach and helped mona and the young wife of ewan to alight he led them to the quay steps and when the company had gathered about and all was made ready he shouted to old billy to throw him the bottle that lay tied by the blue ribbon to the tiller then he handed the bottle to mona who stood on the step a few feet above the waters edge mona was looking very fresh and beautiful that day with a delicious joy and pride in her deep eyes dan was talking to her with an awkward sort of consciousness looking askance at his big brown hands when they came in contact with her dainty white fingers then glancing down at his great clattering boots and up into her soft smooth face what am i to christen her said mona with the bottle held up in her hand mona answered dan with a shamefaced look and one hand in his brown hair no no said she not that then what you like said dan well the benmychree said mona and with that the bottle broke on the boats side in another instant ewan was kissing his meek little wife and bidding her goodby and dan in a fumbling way was for the first time in his life demurely shaking monas hand and trying hard to look her in the face tail on there shouted quilleash from the lugger then the two men jumped aboard davy fayle ran the ropes from the blocks the admirals boat cleared away from the quay and the admirals flag was shot up to the masthead the other boats in the harbor followed one by one and soon the bay was full of the fleet as the benmychree stood out to sea beyond the islandrock dan and ewan stood aft dan in his brown guernsey ewan in his black coat ewan waving his handkerchief and dan his cap old billy was at the tiller crennel the cook had his head just above the hatchways and davy was clambering handoverhand up the rope by which the dingey was hauled to the stern then the herring fleet sailed away under the glow of the setting sun chapter x the first night with the herrings the sun went down and a smart breeze rose off the land as the benmychree with the fleet behind her rounded contrary head and crossed the two streams that flow there for an hour afterward there was still light enough to see the coastline curved into covelets and promontories and to look for miles over the hills with their moles of gorse and tussocks of lush grass the twilight deepened as the fleet rounded niarbyl point and left the islet on their lee with cronknyireylhaa towering into the gloomy sky when they sailed across fleshwick bay the night gradually darkened and nothing was seen of ennyn mooar but after an hour of darkness the heavens lightened again and glistened with stars and when old billy quilleash brought his boat head to the wind in six fathoms of water outside port erin the moon had risen behind bradda and the rugged headland showed clear against the sky one after another the boats and the fleet brought to about the benmychree dan asked old billy if he had found the herrings on this ground at the same time in former seasons not for seven years said the old man then why try now billy stretched out his hand to where a flight of seagulls were dipping and sailing in the moonlight see the gull there he said shes skipper tonight shes showing us the fish davy fayle had been leaning over the bow rapping with a stick at the timbers near the waters edge any signs shouted billy quilleash ay said davy the marfires risin the wind had dropped and luminous patches of phosphorescent light in the water were showing that the herrings were stirring lets make a shot up with the gear said quilleash and preparations were made for shooting the nets over the quarter ned teare you see to the line crennel look after the corks davywheres that ladlook to the seizings dye hear then the nets were hauled from below and passed over a bankboard placed between the hatchway and the top of the bulwark teare and crennel shot the gear and as the seizings came up davy ran aft with them and made them fast to the warp near the taffrail when the nets were all paid out every net in the drift being tied to the next and a solid wall of meshes nine feet deep had been swept away along the sea for half a mile behind them quilleash shouted down with the sheets the ropes were hauled the sails were taken in the mainmastwhich was so made as to lower backwardwas dropped and only the driftmizzen was left and that was to keep the boat head on to the wind up with the light there said quilleash at this word davy fayle popped his head out of the hatchways aw to be sure that lads never ready get out of that quick davy jumped on deck took a lantern and fixed it to the top of the mitch board then vessel and nets drifted together and dan and ewan who had kept the deck until now went below together it was now a calm clear night with just light enough to show two or three of the buoys on the back of the net nearest to the boat as they floated under water old billy had not mistaken his ground large white patches came moving out of the surrounding pavement of deep black lightened only by the image of a star where the vanishing ripples left the dark sea smooth once or twice countless faint popping sounds were to be heard and minute points of shooting silver were to be seen on the water around the herrings were at play and shoals on shoals soon broke the black sea into a glistening foam but no strike was made and after an hours time dan popped his head over the hatchways and asked the skipper to try the lookon net the warp was hauled in until the first net was reached it came up as black as coal save for a single dogfish or two that had broken a mesh here and there too much moon tonight said quilleash they see the nets and cute they are extraordinary but half an hour later the moon went out behind a thick ridge of cloud that floated over the land the sky became gray and leaden and a rising breeze ruffled the sea then hour after hour wore on and not a fish came to the lookon net toward one oclock in the morning the moon broke out again therell be a heavy strike now said quilleash and in another instant a luminous patch floated across the line of the nets sank disappeared and finally pulled three of the buoys down with them pull up now shouted quilleash in another tone then the nets were hauled davy the boy led the warp through a snatchblock fixed to the masthole on to the capstan ned teare disconnected the nets from the warps and crennel and corlett pulled the nets over the gunwale they came up silverwhite in the moonlight a solid block of fish billy quilleash and dan passed them over the scuddingpole and shook the herrings into the hold five maze at least said quilleash with a chuckle of satisfaction try again and once more the nets were shot the other boats of the fleet were signaled by a blue light run up the driftmizzen that the benmychree had struck a scale of fish in a few minutes more the blue light was answered by other blue lights on every side and these reported that the fishery was everywhere faring well one two three oclock came and went the night was wearing on the moon went out once more and in the darkness which preceded the dawn the lanterns burning on the fleet of drifting boats gave out an eerie glow across the waters that lay black and flat around the gray light came at length in the east and the sun rose over the land then the nets were hauled in for the last time and that nights fishing was done the mast was lifted but before the boat was brought about the skipper shouted men let us do as were used of and instantly the admirals flag was run up to the masthead and at this sign the men dropped on one knee with their faces in their caps and old billy offered up a short and simple prayer of thanks for the blessings of the sea when this was done every man leaped to his feet and all was work bustle shouting singing out and some lusty curses tumble up the sheetsbear a hand thered the lad bawled quilleash get out of the way or ill make you walk handsome over the bricks in five minutes more the benmychree with the herring fleet behind her was running home before a stiff breeze nine mazenot bad for the first night said dan to ewan souse them well said quilleash and ned teare sprinkled salt on the herrings as they lay in the hold crennel the cook better known as the slushy came up the hatchways with a huge saucepan which he filled with the fish as he did so there was a faint cheep cheep from belowthe herrings were still alive all hands went down for a smoke except corlett who stood at the tiller davy who counted for nobody and stretched himself out at the bow and ewan the young parson who had been taking note of the lad during the night now seated himself on a coil of rope near where davy lay the cheep cheep was the only sound in the air except the plash of the waters at the boats bow and with an inclination of the head in the direction of the fish in the hold ewan said it seems cruel davy doesnt it cruel well pozzible pozzible och deed now theyve got their feelings same as anybody else the parson had taken the lads measure at a glance you should see the shoals of them lying round the nets watching the otherstheir mothers and sisters as you might saywhove got their gills tangled and when you haul the net up away they go at a slant in millions and millions just the same as lightning going through the water och yes yes leave them alone for having their feelings it does seem cruel davy eh davy looked puzzled he was reasoning out a grave problem well sir thats the mortal strange part of it it does look cruel to catch them sarten sure but then the herrings themselves catch the sandeels and the cod catch the herring and the porpoises and grampuses catch the cod ewan did his best to look astonished aw thats the truth sir its terrible wonderful strange but i suppose its all nathur you see sir we do the same ourselves how do you mean davy we dont eat each other i hope said the young parson och dont we though lave us alone for that ewan tried to look appalled well of coorse not to say ate not xactly ate but the biggest chap allis rigs the rest and the next biggest chap allis rigs a littler one you know and the littlest chap he gets rigged by everybody all round doesnt he sir davy had got a grip of the knotty problem but the lads poor simple face looked sadly burdened and he came back to his old word seems to me it must be all nathur sir ewan began to feel some touch of shame at playing with this simple earnest big little heart so you think it all nature davy he said with a lump gathering in his throat well well i do you know sir it does make a fellow fit to cry a bit somehow but it must be nathur sir and davy took off his blue worsted cap and fumbled it and gave his troubled young head a grave shake then there was some general talk about davys early history davys father had been pressed into the army before davy was born and had afterward been no more heard of then his mother had died and billy quilleash being his mothers elder brother had brought him up davy had always sailed as boy with uncle billy he was sailing as boy then and that was to the end that uncle billy might draw his share but the young master mastha dan had spoken up for him so he had and he knew middlin well what that would come to hes a tidy lump of a lad now says mastha dan and hes well used of the boats too says he and if he does well this time he says he must sail man for himself next season aw yes sir that was what mastha dan said it was clear that dan was the boys hero when dan was mentioned that lagging lip gave a yearning look to davys simple face dans doubtful exploits and his dubious triumphs all looked glorious in davys eyes davy had watched dan and listened to him and though dan might know nothing of his silent worship every word that dan had spoken to him had been hoarded up in the lads heart like treasure davy had the dogs soul and dan was his master uncle billy and hims same as brothers said davy and uncle billys uncommon proud of the young master and middlin jealous too aw well whos wondering at it just then crennel the cook came up to say that breakfast was ready and ewan and davy went below the young parsons hand resting on the boys shoulder in the cabin dan was sitting by the stove laughing immoderately ewan saw at a glance that dan had been drinking and he forthwith elbowed his way to dans side and lifted a brandy bottle from the stovetop into the locker under pretense of finding a place for his hat then all hands sat down to the table there was a huge dish of potatoes boiled in their jackets and a similar dish of herrings every man dipped into the dishes with his hands lifted his herring on to his plate ran his fingers from tail to head swept all the flesh off the fresh fish and threw the bare backbone into the crock that stood behind keep a corner for the meailley at the three legs said dan there was to be a herring breakfast that morning at the three legs of man to celebrate the opening of the fishing season youll come ewan eh the young parson shook his head dan was in great spirits to which the spirits he had imbibed contributed a more than common share ewan saw the too familiar light of dangerous mischief dancing in dans eyes and made twenty attempts to keep the conversation within ordinary bounds of seriousness but dan was not to be restrained and breaking away into the homespuna sure indication that the old adam was having the upper handhe forthwith plunged into some chaff that was started by the mate ned teare at davy fayles expense aw ye wouldnt think its true would ye now said ned with a wink at dan and a glime at davy and whats that said dan with another glime at the lad why that the like o yander is tackin round the gels dye raely mane it said dan dropping his herring and lifting his eyes ewan coughed with some volume and said there there danthere there yes though and sniffin and snuffin abaft of them astonishin ned teare put it again aw well well well said dan turning up afresh the whites of his eyes there was not a sign from davy he broke his potato more carefully and took both hands and both eyes to strip away its jacket yes yes the craythurs doing somethin in the spooney line said billy quilleash him as hasnt the hayseed out of his hair yet aw well said dan pretending to come to davys relief it isnt raisonable but the lad should be coortin some gel now whats that shouted quilleash dropping the banter rather suddenly what and not a farthing at him and owin me fortune for the bringin up no matter billy said dan and dont ride a man down like a maintack one of these fine mornings davy will be payin his debt to you with the foretopsail davys eyes were held very low but it was not hard to see that they were beginning to fill that will do dan that will do said ewan the young parsons face had grown suddenly pale but dan saw nothing of that and look at him there said dan reaching round ewan to prod davy in the ribslook at him there pretendin he never knows nothin the big tears were near to toppling out of davys eyes he could have borne the chaff from any one but dan dan said ewan with a constrained quietness stop it i cant stand it much longer at that davy got up from the table leaving his unfinished breakfast and began to climb the hatchways aw now look at that said dan with affected solemnity and so saying and not heeding the change in ewans manner dan got up too and followed davy out put an arm round the lads waist and tried to draw him back dont mind the loblollyboys davy veg he said coaxingly davy pushed him away with an angry word whats that hes after saying asked quilleash nothin he only cussed a bit said dan cussed did he hed better show a leg if he dont want the rats tail then ewan rose from the table and his eyes flashed and his pale face quivered ill tell you what it is he said in a tense tremulous voice theres not a man among you youre a lot of skulking cowards at that he was making for the deck but dan whose face full of the fire of the liquor he had taken grew in one moment old and ugly leaped to his feet in a tempest of wrath overturned his stool and rushed at ewan with eyes aflame and uplifted hand and suddenly instantly like a flash his fist fell and ewan rolled on the floor then the men jumped up and crowded round in confusion the parzon the parzon god preserve me the parzon there stood dan with a ghastly countenance white and convulsed and there at his feet lay ewan god amighty mastha dan mastha dan cried davy before the men had found time to breathe davy had leaped back from the deck to the cockpit and had lifted ewans head on to his knee ewan drew a long breath and opened his eyes he was bleeding from a gash above the temple having fallen among some refuse of iron chain davy still moaning piteously oh mastha dan god amighty mastha dan took a white handkerchief from ewans breast and bound it about his head over the wound the blood oozed through and stained the handkerchief ewan rose to his feet pale and trembling and without looking at any one steadied himself by davys shoulder and clambered weakly to the deck there he stumbled forward sat down on the coil of rope that had been his seat before and buried his uncovered head in his breast the sun had now risen above contrary and the fair young morning light danced over the rippling waters far and near a fresh breeze blew from the land and the boats of the fleet around and about scudded on before the wind like a flight of happy birds with outspread wings the benmychree was then rounding the head and the smoke was beginning to coil up in many a slender shaft above the chimneys of the little town of peel but ewan saw nothing of this with head on his breast and his heart cold within him he sat at the bow down below dan was then doing his best to make himself believe that he was unconcerned he whistled a little and sang a little and laughed a good deal but the whistle lost its tune and the song stopped short and the laugh was loud and empty when he first saw ewan lie where he fell all the fire of his evil passion seemed to die away and for the instant his heart seemed to choke him and he was prompted to drop down and lift ewan to his feet but at that moment his stubborn knees would not bend and at the next moment the angel of god troubled the waters of his heart no more then the fisherfellows overcame their amazement and began to crow and to side with him and to talk of his pluck and what not the parzonsoch the parzonsthey think they may ride a man down for half a word inside his gills cowardsoch skulking cowards if you plaizeright sarved say i dan tramped about the cabin restlessly and sometimes chuckled aloud and asked himself what did he care and then laughed noisily and sat down to smoke and presently jumped up threw the pipe into the open stove and took the brandy bottle out of the locker where was ewan what was he doing what was he looking like dan would rather have died than humbled himself to ask but would none of these grinning boobies tell him when teare the mate came down from the deck and said that sarten sure the young parzon was afther sayin his prayers up forrard dans eyes flashed again and he had almost lifted his hand to fell the sniggering waistrel he drank half a tumbler of brandy and protested afresh though none had yet disputed it that he cared nothing not he let them say what they liked to the contrary in fifteen minutes from the time of the quarrel the fleet was running into harbor dan had leaped on deck just as the benmychree touched the two streams outside contrary he first looked forward and saw ewan sitting on the cable in the bow with his eyes shut and his pallid face sunk deep in his breast then a strange wild light shot into dans eyes and he reeled aft and plucked the tiller from the hand of corlett and set it hard aport and drove the boat head on for the narrow neck of water that flowed between the mainland and the islandrock on which the old castle stood hould hard shouted old billy quilleash theres not water enough for the like o thatyoull run her on the rocks then dan laughed wildly and his voice rang among the coves and caves of the coast heres for the harbor orhell he screamed and then another wild peal of his mad laughter rang in the air and echoed from the land whats agate of the young mastha the men muttered one to another and with eyes of fear they stood stockstill on the deck and saw themselves driven on toward the shoals of the little sound in two minutes more they breathed freely the benmychree had shot like an arrow through the belt of water and was putting about in the harbor dan dropped the tiller reeled along the deck scarcely able to bear himself erect and stumbled under the hatchways old billy brought up the boat to its moorings come lay down dye hear wheres that lad davy was standing by the young parson you idiot waistrel why dye stand prating there ill pay you you beachcomber the skipper was making for davy when ewan got up stepped toward him looked him hard in the face seemed about to speak checked himself and turned away old billy broke into a bitter little laugh and said im right up and down like a yard o pumpwater thats what i am the boat was now at the quayside and ewan leaped ashore without a word or a look more he walked away the white handkerchief clotted with blood still about his forehead and his hat carried in his hand on the quay there were numbers of women with baskets waiting to buy the fish teare the mate and crennel the cook counted the herrings and sold them the rest of the crew stepped ashore dan went away with the rest his face was livid in the soft morning sunlight he was still keeping up his brave outside while the madness was growing every moment fiercer within as he stumbled along the paved way with an unsteady step his hollow laugh grated on the quiet air chapter xi the herring breakfast it was between four oclock and five when the fleet ran into peeltown harbor after the first night of the herring season and toward eight the fisherfellows to the number of fifty at least had gathered for their customary first breakfast in the kitchen of the three legs of man what sport what noisy laughter what singing and rollicking cheers the men stood neither on the order of their coming nor their going their sitting nor their standing in they trooped in their woolen caps or their broad souwesters their oilskins or their long seaboots swung across their arms they wore their caps or not as pleased them they sang or talked as suited them they laughed or sneezed they sulked or snarled they were noisy or silent precisely as the whim of the individual prescribed the individual rule of manners rather later than the rest dan mylrea came swinging in with a loud laugh and a shout and something like an oath too and the broad homespun on his lips billy quilleashi say billy therewhy dont you put up the young mastha for the chair aw lave me alone answered billy quilleash with a contemptuous toss of the head uncle billys proud uncommon of the mastha whispered davy fayle who sat meekly on a form near the door to the man who sat crosslegged on the form beside him its a bit free them chaps is making said old billy in a confidential undertone to dan who was stretching himself out on the settle then rising to his feet with gravity genlmen said quilleash what dye say now to mistha danl mylrea for the elbercheer yander at that there was the response of loud raps on the table with the heels of the long boots swung over various arms and with several clay pipes that lost their heads in the encounter old billy resumed his seat with a lofty glance of patronage at the men about him which said as plainly as words themselves i tould ye to lave it all to me proud dye say look at him muttered the fisherman sitting by davy fayle dan staggered up and shouldered his way to the elbowchair at the head of the table he had no sooner taken his seat than he shouted for the breakfast and without more ado the breakfast was lifted direct on to the table from the pans and boilers that simmered on the hearth first came the broth well loaded with barley and cabbage then suet puddings and last of all the fryingpan was taken down from the wall and four or five dozen of fresh herrings were made to grizzle and crackle and sputter over the fire dan ate ravenously and laughed noisily and talked incessantly as he ate the men at first caught the contagion of his boisterous manners but after a time they shook their tousled heads and laid them together in gravity and began to repeat in whispers whats agate of the young mastha at all at all away went the dishes away went the cloth an oillamp with its open moutha relic of some monkish sanctuary of the middle ageswas lifted from the mantelshelf and put on the table for the receipt of custom a brass censer choked with spills was placed beside it pipes emerged from waistcoatpockets and pots of liquor with glasses and bottles came in from the outer bar is it heavy on the liquor youre going to be billy said ned the mate and old billy replied with a superior smile and the lifting up of a whisky bottle from which he had just drawn the cork then came the toasts the chairman arose amid hip hip hooraa and gave life to man and death to fish and quilleash gave death to the head that never wore hair then came more noise and more liquor and a good deal of both in the vicinity of the chair dan struck up a song he sang drink to me only and the noisy company were at first hushed to silence and then melted to audible sobs aw man the voice he

going on at the head of the table dan had risen from the elbowchair it was the moment for him to respond but he stared wildly around and stood there in silence and his tongue seemed to cleave to his mouth every eye was now fixed on his face and that face quivered and turned white the glass he had held in his hand fell from his nerveless fingers and broke on the table laughter died on every lip and the voices were hushed at last dan spoke his words came slowly and fell heavily on the ear men he said you have been drinking my health you call me a good fellow thats wrong im the worst man among you old billy says im going to the house of keys thats wrong too shall i tell you where i am going shall i tell you im going to the devil and then amid breathless silence he dropped back in his seat and buried his head in his hands no one spoke the fair head lay on the table among broken pipes and the refuse of spilled liquor there could be no more drinking that morning every man rose to his feet and picking up his waterproofs or his long seaboots one after one went shambling out the room was dense with smoke but outside the air was light and free and the morning sun shone brightly strange now wasnt it muttered one of the fellows strange uncommon hes been middlin heavy on the liquor lately and hed never no right to strike the young parzon and him his cousin too and terrible fond of him as theyre saying well well its middlin wicked anyway and so the croakers went their way in two minutes more the room was empty except for the stricken man who lay there with hidden face and davy fayle who with big tears glistening in his eyes was stroking the tangled curls chapter xii dans penance dan rose to his feet a sobered man and went out of the smoky pothouse without a word to any one and without lifting his bleared and bloodshot eyes unto any face he took the lane to the shore and behind him with downcast eyes like a dog at the heels of his master davy fayle slouched along when they reached the shore dan turned toward orris head walking within a yard or two of the waters edge striding over the sands the past of his childhood came back to him with a sense of pain he saw himself flying along the beach with ewan and mona shouting at the gull mocking the cormorant clambering up the rocks to where the longnecked bird laid her spotted eggs and the seapink grew under the fresh grass of the corries under the head dan sat on a rock and lifted away his hat from his burning forehead but not a breath of wind stirred his soft hair dan rose again with a new resolve he knew now what course he must take he would go to the deemster confess to the outrage of which he had been guilty and submit to the just punishment of the law with quick steps he strode back over the beach and davy followed him until he turned up to the gates of the new ballamona and then the lad rambled away under the foot of slieu dhoo dan found the deemsters house in a tumult hommybeg was rushing here and there and dan called to him but he waved his arm and shouted something in reply whereof the purport was lost and then disappeared blind kerry was there and when dan spoke to her as she went up the stairs he could gather nothing from her hurried answer except that some one was morthal bad as the saying was and in another moment she too had gone dan stood in the hall with a sense of impending disaster what had happened a dread idea struck him at that moment like a blow on the brain the sweat started from his forehead he could bear the uncertainty no longer and had set foot on the stairs to follow the blind woman when there was the sound of a light step descending in another moment he stood face to face with mona she colored deeply and his head fell before her is it ewan he said and his voice came like a hoarse whisper no his wife said mona it turned out that not long after daybreak that morning the young wife of ewan who had slept with mona had awakened with a start and the sensation of having received a heavy blow on the forehead she had roused mona and told her what seemed to have occurred they had looked about and seen nothing that could have fallen they had risen from bed and examined the room and had found everything as it had been when they lay down the door was shut and there was no hood above the bed but mona had drawn up the window blind and then she had seen clearly marked on the white forehead of ewans young wife a little above the temple on the spot where she had seemed to feel the blow a streak of pale color such as might have been made by the scratch of a thorn that had not torn the skin it had been a perplexing difficulty and the girls had gone back to bed and talked of it in whispers until they had fallen asleep in each others arms when they had awakened again the deemster was rapping at their door to say that he had taken an early breakfast that he was going off to hold his court at ramsey and expected to be back at midday then halftimidly mona had told her father of their strange experience but he had bantered them on their folly and they had still heard his laughter when he had leaped to the saddle in front of the house and was cantering away over the gravel reassured by the deemsters unbelief the girls had thrown off their vague misgivings and given way to good spirits ewans young wife had said that all morning she had dreamed of her husband and that her dreams had been bright and happy they had gone down to breakfast but scarcely had they been seated at the table before they had heard the click of the gate from the road then they had risen together and ewan had come up the path with a white bandage about his head and with a streak of blood above the temple with a sharp cry ewans young wife had fallen to the ground insensible and when ewan himself had come into the house they had carried her back to bed there she was at that moment and from a peculiar delicacy of her health at the time there was but too much reason to fear that the shock might have serious results all this mona told to dan from where she stood three steps up the stairs and he listened with his head held low one hand gripping the stairrail and his foot pawing the mat at the bottom when she finished there was a pause and then there came from overhead a long deep moan of pain dan lifted his face its sudden pallor was startling mona he said in a voice that was husky in his throat do you know who struck ewan that blow there was silence for a moment and then half in a whisper half with a sob mona answered that she knew it had not been from ewan himself but by one of the many tongues of scandal that the news had come to ballamona dan railed at himself in bitter words and called god to witness that he had been a curse to himself and every one about him mona let the torrent of his selfreproach spend itself and then she said dan you must be reconciled to ewan not yet he answered yes yes im sure he would forgive you said mona and she turned about as if in the act of going back to seek for ewan dan grasped her hand firmly no he said dont heap coals of fire on my head mona dont dont and after a moment with a calmer manner i must see the deemster first hardly had this been spoken when they heard a horses hoofs on the gravel path and the deemsters voice calling to hommybeg as he threw the reins over the post near the door and entered the house the deemster was in unusual spirits and slapped dan on the back and laughed as he went into his room dan followed him and mona crept nervously to the open door with head held down dan told what had occurred the deemster listened and laughed asked further particulars and laughed again threw off his riding boots and leggings looked knowingly from under his shaggy brows and then laughed once more and what dye say you want me to do for you danny veg he asked with one side of his wrinkled face twisted awry to punish me sir said dan at that the deemster who was buckling his slippers threw himself back in his chair and sent a shrill peal of mocking laughter through the house dan was unmoved his countenance did not bend as he said slowly and in a low tone if you dont do it sir i shall never look into ewans face again the deemster fixed his buckles rose to his feet slapped dan on the back and said go home man veen go home and then hurried away to the kitchen where in another moment his testy voice could be heard directing hommybeg to put up the saddle on the lath mona looked into dans face will you be reconciled to ewan now she said and took both his hands and held them no he answered firmly i will see the bishop his eyes were dilated his face that had hitherto been very mournful to see was alive with a strange fire mona held his hands with a passionate grasp dan she said with a great tenderness this is very very noble of you this is like our dan this she stopped she trembled and glowed her eyes were close to his dont look at me like that he said she dropped his hands and at the next instant he was gone from the house dan found the bishop at bishops court and told him all the bishop had heard the story already but he said nothing of that he knew when dan hid his provocation and painted his offense at its blackest with a grave face he listened while dan accused himself and his heart heaved within him it is a serious offense he said to strike a minister is a grievous offense and the church provides a censure dan held his face very low and clasped his hands in front of him the censure is that on the next sabbath morning following in the presence of the congregation you shall walk up the aisle of the parish church from the porch to the communion behind the minister who shall read the st psalm meantime the bishops deep tones and quiet manner concealed his strong emotion and dan went out without another word this was friday and on the evening of the same day ewan heard what had passed between dan and the deemster and between dan and the bishop and with a great lump in his throat he went across to bishops court to pray that the censure might be taken off the provocation was mine and he is penitent said ewan and with heaving breast the bishop heard him out and then shook his head the censures of the church were never meant to pass by the house of the bishop he said but he is too deeply abased already said ewan the offense was committed in public and before the eyes of all men the expiation must be made but i too am ashamedthink of it and remove the censure said ewan and his voice trembled and broke the bishop gazed out at the window with blurred eyes that saw nothing ewan he said it is gods hand on the lad let it be let it be next day the bishop sent his sumner round the parish asking that every house might send one at least to the parish church next morning on sunday ewans young wife kept her bed but when ewan left her for the church the shock of her nerves seemed in a measure to have passed away there was still however one great disaster to fear and mona remained at the bedside the meaning of the sumners summons had eked out and long before the hour of service the parish church was crowded the riffraff that never came to church from years end to years end except to celebrate the oiel verree were there with eager eyes while willasthorn tolled the bell from the rope suspended in the porch there was a low buzz of gossip but when the bell ceased its hoarse clangor and willasthorn appeared with his pitchpipe in the front of the gallery there could be heard in the silence that followed over the crowded church the loud tick of the wooden clock in front of him presently from the porch there came a low tremulous voice reading the psalm that begins have mercy upon me o god after thy great goodness according to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offenses then the people who sat in front turned about and those who sat at the side strained across and those who sat above craned forward ewan was walking slowly up the aisle in his surplice with his pale face and scarred forehead bent low over the book in his hand and close behind him towering above him in his great stature with head held down but with a steadfast gaze his hat in his hands his step firm and resolute dan mylrea strode along there was a dead hush over the congregation wash me thoroughly from my wickedness and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my faults and my sin is ever before me the tremulous voice rose and fell and nothing else broke the silence except the uncertain step of the reader and the strong tread of the penitent behind him against thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight at this the tremulous voice deepened and stopped and went on and stopped again and when the words came once more they came in a deep low sob and the readers head fell into his breast not until the psalm came to an end and ewan and dan had reached the communion and the vicar had begun the morning prayer and willasthorn had sent out a blast from his pitchpipe was the hard tension of that moment broken when the morning service ended the deemster rose from his pew and hurried down the aisle as usual he was the first to leave the church the ghostly smile with which he had witnessed the penance that had brought tears to the eyes of others was still on the deemsters lip and a chuckle was in his throat when at the gate of the churchyard he met hommybeg whose face was livid from a long run and who stood for an instant panting for breath well well well said the deemster sending the words like small shot into hommybegs deaf ear terrible terrible terrible said hommybeg and he lifted his hands what is it what what the young womanbody is dead in childbed then the ghostly smile fled from the deemsters face chapter xiii how ewan mourned for his wife what passed at the new ballamona on that morning of dans penance was very pitiful there in the deathchamber already darkened lay ewans young wife her eyes lightly closed her girlish features composed and a faint tinge of color in her cheeks her breast was half open and her beautiful head lay in a pillow of her soft brown hair one round arm was stretched over the counterpane and the delicate fingers were curved inward until the thumbnail like an acorn rested on the inner rim of a ring quiet peaceful very sweet and tender she lay there like one who slept after a short sharp pang she had died gently without a struggle almost without a sigh merely closing her eyes as one who was weary and drawing a long deep breath in dying she had given premature birth to a child a girl and the infant was alive and was taken from the mother at the moment of death when the deemster entered the room with a face of great pallor and eyes of fear mona was standing by the bedhead gazing down but seeing nothing the deemster felt the pulse of the arm over the counterpane with fingers that trembled visibly then he shot away from the room and was no more seen that day the vicar the childwifes father came with panting breath and stood by the bedside for a moment and then turned aside in silence ewan came too and behind him dan walked to the door and there stopped and let ewan enter the chamber of his great sorrow alone not a word was said until ewan went down on his knees by the side of his wife and put his arms about her and kissed her lips still warm with his own far colder lips and called to her softly by her name as though she slept gently and must not be awakened too harshly and drew her to his breast and called again in a tenderer tone that brushed the upturned face like a caress aileen aileen aileen mona covered her eyes in her hands and dan where he stood at the door turned his head away aileen ailee ailee my ailee the voice went like a whisper and a kiss into the deaf ear and only one other sound was heard and that was the faint cry of an infant from the room below ewan raised his head and seemed to listen he paused and looked at the faint color in the quiet cheeks he put his hand lightly on the heart and looked long at the breast that did not heave then he drew his arms very slowly away and rose to his feet for a moment he stood as one dazed like a man whose brain is benumbed and with the vacant light still in his eyes he touched mona on the arm and drew her hand from her eyes and he said as one who tells you something that you could not think she is dead mona looked up into his face and at sight of it the tears rained down her own dan had stepped into the room noiselessly and came behind ewan and when ewan felt his presence he turned to dan with the same vacant look and repeated in the same empty tone she is dead and never a tear came into ewans eyes to soften their look of dull torpor never again did he stretch out his arms to the silent form beneath him only with dazed dry eyes he looked down and said once more she is dead dan could bear up no longer his heart was choking and he went out without a word it was the dread silence of feeling that was frozen but the thaw came in its time they laid out the body of the young wife in the darkened room and ewan went away and rambled over the house all day long and when night fell in and the lighted candles were set in the deathchamber and all in ballamona were going off to bed ewan was still rambling aimlessly from room to room he was very quiet and he spoke little and did not weep at all in the middle of that night the deemster opened his bedroom door and listened and ewans step was still passing from room to room and mona heard the same restless footfall in every break of her fitful sleep but later on in the dark hour that comes before day the deemster opened his door and listened again and then all was quiet in the house he has gone to bed at last thought the deemster but in the early morning as he passed by ewans room he found the door open and saw that the bed had not been slept in the second day went by like the first and the next night like the former one and again in the dead of night the deemster opened his door and heard ewans step once more in the dark hour that goes before the day he opened his door and listened again and all was quiet as before surely he is in bed now thought the deemster he was turning back into his own room when he felt a sudden impulse to go to ewans room first and see if it was as he supposed he went and the door was open and ewan was not there and again the bed had not been slept in the deemster crept back on tiptoe and a gruesome feeling took hold of him he could not lie and no sleep had come near his wakeful eyes so he waited and listened for that unquiet beat of restless feet but the sound did not come then as the day was breaking over the top of slieu dhoo and all the curraghs around lay veiled in mist and far away to the west a deep line stretched across where the dark sea lay with the lightening sky above it the deemster opened his door yet again and went along the corridor steadily until he came to the door of the room where the body was perhaps he is sitting with her he thought with awe and he turned the handle but when the door swung open the deemster paused a faint sound broke the silence it was a soft and measured breathing from within quivering with dread the deemster stepped into the deathchamber and his head turned rigidly toward the bed there in the gloom of the dawn that came over the light of the last candle that flickered in its socket ewan lay outstretched by the side of the white upturned face of his dead wife and his hand lay on her hand and he was in a deep sleep to the deemster it was as if a spirit had passed before his face and the hair of his flesh stood up they buried ewans young wife side by side with his mother under the eldertree now thick with clusters of the green berry by the wall of the churchyard that stood over by the sea the morning was fine but the sun shone dimly through a crust of hot air that gathered and slumbered and caked above ewan passed through all without a word or a sigh or a tear but when the company returned to the deemsters house and mona spoke to ewan and he answered her without any show of feeling and dan told him of his own remorse and accused himself of every disaster and still ewan gave no sign but went in and out among them all with the vacant light in his eyes then the bishop whispered to mona and she went out and presently came again and in her arms was the infant in its white linen clothes the sun was now hidden by the heavy cloud overhead and against the windowpanes at that moment there was a light pattering of raindrops ewan had watched with his vacant gaze when mona went out but when she came again a new light seemed to come into his eyes and he stepped up to her and looked down at the little face that was sleeping softly against her breast then he put out his arms to take the child and mona passed it to him and he held it and sat down with it and all at once the tears came into his dry eyes and he wept aloud chapter xiv wrestling with fate so far as concerned the deemster the death of ewans wife was the beginning of the end had she not died under the roof of the new ballamona was it not by the strangest of accidents that she had died there and not in her own home had she not died in childbed did not everything attending her death suggest the force of an irresistible fate more than twenty years ago the woman kerruish the mother of mally kerruish had cursed this house and said that no life would come to it but death would come with it and for more than twenty years the deemster had done his best to laugh at the prediction and to forget it who was he that he should be the victim of fear at the sneezing of an old woman what was he that he should not be master of his fate but what had occurred for more than twenty years one disturbing and distinct idea had engrossed him in all his waking hours it exasperated him and even in his hours of sleep it lay heavy at the back of his brain as a dull feeling of dread on the bench in the saddle at table alone by the winters fire alone in summer walks the obstinate idea was always there and nothing but death seemed likely to shake it off often he laughed at it in his long lingering nervous laugh but it was a chain that was slowly tightening about him everything was being fulfilled first came the death of his wife at the birth of mona and now after an interval of twenty years the death of his sons wife at the birth of her child in that stretch of time he had become in his own view a childless man his hopes had been thwarted in the son on whom alone his hopes had been built the house he had founded was but an echoing vault the fortune he had reared an empty bubble he was accursed god had heard the womans voice he looked too steadily at the facts to mistake them and let the incredulous fools laugh if they liked when twenty years before the deemster realized that he was the slave of one tyrannical idea he tried to break the fate that hung over him he bought up the cottage on the brew and turned the woman kerruish into the roads then he put his foot on every sign of superstitious belief that came in his way as judge but not with such brave shows of unbelief could he conquer his one disturbing idea his nature had never been kindly but now there grew upon him an obstinate hatred of everybody this was in the days when his children ewan and mona lived in the cozy nest at bishops court if in these days any man mentioned the kerruishes in the deemsters presence he showed irritation but he kept his ears open for every syllable said about them he knew all their history he knew when the girl mally fled away from the island on the day of ewans christening he knew by what boat she sailed he knew where she settled herself in england he knew when her child was born and when in terror at the unfulfilled censure of the church that hung over her separating her from all communion with gods people in life or hope of redemption in death she came back to the island drawn by an irresistible idea her child at her breast to work out her penance on the scene of her shame thereafter he watched her daily and knew her life she had been taken back to work at the netlooms of kinvig the peeltown netmaker and she lived with her mother at the cottage over the head and there in poverty she brought up her child her boy jarvis kerruish as she had called him if any pointed at her and laughed with cruelty if any pretended to sympathize with her and said with a snigger the first error is always forgiven mally woman if any mentioned the deemster himself and said with a wink im thinking it terrible strange mally that you dont take a slue round and put a sight on him if any said to her when she bought a new garment out of her scant earnings a gown or even a scarf or bit of bright ribbon such as she loved in the old days dearee dear i thought you wouldnt take rest but be up and put a sight on the ould crookythe deemster knew it all he saw the ruddy audacious girl of twenty sink into the pallid slattern of thirty without hope without joy in life and with only a single tie and the deemster found that there grew upon him daily his old malicious feeling but so far as concerned his outer bearing matters took a turn on the day he came upon the boys dan mylrea and jarvis kerruish fighting in the road it was the first time he had seen the boy jarvis who is he he had asked and the old woman kerruish had made answer dont you know him deemster do you never see a face like that not when you look in the glass there was no need to look twice into a mirror like the face of that lad to know whose son he was the deemster went home to ballamona and thought over the fierce encounter he could tolerate no longer the living reproach of this boys presence within a few miles of his own house and by an impulse no better than humbled pride he went back to the cottage of the kerruishes at night alone and afoot the cottage was a lone place on the top of a bare heath with the bleak sea in front and the purple hills behind and with a fenceless carttrack leading up to it a lead mine known as the cross vein had been worked there forty years before the shaft was still open and now full of dark foul water almost to the surface one roofless wall showed where the gear had stood and under the shelter of this wall there crouched a low thatched toolshed having a door and a small window this was the cottage and until old mrs kerruish had brought there her few rickety sticks when by the deemsters orders they had been thrown into the road none had ever occupied the toolshed as a house the door was open and the deemster stepped in one of the women old mrs kerruish was sitting on a stool by the fireit was a fire of sputtering hazel sticksshredding some scraps of green vegetables into a pot of broth that swung from the iron hook of the chimney the other woman mally was doing something in the dark crib of a sleepingroom shut off from the livingroom by a wooden partition like the stanchionboard of a stable the boy was asleep his soft breathing came from the dark crib mrs kerruish said the deemster i am willing to take the lad and rear him and when the time comes to set him to business and give him a start in life mrs kerruish had risen stiffly from her stool and her face was set hard think of it woman think of it and dont answer in haste said the deemster wed have to be despard hard put to for a bite and a sup before wed take anything from you deemster said the old woman the deemsters quick eyes under the shaggy gray brows glanced about the room it was a place of poverty descending to squalor the floor was of the bare earth trodden hard the roof was of the bare thatch with here and there a lath pushed between the uphewn spars to keep it up and here and there a broken patch dropping hayseed you are desperate hard put to woman said the deemster and at that mally herself came out of the sleepingcrib her face was thin and pale and her bleared eyes had lost their sharp light it was a countenance without one ray of hope stop mother she said let us hear what the deemster has to offer offer offer the old woman rapped out youve had enough of the deemsters offers im thinking be quiet mother said mally and then she turned to the deemster and said well sir and what is it aw very nate and amazing civil to dirks like thatgo on girl go on said the old woman tossing her head and hand in anger toward mally mother this is my concern im thinkingwhat is it sir but the old womans wrath at her daughters patience was not to be kept down behold ye she said its my own girl thats after telling me before strangers that ive not a farthing at me and me good for nothing at working and only fit to hobble about on a stick and fix the house tidy maybe and to have no say in nothinggo on och go on girl the deemster explained his proposal it was that the boy jarvis should be given entirely into his control and be no more known by his mother and his mothers mother and perhaps no more seen or claimed or acknowledged by them and that the deemster should provide for him and see him started in life mrs kerruishs impatience knew no bounds my gough she criedmy gough my gough but mally listened and reflected her spirit was broken and she was thinking of her poverty her mother was now laid aside by rheumatism and could earn nothing and she herself worked piecework at the netmakingso much for a piece of net a hundred yards long by two hundred meshes deep toiling without heart from eight to eight and earning four five and six shillings a week and if there was a want her boy felt it she did not answer at once and after a moment the deemster turned to the door think of it he said think of it hurroo hurroo cried the old woman derisively from her stool her untamable soul aflame with indignation be quiet mother said mally and the hopelessness that had spoken from her eyes seemed then to find a way into her voice the end of it was that jarvis kerruish was sent to a school at liverpool and remained there three years and then became a clerk in the countinghouse of benas brothers of the goree piazza ostensibly african merchants really english moneylenders jarvis did not fret at the loss of his mother and of course he never wrote to her but he addressed a careful letter to the deemster twice a year beginning honored sir and ending yours with much respect most obediently mally had miscalculated her selfcommand if she had thought of her poverty it had been because she had thought of her boy as well he would be lifted above it all if she could but bring herself to part with him she wrought up her feelings to the sacrifice and gave away her son and sat down as a brokenspirited and childless woman then she realized the price she had to pay the boy had been the cause of her shame but he had been the centre of her pride as well if she had been a hopeless woman before she was now a heartless one little by little she fell into habits of idleness and intemperance before young jarvis sat in his frilled shirt on the stool in the goree piazza and before the down had begun to show on his lean cheeks his mother was a lost and abandoned woman but not yet had the deemster broken his fate when ewan disappointed his hopes and went into the church and married without his sanction or knowledge it seemed to him that the chain was gradually tightening about him then the deemster went over once more to the cottage at the cross vein alone and in the night mrs kerruish he said i am willing to allow you six pounds a year pension and i will pay it in three pound notes on lady day and martinmas and putting his first payment on the table he turned about and was gone before the rheumatic old body could twist in her chair the deemster had just made his third visit to the cottage at the cross vein and left his second payment when the death of ewans young wife came as a thunderbolt and startled him to the soul for days and nights thereafter he went about like a beaten horse trembling to the very bone he had resisted the truth for twenty years he had laughed at it in his long lingering laugh at going to bed at night and at rising in the morning he had ridiculed superstition in others and punished it when he could he was the judge of the island and she through whose mouth his fate fell upon him was a miserable ruin cast aside on lifes highway but the truth would be resisted no longer the house over his head was accursedaccursed to him and to his children and to his childrens children the deemsters engrossing idea became a dominating terror was there no way left to him to break the fate that hung over him none the deemster revolved the problem night and day and meantime lived the life of the damned at length he hit on a plan and then peace seemed to come to him a poor paltering show of peace and he went about no longer like a beaten and broken horse his project was a strange one it was the last that prudence would have suggested but the first that the evil spirit of his destiny could have hoped forit was to send to liverpool for jarvis kerruish and establish him in ballamona as his son in that project the hand of his fate was strongly upon him he could not resist it he seemed to yield himself to its power he made himself its willing victim he was even as saul when the spirit of the lord had gone from him and an evil spirit troubled him sending for the anointed son of jesse to play on the harp to him and to supplant him on the throne chapter xv the lie that ewan told it was not for long that dan bore the signs of contrition as soon as ewans pale face had lost the weight of its gloom dans curly poll knew no more trouble he followed the herrings all through that season grew brown with the sun and the briny air and caught the seas laughter in his rollicking voice he drifted into some bad habits from which he had hitherto held himself in check every morning when the boats ran into harbor and teare the mate and crennel the cook stayed behind to sell the fish dan and old billy quilleash trooped up to the three legs of man together there dan was made much of and the lads spirit was not proof against the poor flattery it was mastha dan here and mastha dan there and where is mastha dan and what does mastha dan say and great shoutings and tearings and sprees and all the time the old cat with the whiskers who kept the pothouse was scoring up against dan at the back of the cupboard door did the bishop know know did ever a young fellow go to the dogs but some old woman of either sex found her way to the very ear that ought not to be tormented with jobs comfort and whisper aw dear aw dear and lawkaday and im the last to bring bad newses as the saying is and och and its a pity and him a fine brave young fellow too and i wouldnt have told it on no account to another living soul the bishop said little and tried not to hear but when dan would have hoodwinked him he saw through the device as the sun sees through glass dan never left his fathers presence without a sense of shame that was harder to bear than any reproach would have been something patient and trustful and strong in hope and stronger in love seemed to go out from the bishops silence to dans reticence dan would slink off with the bearing of a whipped hound or perhaps with a muttered curse under his teeth and always with a stern resolve to pitch himself or his cronies straightway into the sea the tragical purpose usually lasted him over the short mile and a half that divided bishops court from the three legs of man and then it went down with some other troubles and a long pint of manx jough of all men the most prompt to keep the bishop informed of dans sad pranks was no other than the deemster since the death of ewans wife the deemsters feelings toward dan had undergone a complete change from that time forward he looked on dan with eyes of distrust amounting in its intensity to hatred he forbade him his house though dan laughed at the prohibition and ignored it he also went across to bishops court for the first time for ten years and poured into the bishops ears the story of every bad bit of business in which dan got involved dan kept him fully employed in this regard and bishops court saw the deemster at frequent intervals if it was degrading to the bishops place as father of the church that his son should consort with all the ragabash of the island the scum of the land and the dirtiest froth of the sea the bishop was made to know the full bitterness of that degradation he would listen with head held down and when the deemster passing from remonstrance to reproach would call upon him to set his own house in order before he ever ascended the pulpit again the bishop would lift his great heavy eyes with an agonizing look of appeal and answer in a voice like a sob have patience thorkellhave patience with the lad he is my son my only son it chanced that toward the end of the herring season an old man of eighty one william callow died and he was the captain of the parish of michael the captaincy was a semicivil semimilitary office and it included the functions of parish headconstable callow had been a a man of extreme probity and his walk in life had been without a slip the ould mans left no living craythur to fill his shoes the people said when they buried him but when the name of the old mans successor came down from castletown who should be the new captain but daniel mylrea the people were amazed the deemster laughed in his throat and dan himself looked appalled hardly a month after this event the relations of dan and the deemster and dan and the bishop reached a climax for months past the bishop had been hatching a scheme for the subdivision of his episcopal glebe the large extent of which had long been a burden on the dwindling energies of his advancing age and he had determined that since his son was not to be a minister of the church he should be its tenant and farm its lands so he cut off from the demesne a farm of eighty acres of fine curragh land well drained and tilled this would be a stay and a solid source of livelihood to dan when the herring fishing had ceased to be a pastime there was no farmhouse on the eighty acres but barns and stables were to be erected and dan was to share with ewan the old ballamona as a home dan witnessed these preparations but entered into them with only a moderate enthusiasm the reason of his lukewarmness was that he found himself deeply involved in debts whereof his father knew nothing when the fishing season finished and the calculations were made it was found that the boat had earned no more than l of this old billy quilleash took four shares every man took two shares there was a share set aside for davy the boy and the owner was entitled to eight shares for himself his nets and his boat so far all was reasonably satisfactory the difficulty and dissatisfaction arose when dan began to count the treasury then it was discovered that there was not enough in hand to pay old billy and his men and the boy leaving dans eight shares out of the count dan scratched his head and pondered he was not brilliant at figures but he totted up his numbers again with the same result then he computed the provisioningtea at four shillings a pound besides fresh meat four times a week and fine flour biscuits it was heavy but not ruinous and the season had been poor but not bad and whatever the net results there ought not to have been a deficit where the principle of cooperation between master and man was that of share and share dan began to see his way through the mysteryit was most painfully transparent in the light of the score that had been chalked up from time to time on the inside of the cupboard of the three legs of man but it was easier to see where the money had gone than to make it up and old billy and his chums began to mutter and to grumble its raely wuss till ever said one the tack weve been on hasnt been worth workin said another dan heard their murmurs and went up to bishops court after all the deficit was only forty pounds and his father would lend him that much but hardly had dan sat down to breakfast than the bishop who was clearly in lower spirits than usual began to lament that his charities to the poor had been interrupted by the cost of building the barns and stables on the farm intended for his son i hope your fishing will turn out well dan he said for ive scarce a pound in hand to start you so dan said nothing about the debt and went back to the fisherfellows with a face as long as a haddocks ill tell you men the storm is coming he said old billy looked as black as thunder and answered with an impatient gesture then keep your weather eye liftin thats all dan measured the old salt from head to foot and hitched his hand into his guernsey you wouldnt talk to me like that billy quilleash if i hadnt been a fool with you its a true saying that when you tell your servant your secret you make him your master old billy sniggered and his men snorted billy wanted to know why he had left kinvigs boat where he had a sure thirty pounds for his season and ned teare wished to be told what his missus would say when he took her five pound ten and crennel the slushy asked what sort of a season the mastha was aftha callin it at all at all not a man of them remembered his share of the long scores chalked up on the inside of the cupboard door poor old dad thought dan he must find the money after allno way but that and once again he turned toward bishops court billy quilleash saw him going off and followed him ive somethin terrible fine up here said billy tapping his forehead mysteriously what is it dan asked och a shockin powerful schame itll get you out of the shoal water anyways said billy it turned out that the shockin powerful schame was the ancient device of borrowing the money from a moneylender old billy knew the very man to serve the turn his name was kisseck and he kept the jolly herrings in peeltown near the bottom of the crabbed little thoroughfare that wound and twisted and descended to that part of the quay which overlooked the castle rock no no thatll not do said dan aw and why not at all why not why not because its blank robbery to borrow what you cant pay back robbery now whats the use of sayin the like o that aw the shockin notions well well and do you raely think a persons got no feelins robbery aw well now well now and old billy tramped along with the air of an injured man but the end of it was that dan said nothing to the bishop that day and the same night found him at the jolly herrings the landlord had nothing to lend not he but he knew people who would not mind parting with money on good security or on anybodys bail as the sayin was couldnt mastha dan get a good mans name to a bit o paper like coorse he could and nothing easier for a genlman same as him who was the people they belonged to liverpool the goree peaizybenas they were callin them three days afterward the forty pounds made up to fifty for round numbers came to kisseck the landlord and the bit o paper came with it dan took the paper and went off with it to the old ballamona ewan would go bail for him and so the bishop need know nothing of the muddle but when dan reached his new home ewan was awaya poor old quaker named christian who had brought himself to beggary by neglecting solomons injunction against suretyship was dying and had sent for the parson dan was in a hurry the fisherfellows were grumbling and their wives were hanging close about their coattails the money must be got without delay and of course ewan would sign for it straightaway if he were there an idea struck dan and made the sweat to start from his forehead he had put the paper on the table and taken up a pen when he heard ewans voice outside and then he threw the pen down and his heart leaped with a sense of relief ewan came in and rattled on about old christian the quaker he hadnt a week to live poor old soul and he hadnt a shilling left in the world once he farmed his hundred acres but he had stood surety for this man and surety for that man and paid up the defalcations of both and now while they were eating the bread of luxury he was dying as a homeless pauper well he has been practising a bad virtue said ewan i wouldnt stand surety for my own brothernot for my own brother if i had one it would be helping him to eat today the bread he earns tomorrow dan went out without saying anything of the bit of paper from liverpool the fisherfellows met him and when they heard what he had to say their grumblings broke out again well im off for the bishopand no disrespec said old billy he did not go the bit o paper was signed but not by ewan the money was paid the grateful seadogs were sent home with their wages in their pockets and a smart cuff on either ear a month or two went by and dan grew quiet and thoughtful and sometimes gloomy and people began to say its none so wild the young mastha is at all at all or perhaps wonderful studdy hes growing or even i wouldnt trust but hell turn out a parson after all one day in november dan went over to new ballamona and asked for mona and sat with her in earnest talk he told her of some impending disaster and she listened with a whitening face from that day forward mona was a changed woman she seemed to share some great burden of fear with dan and it lay heavy upon her and made the way of life very long and cheerless to the sweet and silent girl toward the beginning of december sundry letters came out of their season from the young clerk of benas brothers jarvis kerruish then the deemster went over more than once to bishops court and had grave interviews with the bishop if you can prove this that you say thorkell i shall turn my back on him foreveryes forever said the bishop and his voice was husky and his sad face was seamed with lines of pain a few days passed and a stranger appeared at ballamona and when the stranger had gone the deemster said to mona be ready to go to bishops court with me in the morning monas breath seemed to be suddenly arrested will ewan be there she asked yesisnt it the day of his weekday service at the chapelwednesdayisnt it and dan she said dan why dan well woman perhaps dan toowho knows the bishop had sent across to the old ballamona to say that he wished to see his son in the library after service on the following morning at twelve next day dan who had been plowing turned in at bishops court in his long boots and rough red shirt and there in the library he found mona and the deemster seated mona did not speak when dan spoke to her her voice seemed to fail but the deemster answered in a jaunty word or two and then the bishop looking very thoughtful came in with ewan whose eyes were brighter than they had been for many a day and behind them walked the stranger whom mona had seen at ballamona the day before why and hows this said ewan on perceiving that so many of them were gathered there the bishop closed the door and then answered with averted face we have a painful interview before us ewanbe seated it was a dark day the clouds hung low and the dull rumble of the sea came through the dead air a fire of logs and peat burned on the hearth and the deemster rose and stood with his back to it his hands interlaced behind him the bishop sat on his brassclamped chair at the table and rested his pale cheek on his hand there was a pause and then without lifting his eyes the bishop said ewan do you know that it is contrary to the customs of the church for a minister to stand security for a debtor ewan was standing by the table fumbling the covers of a book that he had lifted i know it he said quietly do you know that the minister who disregards that custom stands liable to suspension at the hands of his bishop ewan looked about with a stare of bewilderment but he answered again and as quietly i know it there was silence for a moment and then the deemster clearing his throat noisily turned to where dan was pawing up a rug that lay under a column and bust of bunyan and do you know sir said the deemster in his shrill tones what the punishment of forgery may be dans face had undergone some changes during the last few minutes but when he lifted it to the deemsters it was as firm as a rock hanging perhaps he answered sullenly transportation perhaps what of it out with itbe quick dans eyes flashed the deemster tittered audibly the bishop looked up at his son from under the rims of his spectacles and drew a long breath mona had covered her face in her hands where she sat in silence by the ingle and ewan still fumbling the book in his nervous fingers was glancing from dan to the deemster and from the bishop to dan with a look of blank amazement the deemster motioned to the stranger who thereupon advanced from where he had stood by the door and stepped up to ewan may i ask if this document was drawn by your authority and saying this the stranger held out a paper and ewan took it in his listless fingers there was a moments silence ewan glanced down at the document it showed that fifty pounds had been lent to daniel mylrea by benas brothers of the goree piazza liverpool and it was signed by ewans own name as that of surety is that your signature asked the stranger ewan glanced at dan and dans head was on his breast and his lips quivered the bishop was trembling visibly and sat with head bent low by the sorrow of a wrecked and shattered hope the stranger looked from ewan to dan and from dan to the bishop the deemster gazed steadily before him and his face wore a ghostly smile is it your signature repeated the stranger and his words fell on the silence like the clank of a chain ewan saw it all now he glanced again at the document but his eyes were dim and he could read nothing then he lifted his face and its lines of agony told of a terrible struggle yes he answered the signature is minewhat of it at that the bishop and mona raised their eyes together the stranger looked incredulous it is quite right if you say so the stranger replied with a cold smile ewan trembled in every limb i do say so he said his fingers crumpled the document as he spoke but his head was erect and the truth seemed to sit on his lips dan dropped heavily into a chair and buried his face in his hands the stranger smiled again the same cold smile the lenders wish to withdraw the loan he said they may do soin a month said ewan that will suffice the deemsters face twitched monas cheeks were wet with tears the bishop had risen and gone to the window and was gazing out through blurred eyes into the blinding rain that was now pelting against the glass it would be cruel to prolong a painful interview said the stranger and then with a glance toward dan where he sat convulsed with distress that he made no effort to conceal he added in a hard tone only the lenders came to have reasons to fear that perhaps the document had been drawn without your knowledge ewan handed the paper back with a nerveless hand he looked at the stranger through swimming eyes and said gently but with an awful inward effort you have my answer siri knew of it the stranger bowed and went out dan leaped to his feet and threw his arms about ewans neck but dared not to look into his troubled face mona covered her eyes and sobbed the deemster picked up his hat to go and in passing out he paused in front of ewan and said in a bitter whisper fool fool you have taken this mans part to your own confusion when the door closed behind the deemster the bishop turned from the window ewan he said in a voice like a cry the recording angel has set down the lie you have told today in the book of life to your credit in heaven then the bishop paused and dan lifted his head from ewans neck as for you sir the bishop added turning to his son i am done with you forevergo from melet me see your face no more dan went out of the room with bended head chapter xvi the plowing match when ewan got back home there was dan sitting before the fire in the old hall his legs stretched out before him his hands thrust deep in his pockets his head low in his breast and his whole mien indicative of a crushed and broken spirit he glanced up furtively as ewan entered and then back with a stony stare to the fire if ewan had then given him one word of cheer god knows what tragic consequences would have been spared to them both but ewan had saved dan from the penalty of his crime at the cost of truth and his selfesteem dan he said you and i must partwe can be friends no longer he spoke with a strong effort and the words seemed to choke him dan shambled to his feet he appeared to collect his thoughts for a moment like one who had fainted and returns to consciousness mindi dont turn you out of the house said ewan only if we are to share this place together we must be strangers a hard smile broke out on dans face he seemed to be trying to speak but not a word would come he twisted slowly on his heel and lifted the latch of the door that led to the inner part of the house one thing more said ewan speaking quickly and in a tremulous voice i will ask you to look upon yourself as a stranger to my sister also dan stopped and turned about over the forced smile his hard face told of a great struggle for selfcommand he said nothing and after a moment he went out drawing his breath audibly then straightway ewan flung himself into the chair from which dan had risen and his slight frame shook with suppressed sobs after some minutes the sense of his own degradation diminished and left room for a just idea of dans abject humiliation i have gone too far he thought i will make amends he had risen to follow dan when another thought trod heavily on the heels of the first leave him alone it will be best for himselfleave him alone for his own sake and so with the madness of wrath fermenting in his own brain he left it to ferment in dans brain as well now when dan found himself left alone he tried to carry off his humiliation by a brave show of unconcern he stayed on at the old ballamona but he never bothered himselfnot he forsoothto talk to folks who passed him on the stairs without a word of greeting or met in the hall without a glance of recognition it chanced just then that in view of a threatened invasion the authorities were getting up a corps of volunteers known as the manx fencibles and that they called on the captains of the parishes to establish companies dan threw himself into this enterprise with uncommon vigor took drills himself acquired a competent knowledge of the rudiments in a twinkling and forthwith set himself to band together the young fellows of his parish it was just the sort of activity that dan wanted at the moment and in following it up the three legs saw him something oftener than before and there the fellows of the baser sort drank and laughed with him addressing him sometimes as captain but oftener as dan never troubling themselves a haporth to put a handle to his name this was a turn of events which ewan could not understand i have been mistaken in the man he thought theres no heart left in him toward the middle of december jarvis kerruish arrived at ballamona and forthwith established himself there in a position that would have been proper to the deemsters heir he was a young man of medium height and size closely resembling the deemster in face and figure his dress was english he wore a closefitting undercoat with tails and over it a loose cloak mounted with a brass buckle at the throat he had a beaver hat of the shape of a sugarloaf and boots that fitted to his legs like gloves his manner was expansive and he betrayed a complete unconsciousness of the sinister bar of his birth and of the false position he had taken up in the deemsters house he showed no desire to visit the cottage at the cross vein and he spoke of the poor with condescension when he met with ewan he displayed no uneasiness and ewan on his part gave no sign of resentment mona on the other hand betrayed an instinctive repulsion and in less than a week from his coming their relations had reached an extraordinary crisis which involved ewan and dan and herself in terrible consequences this is what occurred on the day before christmas day there was to be a plowing match in a meadow over the head and ewan stood pledged by an old promise to act as judge the day came and it was a heavy day with snowclouds hanging overhead and misty vapors floating down from the hills and up from the curraghs and hiding them at ten in the morning mona muffled herself in a great cloak and went over to the meadow with ewan there a crowd had already gathered strong men in blue pilots old men in sheepskin coats women with their short blue camblet gowns tucked over their linen caps boys and girls on every side all coming and going like shadows in the mist at one end of the meadow several pairs of horses stood yoked to plows and a few lads were in charge of them on ewans arrival there was a general movement among a group of men standing together and a respectful salutation to the parson the names were called over of the plowmen who had entered for the prizea pound note and a cupand last of all there was a show of hands for the election of six men to form a jury then the stretch was staked out the prize was to the plowman who would make the stretch up and down the meadow in the shortest time cutting the furrows straightest cleanest and of the most regular depth when all was ready ewan took up his station where the first furrow would be cut into the field with mona at his side and the six jurors about him the first plowman to bring up his plow was a brawny young fellow with a tanned face the plowman had brought up his horses in front of the stake and had laid hands on his plowhandles and was measuring the stretch with his eye for a landmark to sight by when jarvis kerruish came into the meadow and walked through the crowd and took up a place by monas side there were audible comments and some racy exclamations as he pushed through the crowd not lifting an eye to any face but he showed complete indifference and began to talk to mona in a loud measured tone ah this is very gratifying he was saying to see the peasantry engaged in manly sportsuseful sportsis i confess very gratifying to me my gough said a voice from one side hurroo said a voice from the other side lawkaday came from behind in a shrill female treble did ye ever see a grub turn butterfly jarvis seemed not to hear now there are sports he began but the plowman was shouting to his horses steady steady the plow was dipping into the succulent grass the first swish of the upturned soil was in the air and jarviss wise words were lost all eyes were on the bent back of the plowman plodding on in the mist he cuts like a razor said one of the spectators he bears his hand too much on said another do better yourself next spell said a third when the horses reached the far end of the stretch the plowman whipped them round like the turn of a wheel and in another moment he was toiling back steadily firmly his hand rigid and his face set hard when he got back to where ewan with his watch in his hand stood surrounded by the jurors he was covered with sweat good very goodsix minutes ten seconds said ewan and there were some plaudits from the people looking on and some banter of the competitors who came up to follow jarvis kerruish at monas elbow was beginning again i confess that it has always been my personal opinion but in the bustle of another pair of horses whipped up to the stake no one seemed to be aware that he was speaking five plowmen came in succession but all were behind the first in time and cut a less regular furrow so ewan and the jurors announced that the prize was to the stranger then as ewan twisted about his adjudication finished to where mona stood with jarvis by her side there was a general rush of competitors and spectators to a corner of the meadow where from a little square cart the buirdly stranger who was victor proceeded to serve out glasses of ale from a small barrel while this was going on and there was some laughter and shouting and singing there came a loud hello as of many voices from a little distance and then the beat of many irregular feet and one of the lads in the crowd who had jumped to the top of the broad turf hedge shouted its the captnits mastha dan in another halfminute dan and some fifty or sixty of the scum of the parish came tumbling into the meadow on all sidesover the hedge over the gate and tearing through the gaps in the gorse they were the corps that dan had banded together toward the manx fencibles but the only regimentals they yet wore were a leather belt and the only implement of war they yet carried was the small dagger that was fitted into the belt that morning they had been drilling and after drill they had set off to see the plowing match and on the way they had passed the three legs and being exceeding dry they had drawn up in front thereof and every man had been served with a glass which had been duly scored off to the captains account dan saw mona with ewan as he vaulted the gate but he gave no sign of recognition and in a moment he was in the thick of the throng at the side of the cart hearing all about the match and making loud comments upon it in his broadest homespun what he said and youve let yourselves be bate by a craythur like that hurroo he strode up to the strangers furrow cocked his eye along it and then glanced at the strangers horses och ill go bail ill bate it with a yoke of oxen at that there was a movement of the crowd around him and some cheering just to egg on the rupture that was imminent the big stranger heard all and strode through the people with a face like a thundercloud who says hell bate it with a yoke of oxen he asked thats just what im afther saying my fine fellow have you anything agen it in half a minute a wager had been laid of a pound a side that dan with a pair of oxen would beat the stranger with a pair of horses in two stretches out of three davy davy shouted dan and in a twinkling there was davy fayle looking queer enough in his guernsey and his long boots and his seacap and withal his belt and his dagger davy was sent for a pair of oxen to where they were leading manure not far away he went off like a shot and in ten minutes he was back in the meadow driving the oxen before him now these oxen had been a gift of the bishop to dan they were old and had grown wise with their years for fifteen years they had worked on the glebe at bishops court and they knew the dinner hour as well as if they could have taken the altitude of the sun when the dinner bell rang at the court at twelve oclock the oxen would stop short no matter where they were or what they were doing and not another budge would they make until they had been unyoked and led off for their midday mash it was now only a few minutes short of twelve but no one took note of that circumstance and the oxen were yoked to a plow same judge and jury said the stranger but ewan excused himself aw what matter about a judge said dan from his plowhandles let the jury be judge as well ewan and mona looked on in silence for some moments ewan could scarce contain himself there was dan stripped to his red flannel shirt his face tanned and glowing his whole body radiant with fresh life and health and he was shouting and laughing as if there had never been a shadow to darken his days look at him whispered ewan with emotion in monas ear look this goodnature that seems so good to others is almost enough to make me hate him mona was startled and turned to glance into ewans face come let us go said ewan with head aside not yet said mona then jarvis kerruish who had stepped aside for a moment returned and said will you take a wager with me monaa pair of gloves very well she answered who do you bet on oh on the stranger said mona coloring slightly and laughing a little how lucky said jarvis i bet on the captain i can stand it no longer whispered ewan will you come but monas eyes were riveted on the group about the oxen she did not hear and ewan turned away and walked out of the meadow then there was a shout and the oxen started with dan behind them on they went through the hard tough ground tranquilly steadily with measured pace tearing through roots of trees that lay in their way as if nothing could stop them in their great strength when the oxen got back after the first stretch the time was calledfive minutes thirty secondsand there was a great cheer and monas pale face was triumphant the stranger brought up his horses and set off again straining every muscle he did his stretch in six minutes four seconds and another cheerbut it was a cheer for danwent up after the figures were called then dan whipped round his oxen once more and brought them up to the stake the excitement among the people was now very great mona clutched her cloak convulsively and held her breath jarvis was watching her closely and she knew that his cold eyes were on her face one would almost imagine that you were anxious to lose your bet he said she made no answer when the oxen started again her lips closed tightly as if she was in pain on the oxen went and made the first half of the stretch without a hitch and with the blade of the plow lifted they were wheeling over the furrow end when a bell rang across the curraghit was the bell for the midday meal at bishops courtand instantly they came to a dead stand dan called to them but they did not budge then his whip fell heavily across their snouts and they snorted but stirred not an inch the people were in a tumult and shouted with fifty voices at once dans passion mastered him he brought his whip down over the flanks and across the eyes and noses of the oxen they winced under the blows that rained down on them and then shot away across the meadow tearing up the furrows they had made then there was a cry of vexation and anger from the people and dan who had let go his reins strode back to the stake ive lost said dan with a muttered oath at the oxen all this time jarvis kerruish had kept his eye steadily fixed on monas twitching face youve won mona he said in a cold voice and with an icy smile i must go where is ewan she said tremulously and before jarvis was aware she had gone over the grass dan had heard when ewan declined to act as judge he had seen when ewan left the meadow and though he did not look he knew when mona was no longer there his face was set hard and it glowed red under his sunburned skin davy bring them up he said and davy fayle led back the oxen to the front of the stake then dan unyoked them took out the long swinging tree that divided thema heavy wooden bar clamped with ironand they stood free and began to nibble the grass under their feet look out he shouted and he swung the bar over his shoulder the crowd receded and left an open space in which dan stood alone with the oxen his great limbs holding the ground like their own hoofs his muscles standing out like bulbs on his bare arms what is he going to dokill them said one look out dan shouted again and in another moment there was the swish of the bar through the air then down the bar came on the forehead of one of the oxen and it reeled and its legs gave way and it fell dead the bar was raised again and again it fell and the second of the oxen reeled like the first and fell dead beside its old yokefellow a cry of horror ran through the crowd but heeding it not at all dan threw on his coat and buckled his belt about him and strode through the people and out at the gate chapter xvii the wrong way with dan what happened next was one of those tragedies of bewildering motive so common and so fatal in which it is impossible to decide whether evil passion or evil circumstances plays the chief malicious part dan walked straight to the new ballamona and pushed through the house without ceremony as it had been his habit to do in other days to the room where mona was to be found she was there and she looked startled at his coming is it you dan she said in a tremulous whisper he answered sullenly it is i i have come to speak with you i have something to saybut no matter he stopped and threw himself into a chair his head ached his eyes were hot and his mind seemed to him to be in darkness and confusion mona i think i must be going mad he stammered after a moment why talk like that she said her bosom heaved and her face was troubled he did not answer but after a pause turned toward her and said in a quick harsh tone you did not expect to see me here and you have been forbidden to receive me is it not so she colored deeply and did not answer at once and then she began with hesitation my fatherit is true my father it is so he said sharply he got on to his feet and tramped about the room after a moment he sat down again and leaned his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands but what of ewan he asked ewan loves you dan and you have been at fault said mona in broken accents at fault there was a sudden change in his manner he spoke bruskly even mockingly and laughed a short grating laugh they are taking the wrong way with me monathats the fact he said and now his breast heaved and the words came with difficulty mona was gazing absently out at the window her head aslant her fingers interlaced before her oh dan dan she murmured in a low tone there is your dear dear father and ewan andand myself dan had leapt to his feet again dont turn my eyes into my head mona he said he tramped to and fro in the room for a moment and then broke out nervously all last night i dreamt such an ugly dream i dreamt it three times and o god what an ugly dream it was it was a bad night and i was walking in the dark and stumbling first into bogs and then in cart ruts when all of a sudden a mans hand seized me unawares i could not see the man and we struggled long in the darkness and it seemed as if he would master me he gripped me by the waist and i held him by the shoulders we reeled and fell together and when i would have risen his knee was on my chest but a great flood of strength seemed to come to me and i threw him off and rose to my feet and closed with him again and at last i was over him covering him with his back across my thigh and my hand set hard in his throat and all this time i heard his loud breathing in the darkness but never once the sound of his voice then instantly as if by a flash of lightning i saw the face that was close to mine andgod almighty it was my own facemy ownand it was black already from the pressure of my stiff fingers at the throat he trembled as he spoke and sat again and shivered and a cold chill ran down his back mona he said half in a sob do you believe in omens she did not reply her breast heaved visibly and she could not speak tush he said in another voice omens and he laughed bitterly and rose again and picked up his hat and then said in a quieter way only as i say theyre taking the wrong way with me mona he had opened the door and she had turned her swimming eyes toward him it was bad enough to make himself a stranger to me but why did he want to make you a stranger too stranger stranger he echoed the word in a mocking accent and threw back his head dan said mona in a low passionate tone and the blinding tears rained down her cheeks nothing and nobody can make us strangers you and menot my father or your dear father or ewan orshe dropped her voice to a deep whisperor any misfortune or any disgrace mona he cried and took a step toward her and stretched out one arm with a yearning gesture but at the next moment he had swung about and was going out at the door at sight of all that tenderness and loyalty in monas face his conscience smote him as it had never smitten him before ewan was right mona he is the noblest man on gods earth and i am the foulest beast on it he was pulling the door behind him when he encountered jarvis kerruish in the hall that gentleman had just come into the house and was passing through the hall in hat and cloak he looked appalled at seeing dan there and stepped aside to let him go by but dan did not so much as recognize his presence by lifting his head as he strode out at the porch with head still bent dan had reached the gate to the road and pushed through it and sent it back with a swing and a click when the deemster walked up to it and half halted and would have stopped but dan went moodily on and the frown on the deemsters wizened face was lost on him he did not take the lane toward the old ballamona but followed the turnpike that led past bishops court and as he went by the large house behind the trees ewan came through the smaller gate and turned toward the new ballamona they did not speak or even glance at each others faces dan went on until he came to the parish church there was singing within and he stopped he remembered that this was christmas eve the choir was practising the psalms for the morrows services before i was troubled i went wrong but now have i kept thy word dan went up to the church porch and stood there and listened it is good for me that i have been in trouble that i may learn thy statutes the wooden door clamped and barred and wormeaten and cut by knives was ajar and from where he stood dan could see into the church there were the empty pews the gaunt square greenclad boxes on which he had sat on many a christmas eve at oiel verree he could picture the old place as it used to be in those days of his boyhood the sea of faces some solemn and some bubbling over with mischief the candles with their ribbons the old clerk willasthorn standing up behind the communion rail with his pitchpipe in his hand and hommybeg in his linseywoolsey petticoat singing lustily from a paper held upside down the singing stopped behind were the hills slieu dhoo and slieu volley hidden now under a thick veil of mist and from across the flat curragh there came in the silence the low moan of the sea once more said a voice within the church and then the psalm was sung again dan began to breathe easier he scarce knew why and a great weight seemed to be lifted off his breast as he turned away from the porch a heavy web of cloud was sweeping on and sweeping on from over the sea he looked up and saw that a snowstorm was coming and that the snowcloud would break when it reached the mountains the clock in the gray tower was strikingonetwothreeso it was now three oclock dan went down toward the creek known as the lockjaw under orris head there he expected to see old billy quilleash and his mates who had liberty to use the benmychree during the winter months for fishing with the lines when he got to the creek it was an hour after high water and the lugger with quilleash and teare had gone out for cod davy fayle who like dan himself was still wearing his militia belt and dagger had been doing something among scraps of net and bits of old rope which lay in a shed that the men had thrown together for the storing of their oddsandends davy was looking out to sea down there a stiff breeze was blowing and the white curves of the breakers outside could just be seen through the thick atmosphere the storm is coming mastha dan said davy see the diver on the top of the white wave out there dye hear her wild note davy shaded his eyes from the wind which was blowing from the sea and looked up at the stormy petrel that was careering over the head of the cliff above them and uttering its dismal cry ay and dye see mother careys chickens up yonder said davy again the storms coming and wonderful quick too truly a storm was coming and it was a storm more terrible than wind and snow chapter xviii the blind womans second sight now when jarvis kerruish encountered dan in the act of coming out of monas room his surprise was due to something more than the knowledge that dan had been forbidden the house on leaving the meadow after the plowing match and the slaughter of the oxen that followed it jarvis had made a long circuit of the curragh and returned to ballamona by the road he had been pondering on monas deportment during the exciting part of the contest between dan and the stranger and had just arrived at obvious conclusions of his own by way of explaining the emotion that she could not conceal when he recognized that he was approaching the cottage occupied by hommybeg and his wife kerry a droning voice came from within accompanied by some of the most doleful wails that ever arrested mortal ears jarvis was prompted to stop and enter he did so and found both the deaf husband and the blind wife at home hommy was squatting on a low threelegged stool with his fiddle at his shoulder playing vigorously and singing as he played it was christmas eve to hommybeg also and he was practising the carol that he meant to sing at the oiel verree that night blind kerry was sitting by the fire knitting with gray yarn the deaf mans eyes and the blind womans ears simultaneously announced the visit of jarvis and as hommybeg dropped his fiddle from his shoulder kerry let fall the needles on her lap and held up her hand with an expression of concern och and didnt i say that something was happening at ballamona said kerry and so she did said hommybeg i knew it said kerry i knew it as the sayin is all this in return for jarviss casual visit and mere salutation surprised him the sight the sight its as true as the ould book itself aw yes aw yes continued kerry and she began to wring her hands jarvis felt uneasy do you know my good people he said largely im at a loss to understand what you mean what is it that has happened at ballamona at that the face of the blind wife looked puzzled have ye not come from ballamona straight she asked noits four hours since i left there said jarvis aw dear aw dearee dear said kerry the sight the sight jarviss uneasiness developed into curiosity and in answer to many questions he learned that blind kerry had that day been visited by another of those visions of dan which never came to her except when her nursling was in some disgrace or danger and never failed to come to her then on this occasion the vision had been one of great sorrow and kerry trembled as she recounted it i saw him as plain as plain and he was standing in misthress monas room atween the bed and the wee craythurs cot and he went down on his knees aside of it and cried and cried and cried morthal and misthress mona herself was there sobbing her heart out as the sayin is and the wee craythur was sleeping soft and quiet and it was dark night outside and the candle was in the misthresss hand aw yes i saw it sir i saw it and i tould my man here and behould ye he said drop it woman drop it says he its only drames its only drames jarvis did not find the story a tragic one but he listened with an interest that was all his own you saw mr dan in miss monas roomdo you mean her chamber sure and he climbed in at the window and white as a haddock and all amuck with sweat climbed in at the windowthe window of her chamberher bedroomyoure sure it was her bedroom sarten sure dont i know it same as my own bit of a place the bed with the curtains all white and dimity as theyre sayin and the wee things cot carved over with the lions and the tigers and the beasties and the goats rug and the sheepskinaw yes aw yes the reality of the vision had taken such a hold of kerry that she had looked upon it as a certain presage of disaster and when jarvis had opened the door she had leapt to the conclusion that he came to announce the catastrophe that she foresaw and to summon her to ballamona jarvis smiled grimly he had heard in the old days of kerrys second sight and now he laughed at it but the blind womans stupid dreams had given him an idea and he rose suddenly and hurried away jarvis knew the deemsters weakness for he knew why he found himself where he was stern man as the deemster might be keen of wit and strong of soul jarvis knew that there was one side of his mind on which he was feebler than a child on that side of the deemster jarvis now meant to play to his own end and profit he was full to the throat of the story which he had to pour into credulous ears that never listened to a superstitious tale without laughing at it and mocking at it and believing it when he stepped into the hall at ballamona and came suddenly face to face with dan and saw the door of monas sittingroom open before and close behind him jarvis was bewildered could it be possible that there was something in the blind womans second sight he had scarcely recovered from his surprise when the deemster walked into the porch looking as black as a thundercloud that man has been here again he said why didnt you turn him out of the house i have something to tell you said jarvis they went into the deemsters study it was a little place to the left of the hall half under the stairs and with the fireplace built across one corner over the mantelshelf a number of curious things were hung from hooks and nailsa huge silver watch with a small face and great seals a mask a blunderbuss a monastic lamp and a crucifix a piece of silvered glass and a pistol what now asked the deemster jarvis told the blind womans story with variations and the deemster listened intently and with a look of deadly rage and you saw him come out of her roomyou yourself saw him said the deemster with my own eyes dear sir said jarvis the deemsters lip quivered my god it must be true he said at that moment they heard a foot in the hall and going to the door in his restless tramping to and fro the deemster saw that ewan had come into the house he called to him and ewan went into the study and on ewan going in jarvis went out there was a look of such affright on the deemsters face that before a word was spoken ewan had caught the contagion of his fathers terror then grasping his son by the wrist in the intensity of his passion the deemster poured his tale into ewans ear but it was not the tale that blind kerry had told to jarvis it was not the tale that jarvis had told to him it was a tale compounded of superstition and of hate blind kerry had said of her certain knowledge that dan was accustomed to visit mona in her chamber at night alone entering in at the window jarvis kerruish himself had seen him thereand that very day not at night but in the broad daylight jarvis had seen dan come from monas room what had ewan no bowels that he could submit to the dishonor of his own sister ewan listened to the hot words that came from his father in a rapid and ceaseless whirl the story was all so fatally circumstantial as the deemster told it no visions no sights no sneezings of an old woman all was clear hard deadly damning circumstance or seemed to be so to ewans heated brain and poisoned heart father he said very quietly but with visible emotion you are my father but there are only two persons alive from whose lips i would take a story like this and you are not one of them at that word the deemsters passion overcame him my god he cried what have i done that i should not be believed by my own son would i slander my own daughter but ewan did not hear him he had turned away and was going toward the door of monas room he moved slowly there was an awful silence full half a minute his hand rested on the door handle and only then did his nervous fingers turn it he stepped into the room the room was empty it was monas sittingroom her workroom her parlor her nursery out of it there opened another room by a door at the further end of the hall on the left the door of that other room was ajar and ewan could hear from where he now stood quivering in every limb the soft cooing of the childhis child his dead wifes childand the inarticulate nothings that mona the fostermother babbled over it booloolalapapa deareedeareedear and then the tender cooing died off into a murmur and an almost noiseless long kiss on the full round babyneck ewan stood irresolute for a moment and the sweat started from his forehead he felt like one who has been kneeling at a shrine when a foul hand besmudges it he had half swung about to go back when his ear caught the sound of the deemsters restless foot outside he could not go back the poison had gone to his heart he stepped into the bedroom that led out of the sittingroom mona raised her eyes as her brother entered she was leaning over the cot her beautiful face alive with the light of a tender lovea very vision of pure and delicious womanhood almost she had lifted the child from the cot to ewans arms when at a second glance she recognized the solemn expression of his face and then she let the little one slide back to its pillow what has happened is it true he began very slowly that dan has been here then mona blushed deeply and there was a pause is it true he said again and now with a hurried and startled look is it true that dan has been herehere mona misunderstood his emphasis ewan was standing in her chamber and when he asked if dan had been there he was inquiring if dan had been with her in that very room she did not comprehend the evil thought that had been put in his heart but she remembered the prohibition placed upon her both by ewan and her father never to receive dan again and her confusion at the moment of ewans question came of the knowledge that contrary to that prohibition she had received him is it true he asked yet again and he trembled with the passion he suppressed after a pause he answered himself with an awful composure it is true the child lifted itself and babbled at mona with its innocent face all smiles and mona turned to hide her confusion by leaning over the cot booloolala then a great wave of passion seemed to come to ewan and he stepped to his sister and took her by both hands he was like a strong man in a dream who feels sure that he can only be dreamingstruggling in vain to awake from a terrible nightmare and knowing that a nightmare it must be that sits on him and crushes him no no there must be a mistake there must there must he said and his hot breathing beat on her face he has never been here herenever mona raised herself she loosed her hands from his grasp her womans pride had been stung it seemed to her that her brother was taking more than a brothers part there is no mistake she said with some anger dan has been here you confess it she looked him straight in the eyes and answered yes if you call it soi confess it it is of no use to deceive you then there was an ominous silence ewans features became deathlike in their rigidity a sickening sense came over him he was struggling to ask a question that his tongue would not utter monado you meando you mean that dan hashasoutragegreat god what am i to say how am i to say it mona drew herself up i mean that i can hide my feelings no longer she said do with me as you may i am not a child and no brother shall govern me dan has been hereoutrage or nonecall it what you willyes and she dropped her head over the cot i love him ewan was not himself his heart was poisoned or then and there he would have unraveled the devilish tangle of circumstance he tried again with another and yet another question but every question he asked and every answer mona gave made the tangle thicker his strained jaw seemed to start from his skin i passed him on the road he said to himself in a hushed whisper oh that i had but known then with a look of reproach at mona he turned aside and went out of the room he stepped back to the study and there the deemster was still tramping to and fro simpleton simpleton to expect a woman to acknowledge her own dishonor the deemster cried ewan did not answer at once but in silence he reached up to where the pistol hung over the mantelshelf and took it down what are you doing cried the deemster she has acknowledged it said ewan still in a suppressed whisper for a moment the deemster was made speechless and powerless by that answer then he laid hold of his sons hand and wrenched the pistol away no violence he cried he was now terrified at the wrath that his own evil passions had aroused he locked the pistol in a cabinet it is better so said ewan and in another moment he was going out at the porch the deemster followed him and laid a hand on his arm rememberno violence he said for the love of god see there is no violence but ewan without a word more without relaxing a muscle of his hard white face without a glance or a sign but with bloodshot eyes and quivering nostrils with teeth compressed and the great veins on his forehead large and dark over the scar that dan had left there drew himself away and went out of the house chapter xix how ewan found dan ewan went along like a man whose reason is clogged all his faculties were deadened he could not see properly he could not hear he could not think try as he might to keep his faculties from wandering his mind would not be kept steady time after time he went back to the passage of scripture which he had fixed on that morning for his next lesson and sermon it was the story how esau when robbed of his birthright blessing said in his heart i will slay my brother jacob how jacob fled from his brothers anger to the home of laban how after many years esau married the daughter of ishmael and jacob came to the country of edom how in exceeding fear of esaus wrath jacob sent before him a present for esau out of the plenty with which god had blessed him and how jacob lifted up his eyes and beheld esau and ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept ewan would see the goats and the ewes and the rams and the milch camels toiling along through the hot lush grass by the waters of the jordan then all at once these would vanish and he would find himself standing alone in the drear winter day with the rumble of the bleak sea far in front and close overhead the dark snowclouds sweeping on and on his strong emotion paralyzed all his faculties he could neither fix his mind on the mission on which he had set out nor banish the thought of it mission what was it at one moment he thought he knew and then his eyes seemed to jump from their sockets am i going mad he asked himself and his head turned giddy he went on a blind force impelled him at length he reached the old ballamona his own especial room in the house was the little bookencased closet looking over the curraghs toward the seathe same that had been the study of gilcrist mylrea before he went away and came back as bishop but ewan turned mechanically toward another part of the house and entered a room hung about with muskets and the horns of deer fishing rods and baskets a watchmans truncheon lettered in red loose pieces of net and even some horse harness a dog a brown collie lay asleep before the fire and over the ranneltree shelf a huge watch was ticking but dan was not in his room then ewan remembered in a dazed wayhow had the memory escaped him so longthat when dan passed him on the road he was not going homeward but toward the village no doubt the man was on his way to the low pothouse he frequented ewan left ballamona and went on toward the three legs of man he crossed the fields which the bishop had cut off from the episcopal demesne for his sons occupation as a farm as he walked his wandering aimless thoughts were arrested by the neglected state of the land and the stock upon it in one croft the withered stalks of the last crop of cabbage lay rotten on the ground in a meadow a sheep was lying dead of the rot and six or seven of the rest of the flock were dragging their falling wool along the thin grass ewan came out of the fields to the turnpike by the footpath that goes by bishops court and as he passed through the stile he heard the bishop in conversation with some one on the road within what is the balance that i owe you mr looney for building those barns on my sons farm the bishop was saying seven pounds five shillings my lord the man answered and rael bad im wanting the money too my lord and three months im afther waiting for it so you are mr looney you would have been paid before this if id had wherewith to pay you then there was silence between the two and ewan was going on when the bishop added hereheretake this there was a sound as of the rattle of keys and seals and a watch chainit was my old fathers last gift to me all he had to give to megod bless his memoryand i little thought to part with itbut there take it and sell it and pay yourself mr looney the man seemed to draw back your watch he said aw no no no och if im never paid never its not patrick looney that is the man to take the watch out of your pocket take ittake it why my good manthe bishops voice was all but breakingyou should not refuse to take the time of day from your bishop then there was a jaunty laugh with a great sob at the back of it besides ive found the old thing a sore tax on my failing memory this many day to wind it and wear it come it will wipe out my debt to you ewan went on his teeth were set hard why had he overheard that conversation was it to whet his purpose it seemed as if there might be some supernatural influence over him but this was not the only conversation he overheard that day when he got to the three legs of man a carriers cart stood outside ewan stepped into the lobby of the house the old cat was counting up the chalk marks vertical and horizontal at the back of the cupboard door and the carrier was sitting on a round table recounting certain mad doings at castletown lets down with the watch and take their lanterns says the captain says he laughing morthal and a bit sprung maybe and down they went one a top o the other jemmy the red and johnnybynite and all the rest of them bellowing strong and the captn and his pals whipping up their lanterns and their truncheons and away at a slant aw it was right fine the carrier laughed loud at his story was that when mastha dan was down at castletown fixing the business for the fencibles aw yes woman and middlin stiff it cost him next morning jemmy the red and johnnybynite were off for the castle but the captain met them and im not for denying it says he and a bit of a spree he says and take this jemmy says he and say no more and what did he give the watch to sweeten them three pound theyre saying aw yes woman womanliberal very none o yer closefisted about the captain the blood rushed to ewans heart in a moment he found himself asking for dan and hearing from the old woman with the whiskers who spoke with a curtsey after every syllable that master dan had been seen to go down toward the creek the lockjaw under orris head ewan went out of the pothouse and turned the lane toward the creek what was the mysterious influence on his destiny that he of all men must needs overhear two such conversations and hear them now of all times the neglected lands the impoverished old bishop the reckless spendthrift all rose before ewans mind in a bewildering haze the lane to the lockjaw led past the shambles that stood a little out of the village ewan had often noticed the butchers low wagon on the road with sheep penned in by a rope across the sternboard or with a calf in a net all at once he now realized that he was walking behind this wagon and that a dead ox lay in it and that the driver at the horses head was talking to a man who plodded along beside him ewans faculties were now more clouded than before but he could hear with gaps in which his sense of hearing seemed to leave him the conversation between the two men well well just to thinkkilling the poor beast for stopping when the dinner bell rang at the coort and them used of it for fifteen years aw well well hes no christian anyway and no disrespec christian christian is it brute beast as im sayin the ould bishops son well well bit by bit scarcely listening losing the words sometimes as one loses at intervals the tick of a clock when lying awake at night with a brain distraught ewan gathered up the story of the bad business at the plowing match after he had left the meadow christian och christian one of the men repeated with a bitter laugh of mockery im thinking it would be a middlin little crime to treat a christian like that same as he treated the poor dumb craythurs ewans temples beat furiously and a fearful tumult was rife in his brain one wild thought expelled all other thoughts why had he overheard three such conversations there could be but one answerhe was designed by supernatural powers to be the instrument of a fixed purpose it was irrevocably decidedhe was impelled to the terrible business that was in his mind by an irresistible force to which he was blind and powerless it was so it was so ewan pushed on past the wagon and heard the mens voices die off to an indistinct mumble behind him how hideous were the meditations of the next few minutes the beating of his temple drew the skin hard about the scar above it he thought of his young wife in her grave and of the shock that sent her there he felt afresh the abject degradation of that bitter moment in the library at bishops court when to save the honor of a forger he had lied before god and man then he thought of the gray head of that august old man serenest of saints fondest of fathers the bishop bowed down to the dust with shame and a ruined hope and after his mind had oscillated among these agonizing thoughts there came to him over all else and more hideous than all else the memory of what his own father the deemster had told him an hour ago ewan began to run and as he ran all his blood seemed to rush to his head and a thousand confused and vague forms danced before his eyes all at once he recognized that he was at the mouth of the creek going down the steep gate to the sea that ended in the lockjaw before he was aware he was talking with davy fayle and asking for dan he noticed that his voice would scarcely obey him hes in the crib on the shore sir said davy and the lad turned back to his work he was hammering an old bent nail out of a pitchpine plank that had washed ashore with the last tide after a moment davy stopped and looked after the young parson and shook his head and muttered something to himself then he threw down his hammer and followed slowly ewan went on his impatience was now feverish he was picturing dan as he would find himdrinking smoking laughing one leg thrown over the end of a table his cap awry his face red his eyes bleared and his lips hot it was growing dark the snowcloud was very low overhead the seabirds were screaming down at the waters edge and the seas deep rumble came up from the shingle below and the rocks beyond ewan saw the tent and made for it as he came near to it he slipped and fell regaining his feet he perceived that in the dusk he had tripped over some chips that lay about a block davy had been chopping firewood of the driftwood that the sea had sent up ewan saw the hatchet lying among the loose chips in an instant he had caught it up recognizing in every event of that awful hour the mysterious influence of supernatural powers he read this incident as he had read all the others until then he had thought of nothing but the deed he was to do never for one instant of how he was to do it but now the hatchet was thrust into his hand thus was everything irrevocably decided and now ewan was in front of the tent panting audibly the hatchet in his hand his eyes starting from their sockets the great veins on his forehead hard and black now o god for a moments strength one little moments strength now now the smoke was rising from the gorsecovered roof the little black door was shut inside was dan dan dan and while ewans young wife lay in her grave and ewans sister was worse than in her grave and the good bishop was brought low dan was there there and he was drinking and laughing and his heart was cold and dead ewan lifted the latch and pushed the door open and stepped into the tent lord of grace and mercy what was there on the floor of earth in one corner of the small place a fire of gorse turf and logs burned slowly and near the fire dan lay outstretched on a bed of straw his head pillowed on a coil of old rope one hand twisted under his head the other resting lightly on his breast and he slept peacefully like a child ewan stood for a moment shuddering and dismayed the sight of dan helpless and at his mercy unnerved his arm and drove the fever from his blood there was an awful power in that sleeping man and sleep had wrapped him in its own divinity the hatchet dropped from ewans graspless fingers and he covered his face as a drowning man is said to see all his life pass before him at the moment of death so ewan saw all the past the happy pastthe past of love and of innocence whereof dan was a partrise up before him it is true i am going mad he thought and he fell back on to a bench that stood by the wall then there came an instant of unconsciousness and in that instant he was again by the waters of the jordan and the ewes and the rams and the milch camels were toiling through the long grass and esau was falling on the neck of jacob and they were weeping together chapter xx blind passion and pain dan moved uneasily and presently awoke opened his eyes and saw ewan and betrayed no surprise at his presence there ah is it you ewan he said speaking quietly partly in a shamefaced way and with some confusion do you know ive been dreaming of youyou and mona ewan gave no answer because sleep is a holy thing and the brother of death whose shadow also it is therefore ewans hideous purpose had left him while dan lay asleep at his feet but now that dan was awake the evil passion came again i was dreaming of that mother careys chickenyou remember it when we were lumps of lads you knowwhy you cant have forgotten itthe old thing i caught in its nest just under the head still ewan gave no sign but looked down at dan resting on his elbows dans eyes fell upon ewans face but he went on in a confused way mona couldnt bear to see it caged and would have me put it back dont you remember i clambered up to the nest and put the bird in again you were down on the shore thinking sure i would tumble over the head and monamona dan glanced afresh into ewans face and its look of terror seemed to stupefy him still he made shift to go on with his dream in an abashed sort of way my gough if i didnt dream it all as fresh as fresh and the fight in the air and the screams when i put the old bird in the nestthe young ones had forgotten it clean and they tumbled it out and set on it terrible and drove it awayand then the poor old thing on the rocks sitting by itself as lonesome as lonesomeand little mona crying and crying down below and her long hair ripriprippling in the wind andand dan had got to his feet and then seated himself on a stool as he rambled on with the story of his dream but once again his shifty eyes came back to ewans face and he stopped short my god what is it he cried now ewan standing there with a thousand vague forms floating in his brain had heard little of what dan had said but he had noted his confused manner and had taken this story of the dream as a feeble device to hide the momentary discomfiture what does it mean he said it means that this island is not large enough to hold both you and me what it means that you must go away away yesand at once in the pause that followed after his first cry of amazement dan thought only of the bad business of the killing of the oxen at the plowing match that morning and so in a tone of utter abasement with his face to the ground he went on in a blundering humble way to allow that ewan had reason for his anger im a blind headstrong fool i know thatand my temper iswell its damnable thats the factbut no one suffers from it more than i do and if i could have felled myself after i had felled the oxen why down ewan for the sake of the dear old times when we were good chums you and i and little mona with her quiet eyes god bless her go away and never come back to either of us cried ewan stamping his foot dan paused and there was a painful silence why should i go away he said with an effort at quietness because you are a scoundrelthe basest scoundrel on gods earththe foulest traitorthe blackesthearted monster dans sunburnt face whitened under his tawny skin easy easy man veen easy he said struggling visibly for selfcommand while he interrupted ewans torrent of reproaches you are a disgrace and a byword only the riffraff of the island are your friends and associates thats true enough ewan said dan and his head fell between his hands his elbows resting on his knees what are you doing drinking gambling roistering cheatingyes dan got on his feet uneasily and took a step to and fro about the little place then sat again and buried his head in his hands as before ive been a reckless selfwilled mad fool ewan but no worse than that and if you could see me as god sees me and know how i suffer for my follies and curse them for all i seem to make so light of them and how i am driven to them one on the head of another perhapsperhapsperhapsyou would have pityay pity pity pity for you you who have brought your father to shame he is the ruin of the man he was you have impoverished him you have spent his substance and wasted it ay and you have made his gray head a mark for reproach set your own house in orderthats what the world says to the man of god whose son is a child of the stop cried dan he had leapt to his feet his fist clenched his knuckles showing like nuts of steel but ewan went on standing there with a face that was ashy white above his black coat your heart is as dead as your honor and that is not all but you must outrage the honor of another now when ewan said this dan thought of his forged signature and of the censure and suspension to which ewan was thereby made liable go away ewan cried again motioning dan off with his trembling hand dan lifted his eyes and what if i refuse he said in a resolute way then take the consequences you mean the consequences of thatthatthat forgery at this ewan realized the thought in dans mind and perceived that dan conceived him capable of playing upon his fears by holding over his head the penalty of an offense which he had already taken upon himself god in heaven he thought and this is the pitiful creature whom i have all these years taken to my heart is that what your loyalty comes to said dan and his lip curled loyalty cried ewan in white wrath loyalty and you talk to me of loyaltyyou who have outraged the honor of my sister mona i have said it at last though the word blisters my tongue go away from the island forever and let me never see your face again dan rose to his feet with rigid limbs he looked about him for a moment in a dazed silence and put his hand to his forehead as if he had lost himself do you believe that he said in a slow whisper dont deny itdont let me know you for a liar as well ewan said eagerly and then added in another tone i have had her own confession her confession yes and the witness of another the witness of another dan echoed ewans words in a vague halfconscious way then in a torrent of hot words that seemed to blister and sting the man who spoke them no less than the man who heard them ewan told all and dan listened like one in a stupor there was silence and then ewan spoke again in a tone of agony dan there was a time when in spite of yourself i loved youyes though im ashamed to say it for it was against gods own leading still i loved you dan but let us part forever now and each go his own way and perhaps though we can never forget the wrong that you have done us we may yet think more kindly of you and time may help us to forgive but dan had awakened from his stupor and he flung aside damn your forgiveness he said hotly and then with teeth set and lips drawn hard and eyes aflame he turned upon ewan and strode up to him and they stood together face to face you said just now that there was not room enough in the island for you and me he said in a hushed whisper you were right but i shall mend your words if you believe what you have saidby heaven ill not deny it for youthere is not room enough for both of us in the world it was my own thought said ewan and then for an instant each looked into the others eyes and read the others purpose the horror of that moment of silence was broken by the lifting of the latch davy fayle came shambling into the tent on some pretended errand he took off his militia belt with the dagger in the sheath attached to it and hung it on a long rusty nail driven into an upright timber at one corner then he picked up from among some ling on the floor a waterproof coat and put it on he was going out with furtive glances at dan and ewan who said not a word in his presence and were bearing themselves toward each other with a painful constraint when his glance fell on the hatchet which lay a few feet from the door davy picked it up and carried it out muttering to himself strange strange uncommon hardly had the boy dropped the latch of the door from without than ewan took the militia belt from the nail and buckled it about his waist dan understood his thought he was still wearing his own militia belt and dagger there was now not an instants paltering between themnot a word of explanation we must get rid of the lad said dan ewan bowed his head it had come to him to reflect that when all was over mona might hear of what had been done what they had to do was to be done for her honor or for what seemed to be her honor in that blind tangle of passion and circumstance but none the less though she loved both of them now would she loathe that one who returned to her with the blood of the other upon him she must never know he said send the boy away then we must go to where this work can be done between you and me alone dan had followed his thought in silence and was stepping toward the door to call to davy when the lad came back carrying a log of driftwood for the fire there were some small flakes of snow on his waterproof coat go up to the shambles davy said dan speaking with an effort at composure and tell jemmy curghey to keep me the oxhorns davy looked up in a vacant way and his lip lagged low aw and didnt you tell jemmy yourself and terrible particlar too do you say so davy sarten sure then just slip away and fetch them davy fixed the log on the fire tapped it into the flame glanced anxiously at dan and ewan and then in a lingering way went out his simple face looked sad under its vacant expression the men listened while the lads footsteps could be heard on the shingle above the deep murmur of the sea then dan stepped to the door and threw it open now he said it was rapidly growing dark the wind blew strongly into the shed dan stepped out and ewan followed him they walked in silence through the gully that led from the creek to the cliff head the snow that had begun to fall was swirled about in the wind that came from over the sea and spinning in the air it sometimes beat against their faces ewan went along like a man condemned to death he had begun to doubt though he did not know it and would have shut his mind to the idea if it had occurred to him but once when dan seemed to stop as if only half resolved and partly turn his face toward him ewan mistook his intention he is going to tell me that there is some hideous error he thought he was burning for that word but no dan went plodding on again and never after shifted his steadfast gaze never spoke and gave no sign at length he stopped and ewan stopped with him they were standing on the summit of orris head it was a sad a lonesome and a desolate place in sight of a wide waste of common land without a house and with never a tree rising above the purple gorse and tussocks of long grass the sky hung very low over it the steep red cliffs with their patches of green in ledges swept down from it to the shingle and the sharp shelves of slate covered with seaweed the ground swell came up from below with a very mournful noise but the air seemed to be empty and every beat of the foot on the soft turf sounded near and large above their heads the seafowl kept up a wild clamor and far out where sea and sky seemed to meet in the gathering darkness the seas steady blow on the bare rocks of the naze sent up a deep hoarse boom dan unbuckled his belt and threw off his coat and vest ewan did the same and they stood there face to face in the thin flakes of snow dan in his red shirt ewan in his white shirt open at the neck these two men whose souls had been knit together as the soul of jonathan was knit to the soul of david and each ready to lift his hand against his hearts best brother then all at once a startled cry came from near at hand it was davy fayles voice the lad had not gone to the shambles realizing in some vague way that the errand was a subterfuge and that mischief was about he had hidden himself at a little distance and had seen when dan and ewan came out of the tent together creeping through the ling and partly hidden by the dusk he had followed the men until they had stopped on the head then davy had dropped to his knees his ideas were obscure he scarcely knew what was going on before his eyes but he held his breath and watched and listened at length when the men threw off their clothes the truth dawned on davy and though he tried to smother an exclamation a cry of terror burst from his husky throat dan and ewan exchanged glances and each seemed in one moment to read the others thoughts in another instant at three quick strides dan had taken davy by the shoulders promise he said that you will never tell what you have seen davy struggled to free himself but his frantic efforts were useless in dans grip he was held as in a vice let me go mastha dan the lad cried promise to hold your tongue said dan promise it promise it let me go will you let me go the lad shouted sullenly be quiet said dan i wont be quiet was the stubborn answer help help help and the lad screamed lustily hold your tongue or by g dan held davy by one of his great hands hitched into the lads guernsey and he lifted the other hand threateningly help help help davy screamed still louder and struggled yet more fiercely until his strength was spent and his breath was gone and then there was a moments silence the desolate place was still as desolate as before not a sign of life around not an answering cry theres nobody to help you said dan you have got to promise never to tell what you have seen to man woman or child i wont promise and i wont hould my tongue said the lad stoutly you are goin to fight you and mastha ewan and dan stopped him hearken here if you are to live another hour you will promise but davy had regained both strength and voice i dont carehelp help help he shouted dan put his hand over the lads mouth and dragged him to the cliff head below was the brant steep dark and jagged and quivering in the deepening gloom and the seabirds were darting through the midair like bats in the dark look said dan youve got to swear never to tell what you have seen tonight so help you god the lad held tightly by the breast and throat and gripping the arms that held him with fingers that clung like claws took one horrified glance down into the darkness he struggled no longer his face was very pitiful to see i can not promise he said in a voice like a cry at that answer dan drew davy back from the cliff edge and loosed his hold of him he was abashed and ashamed he felt himself a little man by the side of this halfdaft fisherlad all this time ewan had stood aside looking on while dan demanded the promise and saying nothing now he went up to davy and said in a quiet voice davy if you should ever tell any one what you have seen dan will be a lost man all his life hereafter then let him pitch me over the cliff said davy in a smothered cry listen to me davy ewan went on youre a brave lad and i know whats in your head but then what for do you want to fight him davy broke out the lads throat was dry and husky and his eyes were growing dim ewan paused half his passion was spent davys poor dense head had found him a question that he could not answer davy if you dont promise you will ruin danyes it will be you who will ruin him you remember that he will be a lost man and my sister my good sister mona she will be a brokenhearted woman then davy broke down utterly and big tears filled his eyes and ran down his cheeks i promise he sobbed good ladnow go davy turned about and went away at first running and then dragging slowly then running again and then again lingering what followed was a very pitiful conflict of emotion nature who looks down pitilessly on man and his big little passions that clamor so loud but never touch her at alleven nature played her part in this tragedy when davy fayle was gone dan and ewan stood face to face as before dan with his back to the cliff ewan with his face to the sea then without a word each turned aside and picked up his militia belt the snowflakes had thickened during the last few moments but now they seemed to cease and the sky to lighten suddenly in the west the sky was cloven as though by the sweep of a sword and under a black bar of cloud and above a silvered waterline the sun came through very red and hazy in its setting and with its ragged streamers around it ewan was buckling the belt about his waist when the setting sun rose upon them and all at once there came to him the scripture that says let not the sun go down on your wrath if gods hand had appeared in the heavens the effect on ewan could not have been greater already his passion was more than half gone and now it melted entirely away dan he cried and his voice was a sob dan i can not fightright or wrong i can not and he flung himself down and the tears filled his eyes then dan whose face was afire laughed loud and bitterly coward he said coward and poltroon at that word all the evil passion came back to ewan and he leapt to his feet that is enough he said the beltsbuckle them together dan understood ewans purpose at the next breath the belt about dans waist was buckled to the belt about the waist of ewan and the two men stood strapped together then they drew the daggers and an awful struggle followed with breast to breast until their flesh all but touched and with thighs entwined they reeled and swayed the right hand of each held up for thrust the left for guard and parry what dan gained in strength ewan made up in rage and the fight was fierce and terrible dan still with his back to the cliff ewan still with his face to the sea at one instant dan by his great stature had reached over ewans shoulder to thrust from behind and at the next instant ewan had wrenched his lithe body backward and had taken the blow in his lifted arm which forthwith spouted blood above the wrist in that encounter they reeled about changing places and ewans back was henceforward toward the cliff and dan fought with his face toward the sea it was a hideous and savage fight the sun had gone down the cleft in the heavens had closed again once more the thin flakes of snow were falling and the world had dropped back to its dark mood a stormy petrel came up from the cliff and swirled above the men as they fought and made its direful scream over them up and down to and fro embracing closely clutching guarding and meantime panting hoarsely and drawing hard breath the two men fought in their deadly hate at last they had backed and swayed to within three yards of the cliff and then ewan with the gasp of a drowning man flung his weapon into the air and dan ripped his daggers edge across the belts that bound them together and at the next breath the belts were cut and the two were divided and ewan separated from dan and leaning heavily backward was reeling by force of his own weight toward the cliff then dan stood as one transfixed with uplifted hand and a deep groan came from his throat passion and pain were gone from him in that awful moment and the world itself seemed to be blotted out when he came to himself he was standing on the cliff head alone the clock in the old church was striking how the bell echoed on that lonely height onetwothreefourfive five oclock everything else was silent as death the day was gone the snow began to fall in thick large flakes it fell heavily on dans hot cheeks and bare neck his heart seemed to stand still and the very silence itself was awful his terror stupefied him what have i done he asked himself he could not think he covered his eyes with his hands and strode up and down the cliff head up and down up and down then in a bewildered state of semiconsciousness he looked out to sea and there far off a league away he saw a black thing looming large against the darkening sky he recognized that it was a sail and then perceived that it was a lugger and quite mechanically he tried to divide the mainmast and mizzen the mainsail and yawlsail and to note if the boat were fetching to leeward or beating down the channel all at once sea and sky were blotted out and he could not stand on his legs but dropped to his knees and great beads of perspiration rolled down his face and neck he tried to call ewan ewan but he could not utter the least cry his throat was parched his tongue swelled and filled his mouth his lips moved but no words came from him then he rose to his feet and the world flowed back upon him the seafowl crying over his head the shrillness of the wind in the snowcapped gorse and the seas hoarse voice swelling upward through the air while its heavy monotonous blow on the beach shook the earth beneath him if anything else had appeared to dan at that moment he must have screamed with terror quaking in every limb he picked up his clothes and turned back toward the shore he was so feeble that he could scarcely walk through the snow that now lay thick on the short grass when he reached the mouth of the gully he did not turn into the shed but went on over the pebbles of the creek his bloodshot eyes which almost started from their sockets glanced eagerly from side to side at last he saw the thing he sought and now that it was under him within reach of his hand he dare hardly look upon it at the foot of a jagged crag that hung heavily over from the cliff the body of ewan mylrea lay dead and cold there was no mark of violence upon it save a gash on the wrist of the left hand and over the wound there was a clot of blood the white face lay deep in the breast as if the neck had been dislocated there were no other outward marks of injury from the fall the body was outstretched on its back with one armthe left armlying half over the forehead and the other the right arm with the hand open and the listless fingers apart thrown loosely aside dan knelt beside the body and his heart was benumbed like ice he tried to pray but no prayer would come and he could not weep ewan ewan he cried at length and his voice of agony rolled round the corpse like the soughing of the wind ewan ewan he cried again but only the seas voice broke the silence that followed then his head fell on the cold breast and his arms covered the lifeless body and he cried upon god to have mercy on him and to lift up his hand against him and cut him off presently he got on his feet and scarcely knowing what he was doing he lifted the body in his arms with the head lying backward on his shoulder and the white face looking up in its stony stare to the darkening heavens as he did so his eyes were raised to the cliff and there clearly outlined over the black crags and against the somewhat lighter sky he saw the figure of a man he toiled along toward the shed he was so weak that he could scarce keep on his legs and when he reached the little place at the mouth of the creek he was more dead than alive he put the body to lie on the bed of straw on which he had himself slept and dreamed an hour before then all at once he felt a low sort of cunning coming over him and he went back to the door and shut it and drew the long wooden bolt into its iron hoop on the jamb he had hardly done so when he heard an impatient footstep on the shingle outside in another instant the latch was lifted and the door pushed heavily then there was a knock dan made no answer but stood very still and held his breath there was another knock and another then in a low tremulous murmur there came the words where is he god amighty where is he it was davy fayle another knock louder and still no reply mastha dan mastha dan theyre coming mastha dan god amighty davy was now tramping restlessly to and fro dan was trying to consider what it was best to do whether to open to davy and hear what he had to say or to carry it off as if he were not within when another foot sounded on the shingle and cut short his meditations have you seen mr ewanparson ewan dan recognized the voice it was the voice of jarvis kerruish davy did not answer immediately have you seen him eh no sir davy faltered then why didnt you say so at once it is very strange the people said he was walking toward the creek theres no way out in this direction is there way outthis direction yes sir davy stammered how show me the way by the sea sir the sea simpleton what are you doing here waiting for the boat sir what shed is this dan could hear that at this question davy was in a fever of excitement only a place for bits of net and cable and all to that said davy eagerly dan could feel that jarvis had stepped up to the shed and that he was trying to look in through the little window do you keep a fire to warm your nets and cables he asked in a suspicious tone at the next moment he was trying to force the door dan stood behind the bolt creaked in the hasp if the hasp should give way he and jarvis would stand face to face strangetheres something strange about all this said the man outside i heard a scream as i came over the head did you hear anything i tell you i heard nothing said davy sullenly dan grew dizzy and groping for something to cling to his hand scraped across the door wait i could have sworn i heard something move inside who keeps the key of this shed kay theres never a kay at the like of it then how is it fastened from within waitlet me see there was a sound like the brushing of a hand over the outside face of the door has the snow stopped up the keyhole or is there no such thing or is the door fastened by a padlock dan had regained his selfpossession by this time he felt an impulse to throw the door open he groped at his waist for the dagger but belt and dagger were both gone all this is very strange said jarvis and then he seemed to turn from the door and move away stop where is the man danthe captain he asked from a little distance i dunno said davy stoutly thats a lie my lad then the mans footsteps went off in dull beats on the snowclotted pebbles after a moments silence there was a soft knocking davy had crept up to the door mastha dan he whispered amid panting breath dan did not stir the latch was lifted in vain mastha dan mastha dan the soft knocking continued dan found his voice at last go away davygo away he said hoarsely there was a short pause and then there came from without an answer like a sob im going mastha dan after that all was silent as death half an hour later dan mylrea was walking through the darkness toward ballamona in his blind misery he was going to mona the snow was not falling now and in the lift of the storm the sky was lighter than it had been as dan passed the old church he could just descry the clock the snow lay thick on the face and clogged the hands the clock had stopped it stood at five exactly the blind leading that is here of passion by accident is everywhere that great tragedies are done it is not the evil in mans heart more than the deep perfidy of circumstance that brings him to crime chapter xxi the voice in the night however bleak the night however dark the mood of the world might be there was a room in ballamona that was bright with one beautiful human flower in bloom mona was theremona of the quiet eyes and the silent ways and the little elfish head it was christmas eve with her as with other people and she was dressing the house in hibbin and hollin from a great mountain of both that hommybeg had piled up in the hall she was looking very smart and happy that night in her short body of homespun turned in from neck to waist showing a white habitshirt and a white handkercheif crossed upon it a quilted overskirt and linen apron that did not fall so low as to hide the openwork stockings and the sandalshoes her room too was bright and sweet with its glowing fire of peat and logs on the wide hearth its lamp on the square oak table and the oak settle drawn up between them in one corner of the settle bubbling and babbling and spluttering and cooing amid a very crater of red baize cushions was monas fosterchild ewans motherless daughter lying on her back and fighting the air with clinched fists while mona picked out the hibbin from the hollin dissected both made arches and crosses and crowns and rosettes and then sprinkled flour to resemble snow on the red berries and the green leaves she sung an old manx ballad in snatches or prattled to the little one in that halfarticulate tongue that comes with the instinct of motherhood to every good woman that god ever makes i rede ye beware of the carrasdoo men as ye come up the wold i rede ye beware of the haunted glen but a fretful whimper would interrupt the singer hush hush ailee darlinghush the whimper would be hushed and again there would be a snatch of the ballad in jorby curragh they dwell alone by dark peat bogs where the willows moan down in a gloomy and lonely glen once again the whimper would stop the song hush darling papa is coming to ailee yes and ailee will see papa yes and papa will see ailee yes and ailee then a long low gurgle a lovely head leaning over the back of the settle and dropping to the middle of the pillow like a lark to its nest in the grass a long liquid kiss on the soft round baby legs and then a perfect fit of baby laughter it was as pretty a picture as the world had in it on that bleak christmas eve whatever tumult might reign without there within was a nest of peace mona was expecting ewan at ballamona that night and now she was waiting for his coming it was true that when he was there three hours ago it was in something like anger that they had parted but mona recked nothing of that she knew ewans impetuous temper no better than his conciliatory spirit he would come tonight as he had promised yesterday and if there had been anger between them it would then be gone twenty times she glanced at the little clock with the lion face and the pendulum like a dogs head that swung above the ingle many a time with head aslant with parted lips and eyes alight she cried hark to the little one when a footstep would sound in the hall but ewan did not come and meantime the child grew more and more fretful as her bedtime approached at length mona undressed her and carried her off to her crib in the room adjoining and sang softly to her while she struggled hard with sleep under the oak hood with the ugly beasts carved on it until sleep had conquered and all was silence and peace then leaving a tallow dip burning on the table between the crib and the bed lest perchance the little one should awake and cry from fear of the darkness mona went back to her sittingroom to finish off the last bunch of the hibbin and hollin the last bunch was a bit of prickly green with a cluster of the reddest berries and mona hung it over a portrait of her brother which was painted by a great artist from england when ewan was a child the deemster had turned the portrait out of the diningroom after the painful interview at bishops court about the loan and surety and mona had found it face to the wall in a lumberroom she looked at it now with a new interest when she hung the hollin over it she recognized for the first time a resemblance to the little aileen whom she had just put to bed how strange it seemed that ewan had once been a child like aileen then she began to feel that ewan was late in coming and to make conjectures as to the cause of his delay her fathers house was fast becoming a cheerless place to her more than ever the deemster was lost to her jarvis kerruish her strangerbrother was her fathers companion and this seemed to draw her closer to ewan for solace and cheer then she sat on the settle to thread some loose berries that had fallen and to think of danthe highspirited reckless rollicking headstrong tenderhearted thoughtless brave stubborn daring dear dear dandan who was very very much to her in her great loneliness let other people rail at dan if they would he was wrapped up with too many of her fondest memories to allow of disloyalty like that dan would yet justify her belief in him oh yes he would yet be a great man all the world would say it was so and she would be very proud that he was her cousinyes her cousin or perhaps perhaps and then without quite daring to follow up that delicious train of thought even in her secret heart though none might look there and say if it was unmaidenly mona came back to the old manx ballad and sang to herself another verse of it who has not heard of adair the youth who does not know that his soul was truth woe is me how smoothly they speak and adair was brave and a man but weak all at once her hand went up to her forehead and the words of the old song seemed to have a new significance hardly had her voice stopped and her last soft note ceased to ring in the quiet room when she thought she heard her own name called twicemona mona the voice was ewans voice and it seemed to come from her bedroom she rose from the settle and went into her room there was no one there save the child the little one was disturbed in her sleep at the moment and was twisting restlessly making a faint cry it was very strange the voice had been ewans voice and it had been deep and tremulous as the voice of one in trouble presently the child settled itself to sleep all was silent as before and mona went back to the sittingroom scarcely was she seated afresh when she heard the voice again and it again called her twice by name mona mona in the same tremulous tone but very clear and distinct then tremblingly mona rose once more and went into her room for thence the voice seemed to come no one was there the candle burned fitfully and suddenly the child cried in its sleepthat strange nightcry that freezes the blood of one who is awake to hear it it was very very strange feeling faint hardly able to keep on her feet mona went back to the sittingroom and opened the door that led into the hall no one seemed to be stirring the door of her fathers study opposite was closed and there was talkingthe animated talking of two personswithin mona turned back closed her door quietly and then summoning all her courage she walked to the window and drew the heavy curtains aside the hoops from which they hung rattled noisily over the pole putting her face close to the glass and shading her eyes from the light of the lamp behind her she looked out she saw that the snow had fallen since the lamp had been lit at dusk there was snow on the ground and thin snow on the leafless boughs of the trees she could see nothing else she even pushed up the sash and called who is there but there came no answer the wind moaned about the house and the sea rumbled in the distance she pulled the sash down again then leaving the curtain back she turned again into the room and partly to divert her mind from the mysterious apprehensions that had seized it she sat down at the little harpsichord that stood on the farther side of the ingle against the wall that ran at right angles from the window at first her fingers ran nervously over the keys but they gained force as she went on and the volume of sound seemed to dissipate her fears it is nothing she thought i have been troubled about what ewan said today and im nervousthat is all and as she played her eyes looked not at the fingerboard but across her shoulder toward the bare window then suddenly there came to her a sensation that made her flesh creep it was as if from the darkness outside there were eyes which she could not see looking steadily in upon her where she sat her blood rushed to her head she felt dizzy the playing ceased and she clung by one hand to the candlerest of the harpsichord then once more she distinctly heard the same deep tremulous voice call her by her namemona mona faint and all but reeling she rose again and again made her way to the bedroom as before the child was restless in her sleep it seemed as if all the air were charged mona had almost fallen from fright when all at once she heard a sound that she could not mistake and instantly she recovered some selfpossession it was the sound of the window of her sittingroom being thrown open from without she ran back and saw dan mylrea climbing into the room dan she cried mona did you call when nowa little while ago no a great trembling shook dans whole frame mona perceived it and a sensation of disaster not yet attained to the clearness of an idea took hold of her where is ewan she said he tried to avoid her gaze why do you ask for him said dan in a faltering voice where is he she asked again he grew dizzy and laid hold of the settle for support the question she asked was that which he had come to answer but his tongue clave to his mouth very pale and almost rigid from the heaviness of a great fear which she felt but could not understand she watched him when he reeled like a drunken man he has called me three times where is he he was to be here tonight she said ewan will not come tonight he answered scarcely audibly not tonight mona or tomorrowor everno he will never come again the horrible apprehension that had taken hold of her leaped to the significance of his words and almost before he had spoken a cry burst from her ewan is deadhe is dead mona our ewan he is dead he faltered she dropped to the settle and cried in the excess of her first despair ewan ewan to think that i shall see him no more and then she wept all the time dan stood over her leaning heavily to bear himself up trembling visibly and with a look of great agony fixed upon her as if he had not the strength to turn his eyes away yes yes our ewan is dead he repeated in a murmur that came up from his heart the truest friend the fondest brother the whitest soul the dearest bravest purest noblesto god o god dead dead worse a hundredfold worsemona he is murdered at that she raised herself up and a bewildered look was in her eyes murdered no that is not possible he was beloved by all there is no one who would kill himthere is no one alive with a heart so black yes mona but there is he said there is one man with a heart so black who is he who he is the foulest creature on gods earth oh god in heaven why was he born who is he he bowed his head where he stood before her and beads of sweat started from his brow cursed be the hour when that man was born he said in an awful whisper then monas despair came upon her like a torrent and she wept long in the bitterness of her heart she cried cursed indeed cursed forever dan dan you must kill himyou must kill that man but at the sound of that word from her own lips the spirit of revenge left her on the instant and she cried no no not that then she went down on her knees and made a short and piteous prayer for forgiveness for her thought o father she prayed forgive me i did not know what i said but ewan is dead o father our dear ewan is murdered some blackhearted man has killed him vengeance is thine yes i know that o father forgive me but to think that ewan is gone forever and that base soul lives on vengeance is thine but o father let thy vengeance fall upon him if it is thy will let thy hand be on him follow him father follow him with thy vengeance she had flung herself on her knees by the settle her upturned eyes wide open and her two trembling hands held above her head dan stood beside her and as she prayed a deep groan came up from his heart his breast swelled and his throat seemed to choke at last he clutched her by the shoulders and interrupted her prayer and cried mona mona what are you sayingwhat are you saying stop stop she rose to her feet i have done wrong she said more quietly he is in gods hands yes it is for god to punish him then dan said in a heartrending voice mona he did not mean to kill ewanthey foughtit was all in the heat of blood once more he tried to avoid her gaze and once more pale and immovable she watched his face who is he she asked with an awful calmness mona turn your face away from me and i will tell you he said then everything swam about her and her pale lips grew ashy dont you know he asked in a whisper she did not turn her face and he was compelled to look at her now his glaring eyes were fixed upon her dont you know he whispered again and then in a scarcely audible voice he said it was i mona at that she grew cold with horror her features became changed beyond recognition she recoiled from him stretched her trembling hands before her as if to keep him off oh horror do not touch me she cried faintly through the breath that came so hard do not spare me mona he said in a great sob do not spare me you do right not to spare me i have stained my hands with your blood then she sank to the settle and held her head while he stood by her and told her allall the bitter blundering truthand bit by bit she grasped the tangled tale and realized the blind passion and pain that had brought them to such a pass and saw her own unwitting share in it and he on his part saw the product of his headstrong wrath and the pitiful grounds for it so small and so absurd as such grounds oftenest are and together these shipwrecked voyagers on the waters of life sat and wept and wondered what evil could be in hell itself if man in his blindness could find the world so full of it and dan cursed himself and said oh the madness of thinking that if either were gone the other could ever again know one hours happiness with you mona ay though the crime lay hidden yet would it wither and blast every hour and now behold at the first moment i am bringing my burden of sin too heavy for myself to you i am a cowardyes i am a coward you will turn your back upon me mona and then i shall be alone she looked at him with infinite compassion and her heart surged within her as she listened to his voice of great agony ah me and i asked god to curse you she said oh how wicked that prayer was will god hear it merciful father do not hear it i did not know what i said i am a blind ignorant creature but thou seest and knowest best pity him and forgive him oh no god will not hear my wicked prayer thus in fitful outbursts she talked and prayed it was as if a tempest had torn up every tie of her soul dan listened and he looked at her with swimming eyes and do you pray for me mona he said who will pray for you if i do not in all the world there will not be one left to speak kindly of you if i speak ill oh dan it will become known and every one will be against you and can you think well of him who killed your brother but you are in such sorrow you are so miserable then dans great frame shook wofully and he cried in his painmercy mercy have mercy what have i lost what love have i lost at that monas weeping ceased she looked at dan through her lashes still wet and said in another tone dan do not think me unmaidenly if you had done well if you had realized my hopes of you if you had grown to be the good and great man i longed to see you then though i might have yearned for you i would rather have died with my secret than speak of it but now now that all this is not so now that it is a lost faith now that by gods will you are to be abased before the whole worldoh do not think me unmaidenly now i tell you dan that i love you and have always loved you mona he cried in a low passionate tone and took one step toward her and held out his hands there was an unspeakable language in her face yes and that where you go i must go also though it were to disgrace and shame she had turned toward him lovingly yearningly with heaving breast with a great cry he flung his arms about her and the world of pain and sorrow was for that instant blotted out but all the bitter flood came rushing back upon them he put her from him with a strong shudder we are clasping hands over a tomb mona our love is known too late we are mariners cast on a rock within a cables length of harbor but cut off from it by a cruel sea that may never be passed we are hopeless within sight of hope our love is known in vain it is a vision of what might have been in the days that are lost forever we can never clasp hands for o god a cold hand is between us and lies in the hand of both then again she fell to weeping but suddenly she arose as if struck by a sudden idea you will be taken she said how can i have forgotten it so long you must fly from the island you must get away tonight tomorrow all will be discovered i will not leave the island said dan firmly can you drive me from you he said with a suppliant look yes you do well to drive me away my love i do not drive you from me i would have you here forever but you will be taken quick the world is wide there is no world for me save here mona to go from you now is to go forever and i would rather die by my own hand than face such banishment no no not that never never that that would imperil your soul and then we should be divided forever it is so already mona said dan with solemnity we are divided foreveras the blessed are divided from the damned dont say that dont say that yes mona he said with a fearful calmness we have thought of my crime as against ewan as against you myself the world and its law but it is a crime against god also and surely it is the unpardonable sin dont say that dan there is one great anchor of hope what is that mona ewan is with god at this moment while we stand here together ewan sees god ah dan dropped to his knees with awe at that thought and drew off the cap which he had worn until then and bent his head yes he died in anger and in strife said mona but god is merciful he knows the feebleness of his creatures and has pity yes our dear ewan is with god now he knows what you suffer my poor dan and he is taking blame to himself and pleading for you no no i did it all mona he would not have fought he would have made peace at the last but i drove him on i can not fight dan he said i can see him saying it and the sun was setting no it was not fight it was murder and god will punish me my poor girl death is my just punishmenteverlasting death wait i know what is to be done what mona you must make atonement how you must give yourself up to justice and take the punishment of the law and so you will be redeemed and god will forgive you he listened and then said and such is to be the end of our love mona born in the hour of its death you even you give me up to justice dont say that you will be redeemed by atonement when ewan was killed it was woe enough but that you are under gods wrath is worse than if we were all all slain then we must bid farewell the penalty of my crime is death no no not that i must die mona this then is to be our last parting and even if so it is best you must make your peace with god and you my last refuge even you send me to my death well it is right it is just it is well farewell my poor girl this is a sad parting farewell you will remember me mona remember you when the tears i shed for ewan are dry i shall still weep for you there was a faint cry at that moment hush said mona and she lifted one hand it is the child she added come look at it she turned and walked toward the bedroom dan followed her with drooping head the little one had again been restless in her sleep but now with a long breath she settled herself in sweet repose at sight of the child the great trembling shook dans frame again mona mona why did you bring me here he said the sense of his crime came with a yet keener agony when he looked down at the childs unconscious face the thought flashed upon him that he had made this innocent babe fatherless and that all the unprotected years were before her wherein she must realize her loss he fell to his knees beside the cot and his tears rained down upon it mona had lifted the candle from the table and she held it above the kneeling man and the sleeping child it was the blind womans vision realized when dan rose to his feet he was a stronger man mona he said resolutely you are right this sin must be wiped out she had put down the candle and was now trying to take his hand dont touch me he said dont touch me he returned to the other room and threw open the window his face was turned toward the distant sea whose low moan came up through the dark night dan she murmured do you think we shall meet again perhaps we are speaking for the last time mona he answered oh my heart will break she said dan she murmured again and tried to grasp his hand dont touch me not until laternot untiluntil then their eyes met the longing yearning look in hers answered to the wild light in his she felt as if this were the last she was ever to see of dan in this weary world he loved her with all his great broken bleeding heart he had sinned for her sake she caught both his hands with a passionate grasp her lips quivered and the brave fearless stainless girl put her quivering lips to his to dan that touch was as fire with a passionate cry he flung his arms about her for an instant her head lay on his breast now go she whispered and broke from his embrace dan tore himself away with heart and brain aflame were they ever to meet again yes at one great moment they were yet to stand face to face the night was dark but dan felt the darkness not at all for the night was heavier within him he went down toward the creek tomorrow he would give himself up to the deemster but tonight was for himselfhimself and it he went by the church a noisy company were just then trooping out of the porch into the churchyard there they gathered in little knots lit lanterns laughed and drank healths from bottles that were brought out of their pockets it was the breaking up of the oiel verree chapter xxii alone aloneall all alone when dan got down to the creek the little shed was full of the fisherfellows there were quilleash teare crennell and the lad davy the men wore their oilskins as if they had just stepped out of the dingey on the beach and on the floor were three baskets of cod and ray as if they had just set them down the fire of gorse was crackling on the hearth and davy sat beside it looking pale and ill he had watched dan away from the shed and then trembling with fear but girding up his young heart to conquer it he had crept back and kept guard by the body i couldnt give myself liberty to lave it he said half fearfully lifting his eyes to dans as dan entered then the men who in the first moment of horror had asked davy fifty questions and got never an answer to any of them seemed to understand everything at once they made way for dan and he strode through them and looked down at the body for it was still lying where he had left it he said not a word when the men had time to comprehend in its awful fulness what had occurred they stood together and whispered cast side looks at dan and then long searching looks at the body the certainty that ewan was dead did not at first take hold of them there was no mark of violence on the body except the wound above the wrist and suddenly while the men stood and looked down the wound bled afresh then old quilleash who was reputed to possess a charm to stop blood knelt beside ewan and while all looked on and none spoke he whispered his spell in the deaf ear a few good words can do no harm said crennell the cook who was a quaker old quilleash whispered again in the dead ear and then he made a wild command to the blood to cease flowing in the name of the three godly men who came to romechrist peter and paul there was a minute of silence and the blood seemed to stop the men trembled davy the lad grew more pale than before and dan stood as if in a stupor looking down and seeing all yet seeing nothing then the old man lifted his tawny face cha marroo as clagh he said in another hoarse whisper he is dead as a stone there was a deep groan from the throats of the men they dropped aside and awe fell upon them none of them spoke to dan and none questioned the lad again but all seemed to understand everything in some vague way billy quilleash sat on a block of a treetrunk that stood at one side and there was silence for a space then the old man turned his face to his mates and said im for a man sticking up for a frien i am at that there was an uneasy movement among the others aw yes though a man should stick to his frien he should alow or aloft up or down continued billy and after some twisting and muttering among the other fisherfellows he went on you have to summer and winter a man before you know him and lave it to us to know mastha dan weve shared meat shared work with him and d me sowl nothing will hould me but ill stand up for him now sink or swim then one of the fellows said ay and another said ay and a thirdit was crennellsaid a friend in need was more preciouser nor goold and then old billy half twisted his head toward dan but never once lifted his eyes to dans face and speaking at him but not to him said they were rough chaps maybe and couldnt put out no talk at all never being used of it but if there was somethin wrong as was plain to see and keepin a quiet tongue in your head was the way it was goin and buckin up for them as was afther buckin up for his chums why a frien was a frien and they meant to stand by it at that these rough seadogs with the big hearts in their broad breasts took hold of each others hard hands in a circle about the body of ewan whose white face looked up at them in its stony stare and there in the little lonely shed by the sea they made their mutual pledge all that time dan had stood and looked on in silence and davy sitting by the spluttering fire sobbed audibly while uncle billy spoke we must put it away said old billy in a low tone with his eyes on the body ay said ned teare whats oclock a piece past twelve halfflood it will be near the turn of the ebb at three said quilleash not another word of explanation was needed all understanding that they must take the body of ewan out to sea and bury it there after three oclock next morning so that if it stirred after it was sent down to its long home it must be swept away over the channel heise said one as he put his hand down to lift the body shoo dan himself stepped aside to let them pass out he had watched their movements with wide eyes they went by him without a word when they were gone he followed them mechanically scarcely knowing what he did davy went after him the fishermen stepped out into the night in silence they carried the body of ewan to the dingey that lay on the beach all got into the boat and pushed off it was very dark now but soon they came athwart the hawse of the benmychree which was lying at anchor below lowwater they pulled up lifted the body over the gunwale and followed it into the fishingboat theres a good taste of a breeze said old quilleash in five minutes more they were standing out to sea with their dread freight of horror and crime they had put the body to lie by the hatchways and again and again they turned their heads toward it in the darkness it was as though it might even yet stand up in their midst and any man at any moment might find it face to face with him eye to eye the wind was fresh outside it was on their larboard quarter as they made in long tacks for the north when they were well away the men gathered about the cockpit and began to mourn over ewan and to recount their memories concerning him well the young pazons cruise is up and a rael good man anyway aw yes theres odds of pazons but the like of him isnt in poor pazon ewan said quilleash i remember him since he was a wee skute in his mothers armsand a fine lady too and him that quiet but thinking a dale maybe with his head a piece to starboard and his eyes fixed like a figurehead but more natheral and tender uncommon and game too aw dear you should a seen him buck up to young dan at whiles game a hot temper at him for all and i wouldnt trust but its been the death of him well man lave it at that lave it man which of us doesnt lie ever in a bit of a breeze aither to port or starboard god wont be hard on him for the temper no no godll never be hard on a warm heart because it keeps company with a hot head aw but the tender he was said crennell the quaker and the voice like an urgan when its like a flute soft and low and all atremblin dye mind the day ould betty kelly lost her little gel by the faver the one with the slander little stalk of a body and the head like a flower and the eyes like a pair of bumbees playing in it you mind her the millish well young pazon ewan up and went to balligbeg immadietly and ould betty scraming and crying morthal and shed die so she would and what for should you live but och boy the way the pazon put out the talk at him and the bit of a spell at the prayinaw man alive he calked the seams of the ould body wonderful the man was free as free as free said old quilleash when he grew up it was how are you billy quilleash and when he came straight from the college at bishops court and all the larning at him and the fine english tongue and all to that it was and how are you today billy im middlin today mastha ewan aw yes yes though a tender heart at him anyway and no pride at all at all the old mans memories were not thrilling to relate but they brought the tears to his eyes and he wiped them away with his sleeve still a quick temper for all and when his blood was up it was batten down your hatches my boysa storms coming said ned teare all at once they turned their faces in the darkness to where dan sat on the battened hatches his elbows on his knees his head on his hands and a sort of shame took hold of them at all this praise of ewan it was as if every word must enter into dans soul like iron then hardly knowing what they did they began to beat about to undo the mischief they talked of the deemster in his relation to his son deed on ewanthere was not much truck atween themthe deemster and him it wasnt natheral its like as if a sarpent crawled in his ould sowl the craythur and spat out at the young pazon then they talked of jarvis kerruish och schemin and plannin reglar and stirrin and stirrin and stirrin at the devils own gruel aw the deemsters made many a man toe the mark but im thinking hell have to stand to it when the big day comes ill go bail the ould polecats got summat to answer for in this consarn dan said nothing alone and giving no sign he still sat on the hatches near where the body lay and a little to aft of him davy fayle was stretched out on the deck the lads head rested on one hand and his eyes were fixed with a dogs yearning look on the dark outlines of dans figure they were doubling the point of ayre when suddenly the wind fell to a dead calm the darkness seemed to grow almost palpable more snow cominlet the boat driff said old billy quilleash and the men turned into the cabin only dan and the body with davy the lad remaining on deck then through the silence and the blank darkness there was the sound of large drops of rain falling on the deck presently there came a torrent which lasted about ten minutes when the rain ceased the darkness lifted away and the stars came out this was toward two oclock and soon afterward the moon rose but before long it was concealed again by a dense black turretcloud that reared itself upward from the horizon when dan stepped aboard a dull dense aching at his heart was all the consciousness he had the world was dead to him he had then no clear purpose of concealing his crime and none of carrying out the atonement that mona had urged him to attempt he was stunned his spirit seemed to be dead it was as though it could awake to life again only in another world he had watched old billy when he whispered into ewans deaf ear the words of the mystic charm without will or intention he had followed the men when they came to the boat later on a fluttering within him preceded the return of the agonizing sense had he not damned his own soul forever that he had taken a warm human life that ewan who had been alive lay dead a few feet away from himthis was nothing to the horrible thought that he himself was going hot and unprepared to an everlasting hell oh can this thing have happened his bewildered mind asked itself a thousand times as it awoke as often from the halfdream of a paralyzed consciousness yes it was true that such a thing had occurred no it was not a nightmare he would never awake in the morning sunlight and smile to know that it was not true no no true true true it was even until the day of judgment and he and ewan stood once more face to face and the awful voice would cry aloud go get thee hence then dan thought of mona and his heart was nigh to breaking with a dumb longing his eyes turned through the darkness toward the land and while the boat was sailing before the wind it seemed to be carrying him away from mona forever the water that lay between them was as the river that for all eternity would divide the blessed and the damned and while behind him the men talked and their voices fell on his ear like a dull buzz the last ray of his hope was flying away when mona had prompted him to the idea of atonement it had come to him like a gleam of sunlight that though he might never never clasp her hands on earth in heaven she would yet be his to love for ever and ever but no no no between them now the great gulf was fixed much of this time dan lay on the deck with only the dead and the lad davy for company and the fishingboat lay motionless with only the lap of the waters about her the stars died off the darkness came again and then deep in the night the first gray streaks stretching along the east foretold the dawn over the confines of another night the soft daylight was about to break but more utterly lonely more void to dan was the great waste of waters now that the striding light was chasing the curling mists than when the darkness lay dead upon it on one side no object was visible on the waters until sky and ocean met in that great halfcircle far away on the other side was the land that was once called home when the gray light came and the darkness ebbed away dan still sat on the hatches haggard and pale davy lay on the deck a pace or two aside a gentle breeze was rising in the southwest the boat had drifted many miles and was now almost due west off peeltown and some five miles out to sea the men came up from below the cold white face by the hatchway looked up at them and at heaven we must put it away now said billy quilleash ay its past the turn of the ebb said crennell not another word was spoken a man went below and brought up an old sail and two heavy iron weights used for holding down the nets were also fetched from the hold there was no singing out no talking silently they took up what lay there cold and stiff and wrapped it in canvas putting one of the weights at the head and another at the feet then one of the menit was old billy himself because he had been a rigger in his young dayssat down with a sailmakers needle and string and began to stitch up the body in the sail will the string hold asked one it will last him this voyage outits a short one said old billy awe and silence sat on the crew when all was made ready the men brought from below a bankboard used for shooting the nets they lifted the body on to it and then with the scuddingpole they raised one end of the board on to the gunwale it was a solemn and awful sight overhead the heavy clouds of night were still rolling before the dawn dan sat on the hatches with his head in his hands and his haggard face toward the deck none spoke to him a kind of awe had fallen on the men in their dealings with him they left him alone davy fayle had got up and was leaning against the mitchboard all hands else gathered round the bankboard and lifted their caps then old quilleash went down on one knee and laid his right hand on the body while two men raised the other end of the board dy bishee jeeah shingod prosper you murmured the old fisherman god prosper you echoed the others and the body of ewan slid down into the wide waste of waters and then there occurred one of those awful incidents which mariners say have been known only thrice in all the strange history of the sea scarcely had the water covered up the body when there was a low rumble under the wavecircles in which it had disappeared it was the noise of the iron weights slipping from their places at the foot and at the head the stitching was giving away and the weights were tearing open the canvas in which the body was wrapped in another minute these weights had rolled out of the canvas and sunk into the sea then a terrible thing happened the body free of the weights that were to sink it rose to the surface the torn canvas not yet thoroughly saturated opened out and spread like a sail in the breeze that had risen again the tide was not yet strong for the ebb had only just begun and the body floating on the top of the water like a boat began to drive athwart the hawse of the fishingboat straight for the land nor was the marvel ended yet almost instantly a great luminous line arose and stretched from the boats quarter toward the island white as a moons waterway but with no moon to make it flashing along the seas surface for several seconds it seemed to be the finger of god marking the bodys path on the waters old mariners who can interpret aright the signs of sea and sky will understand this phenomenon if they have marked closely what has been said of the varying weather of this fearful night to the crew of the benmychree all that had happened bore but one awful explanation the men stood and stared into each others faces in speechless dismay they strained their eyes to watch the body untilthe strange light being goneit became a speck in the twilight of the dawn and could be seen no more it was as though an avenging angel had torn the murdered man from their grasp but the worst thought was behind and it was this the body of ewan mylrea would wash ashore the murder would become known and they themselves who had thought only to hide the crime of dan mylrea would now in the eyes of the law become participators in that crime or accessories to it dan saw it all and in a moment he was another man he read that incident by another light it was gods sign to the guilty man saying blood will have blood the body would not be buried the crime would not be hidden the penalty must be paid then in an instant dan thrust behind him all his vague fears and all his paralyzing terrors atonement atonement atonement god himself demanded it dan leaped to his feet and cried come my lads we must go backheave hearty and away it was the first time dan had spoken that night and his voice was awful in the mens ears chapter xxiii alone on a wide wide sea the wind strengthened and the men hoisted sail and began to beat into the island the breeze filled the canvas and for half an hour the jib lay over the side while the fishingboat scudded along like a startled bird the sun rose over the land a thin gauze obscuring it the red light flashed and died away and fanned the air as if the wind itself were the sunshine the mens haggard faces caught at moments a lurid glow from it in the west a mass of bluish cloud rested a little while on the horizon and then passed into a nimbus of gray raincloud that floated above it such was the dawn and sunrise of a fateful day dan stood at the helm when the speck that had glided along the waters like a spectre boat could be no more seen he gazed in silence toward the eastern light and the green shores of morning then he had a sweet halfhours blessed respite from terrible thoughts he saw calmly what he had done and in what a temper of blind passion he had done it surely god is merciful he thought and his mind turned to mona it relieved him to think of her she intertwined herself with his yearning hope of pardon and peace she became part of his scheme of penitence his love for her was to redeem him in the fathers eye he was to take it to the foot of gods white throne and when his guilt came up for judgment he was to lay it meekly there and look up into the good fathers face the crew had now recovered from their first consternation and were no longer obeying dans orders mechanically they had come aboard with no clear purpose before them except that of saving their friend but nature is nature and a pitiful thing at the best and now every man began to be mainly concerned about saving himself one after one they slunk away forward and sat on the thwart and there they took counsel together the wind was full on their starboard beam the mainsail and yawl were bellied out and the boat was driving straight for home but through the mens halfbewildered heads there ran like a cold blast of wind the thought that home could be home no longer the voices of girls the prattle of children the welcome of wife the glowing hearththese could be theirs no more davy fayle stayed aft with dan but the men fetched him forward and began to question him tarprit all this mysterious trouble to us they said davy held down his head and made no answer you were with himwhats it hes afther doin still no answer from the lad out with it you cursed young imp said old billy damn his fools face why doesnt he spake its the masthas saycret and i wunnit tell it said davy you wunnit you idiot waistrel no i wunnit said davy stoutly look here ye beachcomber snappin yer fingers at yer old uncle thats after bringin you up you pauperwhat was it goin doin in the shed yander its his saycret repeated davy old billy took davy by the neck as if he had been a sack with an open mouth and brought down his other hand with a heavy slap on the lads shoulder gerr out you young devil he said davy took the blow quietly but he stirred not an inch and he turned on his uncle with great wide eyes gerr out scollop eyes and old billy lifted his hand again aisy aisy said crennell interposing and then while davy went back aft the men compared notes again its plain to see said ned teare its been a quarrel and maybe a fight and hes had a piece more than the better as is only natheral and him a big strapping chap as strong as a black ox and as straight as the backbone of a herring and hes been in hidlins and now hes afther takin a second thought and goin back and chance it this reading of the mystery commended itself to all its aisy for him to lay high like that said ned again if i was the old bishops son id hould my luff too and no hidlins neither but weve got ourselves in for it so we have and were the common sort so we are and theres never no sailin close to the wind for the like of us and to this view of the situation there were many gruff assents they had come out to sea innocently enough and by a kindly impulse but they had thereby cast in their lot with the guilty man and the guilty man had favor in high places but they had none then their tousled heads went together again what for shouldnt we lay high too whispered one which with other whispers was as much as to say why should they not take the high hand and mutiny and put dan into irons and turn the boats head and stand out to sea then it would be anywhere anywhere away from the crime of one and the guilt of all hould hard said old billy quilleash ill spake to himself dan at the tiller had seen when the men went forward and he had also seen when some of them cast sidelong looks over their shoulders in his direction he knewhe thought he knewthe thought wherewith their brave hearts were busy they were thinkingso thought danthat if he meant to throw himself away they must prevent him but they should see that he could make atonement atonement empty solace pitiful unction for a soul in its abasement but all that remained to himall all old quilleash went aft sidled up to the helm and began to speak in a stammering way splicing a bit of rope while he spoke and never lifting his eyes to dans face what for shouldnt we gerr away to shetlands he said why to shetlands asked dan aw its safe and well well be when were there aw yes ive been there afore today theyre all poor men there but right kind and whats it sayin when one poor man helps another poor man god laughs dan thought he saw into the heart of the old fellow his throat grew hard and his eyes dim and he twisted his face away keeping one hand on the tiller they should yet be justified of their loyalty these stout seadogsyes god helping him no no billy he said theres to be no running away were going back to see it out at that old quilleash threw off some of his reserve mastha dan he said we came out to sea just to help you out of this jeel and because weve shared work shared meat with you and a frien should stand to a frien but now were in for it too so we are and what youll have to stand to well have to stand to and itll be unknownst to the law as we are innocent as kittens and so its every man for himself and god for us all then dan understood themhow had he been blind so long to their position you want me to put about is that it he asked old quilleash nodded his head still keeping his eyes down you think youll be taken with me old quilleash made an abashed mutter of assent aw yes as cessories before the facs he added at that dans great purpose began to waver dont fear billy he said ill speak up for you and whatll that go for nothin havent we been tryin to put it away thats true it was a fearful situation the cold sweat rose in big beads on dans forehead what had he done he had allowed these brave fellows to cast in their lot with him they were with him now for good or ill he might say they were innocent but what would his word avail and he had no proof they had tried to cover up his crime they could not cover it god had willed that the crime should not be hidden and now if he wished to lose his life to save his soul what right had he to take the lives of these men also the brave fellows had wives that waited for them and children that claimed their knees atonement empty heroics to be bought at the price of the blood of five loyal fellows whose only crime was that they had followed him he had dressed himself in a proud armor of selfsacrifice but a righteous god that sees into the heart of man and hates pride and brings it to the dust had stripped him naked dans soul was in a turmoil what should he do on the one hand were love honor mona even everlasting life and on the other were five innocent men the agony of that moment was terrible atonement god must have set his face against it dans hand rested on the tiller but there was no strength in his arm because there was now no resolve in his heart the fishingboat was about three miles west of jurby point going well before the wind in half an hour more it would run into the creek it was now to act or never what was he to do what what it was then in that moment of awful doubt when the will of a strong man might have shriveled up that nature herself seemed to give the answer all at once the wind fell again to a dead calm then dan knew or seemed to know that god was with the men and against him there was to be no atonement no there was to be no proud selfsacrifice dans listless hand dropped from the tiller and he flung himself down in his old seat by the hatches the men looked into each others faces and smiled a grisly smile the sails flapped idly the men furled them and the boat drifted south the set of the tide was still to ebb and every boats length south took the boat a fathom farther out to sea this was what the men wanted and they gathered in the cockpit and gave way to more cheerful spirits dan lay by the hatches helpless and hopeless and more haggard and pale than before an unearthly light now fired his eyes and that was the first word of a fearful tale a witchs sabbath a devils revelry had begun in his distracted brain it was as though he were already a being of another world in a state of wild hallucination he saw his own spectre and he was dead he lay on the deck he was cold his face was white and it stared straight up at the sky the crew were busy about him they were bringing up the canvas and the weights he knew what they were going to do they were going to bury him in the sea then a film overspread his sight and when he awoke he knew that he had slept he had seen his father and mona in a dream his father was very old the white head was bent and the calm saintly gaze was fixed upon him there was a happy thought in monas face everything around her spoke of peace the dream was fresh and sweet and peaceful to dan when he woke where he lay on the deck it was like the sunshine and the caroling of birds and the smell of newcut grass was there no dew in heaven for parched lips no balm for the soul of a man accursed hours went by the day wore on a passing breath sometimes stirred the waters and again all was dumb dead pulseless peace hearing only the faint flap of the rippling tide they drifted drifted drifted curious and very touching were the changes that came over the feelings of the men they had rejoiced when they were first becalmed but now another sense was uppermost the day was cold to starvation death was before themslow sure relentless death there could be no jugglery then let it be death at home rather than death on this desert sea anything anything but this blind end this dumb end this dying bit by bit on still waters to see the darkness come again and the sun rise afresh and once more the sun sink and the darkness deepen and still to lie there with nothing around but the changeless sea and nothing above but the empty sky and only the eye of god upon them while the winds and the waters lay in his avenging handslet it rather be death swift death just or unjust thus despair took hold of them and drove away all fear and where there is no fear there is no grace share yn olk shione dooin na yn olk nagh nhione dooin said old billy and that was the old manx proverb that says that better is the evil we know than the evil we do not know and with such shifts they deceived themselves and changed their poor purposes and comforted their torn hearts the cold thick winter day was worn far toward sunset and still not a breath of wind was stirring gilded by the suns hazy rays the waters to the west made a floor of bleared red the fishingboat had drifted nearly ten miles to the south if she should drift two miles more she must float into the southeastern current that flows under contrary head at the thought of that and the bare chance of drifting into peeltown harbor a little of the vague sense of hopelessness seemed to lift away the men glanced across at dan and one murmured let every herring hang by its own gill and another muttered every man to the mill with his own sack davy fayle lay on the deck a few paces from dan the simple lad tried to recall the good words that he had heard in the course of his poor neglected battered life one after one they came back to him most of them from some faraway dreamland strangely bright with the vision of a face that looked fondly upon him and even kissed him tenderly gentle jesus and now i lay me down to sleephe could remember them both pretty well and their simple words went up with the supplicatory ardor of his greatgrown heart to the sky on which his eyes were bent the men lounged about and were half frozen no one cared to go below none thought of a fire silence and death were in their midst once again their hearts turned to home and now with other feelings they could see the island through the haze and a sprinkling of snow dotted its purple hills this brought to mind the bright days of summer and out of their hopelessness they talked of the woods and the birds and the flowers dye mind my ould mothers bit of a place up the glen said crennell an the wee croft afore it swaying and aflowing same as the sea in the softest taste of a south breeze and the red ling like a rod of goold running up the hedge and the fuchsia stretchin up the wall of the loft and drooping its red wrack like blood and the green trammon atop of the porchdye mind it and the men said ay and brushed their eyes with their sleeves each hard man with despair seated on his rugged face longed like a sick child to lay his head in the lap of home it was christmas day old quilleash remembered this and they talked of christmas days gone by and what happy times they had been billy began to tell a humorous story of the two deaf men hommybeg the gardener and jemmy quirk the schoolmaster singing against each other at oiel verree and the old fellows discolored teeth with their many gaps between grinned horribly like an apes between his frozen jaws when he laughed so hard but this was too tender a chord and soon the men were silent once more then while the waters lay cold and clear and still and the sun was sinking in the west there came floating to them from the land through the breathless air the sound of the church bells ringing at home it was the last drop in their cup the poor fellows could bear up no longer more than one dropped his head to his knees and sobbed aloud then old quilleash in a husky voice and coarsely almost swearing as he spoke just to hide his shame in a way said spitting from his quid some chap pray a spell ay ay said another aw yes said a third but no one prayed you billy said ned teare billy shook his head the old man had never known a prayer it was pazon ewan that was powerful at prayer said crennell you crennell crennell could not pray all lay quiet as death around them and only the faint sound of the bells was borne to them as a mellow whisper then from near where dan sat by the hatches davy fayle rose silently to his feet none had thought of him with the sad longing in his big simple eyes he began to sing this was what he sang lo he comes with clouds descending once for favored sinners slain the lads voice laden with tears floated away over the great waters the men hung their heads and were mute the driedup well of dans eyes moistened at last and down his hard face ran the glistening tears in gracious drops like dew chapter xxiv theres gold on the cushags yet then there came a breath of wind at first it was soft as an angels whisper it grew stronger and ruffled the sea every man lifted his eyes and looked at his mates each was struggling with a painful idea that perhaps he was the victim of a delusion of the sense but the chill breath of the wind was indeed among them isnt it beginning to puff up from the souwest asked crennell in an uncertain whisper at that old quilleash jumped to his feet the idea of the supernatural had gone from him now for the sheets and to make sail he cried and spat the quid one after one the men got up and bustled about their limbs were wellnigh frozen stiff all was stir and animation in an instant pulling at the ropes the men had begun to laugh yes with their husky grating teardrowned voices even to laugh through their grisly beards a gruesome sense of the ludicrous had taken hold of them it was the swift reaction from solemn thoughts when the boat felt her canvas she shook herself like a seabird trying her wings then shot off at full flight bear a hand there lay on man alive why youre going about like a brewingpan old fellow pull boy pull what are your arms for eh old quilleashs eyes which had been dim with tears a moment ago glistened with grisly mischief who hasnt heard that a manxmans arms are three legs he said with a hungry grin how the men laughed what humor there was now in the haggard old saw where are you for billy cried corkell peel boy peel d it peel shouted quilleash hurroo bould fellow ha ha he he hurroo theres gold on the cushags yet how they worked in two minutes the mast was stepped the mainsail and mizzen were up and they filled away and stood out from the shores of death they had sailed somehow into the waters of life and hope was theirs once more they began to talk of what had caused the wind it was the blessed st patrick said corkell st patrick was the patron saint of that sea and corkell was more than half a catholic his mother being a fishwife from kinsale saint patrick be cried ned teare with a scornful laugh and they got to words and at length almost to blows old quilleash was at the tiller drop it he shouted were in the down stream for contrary and well be in harbor in ten minutes god amighty its running a tenknots tide said teare in less than ten minutes they were sailing under the castle islet up to the wooden pier having been eighteen hours on the water not a man of the four had given a thought to dan whether he wished to go back to the island or to make a foreign port where his name and his crime would be unknown only the lad davy had hung about him where he sat by the hatches dans pale face was firm and resolute and the dream of a smile was on his harddrawn lips but his despair had grown into courage and he knew no fear at all the sun was down the darkness was gathering and through the daymist the dew fog was rising as the fishingboat put to under the lee of a lantern newly lighted that was stuck out from the end of the pier on a pole the quay was almost deserted only the old harbormaster was there singing out as by duty bound his lusty oaths at their lumberings never before did the old grumblers strident voice sound so musical as now and even his manifest illtemper was sweet tonight for it seemed to tell the men that thus far they were not suspected the men went their way together and dan went off alone he took the straightest course home seven long miles over a desolate road he tramped in the darkness and never a star came out and the moon which was in its last quarter struggling behind a rack of cloud lightened the sky sometimes but did not appear as he passed through michael he noticed though his mind was preoccupied and his perception obscure that the street was more that usually silent and that few lights burned behind the windowblinds even the low porch of the three legs when dan came to it was deserted and hardly the sound of a voice came from within the little pothouse only in a vague way did these impressions communicate themselves to dans stunned intelligence as he plodded along but hardly had he passed out of the street when he realized the cause of the desolation a great glow came from a spot in front of him as of many lanterns and torches burning together and though in his bewilderment he had not noticed it before the lights lit all the air about them in the midst of these lights there came and went out of the darkness the figures of a great company of people sometimes bright with the glare on their faces sometimes black with the deep shadow of the torchlight obscure as his ideas were dan comprehended everything in an instant and chilled as he was to the hearts core by the terrors of the last night and day his very bones seemed now to grow cold within him it was a funeral by torchlight and these maimed rites were by an ancient usage long disused but here revived the only burial of one whose death had been doubtful or whose body had washed ashore on the same day the people were gathered on the side of the churchyard near to the high road between the road and the church dan crept up to the opposite side leaped the low cobble wall and placed himself under the shadow of the vestry by the chancel he was then standing beneath the window he had leaped out of in his effort to escape the bishop on that christmas eve long ago of his boyish freak at oiel verree about an open vault three of four mourners were standing and a little apart from them a smoking and flickering torch cast its light on their faces there was the bishop with his snowy head bare and deeply bowed and there by his elbow was jarvis kerruish in his cloak and beaver with arms folded under his chin and walking to and fro from side to side with a quick nervous step breaking out into alternate shrill cries and harsh commands to four men who had descended into the vault was the little restless figure of the deemster behind these and about them was the close company of the people with the light coming and going on their faces a deep low murmur as of many whispers together rising out of their midst dan shook from head to foot his heart seemed to stand still he knew on what business the mourners were met they were there to bury ewan he felt an impulse to scream and then another impulse to turn and fly but he could not utter the least cry and quivering in every limb he could not stir standing there in silence he clung to the stone wall with trembling fingers the body had been lowered to its last home and the short obsequies began the service for the dead was not read but the bishop stretched out his hands above the open vault and prayed dan heard the words but it was as if he heard the voice only they beat on his dazed closed mind as a seagull blown by the wind beats against a window on a stormy night while the bishop prayed in broken accents the deep thick boom of the sea came up from the distant shore between the lowbreathed murmurs of the people dan dropped to his knees breathless and trembling he tried to pray too but no prayer would come his mind was beaten and his soul was barren his fathers faltering voice ceased and then a halfstifled moan burst from his own lips in the silence the moan seemed to fall on every ear and the quick ear of the deemster was instantly arrested whos that he cried and twisted about but all was still once more and then the people began to sing it was a strange sight and a strange sound the torches the hard furrowed faces in the flickering light the whiteheaded bishop the restless deemster and the voices ringing out in the night over the open grave and from where he knelt dan lifted his eyes and by the light of the torches he saw the clock in the church tower the hands still stood at five he rose to his feet and turned away his step fell softly on the grass of the churchyard at one instant he thought that there were footsteps behind him he stopped and stretched his arms halffearfully toward the sound there was nothing after he had leaped the cobble wall he was conscious that he had stopped again and was listening as though to learn if he had been observed chapter xxv a resurrection indeed and now a strange accident befell himstrange enough in itself mysterious in its significance and marvelous as one of gods own miracles in its results he was going to give himself up to the deemster at ballamona but he did not any longer take the high road through the village for he shrank from every human face almost without consciousness he followed the fenceless carttrack that went by the old lead mine known as the cross vein the disused shaft had never been filled up and never even enclosed by a rail it had been for years a cause of anxiety which nothing but its remoteness on the lone waste of the headland had served to modify and now dan who knew every foot of the waste and was the last man to whom danger from such an occasion might have been feared plodding along with absent mind in the darkness fell down the open shaft the shaft was fortyfive fathoms deep yet dan was not so much as hurt at the bottom were nearly twentyfive fathoms of water the constant drainage of the old workings which rose almost to the surface or dropped to a great depth according to weather this had broken his fall on coming to the surface one stroke in the first instance of dazed consciousness had landed him on a narrow ledge of rock that raked downward from the seam but what was his position when he realized it it seemed to be worse than death itself it was a living death it was burial in an open grave hardly had he recovered his senses when he heard something stirring overhead were they footsteps those thuds on the ear like the first rumble of a distant thundercloud in the agony of fear he tried to call but his tongue clave to his mouth then there was some talking near the mouth of the shaft it came down to him like words shouted through a black hollow upright pillar no use men said one speaker not a foot farther after the best man alive its every man for himself now and ill go bail its after ourselves theyll be going next and then another voice laden with the note of pain cried but theyll take him uncle billy theyll take him and him knowin nothing drove it drove it come along man alive lave the lad to this dd blatheryoud better lets make a slant for it the facs is agen us dan shuddered at the sound of human voices buried as he was twentyfive fathoms beneath the surface the voices came to him like the voice that the wind might make on a tempestuous night if as it reaches your ear it whispered words and fled away the men had gone who were they what had happened dan asked himself if he had not remembered one of the voices or both his mind was stunned and he could not think he could hardly be sure that in very truth he was conscious of what occurred time passedhe knew not how long or shortand again he heard voices overhead but they were not the voices that he had heard before i apprehend that they have escaped us but they were our men nevertheless i have had advices from peel that the boat put into the harbor two hours ago mind the old lead shaft sir dan was conscious that a footstep approached the mouth of the shaft what a gulf lucky we didnt tumble down there was a short laughas of one who was panting after a sharp runat the mouth of dans open grave this was the way they took sir over the head toward the curraghs they were not half wise or they would have taken the mountains for it they do not know that we are in pursuit of them depend upon it they are following him up to warn him after all it may have been his voice that the deemster heard in the churchyard he is somewhere within arms reach let us push on the voices ceased the footsteps died off forty feet of dull dead rock and earth had carried the sounds away in an instant stop cried dan in the hurry of fear despair made him brave fear made him fearless there was no response he was alone once more but death was with him then in the first moment of recovered consciousness he knew whose voice it was that he had heard last and he thanked god that his call had not been answered it was the voice of jarvis kerruish in agony of despair dan perceived that the first company of men had been quilleash and the fisherfellows what fatality had prevented him from crying aloud to the only persons on earth who could have rescued and saved him dan realized that his crime was known and that he was now a hunted man it was then that he knew how hopeless was his plight he must not cry for help he must stand still as death in his deep tomb to be lifted out of this pit by the men who were in search of him would be as it would seem to be dragged from his hidingplace and captured in a feeble effort to escape what then of his brave atonement who would believe that he meant to make it it would be a mockery at which the veriest poltroon might laugh dan saw now that death encircled him on every side to remain in the pit was death to be lifted out of it was death no less surely to escape was hopeless but not so soon is hope conquered when it is hope of life cry for help he must be dragged out of this grave he should let the issue be what it could or would to lie there and die was not human to live was the first duty the first necessity be the price of life no less than future death dan looked up at the sky it was a small square patch of leaden gray against the impenetrable blackness of his prisonwalls standing on the ledge of the rock and steadying himself with one hand he lifted the other cautiously upward to feel the sides of the shaft they were of rock and were quite precipitous but had rugged projecting pieces on which it was possible to lay hold as he grasped one of these a sickening pang of hope shot through him and wounded him worse than despair but it was gone in an instant the piece of rock gave way in his hand and tumbled into the water below him with a hollow splash the sides of the shaft were of crumbling stone it was then in that blind laboring of despair that he asked himself why he should struggle with this last of the misfortunes that had befallen him was life so dear to him not so or being dear he was willing to lay it down was he not about to deliver himself to the death that must be the first punishment of his crime and what after all was there to choose between two forms of death nay if he must die who was no longer worthy of life better to die there none knowing his way of death than to die on the gallows at that thought his hair rose from its roots he had never rightly put it to himself until now that if he had to die for the death of ewan he must die the death of hanging that horror of hanging which all men have was stronger in dan than in most with the grim vision before him of a shameful and damning death it came to him to tell himself that better a thousand times better was death in that living tomb than the death that awaited him outside it then he thought of his father and of the abasement of that good man if so great a shame overtook his son and thereupon at the same breath with a prayer to god that he might die where he was a horrible blasphemy bolted from his lips he was in higher hands than his own god had saved him from himself at least he was not to die on the gallows he had but one prayer now and it cried in its barrenness of hope let me never leave this place his soul was crushed as the moth that will never lift wing again but at that his agony took another turn he reflected that if gods hand was keeping him from the just punishment of his crime god was holding him back from the atonement that was to wash his crime away at this thought he was struck with a great trembling he wrestled with it but it would not be overcome had he not parted with mona with the firm purpose of giving himself up to the law yet at every hour since that parting some impediment had arisen first there were the men in the shed at the creek their resolve to bury the body and his own weak acquiescence then came the dead calm out at sea when he stood at the tiller and the long weary drifting on the wide waters and now there was this last strange accident it was as if a higher will had willed it that he should die before his atonement could be made his spirit sank yet lower and he was for giving up all as lost in the anguish of despair he thought that in very deed it must be that he had committed the unpardonable sin this terrible idea clung to him like a leech at a vein and then it came to him to think what a mockery his dream of atonement had been what atonement could a bad man make for spilling the blood of a good one he could but send his own wasted life after a life well spent would a righteous god take that for a just balance mockeries of mockeries no no let him die where he now was and let his memory be blotted out and his sin be remembered no more he tried to compose himself and pressed one hand hard at his breast to quiet the laboring of his heart he began to reckon the moments in this he had no object or none save only that mysterious longing of a dying man to know how the hour drags on with the one hand that was free he took out his watch intending to listen for the beat of its seconds but his watch had stopped no doubt it was full of water his heart beat loud enough then he went on to countone two three but his mind was in a whirl and he lost his reckoning he found that he had stopped counting and forgotten the number whether five minutes or fifty had passed he could not be sure but time was passing the wind began to rise at first dan felt nothing of it as he stood in his deep tomb he could hear its thin hiss over the mouth of the shaft and that was all but presently the hiss deepened to a sough dan had often heard of the winds sob it was a reality and no metaphor as he listened to the wind now the wind began to descend with a great swoop it came down the shaft licked the walls gathered voice from the echoing water at the bottom struggled for escape roared like a caged lion and was once more sucked up to the surface with a noise like the breaking of a huge wave over a reef the tumult of the wind in the shaft was hard to bear but when it was gone it was the silence that seemed to be deafening then the rain began to fall dan knew this by the quick monotonous patter overhead but no rain touched him it was driven aslant by the wind and fell only against the uppermost part of the walls of the shaft sometimes a soft thin shower fell over him it was like a spray from a cataract except that the volume of water from which it came was above and not beneath him it was then in the deadly sickness of fear that there came to dan the dread of miscarrying forever if he should die now he seemed to see what it was to die unredeemed not to be forgiven but to be forever accursed to be cut off from the living that live in gods peacethe dead darkness of that doom stood up before him life had looked very dear to him before but what now of everlasting death he was as one who was dead before his death came live he could not die he dared not his past life rose up in front of him and he drank of memorys very dregs it was all so fearsome and strange that as he recalled its lost hours one by one it was as if he were a stranger to himself he saw himself like esau who for a morsel of meat had sold his birthright and could thereafter find no acceptance though he sought it with tears the scripture leaped to his mind which says it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god and then from the past to the future his mind went on in a rapid and ceaseless whirl he saw himself fleeing as from the face of a dreadful judge tossed with the terror of a dreadful doom he saw his place in the world cold empty forsaken he saw his old father too the saintly bishop living under the burden of a thousand sorrows while he who was the life of the good mans life but his no longer was a restless wandering soul coming as a cold blast of wind between him and his heaven that thought was the worst terror of all and dan heard a cry burst from his throat that roused echoes of horror in the dark pit then as if his instinct acted without help from his mind dan began to contemplate measures for escape that unexpected softness of the rock which had at first appalled him began now to give him some painful glimmerings of hope if the sides of the shaft had been of the slate rock of the island the ledge he had laid hold of would not have crumbled in his hand that it was soft showed that there must be a vein of sandstone running across the shaft dans bewildered mind recalled the fact that orris head was a rift of red sand and soft sandstone if this vein were but deep enough his safety was assured he could cut niches into it with a knife and so perhaps after infinite pain and labor reach the surface steadying himself with one hand dan felt in his pockets for his knife it was not there now indeed his death seemed certain he was icy cold and feverishly hot at intervals his clothes were wet the water still dripped from them and fell into the hidden tarn beneath in hollow drops but not to hope now would have been not to fear dan remembered that he had a pair of small scissors which he had used three days ago in scratching his name on the silver buckle of his militia belt when searching for his knife he had felt it in his pocket and spurned it for resembling the knife to the touch of his nervous fingers now it was to be his sole instrument he found it again and with this paltry help he set himself to his work of escape from the dark deep tunnel that stood upright the night was wearing on hour after hour went by the wind dropped the rain ceased to patter overhead dan toiled on step over step resting sometimes on the largest and firmest of the projecting ledges he looked up at the sky the leaden gray had changed to a dark blue studded with stars the moon arose very late being in its last quarter and much beset by rainclouds it shone a little way down the shaft lighting all the rest dan knew it must be early morning one star a large full globe of light twinkled directly above him he sat long and watched it and turned again and again in his toilsome journey to look at it at one moment it crept into his heart that the star was a symbol of hope to him then he twisted back to his work and when he looked again the star was goneit had moved beyond his ken it had passed out of the range of his narrow spot of heaven somehow it had been a mute companion dans spirit sank in his cheerless solitude but he toiled on his strength was far spent the moon died off and the stars went out one after one then a deep cloud of darkness overspread the little sky above dan knew it must be the darkness that precedes the dawn he had reached a ledge of rock that was wider than any of the ledges that were beneath it clearly enough a wooden rafter had lain along it dan rested and looked up at that moment he heard the light patter of little feet overhead it was a stray sheep a lamb of last years flock wandering and lost though he could not see it he knew it was there and it bleated down the shaft the melancholy cry of the lost creature in that dismal place touched a seared place on dans heart and made the tears which he had not shed until now to start from his eyes what old memory did it awaken he could not recall it at first but then he remembered the beautiful story which he had heard many times of the lost lamb that came to the church porch at the christening of ewan was it strange that there and then his thoughts turned to ewans child the babe that was innocent of its great sorrows to come he began to wish himself a little child again walking by his fathers hand with all the years rolled back and all the transgressions of the years blotted out as a cloud and with a new spirit sweet and fresh where now was a spirit seared and old and one great aching wound in a moment the outcast lamb went off sending up as it went its pitiful cry into the night dan was alone once more but that visitation had sweetly refreshed his spirit then it came back to him to think that of a surety it was not all one whether he died where he was never coming alive from his open tomb or died for his crime before the faces of all men he must live he must live though not for lifes sake but to rob death of its worst terrors and as for the impediments that had arisen to prevent the atonement on which his mind was set they were not from god to lay his soul outside the reach of mercy but from the devil to beset him and keep him back from the washing away of his sin this thought revived him and he turned to his task with a new resolve his fingers were chilled to the bone and his clothes clung like damp cerements to his body the meagre blades of the scissors were worn short they could not last long he rose to his feet on the ledge of rock and plunged the scissors into the blank wall above him and at that a fresh disaster seemed to overwhelm him his hand went into soft earth the vein of rock had finished and above it must be loose uncertain mold he gasped at the discovery a minute since life had looked very dear must he abandon his hopes after all he might have been longer vexed with this new fear but that he recalled at that moment the words spoken by jarvis kerruish as he went by on the road that ran near the mouth of the shaft was it not clear that quilleash and the fisherfellows were being pursued as his associates without his evidence to clear them would they not surely suffer innocent though they might be and even though he himself lay dead in this place now indeed he saw that he must of a certainty escape from this death in life no difficulties conquering him dan paused and reflected as nearly as he could remember he had made twenty niches in the rock hence he must be fully thirtyfive feet from the water and ten from the surface only ten feet and then freedom yet these ten seemed to represent an impossibility to ascend by holes dug deep in the soft earth was a perilous enterprise a great clod of soil might at any moment give away above or beneath him and then he would be plunged once more into the pit if he fell from the side of the shaft he would be more likely than at first when he fell from the top to strike on one of the projecting ledges and be killed before reaching the water there was nothing left but to wait for the dawn perhaps the daylight would reveal some less hazardous method of escape slowly the dull dead impenetrable blackness was lifted off it was as though a spirit had breathed on the night and it fled away when the woolly hue of morning dappled his larger sky dan could hear the slow beat of the waves on the shore the coast rose up before his vision then silent solemn alone with the dawn the light crept into his prisonhouse and he looked down at the deep black tarn beneath him and now hope rose in his hearth again overhead he saw timbers running around and across the shaft these had been used to bank up the earth and to make two grooves in which the ascending and descending cages had once worked dan lifted up his soul in thankfulness the world was once more full of grace even for him he could climb from stay to stay and so reach the surface catching one of the stays in his uplifted hands he swung his knee on to another one stage he accomplished and then how stiff were his joints and how sinewless his fingers another and another stage he reached and then four feet and no more were between him and the gorse that waved in the light of the risen sun across the mouth of his nightlong tomb but the rain of years had eaten into these timbers in some places they crumbled and were rotten god how the one on which he rested creaked under him at that instant another minute and then his toilsome journey would be over another minute and his dead self would be left behind him buried forever in this grave then there would be a resurrection in very truth yes truly god helping him half an hour later dan mylrea with swimming eyes and a big heart was walking toward the deemster at ballamona the flush of the sun newly risen and the brighter glory of a great hope newly born was on his worn and pallid cheek what terrors had life for him now it had none and very soon death also would lose its sting atonement atonement it was even as he had thought a wasted life for a life well spent the life of a bad man for the life of a good one but all he had to giveall all and when he came to lay his offering at the merciful fathers feet it would not be spurned chapter xxvi how ewan came to church it is essential to the progress of this history that we should leave dan where he now is in the peace of a great soul newly awakened and go back to the beginning of this christmas day on shore the parish of michael began that day with all its old observances while the dawn of christmas morning was struggling but feebly with the night of christmaseve a gang of the baser sort went out with lanterns and long sticks into the lanes there to whoop and beat the bushes it was their annual hunting of the wren before the parish had sat down to its christmas breakfast two of these lusty enemies of the tiny bird were standing in the street of the village with a long pole from shoulder to shoulder and a wee wren suspended from the middle of it their brave companions gathered round and plucked a feather from the wrens breast now and again at one side of the company surrounded by a throng of children was hommybeg singing a carol and playing his own accompaniment on his fiddle the carol told a tragic story of an evil spirit in the shape of a woman who pestered the island in the old days of how the people rose up against her to drive her into the sea and of how she turned herself into a wren and all on the holy day of the blessed saint stephen a boy whose black eyes danced with a mischievous twinkle held a crumpled paper upside down before the gardener and from this inverted text and score the unlettered coxcomb pretended to play and sing the women came to their doors to listen and the men with their two hands in their breechespockets leaned against the ends of their houses and smoked and looked on sleepily when the noisy crowd had passed the street sank back to its customary repose broken only by the voice of a childa little auburnhaired lassie in a white apron tucked up in fishwife fashioncrying shrimps fine shrimps fresh shrimps and then by a lustier voice that drowned the little lassies tones and cried congerconger eelfine ladiesfresh ladiesand bellies as big as bishops conger eelconger it was not a brilliant morning but the sun was shining drowsily through a white haze like a dewfog that hid the mountains the snow of the night before was not quite washed away by the sharp rain of the morning it still lay at the eaves of the thatched houses and among the cobbles of the paved pathway the blue smoke was coiling up through the thick air from every chimney when the bells at bishops court began to ring for christmas service an old woman here and there came out of her cabin in her long blue cape and her mutch and hobbled along on a stick to church two or three men in seaboots with shrimping nets over their shoulders and pipes in their mouths sauntered down the lane that led by the shambles to the shore half an hour later while the bells were still ringing and the people were trooping into the chapel the bishop came out of his house and walked down the path toward the vestry he had a worn and jaded look that morning as if the night had gone heavily with him but he smiled when the women courtesied as they passed and waved his hand when the men fumbled their caps goodmorning and a merry christmas to you he said as he went by the open porch to willasthorn the parish clerk who was tugging at the bellrope there bareheaded stripped to his sheepskin waistcoat with its gray flannel sleeves and sweating he hailed billy the gawk too the hoary old dog turned penitent in his latter days a merry christmas billy and may you live to see many of them yet please god billy was leaning against the porch buttress and taking alms if any offered them then its not living it will be my lord its lingering said this old bartimeus and jabez gawne the sleek little tailor had the bishops salutation as he passed on in the ancient cloak with many buttons a merry christmas to you jabez and a good new year aw deed my lord said jabez with a face as long as a fiddle if the new years no better than the ould one what with quiet times and high rents and the childrens schooling its going on the houses ill be middlin safe nay nay remember our old saying jabez the greater the calm the nearer the south wind as the bishop was turning in at the vestry door blind kerry and her husband hommy passed him and he hailed them as he had hailed the others im taking joy to see you so hearty my lord said the blind woman yes im well on the whole thank god said the bishop and how are you kerry im in my lordim in but distracted mortal with the sights och sir its allis the sights and the sights and the sights and its mastha dan thats in them still this morning bless ye when i woke what should it be behould ye but a company of great ones from the big house itself going down to the churchyard with lanterns aw deed it was sir my lord begging your pardon though its like enough youll think its wake and a kind of silly as the sayin is the bishop listened to the blind womans garrulous tongue with a downcast head and a look of pain and said in a subdued voice as he put his hand on the wooden latch of the vestry door it is not for me to laugh at you kerry woman all night long i have myself been tortured by an uneasy feeling which would not be explained or yet be put away but let us say no more of such mysteries there are dark places that we may never hope to penetrate let it content us if in gods mercy and his wisdom we can see the step that is at our feet so saying the bishop turned about and passed in at the door kerry and her husband went into the chapel at the west porch its just an ould angel he is whispered kerry reaching up to hommys ear as they went by willasthorn aw yes yes said hommybeg a rael ould archangel so he is and still the bells rang for service of christmas morning inside the chapel the congregation was larger than common there was so much handshaking and taking of joy to be gone through in the aisles and the pews that christmas morning that it was not at first observedexcept by malcontents like billy the gawk and jabez gawne to whom the wine of life was mostly vinegarwhen the hour for beginning the service had come and gone the choir in the west gallery had taken their places on either side of willasthorns empty seat over the clock with the pitchpipe resting on the rail above it and opening their books they faced about for gossip then the bell stopped having rung some minutes longer than was its wont the whispering was hushed from pew to choir and only the sound of the turning of the leaves of many books disturbed the silence a moment afterward the bishop entered the chancel and while he knelt to pray down like corn before a south wind went a hundred heads on to the bookrail before the wind of custom when the bishop rose there was the sound of shuffling and settling in the pews followed by some craning of necks in his direction and some subdued whispering where is pazon ewan whats come of the young pazon the bishop sat alone in the chancel and gave no sign of any intention to commence the service in the gallery the choir books in hand waited for willasthorn to take his seat over the clock but his place remained empty then to the universal surprise the bell began to ring again steadily at first and timidly and after that with lusty voice the bell rang out over the heads of the astonished people forthwith the people laid those same heads together and whispered what was agate of pazon ewan had he forgotten that he had to preach that morning blind kerry wanted to know if some of the men craythurs shouldnt just take a slieu round to the ould ballamona and wake him up as the saying is but mr quirk in more gintale phraseology as became his scholastic calling gave it out as probable that the young pazon had only been making a little deetower after breakfast and gone a little too far still the bell rang and the uneasy shuffling in the pews grew more noticeable presently in the middle of an abridged movement of the iron tongue in the loft the head and shoulders of willasthorn appeared in the opening of the green curtain that divided the porch from the body of the chapel and the parish clerk beckoned to hommybeg shambling to his feet and down the aisle hommy obeyed the summons and then amid yet more vigorous bobbing together of many heads in the pews the schoolmaster not to be eclipsed at a moment of public excitement got up also and followed the gardener into the porch the whispering had risen to a sibilant hiss that deadened even the bells loud clangor when little jabez gawne himself felt a call to rise and go out after the others all this time the bishop sat motionless in the chancel his head down his face rather paler than usual his whole figure somewhat weak and languid as if continued suffering in silence and in secret had at length taken the power of life out of him presently the bell stopped suddenly and almost instantly little jabez with a face as sharp as a pen came back to his pew and mr quirk also returned to his place shaking his head meantime with portentous gravity a moment later willasthorn appeared inside the communionrail having put on his coat and whipped the lash comb through his hair which now hung like a dozen of wet dipcandles down his forehead straight for his eyes the dull buzz of gossip ceased all was dead silence in the chapel and many necks were craned forward as willasthorn was seen to go up to the bishop and speak to him listening without much apparent concern the bishop nodded his head once or twice then rose immediately and walked to the readingdesk almost at the same moment willasthorn took his seat over the clock in the little west gallery and straightway the service began the choir sang the psalm which they had practised at the parish church the evening beforeit is good for me that i have been in trouble that i may learn thy statutes for the first of his lessons the bishop read the story of eli and of samuel and of the taking by the philistines of the ark of the covenant of god his voice was deep and measured and when he came to read of the death of elis sons and of how the bad news was brought to eli his voice softened and all but broke and there ran a man of benjamin out of the army and came to shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head and when he came lo eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching for his heart trembled for the ark of god and when the man came into the city and told it all the city cried out and when eli heard the noise of the crying he said what meaneth the noise of this tumult and the man came in hastily and told eli now eli was ninety and eight years old and his eyes were dim that he could not see and the man said unto eli i am he that came out of the army and i fled today out of the army and he said what is there done my son the bishop preached but rarely now and partly for the reverence they always owed the good man and partly for the reason that they did not often hear him the people composed themselves to a mood of sympathy as he ascended the pulpit that christmas morning it was a beautiful sermon that he gave them and it was spoken without premeditation and was loose enough in its structure but it was full of thought that seemed to be too simple to be deep and of emotion that was too deep to be anything but simple it touched on the life of christ from his birth in bethlehem to his coming as a boy to the temple where the doctors sat and so on to the agony in the garden and then it glanced aside as touchingly as irrelevantly at the story of eli and his sons and the judgment of god on israels prophet in that beautiful digression the bishop warned all parents that it was their duty before god to bring up their children in gods fear or theirs would be the sorrow and their childrens the suffering and the shame everlasting and then in a voice that could barely support itself he made an allusion that none could mistake strange it is and very pitiful he said that what we think in our weakness to be the holiest of our human affections may be a snare and a stumblingblock strange enough surely and very sad that even as the hardest of soul among us all may be free from blame where his children stand for judgment so the tenderest of heart may like eli of old be swept from the face of the living god for the iniquity of his children which he has not restrained but the best of our earthly passions or what seem to be the best the love of the mother for the babe at her breast the pride of the father in the son that is flesh of his flesh must be indulged with sin if it is not accepted with grace true too true that there are those of us who may cast no stone who should offer no counsel like eli we know that the word of god has gone out against us and we can but bend our foreheads and say it is the lord let him do what seemeth him good when the sermon ended there was much needless industry in searching for books under the bookrail much furtive wiping of the eyes much demonstrative blowing of the nose and in the midst of the benediction a good deal of subdued whispering aw deed the ould bishop bates the young pazon himself at putting out the talkstuddierlike and not so fiery maybe but man alive the tender he is and dye mind that taste about eli and them two idiot waistrels hoffnee and fineass and did ye observe the ould man thrembling mortal och yes and ill go bail it wasnt them two blackyards he was thinking of at all at all when the service came to an end and the congregation was breaking up and billy the gawk was hobbling down the aisle on a pair of sticks that hoary old sinner turned saint because fallen sick was muttering something about a rael good ould father and dirts like than dan and a thundrin rascal with all a strange scene came next the last of the congregation had not yet reached the porch when all at once there was an uneasy move among them like the groundswell among the shoalings before the storm comes to shore those who were in front fell back or turned about and nodded as if they wished to say something and those who were behind seemed to think and wonder then sudden as the sharp crack of the first breaker on a reef the faces of the people fell to a great heaviness of horror and the air was full of mournful exclamations surprise and terror lord ha massy dead you say aw dead enough washed ashore by the mooragh so theyre sayin so theyre sayin hiain jean myghin orrinlord have mercy upon us half a minute later the whole congregation were gathered outside the west porch there in the recess between the chapel and the house two men fisherfellows of michael stood surrounded by a throng of people something lay at their feet and the crowd made a circle about it looked down at it and drew long breaths and when one after another came up reached over the heads of others and saw what lay within he turned away with uplifted hands and a face that was white with fear lord ha massy lord ha massy cried the people on every side and their senses were confused and overpowered what the dread thing was that lay at the feet of the two fishermen does not need to be said at the mooragh dye saycame ashore at the mooragh ay at the top of the flood god bless me i saw it an hour before it drifted in said one of the two grave fellows i was down longshore shrimping and it was a good piece out to sea and a heavy tide running lord ha massy whats that i says its a gig with a sail i was thinking but no it was looking too small its a diver or maybe a solan goose with its wings stretched out but no it was looking too big bless me lord bless me and when it came a piece nearer it was into the sea i was going breasthigh and a more and i came anigh it and saw what it wasand frightened mortal you go bailand away to the street for jemmy here and back middlin sharp and it driffin and driffin on the beach by that time and the water flopping on it and the two of us up with it on to our shoulders and straight away for the coort and sure enough the fishermans clothes were drenched above his middle and the shoulders of both men were wet bless me bless me lord ha massy echoed one and then another and once again they craned their necks forward and looked down the loose canvas that had been ripped open by the weights was lying where the seams were stretched and none uncovered the face for the sense of human death was strong on all but word had gone about whose body it was and blind kerry wringing her hands and muttering something about the sights pushed her way to the side of the two men and asked why they had brought their burden to bishops court instead of taking it to ballamona aw well they answered we were thinking the bishop was his true father and bishops coort his true home for all and thats true too said kerry for his own father has been worse than a haythen naygro to him and lave it to me to know for didnt i bring the millish into the world then there came a rush of people down the road from the village a rumor that something horrible had washed ashore had passed quickly from mouth to mouth after the fisherman had run up to the village for help and now in low eager tones questions and answers came and went among the crowd who is it is it the captain what mastha dan thats what theyre saying up the street anyway wrapped in a hammockgood lord preserve us came up in the tideway at the mooraghgracious me and i saw him myself ony yesterday the bishop was seen to come out of the vestry door and at the sight of him the crowd seemed to awake out of its first stupor god help the bishop here hes coming bless me hell have to pass it by going into the house the shock will kill the ould man poor thing poor thing some one must up and break the bad newses to him aw yes for sure and then came the question of who was to tell the bishop first the people asked one corlett ballafayle corlett farmed a hundred acres and was a churchwarden and a member of the keys but the big man said no and edged away then they asked one of the tubmans but the brewer shook his head he could not look into the bishops face and tell him a tale like that at length they thought of blind kerry she at least would not see the face of the stricken man when she took him the fearful news aw yes kerry woman its yourself for it and a rael stout heart at you and blind for all thank the lord ill try please god said kerry and with that she moved slowly toward the vestry door where the bishop had stopped to stroke the yellow curls of a little shy boy and to ask him his age next birthday and to wish him a merry christmas and eighty more of them and all merry ones it was observed that the good mans face was brighter now than it had been when he went into the chapel the people watched kerry as she moved up to the bishop could she be telling him he was smiling was it not his laugh that they heard kerry was standing before him in an irresolute way and now with a wave of the hand he was leaving her he was coming forward no he had stopped again to speak to old auntie nan from the curragh and kerry had passed him in returning to the crowd i couldnt do it he spoke so cheerful poor thing said kerry and when i was goin to speak he looked the spitten picture of my ould father the bishop parted from the old woman of the curragh and then on raising his eyes he became conscious of the throng by the porch lave it to me said a rough voice and billy the gawk stepped out the crowd fell aside and the fishermen placed themselves in front of the dread thing on the ground smiling and bowing on the right and left the bishop was passing on toward the door that led to the house when the old beggar of the highways hobbled in front of him were right sorry sir my lord to bring ye bad newses the old man stammered lifting the torn cap from his head the bishops face fell to a sudden gravity what is it he said and his voice sank were rael sorry and we know your heart was gript to him with grapplins ay ay said some in the crowd what is it man speak said the bishop and all around was silence and awe the old man stood irresolute for a moment then just as he was lifting his head to speak and every eye was on the two who stood in the midst the bishop and the old beggar there came a loud noise from near at hand and voices that sounded hoarse and jarring were in the air where is it when did they bring it up why is it not taken into the house it was the deemster and he came on with great flashing eyes and behind him was jarvis kerruish in an instant the crowd had fallen aside for him and he had pushed through and come to a stand in front of the bishop we know what has happened we have heard it in the village he said i knew what it must come to sooner or later i told you a hundred times and you have only yourself to thank for it the bishop said not a word he saw what lay behind the feet of the fishermen and stepped up to it its of your own doing shouted the deemster in a voice of no ruth or pity you would not heed my warning it was easy to see that the devils own dues were in him he hadnt an ounce of grace in his carcass he put his foot on your neck and threatened to do as much for me some day and see where he is now look at him this is how your son comes home to you as he spoke the deemster pointed contemptuously with the handle of his walkingcane to the thing that lay between them then the hard tension of the peoples silence was broken they began to mutter among themselves and to propose and demur to something they saw the deemsters awful error and that he thought the dead man was dan the bishop still stood immovable with not the sign of a tear on his white face but over it the skin was drawn hard and let me tell you one thing more said the deemster whoever he may be that brought matters to this pass he shall not suffer i will not lift a finger against him the man who brings about his own death shall have the burden of it on his own head the law will uphold me then a hoarse murmur ran from lip to lip among the people who stood around and one man a burly fellow nerved by the deemsters error pushed forward and said deemster be merciful as you hope for mercy you dont know what youre saying at that the deemster turned about hotly and brought down his walkingcane with a heavy blow on the mans breast the stalwart fellow took the blow without lifting a hand god help you deemster he said in a thick voice god help you you dont know what youre doing go and look at it deemster go and look if youve the heart for it look at it man and may the lord have mercy on you and on us all in our day of trouble and may god forgive you the cruel words youve spoken to your own brother this day there was then a great silence for a moment the deemster gazed in a sort of stupor into the mans face and his stick dropped out of his hand with a look of majesty and of suffering the bishop stood at one side of the body quiet silent giving no sign seeing nothing but the thing at his feet and hardly hearing the reproaches that were being hurled at him in the face of his people the beating of his heart fell low there was a moment of suspense and then breathing rapid audible breath the deemster stooped beside the body stretched out a halfpalsied hand and drew aside the loose canvas and saw the face of his own son ewan one long exclamation of surprise and consternation broke from the deemster and after that there came another fearful pause wherein the bishop went down on his knees beside the body in an instant the deemster fell back to his savage mood he rose to his full height his face became suddenly and awfully discolored and stern and tottering almost to falling he lifted his clenched fist to the sky in silent imprecation of heaven the people dropped aside in horror and their flesh crawled over them lord ha massy they cried again and kerry who was blind and could not see the deemster covered her ears that she might not hear him and from where he knelt the bishop who had not spoken until now said with an awful emphasis brother the lord of heaven looks down on us but the deemster recovering himself laughed in scorn of his own weakness no less than of the bishops reproof he picked up the walkingcane that he had dropped slapped his leg with it ordered the two fishermen to shoulder their burden again and take it to ballamona and sent straightway for the coroner and the joiner for said he my son having come out of the sea must be buried this same day chapter xxvii how the news came to the bishop the deemster swung aside and went off followed by jarvis kerruish then the two fishermen took up their dread burden and set their faces toward ballamona in a blind agony of uncertainty the bishop went into his house his mind was confused he sat and did his best to compose himself the thing that had happened perplexed him cruelly he tried to think it out but found it impossible to analyze his unlinked ideas his faculties were benumbed and not even pain the pain of ewans loss could yet penetrate the dead blank that lay between him and a full consciousness of the awful event he shed no tears and not a sigh broke from him silent he sat with an expression of suffering that might have been frozen in his stony eyes and on his whitening lips so rigid was it and as if the power of life had ebbed away like the last ebb of an exhausted tide then the people from without began to crowd in upon him where he sat in his library they were in a state of great excitement and all reserve and ceremony were broken down each had his tale to tell each his conjecture to offer one told what the longshore shrimper had said of finding the body near the fishingground known as the mooragh another had his opinion as to how the body had sailed ashore instead of sinking a third fumbled his cap and said i take sorrow to see you in such trouble my lord and wouldnt bring bad newses if i could give myself lave to bring good newses instead but ill go bail theres been bad work goin and foul play as theyre sayin and i wouldnt trust but mastha danim saying i wouldnt trust but mastha dan could tell us something the bishop cut short the mans garrulity with a slight gesture and one by one the people went out he had listened to them in silence and with a face of saintly suffering scarcely hearing what they had said i will await events he thought and trust in god but a great fear was laying hold of him and he had to gird up his heart to conquer it i will trust in god he told himself a score of times and in his faith in the goodness of his god he tried to be calm and brave but one after another his people came back and back and back with new and still newer facts at every fresh blow from damning circumstances his thin lips trembled his nervous fingers ran through his flowing white hair and his deep eyes filled without moving and after the first tempest of his own sorrow for the loss of ewan he thought of dan and of dans sure grief he remembered the love of ewan for dan and the love of dan for ewan he recalled many instances of that beautiful affection and in the quickening flow of the light of that love half the follies of his wayward son sank out of sight dan must be told what had occurred and if none had told him already it was best that it should be broken to him from lips that loved him thus it was that this brave and longharassed man trying to think ill of his own harshness that looked so impotent and so childish now remembering no longer his vow never to set eyes on the face of his son or hold speech with him again sent a messenger to the old ballamona to ask for dan and to bring him to bishops court without delay half an hour later at the sound of a knock at his door the bishop thinking it was dan himself stood up to his stately height and tried to hide his agitation and answered in an unsteady voice that not all the resolution of his brave heart could subdue to calmness but it was the messenger and not dan and he had returned to say that mastha dan had not been home since yesterday and that when mastha ewan was last seen at home he had asked for mastha dan and not finding him had gone down to the lockjaw creek to seek him when was that the bishop asked the ould body at the house said it might be a piece after three oclock yesterday evening said the man beneath the cold quietness of the regard with which the bishop dismissed his messenger a keener eye than his might have noted a fearful tumult the bishops hand grew cold and trembled at the next instant he had become conscious of his agitation and had begun to reproach himself for his want of faith i will trust in god and await events he told himself again no i will not speak i will maintain silence yes i will await the turn of events and trust in the good father of all then there came another knock at his door surely it is dan at length his old housekeeper has sent him on he thought come in he called in a voice that shook it was hommybeg the deemster had sent him across with a message and what is it the bishop asked speaking at the deaf mans ear hommybeg scratched his tousled head and made no answer at first and the bishop repeated the question were all taking sorrow for you my lord said hommy and then he stopped what is it the bishop repeated and right sorry i am to bring his message the bishops pale face took an ashy gray but his manner was still calm what did the deemster send you to say hommy the dempsterbad cess to him and no disrespeche sent me to tell you that theyre after stripping the canvas off and behould ye its an ould sail and theyre knowing it by its number and what fishingboat it came out of and all to that where did the sailcloth come from asked the bishop and his deep eyes were fixed on hommy its an ouldwell the fact isto tell you not a word of a lieaw my lord what matterwhat if it is where said the bishop calmly though his lips whitened and quivered its an old drift yawlsail of the benmychree aw yes yes sarten sure and sorry i am to bring bad newses hommybeg went out and the bishop stood for some minutes in the thrall of fear he had been smitten hard by other facts but this latest fact seemed for the moment to overthrow his great calm faith in gods power to bring out all things for the best he wrestled with it long and hard he tried to persuade himself that it meant nothing that ewan was dead was certain that he came by his death through foul play seemed no less sure and terrible but that his body had been wrapped in sailcloth once belonging to dans fishingboat was no sufficient ground for the terrible accusation that was taking shape in other minds could he accept the idea ah no no no to do so would be to fly in the face of all sound reason all fatherly love and all trust in the good father above though the sailcloth came from the benmychree the fact said nothing of where the body came from and even though it were certain that the body must have been dropped into the sea from the fishingboat that belonged to dan it would still require proof that dan himself was aboard of her with such poor shifts the bishop bore down the cruel facts as one after one they beat upon his brain he tried to feel shame of his own shame and to think hard of his own hard thoughts yes i will trust in god he told himself afresh i will await events and trust in the good father of all mercies but where was dan the bishop had made up his mind to send messengers to skirr the island round in search of his son when suddenly there came a great noise as of many persons talking eagerly and drawing hurriedly near and nearer a minute afterward his library door was opened again without reserve or ceremony and there came trooping into the room a mixed throng of the village folk little jabez gawne was at their head with a coat and a hat held in his hands before him cold as the day was the people looked hot and full of puzzled eagerness and their smoking breath came in long jets into the quiet room my lord look what weve found on the top of orrisdel said jabez and he stretched out the coat while one of the men behind him relieved him of the beaver the coat was a long blackcloth coat with lappets and tails and wristbands turned over the bishop saw at a glance that it was the coat of a clergyman leave it to me to know this coat my lord for it was myself that made it said jabez the bishops brain turned giddy and the perspiration started from his temples but his dignity and his largeness did not desert him is it my poor ewans coat he asked as he held out his hand to take it but his tone was one of almost hopeless misery and not of inquiry thats true my lord said jabez and thereupon the little tailor started an elaborate series of identifications based chiefly on points of superior cut and workmanship but the bishop cut the tailor short with a wave of the hand you found it on orrisdale head asked the bishop and one of the men behind pushed his head between the shoulders of those who were before him and said aw yes my lord not twenty yards from the cliff and i found something else beside of it just then there was a further noise in the passage outside the library and a voice saying gerr out of the way you old loblollyboys bringing bad newses still and glad of them too it was hommybeg returned to bishops court with yet another message but it was a message of his own and not of the deemsters he pushed his way through the throng until he came face to face with the bishop and then he said the dempster is afther having the doctor down from ramsey and the big man is sayin the neck was broken and it was a fall that killed the young pazon and nothing worse at all at all the large sad eyes of the bishop seemed to shine without moving as hommy spoke but in an instant the man who had spoken before thrust his word in again and then the bishops face grew darker than ever with settled gloom it was myself that found the coat and hat my lord and a piece nearer the cliff i found this and this and then down the brew itselfmaybe a matter of ten feet downi saw this other one sticking in a green corry of grass and ling and over i went handunderhand and brought it up while he spoke the man struggled to the front and held out in one hand a belt or what seemed to be two belts buckled together and cut across as with a knife and in the other hand two daggers a great awe fell upon every one at sight of the weapons the bishops face still showed a quiet grandeur but his breathing was labored and harassed give them to me he said with an impressive calmness and the man put the belts and daggers into the bishops hands he looked at them attentively and saw that one of the buckles was of silver while the other was of steel has any one recognized them he asked a dozen voice answered at once that they were the belts of the newlybanded militia at the same instant the bishops eye was arrested by some scratches on the back of the silver buckle he fixed his spectacles to examine the marks more closely when he had done so he breathed with gasps of agony and all the cheer of life seemed in one instant to die out of his face his nerveless fingers dropped the belts and daggers on to the table and the silver and the steel clinked as they fell there had been a dead silence in the room for some moments and then with a labored tranquillity the bishop said that will do and stood mute and motionless while the people shambled out leaving their dread treasures behind them to his hearts core the bishop was struck with an icy chill he tried to link together the terrible ideas that had smitten his brain but his mind wandered and slipped away ewan was last seen going toward the creek he was dead he had been killed by a fall his body had come ashore in an old sail of the benmychree his coat and hat had been picked up on the top of orrisdale head and beside them lay two weapons and two belts whereof one had belonged to dan whose name was scratched upon it in the crushing coil of circumstance that was every moment tightening about him the bishops great calm faith in the goodness of his maker seemed to be benumbed oh my son my son he cried when he was left alone would to god i had died before i saw this day oh my son my son but after a time he regained his selfcontrol and said to himself again i will trust in god he will make the dark places plain then he broke into short fitful prayers as if to drive away by the warmth of the spirit the chill that was waiting in readiness to freeze his faithmake haste unto me o god hide not thy face from thy servant for i am in trouble the short winters day had dragged on heavily but the arms of darkness were now closing round it the bishop put on his cloak and hat and set off for ballamona in length of days he was but little past his prime but the dark sorrow of many years had drained his best strength and he tottered on the way only his strong faith that god would remember his servant in the hour of trouble gave power to his trembling limbs and as he walked he began to reproach himself for the mistrust whereby he had been so sorely shaken this comforted him somewhat and he stepped out more boldly he was telling himself that perplexing though the facts might be they were yet so inconclusive as to prove nothing except that ewan was dead when all at once he became conscious that in the road ahead of him grouped about the gate of ballamona were a company of women and children all agitated and some weeping with the coroner in their midst questioning them the coroner was quayle the gyke the same who would have been left penniless by his father but for the bishops intervention and when did your husband go out to sea the coroner asked at floodtide yesterday answered one of the women and my man he said to me liza he said get me a bite of priddhas and salt herrins for supper he said well be back for twelve he said but never a sight of him yet and me up all night till daylight but theyve been in and gone out to sea again said another of the women how dye know that mother quilleash asked the coroner because ive been taking a slieu round to the creek and theres a basket of ray and cod in the shed the woman answered at that the bishop drew up at the gate and the coroner explained to him the trouble of the women and children is it you mrs corkell the bishop asked of a woman near him aw yes my lord and you too mrs teare the woman courtesied the bishop named them one by one and stroked the bare head of the little girl who was clinging to her mothers cloak and weeping then its the benmychree that has been missing since yesterday at highwater the bishop said in a sort of hushed whisper yes sure my lord at that the bishop turned suddenly aside without a word more opened the gate and walked up the path oh my son my son he cried in his bleeding heart how have you shortened my days how have you clothed me with shame oh my son my son before ballamona an open cart was standing with the tailboard down and the horse was pawing the gravel which had onceon a far different occasionbeen strewn with the blithebread the door of the house stood ajar and a jet of light from within fell on the restless horse without the bishop entered the house and found all in readiness for the hurried night burial on chairs that were ranged back to back a rough oak coffin like an oblong box was resting and from the rafter of the ceiling immediately over it a small oillamp was suspended on either side of the hall were three or four men holding brands and leathern lanterns ready for lighting the deemster was coming and going from his own room beyond attended in bustling eagerness by jarvis kerruish near the coffin stood the vicar of the parish father of the dead mans dead wife and in the opening of a door that went out from the hall mona stood weeping with the dead mans child in her arms and even as it is only in the night that the brightest stars may truly be seen so in the night of all this calamity the star of the bishops faith shone out clearly again and his vague misgivings fell away he stepped up to mona whose dim eyes were now fixed on his face in sadness of sympathy and with his dry lips he touched her forehead then in the depth of his own sorrow and the breadth of shadow that lay upon him he looked down at the little one in monas arms where it leaped and cooed and beat its arms on the air in a strange wild joy at this gay spectacle of its fathers funeral and his eyes filled for what the course of its life would be almost as soon as the deemster was conscious of the bishops presence in the house he called on the mourners to make ready and then six men stepped to the side of the coffin thorkell said the bishop calmly and the bearers paused while he spoke this haste to put away the body of our dear ewan is unseemly because it is unnecessary the deemster made no other answer than a spluttered expression of contempt and the bishop spoke again you are aware that there is no canon of the church requiring it and no law of state demanding it that a body from the sea shall be buried within the day it has washed ashore is no more than a custom then custom shall be indulged with custom said thorkell decisively not for fifty years has it been observed continued the bishop and here is an outrage on reason and on the respect we owe to our dead at this the deemster said the body is mine and i will do as i please with it even the six carriers with their hands on the coffin caught their breath at these words but the bishop answered without anger and the graveyard is mine in charge for the church and gods people and if i do not forbid the burial it is because i would have no wrangling over the grave of my dear boy the deemster spat on the floor and called on the carriers to take up their burden then the six men lifted the coffin from the chairs and put it into the cart at the door the other mourners went out on to the gravel and such of them as carried torches and lanterns lighted them there the old hundred was then sung and when its last notes had died on the night air the springless cart went jolting down the path behind it the mourners ranged themselves two abreast with the deemster walking alone after the cart and the bishop last of all mona stood a moment at the open door in the hall that was now empty and desolate and silent save for the babblings of the child in her arms she saw the procession through the gate into the road after that she went into the house drew aside the curtain of her window and watched the moving lights until they stopped and then she knew that they were gathered about an open grave and that half of all that had been very dear to her in this weary world was gone from it forever chapter xxviii the child ghost in the house after the coroner quayle the gyke had gone through one part of his dual functions at ballamona and thereby discovered that the body of ewan had been wrapped in a sailcloth of the benmychree he set out on the other part of his duty to find the berth of the fishingboat and if need be to arrest the crew he was in the act of leaving ballamona when at the gate of the highroad he came upon the women and children of the families of the crew he was in search of and there at the moment when the bishop arrived for the funeral he heard that the men had been at sea since the middle of the previous day confirmed in his suspicions but concealing them he returned to the village with the terrified women and on the way he made his own sinister efforts to comfort them when they mourned as if their husbands had been lost aw no no no never fear well see them again soon enough ill go bail he said and in their guileless blindness the women were nothing loth to take cheer from the fellows dubious smile his confidence was not misplaced for hardly had he got back to the village and stepped into the houses one after one making his own covert investigations while he sandwiched his shrewd questions with solace when the fishermen themselves old quilleash crennell teare and corkell and the lad davy fayle came tramping up the street then there was wild joy among the children who clung to the mens legs and some sharp nagging among the women who were by wifely duty bound to conceal their satisfaction under a proper appearance of wrath and what for had they been away all night and didnt they take shame at treating a woman like dirt and just like a man just not caring a haporth and a woman up all night and taking notions about drowning and more fool for it and when at length there came a cessation of such questions and the fishermen sat down with an awkward silence or grunted something in an evasive way about women preaching mortal and never no reason in them then the coroner began his more searching inquiries when did they run in with the cod and ling that was found lying in the tent was there a real good strike on that they went out again at halfflood last night doing much outside no he wouldnt trust but they were lying off the mooragh eh yes you say coorse coorse and good ground too and where was the captn out with them he thought so everything the coroner asked save the one thing on which his mind was set but at mention of the mooragh the women forgot their own trouble in the greater trouble that was over the parish and blurted out with many an expletive the story of the coming to shore of the body of ewan and hadnt they heard the jeel aw shocking shocking and the young pazon had sailed in their boat so he had aw terble terble the coroner kept his eyes fixed on the mens faces and marked their confusion with content they on their part tried all their powers of dissembling first came a fine show of ferocity where were their priddhas and herrings bad cess to the women the idle shoulderin craythurs did they think a man didnt want never a taste of nothin comin in off the say afther workin for them day and night same as haythen naygroes and no thanks for it it would not do and the men themselves were the first to be conscious that they could not strike fire one after another slunk out of his house until they were all five on the street in a group holding their heads together and muttering and when at length the coroner came out of old quilleashs house and leaned against the trammon at the porch and looked toward them in the darkness but said not a word their selfpossession left them on the instant and straightway they took to their heels lets away at a slant over the head and give warning to mastha dan they whispered and this was the excuse they made to themselves for their flight just to preserve a little ray of selfrespect but the coroner understood them and he set his face back toward the churchyard knowing that the deemster would be there by that time the bishop had gone through the ceremony at the graveside with composure though his voice when he spoke was full of tears and the hair of his uncovered head seemed to have passed from irongray to white his grand calm face was steadfast and his prayer was of faith and hope only beneath this white quiet as of a glacier the red riot of a great sorrow was rife within him it was then for the first time in its fulness thatundisturbed in that solemn hour by coarser fearshe realized the depth of his grief for the loss of ewan that saintly soul came back to his memory in its beauty and tenderness alone and its heat and uncontrollable unreason were forgotten when he touched on the mystery of ewans death his large wan face quivered slightly and he paused but when he spoke of the hope of an everlasting reunion and how all that was dark would be made plain and the judge of all the earth would do right his voice grew bold as with a surety of a brave resignation the deemster listened to the short nightservice with alternate restlessnesstramping to and fro by the side of the graveand cold selfpossession and with a constant hardness and bitterness of mind breaking out sometimes into a light trill of laughter or again into a hoarse gurgle as if in scorn of the bishops misplaced confidence but the crowds that were gathered around held their breath in awe of the mystery and when they sang it was with such an expression of emotion and fear that no man knew the sound of his own voice more than once the deemster stopped in his uneasy perambulations and cried whats that as if arrested by sounds that did not break on the ears of others but nothing occurred to disturb the ceremony until it had reached the point of its close and while the bishop was pronouncing a benediction the company was suddenly thrown into a great tumult it was then that the coroner arrived panting after a long run he pushed his way through the crowd and burst in at the graveside between the bishop and the deemster theyve come ashore he said eagerly the boats in harbor and the men are here twenty voices at once cried who but the deemster asked no explanation take them he said arrest them and his voice was a bitter laugh and his face in the light of the torches was full of malice and uncharity jarvis kerruish stepped out where are they he asked theyve run across the head in the line of the cross vein the coroner answered but six of us will follow them and without more ado he twisted about and impressed the five men nearest to him into service as constables how many of them are there said jarvis kerruish five sir said the coroner quilleash teare corkell crennell and the lad davy then is he not with them cried the deemster in a tone that went to the bishops heart like iron the coroner glanced uneasily at the bishop and said he was with them and he is still somewhere about then away with you arrest them quick the deemster cried in another tone but what of the warrant sir said the coroner simpleton are you waiting for that the deemster shouted with a contemptuous sweep of the hand where have you been that you dont know that your own warrant is enough arrest the scoundrels and you shall have warrant enough when you come back but as the six men were pushing their way through the people and leaping the cobble wall of the churchyard the deemster picked from the ground a piece of slatestone that had come up from the vault and scraped his initials upon it with a pebble take this token and go after them he said to jarvis kerruish and instantly jarvis was following the coroner and his constables with the deemsters legal warranty for their proceedings it was the work of a moment and the crowd that had stood with drooping heads about the bishop had now broken up in confusion the bishop himself had not spoken a shade of bodily pain had passed over his pale face and a cold damp had started from his forehead but hardly had the coroner gone or the people recovered from their bewilderment when the bishop lifted one hand to bespeak silence and then said in a tone impossible to describe can any man say of his own knowledge that my son was on the benmychree last night the deemster snorted contemptuously but none made answer to the bishops question at that moment there came the sound of a horses hoofs on the road and immediately the old archdeacon drew up he had been preaching the christmas sermons at peeltown that day and there he had heard of the death of his grandson and of the suspicions that were in the air concerning it the dour spirit of the disappointed man had never gone out with too much warmth to the bishop but had always been ready enough to cast contempt on the moonstruck ways of the man who had usurped his own place of preferment and now without contrition or pity he was ready to strike his blow at the stricken man i hear that the benmychree has put into peel harbor he said and as he spoke he leaned across his saddlebow with his russet face toward where the bishop stood well well well cried the deemster rapping out at the same time his oath of impatience as fast as a hen might have pecked and that the crew are not likely to show their faces soon the archdeacon continued then youre wrong said the deemster imperiously for theyve done as much already but what about their owner was he with them have you seen him quick let us hear what you have to say the archdeacon did not shift his gaze from the bishops face but he answered the deemster nevertheless their owner was with them he said and woe be to him i had as lief that a millstone were hung about my neck as that i stood before god as the father of that man and with such charity of comfort the old archdeacon alighted and walked away with the deemster at the horses head the good man had preached with unwonted fervor that day from the scripture which says with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again in another instant the bishop was no longer the same man conviction of dans guilt had taken hold of him thus far he had borne up against all evil shown by the strength of his great faith in his maker to bring out all things well but at length that faith was shattered when the deemster and the archdeacon went away together leaving him in the midst of the people he stood there while all eyes were upon him with the stupid bewildered look of one who has been dealt an unexpected and dreadful blow the world itself was crumbling under him at that first instant there was something like a ghastly smile playing over his pale face then the truth came rolling over him the sight was terrible to look upon he tottered backward with a low moan when his faith went down his manhood went down with it oh my son my son he cried again how have you shortened my days how have you clothed me with shame oh my son my son but love was uppermost even in that bitter hour and the good god sent the stricken man the gift of tears he is dead he is dead he cried now is my heart smitten and withered like grass ewan is dead my son is dead can it be true yes dead and worse than dead lord lord now let me eat ashes for bread and mingle my drink with weeping and so he poured out his broken spirit in a torrent of wild laments the disgrace that had bent his head heretofore was but a dream to this deadly reality oh my son my son would god i had died before i saw this day the people stood by while the unassuageable grief shook the bishop to the soul then one of themit was thormod mylechreest the bastard son of the rich man who had left his offspring to public charitytook the old man by the hand and the crowd parted for them together they passed out of the churchyard and out of the hard glare of the torchlight and set off for bishops court it was a pitiful thing to see how the old father stricken into age by sorrow rather than years tottered feebly on the way how low his white head was bent as if the darkness itself had eyes to peer into his darkened soul and yet more pitiful was it to see how the old mans broken spirit reft of its great bulwark which lay beneath it like an idol that was broken did yet struggle with a vain effort to glean comfort from its fallen faith but every stray text that rose to his heart seemed to wound it afresh as arrows in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth they shall not be ashamed oh absalom my son my son for thy sake i have borne reproach shame hath covered my face i am poor and needy make haste unto me o god hide not thy face from thy servant for i am in trouble o god thou knowest my foolishness and eli said it is the lord let him do as seemeth him good the waters have overwhelmed me the streams have gone over my soul the proud waters have gone over my soul thus tottering feebly at the side of mylechreest and leaning on his arm the bishop went his way and thus the poor dead soul of the man whose faith was gone poured forth its barren grief the way was long but they reached bishops court at last and at sight of it a sudden change seemed to come over the bishop he stopped and turned to mylechreest and said with a strange resignation i will be quiet ewan is dead and dan is dead surely i shall quiet myself as a child that is weaned of its mother yes my soul is even as a weaned child and with the simple calmness of a little child he held out his hand to mylechreest to bid him farewell and when mylechreest with swimming eyes and a throat too full for speech bent over the old mans hand and put his lips to it the bishop placed the other hand on his head as if he had asked for a blessing and blessed him goodnight my son he said simply but mylechreest could answer nothing the bishop was turning into his house when the memory that had gone from him for one instant of blessed respite returned and his sorrow bled afresh and he cried piteously the inanimate old place was in a moment full of spectres for that night bishops court had gone back ten full years and if it was not now musical with childrens voices the spirit of one happy boy still lived in it passing his people in the hall and on the stairs where tortured by suspense bewildered distracted they put their doubts and rumors together the bishop went up to the little room above the library that had once been little dannys room the door was locked but the key was where it had been for many a daythough dan in his headstrong waywardness had known nothing of thatit was in the bishops pocket inside the muggy odor was of a chamber long shut up the little bed was still in the corner and its quilted counterpane lay thick in dust dust covered the walls and the floor also and the table under the window was heavy with it shutting himself in this dusty crib the bishop drew from under the bed a glasscovered case and opened it and lifted out one by one the things it contained they were a childs playthingsa whip a glass marble a whistle an old manx penny a tomtits mossy nest with three speckled blue eggs in it some pearly shells and a bit of shriveled seaweed and each poor relic as it came up awoke a new memory and a new grief and the fingers trembled that held them the sense of a boys sport and a boys high spirits long dumb and dead touched the old man to the quick within these heavy walls the bishop replaced the glasscovered case locked the room and went down to his library but the child ghost that lived in that gaunt old house did not keep to the crib upstairs into this bookclad room it followed the bishop with blue eyes and laughter on the red lips with a hop skip and a jump and a pair of spectacles perched insecurely on the diminutive nose ten years had rolled back for the brokenhearted father that night and dan who was lost to him in life lived in his remembrance only as a beautiful bright happy spirited innocent child that could never grow older but must be a child forever the bishop could endure the old house no longer it was too full of spectres he would go out and tramp the roads the long night through up and down up and down through snow or rain under the moonlight or the stars until the day dawned and the pitiless sun should rise again over the heedless sleeping world chapter xxix by bishops law or deemsters the bishop had gone into the hall for his cloak and hat when he came face to face with the deemster who was entering the house at sight of his brother his bewildered mind made some feeble efforts to brace itself up ah is it you thorkell then you have come at last i had given you up but i am going out tonight will you not come into the library with me but perhaps you are going somewhere it was a painful spectacle the strong brain of the strong man tottering visibly the deemster set down his hat and cane and looked up with a cold mute stare in answer to his brothers inconsequent questions then without speaking he went into the library and the bishop followed him with a feeble irregular step humming a lively tuneit was salley in our alleyand smiling a melancholy jaunty bankrupt smile gilcrist said the deemster imperiously and he closed the door behind them as he spoke let us put away all pretense and talk like men we have serious work before us i promise you by a perceptible spasm of will the bishop seemed to regain command of his faculties and his countenance that had been mellowed down to most pitiful weakness grew on the instant firm and pale what is it thorkell he said in a more resolute tone then the deemster asked deliberately what do you intend to do with the murderer of my son what do i mean to do i do you ask me what i intend to do said the bishop in a husky whisper i ask you what you intend to do said the deemster firmly gilcrist let us make no faces you do not need that i should tell you what powers of jurisdiction over felonies are held by the bishop of this island as its spiritual baron more than once you have reminded me and none too courteously of those same powers when they have served your turn they are today what they were yesterday and so i ask you again what do you intend to do with the murderer of my son the bishops breath seemed suspended for a moment and then in broken accents he said softly you ask me what i intend to do with the murderer of our ewanhis murderer you say in a cold and resolute tone the deemster said again his murderer and bowed stiffly the bishops confusion seemed to overwhelm him is it not assuming too much thorkell he said and while his fingers trembled as he unlaced them before him the same sad smile as before passed across his face listen and say whether it is not so or not said the deemster with a manner of rigid impassibility at three oclock yesterday my son left me at my own house with the declared purpose of going in search of your son with what object wait at halfpast three he asked for your son at the house they shared together he was then told that your son would be found at the village before four oclock he inquired for him at the village pothouse your sons daily and nightly haunt there he was told that the man he wanted had been seen going down toward the creek the frequent anchorage of the fishingsmack the benmychree with which he has frittered away his time and your money as the parish clock was striking four he was seen in the lane leading to the creek walking briskly down to it he was never seen again my brother my brother what proof is there in that said the bishop with a gesture of protestation listen that creek under the head of orrisdale is known to the fisherfolk as the lockjaw do you need to be told why because there is only one road out of it my son went into the creek but he never left it alive how is this known thorkell how in this way almost immediately my son had gone from my house jarvis kerruish went after him to overtake him and bring him back not knowing the course jarvis had to feel his way and inquire but he came upon his trace at last and followed ewan on the road he had taken and reached the creek soon after the parish clock struck five now if my son had returned as he went jarvis kerruish must have met him patience thorkell have patience said the bishop if ewan found dan at the lockjaw creek why did not the young man jarvis find both of them there why the deemster echoed because the one was dead and the other in hiding the bishop was standing at that moment by the table and one hand was touching something that lay upon it a cry that was half a sigh and half a suppressed scream of terror burst from him the deemster understood it not but set it down to the searching power of his own words shuddering from head to foot the bishop looked down at the thing his hand had touched it was the militia belt he had left it where it had fallen from his fingers when the men brought it to him beside it half hidden by many books and papers the two small daggers lay then a little low cunning crept over the heart of that saintly man and he glanced up into his brothers face with a dissembled look not of inquiry but of supplication the deemsters face was imperious and his eyes betrayed no discovery he had seen nothing you make me shudder thorkell the bishop murmured and while he spoke he lifted the belt and dagger furtively amid a chaos of loose papers and whipped them into the door of a cabinet that stood open his duplicity had succeeded nor even the hollow ring of his voice had awakened suspicion but he sat down with a crushed and abject mien his manhood had gone shame overwhelmed him and he ceased to contend i said there was only one way out of the creek said the deemster but there are two ah the other way is by the sea my son took that way but he took it as a dead man and when he came ashore he was wrapped for seaburialby ignorant bunglers who had never buried a body at sea beforein a sailcloth of the benmychree the bishop groaned and wiped his forehead do you ask for further evidence said the deemster in a relentless voice if so it is at hand where was the benmychree last night it was on the sea last night was christmas eve a night of twenty old manx customs where were the boats crew and owner they were away from their homes today was christmas day where were the men their wives and children were waiting for some of them to eat with them their christmas dinner and drink their christmas ale but they were not in their houses and no one knew where they were can circumstances be more damning speak and say dont wring your hands be a man and look me in the face have mercy thorkell the bishop murmured utterly prostrate but the deemster went on to lash him as a brutal master whips a brokenwinded horse when the benmychree came into harbor tonight what was the behavior of crew and owner did they go about their business as they are wont to do when wind and tide has kept them too long at sea did they show their faces before suspicion as men should who have no fear no they skulked away they fled from question at this moment they are being pursued the bishop covered his face with his hands and so i ask you again resumed the deemster what do you intend to do with the murderer of my son oh dan dan my boy my boy the bishop sobbed and for a moment his grief mastered all other emotions ah see how it is you name your son and you know that he is guilty the bishop lifted up his head and his eyes flashed i do not know that my son is guilty he said in a tone that made the deemster pause but speedily recovering his selfcommand the deemster continued in a tone of confidence your conscience tells you that it is so the bishops spirit was broken in a moment what would you have me do thorkell to present your son for murder in the court of your barony man man do you wish to abase me said the bishop do you come to drive me to despair is it not enough that i am bent to the very earth with grief but that you of all men should crush me to the dust itself with shame think of itmy son is my only tie to earth i have none left but him and because i am a judge in the island as well as its poor priest i am to take him and put him to death then his voice which had been faint grew formidable what is it you mean by this cruel torture if my son is guilty must his crime go unpunished though his fathers hand is not lifted against him for what business are you yourself on this little plot of earth you are here to punish the evildoer it is for you to punish him if he is guilty but no for you to do that would be for you to be merciful mercy you will not show to him or me and to make a crime that is terrible at the best thrice shameful as well you would put a father as judge over his son man man have you no pity no bowels of compassion think of it my son is myself life of my life can i lop away my right hand and still keep all my members only think of it thorkell thorkell my brother think of it i am a father and so are you could you condemn to death your own son the sonorous voice had broken again to a sob of supplication yes you are a father said the deemster unmoved but you are also a priest and a judge your son is guilty of a crime who says he is guilty yourself said as much a moment since have i said so what did i say they had no cause of quarreldan and ewan they loved each other but i can not think my head aches i fear my mind is weakened by these terrible events the bishop pressed his forehead hard like a man in bodily pain but the deemster showed no ruth it is now for you to put the father aside and let the priestjudge come forward it is your duty to god and your church cast your selfish interests behind you and quit yourself like one to whom all eyes look up the bishop has a sacred mission fulfil it you have punished offenders against gods law and the churchs rule beforetime dont let it be said that the laws of god and church are to pass by the house of their bishop pity pity have pity the bishop murmured set your own house in order or with what courage will you ever again dare to intrude upon the houses of your people now is your time to show that you can practise the hard doctrine that you have preached send him to the scaffoldyes to the scaffold the bishop held up his two hands and cried listen listen what would it avail you though my sons life were given in forfeit for the life of your son you never loved ewan ah it is true as heaven is my witness you never loved him while i shall have lost two sons at a blow are you a christian to thirst like this for blood it is not justice you want it is vengeance but vengeance belongs to god is he not guilty the deemster answered and is it not your duty and mine to punish the guilty but the bishop went on impetuously panting as he spoke and in a faint broken tone then if you should be mistakenif all this that you tell me should be a fatal coincidence that my son can not explain away what if i took him and presented him and sent him to the gallows as you say and some day when all that is now dark became light and the truth stood revealed what if then i had to say to myself before god i have taken the life of my son brother is your heart brazed out that you can think of it without pity the bishop had dropped to his knees i see that you are a coward said the deemster contemptuously and so this is what your religion comes to i tell you that the eyes of the people of this island are on you if you take the right course now their reverence is yours if the wrong one it will be the worst evil that has ever befallen you from your youth upward the bishop cried mercy mercyfor christs sake mercy and he looked about the room with terrified eyes as if he would fly from it if he could but the deemsters lash had one still heavier blow more more he saidyour church is on its trial also and if you fail of your duty now the people will rise and sweep it away then a great spasm of strength came to the bishop and he rose to his feet silence sir he said and the deemster quailed visibly before the heat and flame of his voice and manner but the spasm was gone in an instant for his faith was dead as his soul was dead and only the galvanic impulse of the outraged thing remained and truly his faith had taken his manhood with it for he sat down and sobbed in a few moments more the deemster left him without another word theirs had been a terrible interview and its mark remained to the end like a brand of iron on the hearts of both the brothers the night was dark but not cold and the roads were soft and draggy over the long mile that divided bishops court from ballamona the old deemster walked home with a mind more at ease than he had known for a score of years it was true enough as he said that i never loved ewan the deemster thought but then whose was the fault but ewans own at every step he was against me and if he took the side of the bishop and his waistrel son he did it to his own confusion and he had his good parts too patient and longsuffering like his mother poor woman dead and gone a little like my old father also the simple soul with fire too and rather headstrong at times i wonder how it all happened then as he trudged along through the dark roads his mind turned full on dan he must die he thought with content and a secret satisfaction by bishops law or deemsters he can not fail but be punished with death and so this is the end he was to have his foot on my neck some day so much for the brave vaunt and prophecy and when he is dead my fate is broken tut who talks of fate in these days idle chatter and balderdash when the deemster got to ballamona he found the coroner quayle the gyke in the hall awaiting him jarvis kerruish was on the settle pushing off his slushcovered boots with a bootjack why what hows this said the deemster theyve escaped us so far said the coroner meekly escaped you what in this little rathole of an island and theyve escaped you we gave them chase for six miles sir theyve taken the mountains for it up past the sherragh vane at sulby and under snaefell and beinnyphottthats their way sir and it was black dark up yonder and we had to leave it till the morrow well take them sir make yourself easy had any one seen them is he with them old moore the miller at sulby saw them as they went by the mill running mortal hard but he told us no the captain wasnt among them what then youve been wasting your wind over the fishermen while he has been clearing away jarvis kerruish raised his head from where he was pulling on his slippers set your mind at rest sir he said calmly we will find him though he lies like a toad under a stone mettle mettle the deemster chuckled into his breast and proceeded to throw off his cloak then he turned to the coroner again have you summoned the jury of inquiry i have sirsix men of the parishcourthouse at ramseyeight in the morning we must indict the whole six of them you have their names jarvis will write them down for you we can not have five of them giving evidence for the sixth the deemster left the hall with his quick and restless step and turned into the diningroom where mona was helping to lay the supper her face was very pale her eyes were red with long weeping she moved to and fro with a slow step and misery itself seemed to sit on her but the deemster saw nothing of this mona he said you must be stirring before daybreak tomorrow she lifted her face with a look of inquiry we breakfast at halfpast six and leave in the coach at seven with a puzzled expression she asked in a low tone where they were to go to ramsey for the court of inquiry he answered with complacency monas left hand went up to her breast and her breath came quick but why am i to go she asked timidly because in cases of this kind when the main evidence is circumstantial it is necessary to prove a motive before it is possible to frame an indictment well father monas red eyes opened wide with a startled look and their long lashes trembled well girl you shall prove the motive the deemster opened the snuffhorn on the mantelshelf i am to do so the deemster glanced up sharply under his spectacles yes you childyou he said with quiet emphasis and lifted his pinch of snuff to his nose monas breast began to heave and all her slight frame to quiver father she said faintly do you mean that i am to be the chief witness against the man who took my brothers life well perhaps but we shall see and now for supper and then to bed for we must be stirring before the lark mona was going out of the room with a heavy step when the deemster who had seated himself at the table raised his eyes wait he said when were you last out of the house yesterday morning sir i was at the plowing match have you had any visitors since five last night visitorsfivei do not understand that will do child jarvis kerruish came into the room at this moment he was the deemsters sole companion at supper that night and so ended that terrible christmas day chapter xxx the deemsters inquest it was at the late dawn of the following morning that dan mylrea escaped from his nightlong burial in the shaft of the disused lead mine on his way to ballamona he went by the little shed where mrs kerruish lived with her daughter mally the sound of his footstep on the path brought the old woman to the doorway asking pardon sir the old body said and which way may you be going dan answered that he was going to ballamona not to the deemsters yes och no why dye say well my daughter was away at the street last nightwhere she allis is o nights mores the pity leaving me a lone woman to fret and fidgetand there in the house where they tell all newses the guzzling craythurs they were sayin as maybe it was yourself as shouldnt trouble the deemster for a bit of a spell longer dan took no further heed of the old womans warning than to thank her as he passed on when he got to ballamona the familiar place looked strange and empty he knocked but there was no answer he called but there was no reply presently a foot on the gravel woke the vacant stillness it was hommybeg and at sight of dan he lifted both his hands then amid many solemn exclamations slowly disjointedly explaining excusing hommy told what had occurred and no sooner had dan realized the business that was afoot and that the deemster with jarvis kerruish and mona were gone to ramsey on a court of inquiry touching ewans death than he straightway set his face in the same direction the court begins its business at eight you say well goodby hommy and god bless you he said and turned sharply away but he stopped suddenly and came back the pace or two wait let us shake hands old friend we may not have another chance goodby in a moment dan was going at a quick pace down the road it was a heavy morning the mists were gliding slowly up the mountains in grim hooded shapes their long white skirts sweeping the meadows as they passed overhead the sky was dim and empty underfoot the roads were wet and thick but dan felt nothing of this wintry gloom it did not touch his emancipated spirit his face seemed to open as he walked and his very stature to increase he reflected that the lumbering coach which carried the deemster and his daughter and bastard son must now be far on its way through the ruts of this rough turnpike that lay between michael and ramsey and he pushed on with new vigor he passed few persons on the roads the houses seemed to be deserted here or there a little brood of children played about a cottage door he hailed them cheerily as he went by and could not help observing that when the little ones recognized him they dropped their play and huddled together at the threshold like sheep affrighted as he passed into ballaugh under the foot of glen dhoo he came upon corlett ballafayle the great man opened his eyes wide at sight of dan and made no answer to his salutation but when dan had gone on some distance he turned as if by a sudden impulse and hailed him with scant ceremony ay why do you take that road dan twisted his head but he did not stop and corlett ballafayle laughed in his throat at a second and more satisfying reflection and then without waiting for an answer to his question he waved the back of one hand and said all right follow on its nothing to me dan had seen the flicker of goodwill followed by the flame of uncharity that flashed over the mans face but he had no taste or time for parley pushing on past the muggy inn by the bridge past the smithy that stood there and the brewery that stood opposite he came into the village there the women standing at their doors put their heads together looked after him and whispered and like corlett ballafayle forgot to answer his greeting it was then that over his newfound elevation of soul dan felt a creeping sense of shame the horror and terror that had gone before had left no room for the lower emotion overwhelmed by a crushing idea of his guilt before god he had not realized his position in the eyes of his fellowmen but now he realized it and knew that his crime was known he saw himself as a hunted man a homeless friendless wanderer on the earth a murderer from whom all must shrink his head fell into his breast as he walked his eyes dropped to the ground he lifted his face no more to the faces of the people whom he passed and gave none his salutation the mists lifted off the mountains as the morning wore on and the bald crowns were seen against the empty sky dan quickened his pace when he came to sulby it had almost quickened to a run and as he went by the mill in the village he noticed that old moore the miller who was a squareset middleaged man with a heavy jowl stood at the open door and watched him he did not lift his eyes but he was conscious that moore turned hurriedly into the mill and that at the next instant one of his men came as hurriedly out of it in a few minutes more he was at the bridge that crosses the sulby river and there he was suddenly confronted by a gang of men with moore at their head they had crossed the river by the ford at the millside and running along the southern bank of it had come up to the bridge at the moment that dan was about to cross it from the road armed with heavy sticks which they carried threateningly they called on dan to surrender himself dan stopped looked into their hot faces and said men i know what you think but you are wrong i am not running away i am going to ramsey courthouse at that the men laughed derisively and the miller said with a grin that if dan was on his road to ramsey they would take the pleasure of his company just to see him safely landed there dans manner was quiet he looked about him with calm but searching looks at the opposite bank of the river close to the foot of the bridge there was a smithy at that moment the smith was hooping a cartwheel and his striker set down his sledge and tied up his leather apron to look on and listen men said dan again in a voice that was low but strong and resolute it is the truth that i am on my way to ramsey courthouse but i mean to go alone and dont intend to allow any man to take me there as a prisoner a likely tale said the miller and with that he stepped up to dan and laid a hand upon his arm at the next moment the man of flour had loosed his grip with a shout and his white coat was rolling in the thick mud of the wet road then the other men closed around with sticks uplifted but before they quite realized what they were to do dan had twisted some steps aside darted through them laid hold of the smiths sledge swung it on his shoulder and faced about now men he said as calmly as before none of you shall take me to ramsey and none of you shall follow me there i must go alone the men had fallen quickly back dans strength of muscle was known and his stature was a thing to respect they were silent for a moment and dropped their sticks then they began to mutter among themselves and ask what it was to them after all and what for should they meddle and what was a few shillin anyway dan and his sledge passed through the encounter had cost him some minutes of precious time but the ardor of his purpose had suffered no abatement from the untoward event though his heart was the heavier for it and the dreary day looked the darker near the angle of the road that turns to the left to ramsey and to the right to the sherragh vane there was a little thatched cottage of one story with its window level with the road it was the house of a cobbler named callister a lean hungry elderly man who lived there alone under the ban of an old rumor of evil doings of some sort in his youth dan knew the poor soul such human ruins had never been quarry to him the bighearted scapegrace and now drawing near he heard the beat of the old mans hammer as he worked the hammering ceased and callister appeared at his door captn he stammered do you knowdo you know he tried to frame his words and could not and at last he blurted out quayle the gyke drove by an hour ago dan knew what was in the heart of the poor battered creature and it touched him deeply he was moving off without speaking merely waving his hand for answer and adieu when the cobblers dog as lean and hungry as its master to look upon came from the house and looked up at dan out of its rheumy eyes and licked his hand the cobbler still stood at his door fumbling in his fingers his cuttingknife worn obliquely to the point and struggling to speak more plainly the whitehaven packet leaves ramsey tonight captn he said dan waved his hand once more his heart sank yet lower only by the very dregs of humanity the very quarry of mankind and by the dumb creatures that licked his hand was his fellowship rewarded thus had he wasted his fidelity and thrown his loyalty away in a day he had become a hunted man so much for the worlds gratitude and even the worlds pity and yet shunned or hunted a mark for the finger of shame or an aim for the hand of fate he felt as he had felt before bound by strong ties to his fellowcreatures he was about to part from them he was meeting them for the last time not even their coldest glance of fear or suspicion made a call on his resolution at every step his impatience became more lively through lezayre and past milntown he walked at a quick pace he dared not run lest his eagerness should seem to betray him and he should meet with another such obstacle as kept him back at sulby bridge at length he was walking through the streets of ramsey he noticed that most of the people who passed him gave him a hurried and startled look and went quickly on he reached the courthouse at last groups stood about the saddle inn and the south side of the enclosure within the rails was crowded the clock in the church tower in the marketplace beyond was striking nine it was while building that square tower twenty years before that the mason looney had dropped to his knees on the scaffold and asked the blessing of the bishop as he passed to the bishops son the clock of the tower seemed now to be striking the hour of doom the people within the rails of the courtyard fell aside as dan pushed his way through and the dull buzz of their gossip fell straightway to a great silence but those who stood nearest the porch were straining their necks toward the inside of the courthouse in an effort to see and hear standing behind them for an instant dan heard what was said in whispers by those within to those without and thus he learned what had been done the deemsters inquest had been going on for an hour first the landlady of the three legs of man had sworn that at about three oclock on christmas eve parson ewan had inquired at her house for mr dan mylrea and had been directed to the creek known sometimes as the lockjaw then the butcher from the shambles in the lane had sworn that parson ewan had passed him walking toward the creek and the longshore fishermen who brought the body to bishops court gave evidence as to when ten oclock on christmas morning and where the coral ground for herrings called the mooragh it came ashore after these jarvis kerruish had sworn to following parson ewan within half an hour of the deceased leaving ballamona to hearing a loud scream as he approached the lane leading to orris head and to finding at the creek the fisherlad davy fayle whose manner awakened strong suspicion when he was questioned as to whether he had seen parson ewan and his master mr daniel mylrea the wife of one of the crew of the benmychree had next been called to say that the fishingboat had been at sea from highwater on christmas eve the woman had given her evidence with obvious diffidence and some confusion repeating and contradicting herself being sharply reprimanded by the deemster and finally breaking down into a torrent of tears when she had been removed the housekeeper at the old ballamona an uncomfortable bewildered old body stated that mr dan mylrea had not been home since the early morning on the day before christmas day finally the harbormaster at peel had identified the sailcloth in which the body had been wrapped as a drift yawlsail of the benmychree and he had also sworn that the lugger of that name had come into the harbor at lowwater the previous night with the men quilleash teare corkell crennell and davy fayle as well as the owner mr dan mylrea aboard of her without waiting to hear more dan made one great call on his resolution and pushed his way through the porch into the courthouse then he realized that there was still some virtue left in humanity no sooner had the people in the court become aware of his presence among them than one stepped before him as if to conceal him from those in front while another tapped him on the shoulder and elbowed a way out beckoning him to follow as if some pressing errand called him away but dans purpose was fixed and no cover for cowardice availed to shake it steadfast and silent he stood at the back of the court half hidden by the throng about him trying to look on with a cool countenance and to fix his attention on the proceedings of his own trial at first he was conscious of no more than the obscurity of the dusky place and a sort of confused murmur that rose from a table at the farther end for a while he looked stupidly on and even trembled slightly but all at once he found himself listening and seeing all that was going on before him the courthouse was densely crowded on the bench sat the deemster his thin quick face as sharp as a pen within his heavy wig jarvis kerruish and quayle the coroner stood at a table beneath stretched on the top of this table was a canvas sail six men from michael sat to the right as a jury but dans eyes passed over all these as if scarcely conscious of their presence and turned by an instinct of which he knew nothing toward the witnessbox and there mona herself was now standing her face was very pale and drawn hard about the lips which were set firm though the nostrils quivered visibly she wore a dark cloak of halfconventual pattern with a hood that fell back from the close hat that sat like a nuns cap about her smooth forehead erect she stood with the fire of two hundred eager eyes upon her but her bosom heaved and the fingers of her ungloved hand gripped nervously the rail in front of her in an instant the thin shrill voice of the deemster broke on dans consciousness and he knew that he was listening to his own trial with mona put up to give evidence against him when did you see your brother last on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at what hour at about two oclock what passed between you at that interview there was no answer to this question tell the jury if there was any unpleasantness between you and your brother at two oclock the day before yesterday there was a pause and then the silence was broken by the reply meekly spoken it is true that he was angry what was the cause of his anger another pause and no answer the deemster repeated his question and still there was no reply listen on your answer to this question the burden of the indictment must rest circumstance points but too plainly to a crime it points to one man as perpetrator of that crime and to five other men as accessories to it but it is necessary that the jury should gather an idea of the motive that inspired it and so i ask again what was the difference between you and your brother at your interview on the afternoon of the day before yesterday there was a deep hush in the court a gloomy echoless silence like that which goes before a storm seemed to brood over the place all eyes were turned to the witnessbox answer said the deemster with head aslant i ask for an answeri demand it then the witness lifted up her great soft liquid eyes to the deemsters face and spoke is it the judge or the father that demands an answer she said the judge the judge the deemster replied with emphasis we know of no father here at that the burden that had rested on monas quivering face seemed to lift away then if it is the judge that asks the question i will not answer it the deemster leaned back in his seat and there was a low rumble among the people in the court dan found his breath coming audibly from his throat his fingernails digging trenches in his palms and his teeth set so hard on his lips that both teeth and lips were bleeding after a moments silence the deemster spoke again but more softly than before and in a tone of suavity if the judge has no power with you make answer to the father and he repeated his question amid silence that was painful mona said in a tremulous voice it is not in a court of justice that a father should expect an answer to a question like that then the deemster lost all selfcontrol and shouted in his shrill treble that whether as father or judge the witnesss answer he should have that on that answer the guilty man should yet be indicted and that even as it would be damning to that man so it should hang him the spectators held their breath at the deemsters words and looked aghast at the livid face on the bench they were accustomed to the deemsters fits of rage but such an outbreak of wrath had never before been witnessed the gloomy silence was unbroken for a moment and then there came the sound of the suppressed weeping of the witness stop that noise said the deemster we know for whom you shed your tears but you shall yet do more than cry for the man if a word of yours can send him to the gallows that word shall yet be spoken dan saw and heard all the dark place the judge the jury the silent throng seemed to swim about him for a moment he struggled with himself scarcely able to control the impulse to push through and tear the deemster from his seat at the next instant with complete selfpossession and strong hold of his passions he had parted the people in front of him and was making his way to the table beneath the bench dense as the crowd was it seemed to open of itself before him and only the low rumble of many subdued voices floated faintly in his ear he was conscious that all eyes were upon him but most of all that mona was watching him with looks of pain and fear he never felt stronger than at that moment long enough he had hesitated and too often he had been held back but now his time was come he stopped in front of the table and said in a full clear voice i am here to surrenderi am guilty the deemster looked down in bewilderment but the coroner recovering quickly from his first amazement bustled up with the air of a constable making a capture and put the fetters on dans wrists what happened next was never afterward rightly known to any of the astonished spectators the deemster asked the jury for their verdict and immediately afterward he called on the clerk to prepare the indictment is it to be for this man only or for all six the clerk asked all six the deemster answered then the prisoner spoke again deemster he said the other men are innocent where are they i do not know if innocent why are they in hiding i tell you sir they are innocent their only fault is that they have tried to be loyal to me were they with you when the body was buried dan made no answer did they bury it still no answer the deemster turned to the clerk the six deemster dan said with stubborn resolution why should i tell you what is not true i have come here when like the men themselves i might have kept away you have come here prisoner when the hand of the law was upon you when its vengeance was encircling you entrapping you when it was useless to hold out longer you have come here thinking to lessen your punishment by your surrender but you have been mistaken a surrender extorted when capture is certain like a confession made when crime can not be denied has never yet been allowed to lessen the punishment of the guilty nor shall it lessen it now then as the deemster rose a cry rang through the court it was such a cry out of a great heart as tells a whole story to a multitude in a moment the people saw and knew all they looked at the two who stood before them dan and mona the prisoner and the witness with eyes that filled and from their dry throats there rose a deep groan from their midst i tell you deemster it is false and the men are innocent said dan the clerk was seen to hand a document to the deemster who took a pen and signed it the accused stands committed for trial at the court of general jail delivery at the next moment the deemster was gone chapter xxxi father and son the prison for felons awaiting trial in the civil courts was in castle rushen at castletown but dan mylrea was not taken to it there had been a general rising in the south of the island on the introduction of a coinage of copper money and so many of the rioters had been arrested and committed for trial without bail at the court of general jail delivery that the prison at castle rushen was full to overflowing twenty men had guarded the place day and night being relieved every twentyfour hours by as many more from each parish in rotation some of them the kith and kin of the men imprisoned and all summoned to castletown in the morning by the ancient mode of fixing a wooden cross over their doors at night owing to this circumstance the deemster made the extraordinary blunder of ordering his coroner to remove dan to the prison beneath the ruined castle at peeltown now the prison on st patricks islet had for centuries been under the control of the spiritual courts and was still available for use in the execution of the ecclesiastical censures the jailer was the parish sumner and the sole governor and director was the bishop himself all this the deemster knew full well and partly in defiance of his brothers authority partly in contempt of it but mainly in bitter disdain of his utter helplessness where his sons guilt was manifest and confessed he arrogated the right without sanction from the spiritual powers of committing dan to the church prison the civil prison being full it was a foul and loathsome dungeon and never but once had bishop mylrea been known to use it dark small damp entered by a score of narrow steps down under the vaults on the floor of the chapel over the long runnels made in the rock by the sea it was as vile a hole as the tyranny of the church ever turned into a jail for the punishment of those who resisted its authority the sumner in charge was old paton gorry of kirk patrick a feeble soul with a vast respect for authority and no powers of nice distinction between those who were placed above him when he received the deemsters warrant for dans committal he did not doubt its validity and when quayle the coroner for his own share ordered that the prisoner should be kept in the close confinement of the dungeon he acquiesced without question if dans humiliation down to this moment had not been gall and wormwood to his proud and stubborn spirit the fault did not lie at the door of quayle the gyke every indignity that an unwilling prisoner could have been subjected to dan underwent from the moment of leaving the courthouse at ramsey dan was pushed and huddled and imperiously commanded with such an abundant lack of need and reason that at length the people who crowded the streets or looked from their windowsthe same people many of them who had shrunk from dan as he entered the townshouted at the coroner and groaned at him but dan himself who had never before accepted a blow from any man without returning it was seen to walk tamely by the coroners side towering above him in great stature but taking his rough handling like a child at his knees at the door of the prison where quayles function ended that of the sumner began and old gorry was a man of another mold twenty times he had taken charge of persons imprisoned six days for incontinence and once he had held the governors wife twelve hours for slander and once again a fighting clergyman seven days for heresies in looking toward rome but never before had he put man woman or child into the pestilential hole under the floor of the old chapel dan he remembered since the bishops son was a boy in corduroys and when the rusty key of the dungeon turned on him with a growl in its wards and old gorry went shivering to the guardroom above and kindled himself a fire there and sat and smoked the good man under his rough surtout got the better of the bad jailer then down he went again and with a certain shamefacedness some halfcomic halfpathetic efforts of professional reserve he said he wouldnt object not he if dan had a mind to come up and warm himself but dan declined with words of cold thanks no gorry he said i dont know that i feel the cold oh all right all right sit ye there sit ye there said gorry he whipped about with as much of largeness as he could simulate rattled his keys as he went back and even hummed a tune as he climbed the narrow stairs but warming itself at the fire the poor human nature in the old mans breast began to tear him pitilessly he could get no peace for memories that would arise of the days when dan plagued him sorely the sad little happy dog then up he rose again and down he went to the dungeon once more i respects the ould bishop he said just by way of preliminary apology and to help him to carry off his intention and if it be so that a man has done wrong i dont seei dont see he stammered it isnt natheral that he should be starved alive anyway and a cold winters night too its no more than i deserve dan mumbled and at that word old gorry whipped about as before repeating loftily sit ye there sit ye there it was not for him to cringe and sue to a prisoner to come out of that foul hole och no and the bishops sumner inflated his choking chest and went back for another pipe but half an hour later the night had closed in and old gorry with a lantern in his hand was at the door of dans prison again to tell the truth sir he muttered i cant get lave for a wink of sleep up yonder and if you dont come up to the fire i wouldnt trust but ill be forced to stay down here in the cold myself before dan could make answer there came a loud knocking from overhead in another moment the key of the door had turned in its lock from without and gorrys uncertain footfall was retreating on the steps when dan had first been left alone in his dark cell he had cast himself down on the broad slab cut from the rock which was his only seat and bed his suspense was over the weight of uncertainty was lifted from his brain and he tried to tell himself that he had done well he thought of ewan now with other feelings than beforeof his uprightness his tenderness his brotherly affection his frequent intercession and no less frequent selfsacrifice then he thought of his own headlong folly his blank insensitiveness his cold ingratitude and last of all of his blundering passion and mad wrath all else on both sides was blotted from his memory in that hour of dark searching alone with his crimetortured no more by blind hopes of escaping its penalty or dread misgivings as to the measure of his guilthis heart went out to the true friend whose life he had taken with a great dumb yearning and a bitter remorse no cruel voice whispered now in palliation of his offense that it had not been murder but the accident of selfdefense he had proposed the fight that ended with ewans death and when ewan would have abandoned it he on his part would hear of no truce murder it was and bad as murder is at the best this murder had been of all murders most base and foul yes he had done well here alone could he know one hour of respite from terrible thoughts this dark vault was his only restingplace until he came to lie in the last restingplace of all there could be no going back life was forever closed against him he had spilled the blood of the man who had loved him with more than a brothers love and to whom his own soul had been grappled with hooks of steel it was enough and the sick certainty of the doom before him was easiest to bear it was with thoughts like these that dan had spent his first hours in prison and when old gorry had interrupted them time after time with poor little troubles about the freezing cold of the pestilential place he hardly saw through the old mans simulation into the tender bit of human nature that lay behind it a few minutes after gorry had left the cell in answer to the loud knocking that had echoed through the empty chambers overhead dan could hear that he was returning to it halting slowly down the steps with many a pause and mumbling remarks meantime as if lighting some one who came after him yes my lord its dark very dark ill set the lantern here my lord and turn the key in another moment old gorry was at dans side saying in a fearful undertone lord a massy its the bishop hisself i lied to him mortal so i didbut no usei said you were sleeping but no good at all at all he wouldnt take rest without putting a sight on you here he iscome in my lord almost before dans mind distraught by other troubles had time to grasp what gorry said the old jailer had clapped his lantern on the floor of the cell and had gone from it and dan was alone with his father dan are you awake the bishop asked in a low eager tone his eyes were not yet familiar with the halflight of the dark place and he could not see his son but dan saw his father only too plainly and one glance at him in that first instant of recovered consciousness went far to banish as an empty sophism the soothing assurance he had lately nursed at his heart that in what he had done he had done well the bishop was a changed and shattered man his very stature seemed to have shrunk and his jovian white head was dipped into his breast his great calm front was gone and in the feeble light of the lantern on the floor his eyes were altered and his face seemed to be cut deep with lines of fear and even of cunning his irresolute mouth was halfopen as if it had only just emitted a startled cry in one of his hands he held a small parcel bound tightly with a broad strap and the other hand wandered nervously in the air before him dan saw everything in an instant this then was the firstfruits of that days work he rose from his seat father he cried in a faint tremulous voice my son the bishop answered and for some swift moments thereafter the past that had been very bitter to both was remembered no more by either but the sweet oblivion was cruelly brief wait the bishop whispered are we alone and with that the once stately man of god crept on tiptoe like a cat to the door of the cell and put his head to it and listened art thou there paton gorry he asked feebly simulating his accustomed tone of quiet authority old gorry answered from the other side of the door that he was there that he was sitting on the steps that he was not sleeping but waiting my lords return the bishop crept back to dans side with the same catlike step as before you are safe my son he whispered in his low eager tone you shall leave this place it is my prison and you shall go free dan had watched his fathers movements with a sickening sense then you do not know that i surrendered he said faintly yes yes oh yes i know it but that was when your arrest was certain but nowlisten dan felt as if his father had struck him across the face that was what the deemster said he began but it is wrong listenthey have nothing against you i know all they can not convict you save on your own confession and why should you confess why dont speakdont explaini must not hear youlisten and the old man put one arm on his sons shoulder and his mouth to his ear there is only one bit of tangible evidence against you and it is here look and he lifted before dans face the parcel he carried in his other trembling hand then down he went on one knee put the parcel on the floor and unclasped the strap the parcel fell open it contained a coat a hat two militia daggers and a large heavy stone look the bishop whispered again in a note of triumph and as he spoke a grin of delight was struck out of his saintly old face dan shuddered at the sight where did you get them he asked the bishop gave a little grating laugh they were brought me by some of my good people he answered oh yes good people all of them and they will not tell oh no they have promised me to be silent promised you yeslisten again last nightit was dark i think it must have been past midnighti went to all their houses they were in bed but i knocked and they came down to me yes they gave me their wordon the book they gave it good people alljabez the tailor stean the cobbler juan of ballacry and thormod in the street i remember every man of them father do you say you went to these peoplethese the very riffraff of the islandyou went to themyou and at midnightand begged them hush it is nothing why not but this is important the bishop who was still on his knees was buckling up the parcel again you can sink it in the sea did you mark the stone that will carry it to the bottom and when you are in the boat it will be easy to drop everything overboard the boat ah have i not told you thormod mylechreestyou remember him a good man thormoda tender heart too and wronged by his father poor misguided man well mylechreest has promisedi have just left himto come down to the harbor at nine tonight and take the fishingsmack the benmychree and bring her round to the west coast of st patricks islet and cast anchor there and then come ashore in the boat and wait for you wait for me father yes for this prison is mine and i shall open its doors to whomsoever it pleases me to liberate look the bishop rose to his full height threw back his head and with a feeble show of his wonted dignity strode to the door of the cell and cried in a poor stifled echo of his accustomed strong tone paton gorry open thou this door old gorry answered from without and presently the door was opened wider the door was thrown wide now give me the keys paton gorry said the bishop with the same assumption of authority old gorry handed his keys to the bishop and get thee home and stay there old gorry touched his cap and went up the steps then with a bankrupt smile of sorry triumph the bishop turned to his son you see he said you are free let me lookwhat is the hour he fumbled for his watch ah i had forgotten i paid my watch away to poor patrick looney no matter at nine by the clock mylechreest will come for you and you will go to your boat and set sail for scotland or england or ireland oror dan could bear up no longer his heart was choking father father my father what are you saying he cried i am saying that you are free to leave this place i will not goi can not go the bishop fetched a long breath and paused for a moment he put one trembling hand to his forehead as if to steady his reeling and heated brain you can not stay he said hark do you hear the wind how it moans or is it the sea that beats on the rock outside and over our heads are the dead of ten generations but dan was suffocating with shame the desolation around the death that was lying silent above and the mother of sorrows that was wailing beneath had no terrors left for him father my father he cried again think what you ask me to do only think of it you ask me to allow you to buy the silence of the meanest hinds alive and at what a price at the price of the influence the esteem the love and the reverence that you have won by the labor of twenty years and to what end to the end that ii to the end that you may live my son remember what your fathers love has been to you no not thatbut think what it must have been to him your father would know you were alive it is true he would never never see you yes we should always be apartyou there and i hereand i should take your hand and see your face no more but you would be alive father do you call it living think if i could bear it suppose i escapedsuppose i were safe in some place far awayaustralia america anywhere out of the reach of shame and deathsuppose i were well ay and prosperous as the world goeswhat then then i should be content my son yes content and thanking god and i should be the most wretched of men only think of it and picture me there i should know though there were none to tell me i should remember it as often as the sun rose above me that at home thousands of miles away my poor father the righteous bishop that once was the leader of his people and their good father was the slave of the lowest offal of them all powerless to raise his hand for the hands that were held over him dumb to reprove for the evil tongues that threatened to speak ill and as often as night came and i tried to sleep i should see him there growing old very old and maybe very feeble and wanting an arm to lean on and good people to honor him and to make him forgetyes forget the mad shipwreck of his sons life but with eyes that could not lift themselves from the earth for secret shame tortured by fears of dishonor selftormented and degraded before the face of his god no no no i can not take such sacrifice the bishop had drawn nearer to dan and tried to take his hand when dan was silent he did not speak at once and when dan sat on his stone seat he sat beside him gentle as a child and very meek and quiet and felt for his hand again and held it though dan would have drawn it away then as they sat together nearer the old bishop crept nearer and yet nearer until one of his trembling arms encircled dans neck and the dear head was drawn down to his swelling throbbing breast as if it were a childs head still and it was a fathers part to comfort it and to soothe away its sorrows then we will go together he said after a time in a faint forlornness of voice to the utmost reaches of the earth leaving all behind us and thinking no more of the past yes we will go together he said very quietly and he rose to his feet still holding dans hand dan was suffocating with shame father he said i see all now you think me innocent and so you would leave everything for my sake but i am a guilty man hush you shall not say that dont tell me that no one shall tell me that i will not hear it the hot eagerness of the bishops refusal to hear with his ears the story of his sons guilt told dan but too surely that he had already heard it with his heart father no one would need to tell you you would find it out for yourself and think of that awful undeceiving you would take your sons part against the world believing in him but you would read his secret bit by bit day by day his crime would steal in between you like a spectre it would separate you hour by hour until at length you would be forever apart and that end would be the worst end of all no it can not be justice is against it love is against it and god i think god must be against it too god dan did not hear yes i am guilty he went on i have killed the man who loved me as his own soul he would have given his life for my life even as he gave his honor for my honor and i slew him ewan ewan my brother my brother he cried and where he sat he buried his face in his hands the bishop stood over his son with the same gentle calm that had come upon him in the cell and with not one breath of the restless fever with which he entered it once again he tried to take dans hand and to hold it and to meet with his own full orbs dans swimming eyes yes father it is right that i should die and it is necessary perhaps god will take my death as an atonement atonement or if there is no atonement there is only hell for my crime and before god i am guilty before god the bishop echoed dans words in a dull mechanical underbreath and stood a long time silent while dan poured forth his bitter remorse then he said speaking with something of his own courageous calm of voice from something like his own pure face and with some of the upright wrinkles of his high forehead smoothed away dan i will go home and think i seem to be awakening from a dreadful nightmare in a world where no god is and no light reigns but all is dark to tell you the truth dan i fear my faith is not what it was or should be i thought i knew gods ways with his people and then it seemed as if after all these years i had not known him but i am only a poor priest and a very weak old man goodnight my son i will go home and think i am like one who runs to save a child from a great peril and finds a man stronger than himself and braverone who looks on death face to face and quails not goodnight dan i will go home and pray and so he went his way the man of god in his weakness he left his son on the stone seat with covered face the lantern and the parcel on the floor and the door of the cell wide open the keys he carried halfconsciously in his hand he stumbled along in the darkness down the winding steps hewn from the rock to the boat at the little wooden jetty where a boatman sat awaiting him the night was very dark and the seas loud moan and its dank salt breath were in the air he did not see he did not hear he did not feel but there was one in that lonesome place who saw his dark figure as he passed who is there said an eager voice as he went through the deep portcullis and out at the old notched and barred door ajar but the bishop neither answered nor heard at the house in castle street near to the quay he stopped and knocked the door was opened by the old sumner ive brought you the keys paton gorry go back to your charge did you lock the doors my lord yesno noi must have forgotten i fear my mindbut it is of no moment go back patonit will be enough ill go my lord said the sumner he went back but others had been there before him chapter xxxii divination well satisfied with this days work the deemster drove from the ramsey courthouse to midday dinner with his fatherinlaw the old archdeacon taking jarvis kerruish with him mona he sent home in the lumbering car driven by the coroner it suited well with the girls troubled mind to be alone and when night fell in and the deemster had not returned the grim gloom of the lonely house on slieu dhoo brought her no terrors but toward nine oclock the gaunt silence of the place was broken and from that time until long after midnight ballamona was a scene of noise and confusion first came blind kerry talking loudly along the passages wringing her hands and crying aw dear oh mam oh goodness me mastha dan was no longer in prison he had been kidnapped four men and a boy had taken him by main force bound hand and foot he had been carried through the mountains to a lonely place and there at daybreak tomorrow he was to be shot all this and more with many details of place and circumstance kerry had seen as in a flash of light just as she was raking the ashes on the fire preparatory to going to bed mona had gone through too much to be within touch of the blind womans excitement we must not give way to these fancies kerry she said fancies mam fancies youre saying scoffers may mock but dont you mambrought up with my own hand as the saying is i did not mean to mock kerry but we have so many real troubles that it seems wicked to imagine othersand perhaps a little foolish too at that word the sightless face of kerry grew to a great gravity foolish mam it is the giftthe gift of the good god he made me blind but he gave me the sights it would have been hard and maybe a taste cruel to shut me up in the dark and every living craythur in the light but he is a just god and a merciful as the saying is and he gave me the gift for recompense my good kerry i am so tired tonight and must go to bed aw yes and well it has sarved me time upon time we were up before six this morning kerry and now i say to you send immadient mam or the lord help the blind womans excitement and monas impassibility were broken in upon by the sound of a mans voice in the hall asking sharply for the deemster at the next moment quayle the coroner was in the room his face was flushed his breath came quick and his manner betrayed extreme agitation when the deemster comes home from kirk andreas tell him to go across to bishops court at once and say that i will be back before midnight so saying the coroner wheeled about without ceremony and was leaving the room what has happened at bishops court mona asked nothing he said impatiently then why should i tell him to go there the tone of the question awakened the curmudgeons sense of common policy well if you must know that man has escaped and im thinking the bishop himself has had his foot in the mischief then kerry with a confused desire to defend the bishop interrupted and said the bishops not at the coortlet me tell ye that whereupon the coroner smiled with a large dignity and answered i know it woman when did this happen said mona not an hour ago i am straight from peeltown this minute and without more words the coroner turned his back on her and was gone in an instant when quayle had left the room kerry lifted both hands her blind face wore a curious expression of mingled pride and fear it is the gift she said in an awesome whisper mona stood a while in silence and perplexity and then she said in tremulous voice kerry dont think me among those that scoff but tell me over again my good kerry and forgive me and kerry told the story of her vision afresh and mona now listened with eager attention and interrupted with frequent questions who where the four men and the boy never saw their faces before never not in the street no never heard their voices ah surely you remember their voices yes yes try to recall them try try my good kerry ah the fishermenthey were the voices of the fishermen how were you so long in remembering quilleash yes old billy and crennell yes and teare and corkell and the boy davy fayle poor young davy he was one of them yes oh you dear good kerry monas impassibility was gone and her questions like her breath came hot and fast and now tell me what place they took him to the mountains yes but where never saw the place before in all your life why no of course not how could you kerry ah dont mind what i say and dont be angry but what kind of place quick kerry quick kerrys blind face grew solemn and one hand with outstretched finger she raised before her as though to trace the scene in the air as she described the spot in the mountains where the four men and the boy had taken dan it was a great lone place mam with the sea aboth sides of you and a great large mountain aback of you and a small low one in front and a deep strame running under you through the gorse and another shallow one coming into it at a slant and all whins and tussocks of the lush grass about and maybe a willow by the waters side with the sallybirds hanging dead from the boughs and never a stick nor a sign of a house nor a barn but the ould tumbled cabin where they took him and only the seas roar afar away and the sheeps bleating and maybe the mountain geese cackling and all to that mona had listened at first with vivid eagerness and a face alive with animation but as kerry went on the girls countenance saddened she fell back a pace or two and said in a tone of pain and impatience oh kerry you have told me nothing what you say describes nearly every mountaintop in the island was there nothing else nothing think what about the tumbledown house had it a roof yes no one living in it no buildings about it a shafthead and gear oh kerry how slow you are quick dear kerry an old mine a workedout mine oh think and be sure then the solemnity of the blind womans face deepened to a look of inspiration think no need to think she said in an altered tone lord bless me i see it again there there it isthere this very minute she sunk back into a chair and suddenly became motionless and stiff her sightless eyes were opened and for the first few moments that followed thereafter all her senses seemed to be lost to the things about her in this dreamstate she continued to talk in a slow broken fearsome voice exclaiming protesting and halfsobbing at first mona looked on in an agony of suspense and then she dropped to her knees at kerrys feet and flung her arms about the blind woman with the cry of a frightened bird kerry kerry she called as if prompted by an unconscious impulse to recall her from the trance that was awful to look upon and in that moment of contact with the seer she suffered a shock that penetrated every fibre she shuddered the cry of pain died off in her throat her parted lips whitened and stiffened her eyes were frozen in their look of terror her breath ceased to come her heart to beat and body and soul together seemed transfixed in that swift instant of insensibility the vision passed like a throb of blood to her from the blind woman and she saw and knew all half an hour later mona with every nerve vibrating with eyes of frenzy and a voice of fear was at bishops court inquiring for the bishop he is this minute home from peel said the housekeeper mona was taken to the library and there the bishop sat before the fire staring stupidly into the flame his hat and cloak had not yet been removed and a ridingwhip hung from one of his listless hands he rose as mona entered she flew to his arms and while he held her to his breast his sad face softened and the pentup anguish of her heart overflowed in tears then she told him the tangled inconsequent tale the coroners announcement kerrys vision her own strange dreamstate and all she had seen in it as she spoke the bishop looked dazed he pressed one hand on his forehead he repeated her words after her he echoed the questions she put to him then he lifted his head to betoken silence let me think he said but the brief silence brought no clearness to his bewildered brain he could not think he could not grasp what had occurred and the baffled struggle to comprehend made the veins of his forehead stand out large and blue a most pitiful look of weariness came over his mellow face and he said in a low tone that was very touching to hear to tell you the truth my dear child i do not follow youmy mind seems thick and cloudedthings run together in iti am only a feeble old man now andbut wait a flash of light crossed his troubled faceyou say you recognize the place in the mountains yes as i saw it in the vision i have been there before when i was a child i was there with dan and ewan it is far up the sulby river under snaefell and over glen crammag dont say it is foolish and womanish and only hysteria dear uncle i saw it all as plainly as i see you now ah no my child if the patriarch joseph practised such divination is it for me to call it foolishness but wait waitlet me think and then in a low murmur as if communing with himself he went on the door was left open yes the door the door was it was useless his brain was broken and would not link its ideas he was struggling to piece together the fact that dan was no longer in prison with the incidents of his own abandoned preparations for his sons escape mumbling and stammering he looked vacantly into monas face until the truth of his impotence forced itself upon her and she saw that from him no help for dan could come then with many tears she left him and hastened back to ballamona the house was in confusion the deemster and jarvis kerruish had returned and the coroner was with them in the study and what of the peeltown watch the deemster was asking sharply where was he away on some cockandbull errand sir by whose orders the bishops and what of the harbormaster when the benmychree was taken away from her moorings he also was spirited away by whom the same messengerwillasthorn the parish clerk old gorry the sumner gave up the prison keys to the bishop you say to the bishop sir and left him in the cell and found the door open and the prisoner gone upon his return just so sir what have you been doing in the matter been to ramsey sir and stationed three men on the quay to see that nobody leaves the island by the cumberland packet that sails at midnight tut man who will need the packetthe man has the fishingboat monas impatience could contain itself no longer she hurried into the study and told her tale the deemster listened with a keen quick sense he questioned crossquestioned and learned all this done he laughed a little coldly and bitterly and dismissed the whole story with contempt kidnapped no such matter escaped womanescaped and visions forsooth what pedlers french get away to bed girl mona had no choice but to go her agitation was painful her sole thought was of dans peril she was a woman and that dan was a doomed man whether in prison or out of it whether he had escaped or been kidnapped was a consideration that had faded from her view his life was in imminent danger and that was everything to her she had tried to save him by help of the bishop and failing in that direction she had attempted the same end by help of the deemster his enemy the hours passed with feet of lead until three oclock struck and then there was a knock at her door the deemsters voice summoned her to rise dress quickly and warmly and come out immediately she had not gone to bed and in two minutes more was standing hooded and cloaked in the hall the deemster jarvis the coroner and seven men were there at the porch a horse saddled and bridled was pawing the gravel mona understood everything at a glance clearly enough the deemster intended to act on the guidance of the vision which he had affected to despise evidently it was meant that she should go with the men to identify the place she had described an old lead mine under snaefell and over glen crammag dyou say yes father daybreak it was daybreak you would know the place if you saw it again yes the deemster turned to the coroner which course do you take across glen dhoo sir past ravensdale and along the mountainpath to the sherragh vane come girl mount be quick mona was lifted to the saddle the coroner took the bridle and they started away the seven men walking behind chapter xxxiii kidnapped what had happened was a strange series of coincidences early that day the crew of the benmychree in the mountain solitude where they found freezing and starving safety had sent one of their number back to sulby village to buy a quarter of meal teare was the man chosen for the errand and having compassed it he was stealing his way back to the mountains when he noticed that great companies of people were coming from the direction of ramsey lagging behind the larger groups on the road was a woman whom he recognized as his wife he attracted her attention without revealing himself to the people in front she was returning from the deemsters inquest and told what had occurred there that dan the bishops son had surrendered and that the indictment to the court of general jail delivery had been made out not only in his name but in the names of the four men and the boy of the benmychree teare carried back to the mountains a heavier burden than the quarter of meal his mates had watched for him as he plodded up the bank of the sulby river with the bag on his back when he came up his face was ominous send the lad away for a spell he muttered to old billy quilleash and davy fayle was sent to cut gorse for a fire then the men gathered around teare and heard what had happened the disaster had fallen which they foresaw what was to be done crennell with a line from a psalm was for trusting in the lord and old quilleash with an oath was for trusting in his heels after a pause teare propounded his scheme it centred in dan dan with his confession was their sole danger once rid of dan they were as free men before his confession of guilt their innocence was beyond his power to prove or their power to establish on his way up from the valley teare had hit on a daring adventure they were to break into the castle at peel take dan by force bring him up to the mountains and there give him the choice of life or death life if he promised to plead not guilty to the indictment death if he adhered to the resolution by which he had surrendered the men gathered closer about teare and with yet whiter faces teare gave his plan his scheme was complete that night they were to carry it out paton gorry was the jailer at peel castle the lad davy was the old sumners godchild davy was to go forth and smuggle gorrys keys out of the guardroom if that were found impossiblewell paton was an old man he might be put quietly out of harms wayno violenceoch no not a haporth then corkell was soninlaw of the watch at peeltown and hence the watch must take the harbormaster to the jolly herrings in castle street while they themselves teare quilleash crennell and corkell took the benmychree from her moorings at the mouth of the harbor on the west coast of st patricks isle they must bear down and run the dingey ashore then dan must be seized in his cell bound hand and foot and brought aboard with a fair windit was blowing eastsoueastthey must set sail for ramsey bay put about at lague anchor there and go ashore thatll lave it said teare to raisonable infrence that mastha dan had whipped off to england by the whitehaven packet that sails at midnight from the quay this done they were to find a horse strap the fettered man to its back fetch him into the mountains in the dark hours of the night and at daybreak try him solemnly and justly on the issue they had hit upon of life or death no violence aw no all just and straight if so be that the man was hanging them theyd do him justice man to man as fair as the backbone lies down the middle of a herring deemsters justice couldnt be cleaner no nor as clean aw yes no violence it was an intricate plan involving many risks presupposing many favorable chances perhaps it was not a logical computation of probabilities but good or bad logical or illogical probable or improbable easy of accomplishment or full of risk and peril it was the only alternative to trusting in the lord as crennell had suggested or in their heels as quilleash had preferred in the end they took it and made ready to act on it as the men arrived at their conclusion davy fayle was returning with an armful of withered gorse for a fire the first move in that nights adventure was to be made by him lave the lad to me whispered quilleash and straightway he tackled davy veracity was not conspicuous in the explanation that the old salt made poor mastha dan had been nabbed bad cess to it and jiggered up in peel castle he would be hanged sarten sure aw safe for it if some chaps didnt make an effort immadient they meant to do it too ay that very evenin wouldnt they let him help well pozzible pozzible they wasnt no objection to that thus davy fell an eager victim to a plan that was not propounded to him if saving mastha dan from the dirts that had nabbed him was the skame that was goin why nothin would hould him but he would be in it be aisy with the loblollyboy and you have him whispered old billy behind the back of his hand as he spat a long jet from his quid relieved of doubt as to their course of action they built a fire and warmed themselves and with water from the river below they made cold porridge of the meal and ate and drank and waited for the night the darkness came earlyit was closing in at four oclock then the men smothered their fire with turf and earth and set out for peeltown their course was over colden and between greeba and beary to the breast of slieu whallin and then down to st patricks isle by the foot of corrins hill it was twelve miles over hill and dale through the darkness and the muggy air of the winters night they had to avoid the few houses and to break their pace when footsteps came their way but they covered the distance in less than four hours at eight oclock they were standing together on the south of the bridge that crosses the neb river at the top of peel harbor there they separated corkell went off to the marketplace by a crooked alley from the quay to find the watch and dispose of him when the harbormaster had been removed corkell was to go to the benmychree which was moored in deep water at the end of the wooden pier open the scuttle on the south and put the lamp to it as a signal of safety to quilleash teare and crennell above the bridge on the headland opposite they were then to come aboard davy fayle took the south quay to st patricks isle it was now the bottom of the ebbtide and davy was to wade the narrow neck that divided the isle from the mainland perhaps he might light on a boat perhaps cross dryshod in half an hour he was to be on the west of the castle just under a spot known as the giants grave and there the four men were to come ashore to him in the dingey meantime he was to see old paton gorry and generally take the soundings thus they parted davy found the water low and the ford dry he crossed it as noiselessly as he could and reached the rocks of the isle it was not so dark but he could descry the dim outlines of the ruined castle a flight of steps ascended from the waters edge to the portcullis davy crept up he had prepared to knock at the old notched door under the arch but he found it standing open he stood and listened at one moment he thought he heard a movement behind him it was darkest of all under these thick walls he went on he passed the doorway that is terrible with the tradition of the moddey dhoo as he went by the door he turned his head to it in the darkness and once again he thought he heard something stir this time the sound came from before him he gasped and had almost screamed he stretched his arms toward the sound there was nothing all was still once more davy stepped forward into the courtyard his feet fell softly on the grass that grew there at length he reached the guardroom once more he had lifted his hand to knock and once more he found the door open he looked into the room it was empty a fire burned on the hearth a form was drawn up in front of it a pipe lay on a bare deal table he has gone down to the cell davy told himself and he made his way to the steps that led to the dungeon but he stopped again and his heart seemed to stand still there could now be no doubt but some one was approaching there was the faint jingle as of keys paton paton davy called fearfully there was no answer but the footsteps came on who is there he cried again in a tremulous whisper at the next instant a man passed in the darkness and davy saw and knew him it was the bishop davy dropped to his knees a moment afterward the bishop was gone through the outer gate and down the steps his footsteps ceased and then there were voices followed by the plash of an oar and then all was silence once more save for the thick boom of the sea that came up from the rocks davy rose to his feet and turned toward the steps that led down to the door of the dungeon a light came from below the door was open also and stretching himself fulllength on to the ground davy could see into the cell on the floor there was a lantern and beside it a bundle lay dan was there he was lying on the stone couch he was alone breathless and trembling davy rose again and fled out of the old castle and along the rocky causeway to a gullet under the giants grave there the men were waiting for him the place is bewitched he said with quickcoming breath and he told how every door was open and not a soul was in the castle except dan the men heard him with evident terror corkell had just told them a similar story the watch and the harbormaster had both been removed before he had gone in search of them everything seemed to be done to their hands nothing was left to them to do but simply to walk into the castle and carry out their design this terrified them its a fate corkell whispered and crennell in white awe of the unseen hand that was helping them was still for trusting in the lord thus they put their heads together quilleash was first to recover from superstitious fears come lay down and no blather he said and stalked resolutely forward carrying a sack and a coil of rope the other men followed him in silence davy was ordered to stay behind with the smallboat they found everything as the lad had left it the notched door of the portcullis was open the door of the guardroom was open and when they came to the steps of the dungeon the door there was also open a moment they stood and listened and heard no sound from below but a light regular breathing as of one man only then they went quietly down the steps and into the cell dan was asleep at sight of him lying alone and unconscious their courage wavered a moment the unseen hand seemed to be on them still i tell thee its a fate corkell whispered again over quilleashs shoulder in half a minute the sleeping man was bound hand and foot and the sack was thrown over his head at the first touch he awoke and tried to rise but four men were over his prostrate body and they overpowered him he cried lustily but there was none to hear in less time than it takes to tell it the men were carrying dan out of the cell the lantern they left on the floor and in their excitement they did not heed the parcel that lay by it over the courtyard through the gate along the ledge under the crumbling walls they stumbled and plunged in the darkness they reached the boat and pushed off ten minutes afterward they were aboard the benmychree and were beating down the bay dan recognized the voices of the men and realized his situation he did not shout again the sack over his head was of coarse fibre admitting the air and he could breathe through it without difficulty he had been put to lie on one of the bunks in the cabin and he could see the tossing light of the horn lantern that hung from the deckplanks when the boat rolled in the strong sea that was running he could sometimes see the lights on the land through the open scuttle with a fair wind for the point of ayr full sail was stretched corkell stood to the tiller and when all went smoothly the three men turned in below and lighted a fire in the stove and smoked then davy fayle came down with eyes dull and sick he had begun to doubt and to ask questions that the men could not answer what for was mastha dan tied up like a haythen and what for the sack but the men were in no humor for crossexamination no crisscrossing the imperent young idiot waistrel let him keep his breath to cool his porridge to quiet the lad the men plied him with liquor and at the second draft he was reeling drunk then he laughed a wild laugh and sang a mad song and finally stood up to dance it was a grim sight but it was soon ended and davy was put to sleep in another of the bunks then two hours passed and there was some growling and quarreling crennell and teare went up on deck quilleash remained below sitting before the stove cleaning with oil and a rag a fowlingpiece that dan had brought aboard at the beginning of the herring season sometimes he crooned a manx carval and sometimes whistled it as he worked chewing his quid meantime and glancing at intervals at dans motionless figure on the bunk with pain we record the year of our lord sixteen hundred and sixty and sayven when it so come to pass a good fishing there wass off dooglas and a wonderful sayson there was no other sound in the cabin except davys heavy breathing and the monotonous beat of the water at the boats bow dan lay as quiet as the dead never once had he spoken or been spoken to the boat was flying before the wind the sky had cleared and the stars were out and the lights on the shore could be plainly seen orrisdale jurby and the rue went by and when bishops court was passed the light in the library window burned clear and strong over the sea toward ten oclock the lighthouse on the point of ayr was rounded and then the boat had to bear down the ramsey bay in tacks before eleven they were passing the town and could see the lights of the cumberland packet as she lay by the quay it was then threequarter tide in half an hour more the lugger was put about at port lague and there dan was taken ashore by teare and crennell quilleash went with them carrying the fowlingpeace corkell and davy fayle who had recovered from his stupor were to take the benmychree back into ramsey bay to drop anchor under ballure and then to rejoin their companions at lague before twelve oclock this was to divert suspicion and to provoke the inference when the fishingboat would be found next morning that dan had escaped to england by the whitehaven packet the benmychree sailed off with corkell and davy teare went in search of a horse quilleash and crennell remained on the shore at lague with dan it was a bleak and desolate place with nothing to the south but the grim rocks of the tableland head and with never a house to the north nearer than folieu which was half a mile away the night was now bitterly cold the stars were gone the darkness was heavy and a nipping frost was in the dense atmosphere but the wind had dropped and every sound sent a dull echo through the air the two men waited and listened thus far all had gone well with them but what remained to do was perilous enough if corkell and the lad happened to be seen when coming from the boat if teare were caught in the act of borrowing a horse without leave then all would be over with them their suspense was keen presently there came up to them from the bay over the dull rumble of the waves on the shore a quick creaking sound followed by a splash and then a dead roll they knew it was the anchor being slipped to its berth soon afterward there came from the land to the south the sharp yap of dogs followed at a sharp interval by the heavy beat of a horses hoofs on the road was it teare with the horse was he pursued the men listened but could hear no other noise then there came through the dense air the muffled sound of a bell ringing at the quay it was the first of three bells that were rung on the cumberland packet immediately before it set sail the horse behind drew nearer the bell in front rang again then teare came up leading a big draft mare by the bridle he had been forced to take it from the stable at lague and in getting it away he had aroused the dogs but he had not been followed and all was safe the bell rang a third time and immediately a red light crept out from the quay toward the sea which lay black as a raven below the cumberland packet had gone at that moment corkell and davy fayle returned corkell holding davy by the neck of his guernsey the lad had begun to give signs of a mutinous spirit which the man had suppressed by force davys eyes flashed but he was otherwise quiet and calm what for is all this you young devil said quilleash what dye mean out with it quick what tricks now d his fools face what for does he look at me like that dowse that billy and bear a hand and be quiet said crennell the young paupers got the imperence of sin said quilleash then the man lifted dan on to the back of the big mare and strapped him with his covered face to the sky never a word was spoken to him and never a word did he speak lets make a slant for it said teare and he took the bridle corkell and crennell walked on either side of the horse quilleash walked behind carrying the fowlingpiece over his left shoulder davy was at his right hand the journey thereafter was long and heavy they took the path that is to the north by barrule and clag ouyre and runs above glen auldyn and winds round to the south of snaefell ten miles they plodded on in the thick darkness and the cold with only the rumbling rivers for company and with the hidden mountains making unseen ghosts about them on they went with the horse between them taking its steady stride that never varied and never failed even when the rivers crossed the path and their own feet stumbled into ruts on and on hour after hour until their weary limbs dragged after them and their gossip ceased and even their growling and quarreling was no more heard then on and still on in the gruesome silence under the breast of snaefell they came into the snow of two days ago which had disappeared in the valleys but still lay on the mountains and was now crisp under their feet it seemed as they looked down in the darkness to pass beneath them like short smoky vapor that dazed the eyes and made the head giddy still higher the sound of running waters suddenly stopped for the rivers were frozen and their voices silenced but the wind blew more strongly as they ascended the chill heights sometimes at the top of a long rise they stopped to breathe the horse and then with no sound above or around except the shrill sough of the wind in the gorse their courage began to fail ghostly imaginings would not be kept down did you ever hear the lockman said crennell beneath his breath i never come agen him said quilleash when i see anything at night on the mountains i allis lave it alone the other men shuddered and forthwith began to whistle right lustily sometimes they passed a mountain sheeppen and the sheep being disturbed would bleat sometimes a dog at a distant house would hear them and bark and even that though it was a signal of danger was also a sort of human companionship on the grim mountainside it was a dreary walk and to dan bound hand and foot on the horse it was a painful ridea cold one it could not be for the awkward motion brought warmth the night wore on and the air grew keener the mens beards became crisp with the frost at length the silent company rounded snaefell to the north of cronkyvane and beinnyphott then teare at the horses head twisted about do we take the ould mineshed for it he asked ay said quilleash their journey was almost ended the sky over the sea behind them was then dabbled with gray and a smell of dawn was coming down from the mountains chapter xxxiv a rude tribunal the course taken by the coroner and his seven men with mona on the horse came to a triangle of mountainpaths above a farm known as the sherragh vane one path wound close under the west foot of snaefell another followed the bed of the river that ran through a glen called crammag and the third joined these two by crossing the breast of beinnyphott at the acute angle of the sherragh vane the coroner drew up can any one see the lead shaft he asked none could see it the darkness had lifted away and the crown of snaefell was bare against the sky like an islet of green floating over a cloud of vapor but the mists still lay thick on the moorlands and even the high glens were obscure it must be yonder about a mile and a half up the river said the coroner the lead mine was in the southeast angle of the triangle of paths under the southwest of snaefell and the north of beinnyphott for some minutes the company was at a stand while the coroner considered their movements monas impatience was manifest let us push on she said the coroner merely eyed her largely and resumed his deliberations oh how we waste our time she said again if the lead mine is there what have we to do but reach it the coroner with an insolent smile inquired if the lady felt the cold he is in danger for his life and here we waste the precious minutes in idle talk she answered danger for his life the coroner echoed and laughed coldly then in a tone of large meaning he added possible possible and smiled at his own subtle thought monas anxiety mastered her indignation look the mist is lifting see there is the shedthere in the gap between the hills and it is the very place i saw come make hastelook it is daylight be aisy be aisy if theyre in yonder shed they are packed as safe as herrings in a barrel said the coroner then he divided his forces three men he sent down the path of the glent crammag two he left where they then stood to guard that outlet to the curraghs of the north and west two others were to creep along the path under snaefell and shut out the course to the sea and the lowlands on the south and east he himself would walk straight up to the shed and his seven men as they saw him approach it were to close quickly in from the three corners of the triangle is it smoke thats rising above the shed a fire possible he thinks hes safe ill go bail och yes and maybe eating and drinking and making aisy now men away with you within the shed itself at that moment there was as grim a scene as the eye of man has yet looked upon the place was a large square building of two rooms one on the groundlevel and the other above it the loft being entered by a trap in the floor with a wooden ladder down the wall it had once served as gearshed and office stable and store but now it was bare and empty in the wall looking east there was a broad opening without door and in the wall looking north a narrow opening without window to a hasp in the jamb of the doorway the big mare was tethered and in the draught between the two openings the lad davy with wandering mind was kindling a fire of gorse over two stones the smoke filled the place and through its dense volumes in the dusk of that vaporous dawn the faces of the men were bleared and green and haggard the four fishermen stood in a group together with old quilleash a pace to the fore the fowlingpiece in his hand its butt on the ground before him and facing him two paces in front stood dan his arms still bound to his sides his head uncovered and his legs free there was a gaunt earnestness in every face listen to me said old quilleash were going to judge and jury you but all fair and square as god is above us and doing nothing that we cant answer for when the big day comes and every man has to toe his mark dye hear what were saying sir dan hoved his head slightly by way of assent weve trapped you its true and fetched you by force thats sartin but we mean to be just by you and no violence and its spakin the truth were going to do and never a word of a lie the other men muttered ay ay and quilleash went on were chaps what believes in a friend and buckin up for them as bucks up for you and being middlin stanch and all to that but were after doing it once too often so we are said crennell and the others muttered again ay ay quilleash spat behind his hand and continued the long and short of it is that youre goin middlin straight for hanging us and it isnt natheral as were to stand by and see it done dan lifted his face from the ground i meant to do you no harm my good fellows he said quickly meanings meaning but doings doing and weve heard all thats going said quilleash youve surrendered and confessed and the presentment is agen us all and whats in for you is in for us but you are innocent men what need you fear innocent we be but where the deemster comes theres not a haporth to choose between you and us dans face flushed and he answered warmly men dont let your miserable fears make cowards of you what have you done nothing you are innocent yet how are you bearing yourselves like guilty men if i were innocent do you think i would skulk away in the mountains aisy sir take it aisy maybe youd rather run like a rat into a trap cowards well pozzible pozzible theres nothing like having a wife and a few childers for making a brave chap into a bit of a skunk but well lave cowards alone if you plaze quilleash made a dignified sweep of the back of his hand while the other men said better better why have you brought me here said dan there isnt a living sowl knows where you are and when they find youre missing at the castle theyll say youve thought better of it and escaped why have you brought me here dan repeated the whitehaven boat left ramsey after we dropped anchor in the bay last night and theyll say youve gone off to england tell me why you have brought me to this place we are alone and can do anything we like with you and nobody a haporth the wiser what do you mean to do then they told him of the alternative of life or death there was nothing against him but his own confession if he but held his tongue there was not enough evidence to hang a cat let him only promise to plead not guilty when the trial came on and they were ready to go back with him and stand beside him if not what then dan asked then well be forced said quilleash and he stopped well im saying well be forced he stopped again out with it man alive teare broke inforced to shoot him like a dog well thats only spakin the truth anyway said quilleash quietly davy fayle leapt up from the fire with a cry of horror but dan was calm and resolute men you dont know what youre asking i can not do it aisy sir aisy and think agen you see were in if youre in and whos to know whos deepest god knows it and he will never allow you to suffer weve childers and wives looking to us and who can tell how theyd fend in the world if we were gone youre brave fellows and im sorry for the name i gave you shoo lave that alone maybe we spoke back lets come to the facs they stated their case again and with calm deliberation he asked how it could mend their case if his life was taken they answered him that they would go back and surrender and stand their trial and be acquitted those four men were as solemn a tribunal as ever a man stood before for life or death not a touch of passion hardly a touch of warmth disturbed their rude sense of justice were innocent but were in it and if you stand to it we must stand to it and whats the use of throwing your life away dan looked into their haggard faces without wavering he had gone too far to go back now but he was deeply moved men he said i wish to god i could do what you ask but i can not and besides the almighty will not let any harm come to you there was a pause and then old quilleash said with quiet gravity im for religion myself and singing hymns at whiles and maybe a bit of a spell at the ould book but when it comes to trusting for life dd if i dont look for summat substantial as little was their stubborn purpose to be disturbed by spiritual faith as dans resolution was to be shaken by bodily terrors they gave him as long to decide as it took a man to tell a hundred the counting was done by teare amid dead silence of the others then it was that thinking rapidly dan saw the whole terrible issue his mind went back to the visit of the bishop to the castle and to the secret preparations that had been made for his own escape he remembered that the sumner had delivered up his keys to the bishop and that the bishop had left the door of the cell open in a quick glance at the facts he saw but too plainly that if he never returned to take his trial it would be the same to his father as if he had accepted the means of escape that had been offered him the bishop guilty in purpose but innocent in fact would then be the slave of any scoundrel who could learn of his design though his father had abandoned his purpose he would seem to have pursued it and the people whom he had bribed to help him would but think that he had used other instruments there could be only one explanation of his absencethat he escaped only one means of escapethe bishop only one way of saving the bishop from unmerited and lifelong obloquyreturning to his trial and only one condition of going back alivepromising to plead not guilty to the charge of causing the death of ewan it was an awful conflict of good passions with passions that were not bad at one moment the sophistry took hold of him that as his promise was being extorted by bodily threats it could not be binding on his honor that he might give the men the word they wanted go back to save his father and finally act at the trial as he knew to be best but at the next moment in his minds eye he saw himself in the prisoners dock by the side of these five brave fellows all standing for their lives all calmly trusting in his promise and he heard himself giving the plea that might send them to their deaths better any consequences than such treachery truth it must be at all costs truth to them and to himself and as for the bishop when did the almighty ask for such poor help as the lie of a bloodstained criminal to save the honor of a man of god it was a terrible crisis of emotion but it was brief the counting ended and quilleash called for the answer no i can not do itgod forgive me i wish i could said dan in a burst of impatience it was said the men made no reply to it there was awful quiet among them they began to cast lots five copper coins of equal size one of them marked with a cross scratched with the point of a nail they put into the bag one after one they dipped a hand and drew out a coin and every man kept his fist clenched till all had drawn the lad was not for joining but the men threatened him and he yielded then all hands were opened together the lot had fallen to davy fayle when he saw this his simple face whitened visibly and his lip lagged very low old quilleash handed him the gun and he took it in a listless way scarcely conscious of what was intended whats goin doing he asked vacantly the men told him that it was for him to do it do what he asked dazed and stupid shamefully and with a touch of braggadocio they told what he had to do and then his vacant face became suddenly charged with passion and he made a shriek of terror and let the gun fall quilleash picked the gun from the ground and thrust it back into davys hand youve got to do it he said the lots fallen to you and its bad work flying in the face of fate at first davy cried that nothing on gods earth would make him do it but suddenly he yielded took the gun quickly and was led to his place three of four paces in front of where dan stood with his arms bound at his sides his face of an ashy whiteness and his eyes fearful to look upon i cant kill him while hes tied up like that said davy loose him and then ill shoot the men had been startled by davys sudden acquiescence but now they understood it not by so obvious a ruse were they to be deceived they knew full well that dan as a free man was a match for all four of them unarmed youre meaning to fire over his head they said to davy and carried away by his excitement and without art to conceal his intention the lad cried hysterically thats the truth and so i am the men put their heads together and there was some hurried whispering at the next minute they had laid hold of davy bound him as dan was bound and put him to stand at dans side this they did with the thought that davy was now dans accomplice then again they cast lots as before this time the lot fell to quilleash he took his stand where the lad had stood and put the trigger of the gun at cock men he said if we dont take this mans life nothing will hould him but hell take ours and its our right to protect ourselves and the ould book will uphold us it isnt murder were at but justice and lord amighty ha massy on their sowls give him another chance said teare and quilleash nothing loath put his question again dan with a glance at davy answered as before with as calm a voice though his face was blanched and his eyes stood out from their sockets and his lips and nostrils quivered then there was silence and then down on their knees behind quilleash fell the three men crennel corkell and teare lord ha massy on their sowls they echoed and quilleash raised the gun never a word more did dan say and never a cry or a sign came from davy fayle but quilleash did not fire he paused and listened and turning about he said in an altered tone wheres the horse the men lifted their heads and pointed without speaking to where the horse was tethered by the doorway quilleash listened with head aslant then whose foot is that he said the men leapt to their feet teare was at the doorway in an instant god amighty theyre on us he said in an affrighted whisper then two of the others looked and saw that from every side the coroner and his men were closing in upon them they could recognize every man though the nearest was still half a mile away for a moment they stared blankly in to each others faces and asked themselves what was to be done in that moment every good and bad quality seemed to leap to their faces corkell and crennell seeing themselves outnumbered fell to a bout of hysterical weeping teare a fellow of sterner stuff without pity or ruth seeing no danger for them if dan were out of sight was for finishing in a twinkling what they had begunshooting dan flinging him into the loft above down the shaft outside or into a manurehole at the doorway that was full of slimy filth and was now halffrozen over quilleash alone kept his head and when teare had spoken the old man said no and set his lip firm and hard then dan himself no less excited than the men themselves called and asked how many they were that were coming crennell told him nineseven men and the coroner and anotherit might be a womanon a horse eight men are not enough to take six of us said dan here cut my rope and davysquick when the men heard that and saw by the light of dans eyes that he meant it and that he whose blood they had all but spilled was ready to stand side by side with them and throw in his lot with their lot they looked stupidly into each others eyes and could say nothing but in another breath the evil spirit of doubt had taken hold of them and teare was laughing bitterly in dans face crennell looked out at the doorway again theyre running were lost men he said and once more he set up his hysterical weeping dowse that said quilleash wheres your trustin now here billy said dan eagerly cut the lads rope and get into the loft every man of you without waiting to comprehend the meaning of this advice realizing nothing but that the shed was surrounded and escape impossible two of them crennell and corkell clambered up the ladder to the loft old quilleash who from the first moment of the scare had not budged an inch from his place on the floor stood there still with the gun in his hand then dan thinking to free himself by burning one strand of the rope that bound him threw himself down on his knees by the fire of gorse and wood and held himself over it until one shoulder and arm and part of his breast were in the flame for a moment it seemed as if bound as he was he must thrust half his body into the fire and roll in it before the rope that tied him would ignite but at the next moment he had leaped to his feet with a mighty effort and the rope was burning over his arm at that same moment the coroner and the seven men with mona riding behind them came up the doorway of the shed there they drew up in consternation no sight on earth was less like that they had looked to see than the sight they then beheld there in a dense cloud of smoke was davy fayle still bound and helpless pale and speechless with affright and there was dan also bound and burning over one shoulder as if the arm itself were afire and straining his great muscles to break the rope that held him quilleash was in the middle of the floor as if rooted to the spot and his gun was in his hands teare was on the first rung of the wallladder and the two white faces of corkell and crennell were peering down from the traphole above whats all this said the coroner then teare dropped back from the ladder and pointed at dan and said we caught him and were taking him back to you sir look thats the way we strapped him but he was trying to burn the rope and give us the slip dans face turned black at that word of treachery and a hoarse cry came from his throat is it true said the coroner and his lip curled as he turned to dan davy fayle shouted vehemently that it was a lie but dan shaking visibly from head to foot answered quietly and said ill not say no coroner at that quilleash stepped out but ill say no he said firmly hes a brave man he is and maybe im ony an ould rip but d me if im goin to lie like that for nobodyno not to save my own sowl then in his gruff tones sometimes faltering sometimes breaking into deep sobs and then rising to deeper oaths the old fellow told all and that night all six of themdan the four fishermen and the lad davywere lodged in the prison at castle rushen chapter xxxv the court of general jail delivery from christmastide onward through the dark months until a dream of spring came once again on the slumbering face of winter the six men lay in castle rushen rumors from within the gray walls of the jail told that some of them were restive under their punishment and that the spirits of others sank under it but that dan bore up with the fortitude of resignation and though prone to much sadness with even the cheerfulness of content it was the duty of each man to take his turn at cleaning the cell and it was said that dans turn seemed by his own counting to come frequently reproaches he bore with humility and on one occasion he took a blow from crennell who was small of stature and had a slight limp in one leg constant bickerings were rife among them and dan was often their subject of quarrel and still oftener their victim but they had cheerful hours too and sometimes a laugh together such were some of the reports that made gossip outside where public curiosity and excitement grew keener as the halfyearly sitting of the court of general jail delivery drew nearer copper riots and felonies of all descriptions disputes as to tithe and arbitrations as to the modes of counting the herrings sank out of sight in prospect of the trial of dan and his crew from point of ayr to the calf of man it was the engrossing topic and none living could remember a time when public feeling ran so high the son of the bishop was to be tried for the murder of the son of the deemster and a bigger issue could no man conceive variable enough was the popular sympathysometimes with dan sometimes against him always influenced by what way the wave of feeling flowed with regard to the deemster and the bishop and closely were these two watched at every turn the deemster showed uncommon animation and even some sprightliness he was more abroad than at any time for fifteen years before and was usually accompanied by jarvis kerruish his short laugh answered oftener to his own wise witticisms than at any time since the coming to the island of his brother the bishop but people whispered that his good spirits did not keep him constant company within the walls of his own house there his daughter mona still soft as the morning dew and all but as silent sat much alone she had grown wae as folk said rarely being seen outside the gates of ballamona never being heard to laugh and showing little interest in life beyond the crib of her fosterchild ewans orphaned daughter and people remembered her mother how silent she had been and how patient and how like to what mona was and they said now as they had said long ago shes going down the steep places the bishop had kept close to bishops court turning night into day and day into night or knowing no times and seasons he had been seen to wander at all hours up and down the glen if any passed him as he crossed the road from the glen back to the house he had seemed not to see his gray hair had grown snowy white his tall figure drooped heavily from his shoulders and his gait had lost all its spring stricken suddenly into great age he had wandered about mumbling to himself or else quite silent the chapel on his episcopal demesne he had closed from the time of the death of ewan his chaplain thus had he borne himself shut out from the world until the primrose had come and gone and the cuckoo had begun to call then as suddenly he underwent a change opening the chapel at bishops court he conducted service there every sunday afternoon the good souls of the parish declared that never before had he preached with such strength and fervor though the face over the pulpit looked ten long years older than on the christmas morning when the longshoremen brought up their dreadful burden from the mooragh convocation was kept on whittuesday as before and the bishop spoke with calm and grave power his clergy said he had gathered strength from solitude and fortitude from many days spent alone as in the wilderness with his maker here and there a wise one among his people said it might look better of him to take the beam out of his own eye than to be so very zealous in pointing out the motes in the eyes of others the world did not stand still though public interest was in suspense and now and again some girl was presented for incontinence or some man for drunkenness then it was noticed that the censures of the church had begun to fall on the evildoer with a great tenderness and this set the wise ones whispering afresh that some one was busy at sweeping the path to his own door and also that the black ox never trod on his own hoof the day of the trial came in may it was to be a day of doom but the sun shone with its own indifference to the big little affairs of men the spring had been a dry one and over the drought came heat from every corner of the island the people trooped off under the broiling sun to castletown the court of general jail delivery was held in castle rushen in the open square that formed the gateway to the prison chapel under the clear sky without shelter from any weather there the narrow space allotted to spectators was thronged with hot faces under beavers mutches and sunbonnets the passages from the castle gate on the quay were also thronged by crowds who could not see but tried to hear from the lancet windows of the castle that overlooked the gateway eager faces peered out and on the lead flat above the iron staircase and over the great clocktower were companies of people of both sexes who looked down and even listened when they could the windows of the houses around the castle gate were thrown up for spectators who sat on the sills in the rigging of the brigs and luggers that lay in the harbor close under the castle walls sailors had perched themselves to look on and crack jokes and smoke nearly the whole floor of the marketplace was thronged but under the cross where none could see or hear an old woman had set up ninepins tipped with huge balls of toffee and a score of tipsy fellows were busy with them amid much laughter and noise a line of older men with their hands in their pockets were propped against the castle wall and a young woman from ballasalla reputed to be a prophetess was standing on the steps of the cross and calling on the careless to take note that while they cursed and swore and forgot their maker six men not twenty yards away were on the brink of their graves the judges were the governor of the island who was robed the clerk of the rolls the two deemsters who wore wigs and gowns the water bailiff the bishop the archdeacon the vicarsgeneral and the twentyfour keys all these sat on a raised platform of planks the senior and presiding deemster thorkell mylrea who was the mouthpiece of the court was elevated on a central dais thorkell was warm eager and even agitated when the bishop took his seat amid a low murmur of the spectators his manner was calm and his quiet eyes seemed not to look into the faces about him the prisoners were brought in from the cell that opened to the left of the gateway they looked haggard and worn but were not wanting in composure dan towering above the rest in his great stature held his head low his cheeks were ashy but his lips were firm by his side half clinging to his garments was the lad davy and at the other end of the line was old quilleash with resolution on his weatherbeaten face crennell and corkell were less at ease but teares firmset figure and harddrawn mouth showed the dogged determination of a man who meant that day to sell his life dear sixtyeight men were present summoned from the seventeen parishes of the island to compose a jury of twelve to be selected by the prisoners over all was the burning sun of a hot day in may when the officer of the court had made the presentment and was going on to ask the prisoners to plead the proceedings were suddenly interrupted the steward of the spiritual barony of the bishop now sole baron of the island rose to a point of law one of the six prisoners who were indicted for felony was a tenant of the bishops barony and as such was entitled to trial not by the civil powers of the island but by a jury of his barony presided over by the proper president of his barony the prisoner in question was daniel mylrea and for him the steward claimed the privilege of a remand until he could be brought up for trial before the court of the lord of the barony under which he lived this claim created a profound sensation in the court dan himself raised his eyes and his face had a look of pain when asked by the deemster if the claim was put forward by his wish or sanction he simply shook his head the steward paid no attention to this repudiation this court he said holds no jurisdiction over a tenant of the bishops barony and forthwith he put in a document showing that daniel mylrea was tenant of a farm on the episcopal demesne situate partly in kirk ballaugh and partly in kirk michael the deemster knew full well that he was powerless nevertheless he made a rigid examination of the prisoners lease and finding the document flawless he put the point of law to the twentyfour keys with every hampering difficulty but the court was satisfied as to the claim and allowed it the prisoner daniel mylrea stands remanded for trial at the court of his barony said the deemster in a tone of vexation and at that trial he added with evident relish the president of the barony shall be as by law appointed assisted by a deemster dan was removed his name was struck out of the indictment and the trial of the five fishermen was proceeded with they pleaded not guilty the attorneygeneral prosecuted stating the facts so far as they concerned the remaining prisoners and reflecting at the evidence against the prisoner who was remanded he touched on the evidence of the sailcloth and then on the mystery attaching to a certain bundle of clothes belts and daggers that had been found in the prison at peel castle at this reference the steward of the barony objected as also against the depositions that inculpated dan the witnesses were fewer than at the deemsters inquest and they had nothing to say that directly criminated the fishermen brief and uninteresting the trial turned out to be with the chief prisoner withdrawn and throughout the proceedings the deemsters vexation was betrayed by his thin sharp testy voice some efforts were made to prove that dans disappearance from peel castle had been brought about by the bishop but the steward of the barony guarded so zealously the privileges of the ecclesiastical courts that nothing less than an open and unseemly rupture between the powers of church and state seemed imminent when the deemster losing composure was for pressing the irrelevant inquiry moreover the keys who sat as arbiters of points of law and to pass the verdict of the jury were clearly against the deemster the trial did not last an hour when the jury was ready to return a verdict the deemster asked in manx as by ancient usage vod y fercarree soie may the man of the chancel the bishop sit and the foreman answered fod he may the ecclesiastics remained in their seats a verdict of not guilty was returned and straightway the five fishermen were acquitted later the same day the deemster vacated his seat on the dais and then the bishop rose and took it with great solemnity that the bishop himself should sit to try his own son as he must have tried any other felon who was a tenant of his barony made a profound impression among the spectators the archdeacon who had hoped to preside looked appalled the deemster sat below and on either side were the ecclesiastics who had claimed their right to sit as judges in the civil court another jury a jury of the barony was impaneled the sergeant of the barony brought dan to the bar the prisoner was still very calm and his lips were as firm though his face was as white and his head held as low as before when a presentment was read over to him charging him with causing the death of ewan mylrea deacon in holy orders and he was asked to plead he lifted his eyes slowly and answered in a clear quiet sonorous voice that echoed from the high walls of the gateway and was heard by the people on the clock tower guilty as evidence had been taken at the deemsters inquest no witnesses were now heard the steward of the barony presented he dwelt on the prisoners special and awful criminality in so far as he was the son of the bishop taught from his youth up to think of human life as a holy thing and bound by that honored alliance to a righteous way in life then he touched on the peculiar duty of right living in one who held the office of captain of his parish sworn to preserve order and to protect life when the steward had appended to his statement certain commonplaces of extenuation based on the plea of guilty the deemster amid a dead hush among the spectators put questions to the prisoner which were intended to elicit an explanation of his motive in the crime and of the circumstances attending it to these questions dan made no answer answer me sir the deemster demanded but dan was still silent then the deemsters wrath mastered him it ill becomes a man in your position to refuse the only amends that you can make to justice for the pains to which you have put this court and another it was an idle outburst dans firm lip was immovable he looked steadily into the deemsters face and said not a word the steward stepped in the prisoner he said has elected to make the gravest of all amends to justice and at that there was a deep murmur among the people nevertheless i could wish said the steward that he would also make answer to the deemsters question but the prisoner made no sign there is some reason for thinking that if all were known where so much is now hidden the crime to which the prisoner pleads guilty would wear a less grievous aspect still the prisoner gave no answer come let us have done said the deemster twisting impatiently in his seat pronounce the sentence and let your sergeant carry it into effect the murmur among the people grew to a great commotion but in the midst of it the bishop was seen to rise and then a deep hush fell on all the bishops white head was held erect his seamed face was firm as it was pale and his voice when he spoke was clear and full daniel mylrea he said you have pleaded guilty to the great crime of murder the sergeant of your barony will now remove you and on the morning of this day next week he will take you in his safe custody to the tynwald hill in the centre of the island there in the eye of light and before the faces of all men to receive the dreadful sentence of this court and to endure its punishment chapter xxxvi cut off from the people during the week that followed the trial of daniel mylrea at the court of his barony the excitement throughout the island passed all experience of public feeling what was to be the sentence of the barony this was the one question everywhereat the inn the mill the smithy the marketcross the street in the courthouse and if two shepherds hailed each other on the mountains they asked for the last news from peel with a silent acceptance of the idea that death alone could be the penalty of the crime that had been committed there passed through the people the burden first of a great awe and then of a great dread that any christian man should die the death of hanging not for nearly twoscore years had the island seen that horror and old men shuddered at the memory of it then it came to be understood in a vague way that after all daniel mylrea was not to die whispers went from mouth to mouth that old quilleash had sailed down to the calf sound with the benmychree well stored with provisions in a few days the old salt returned walking overland preserving an air of vast mystery and shaking his head when his gossips questioned him then poor human nature that could not bear to see daniel mylrea die could not bear to see him saved either and men who had sworn in their impotent white terror that never again should a gallows be built in the island lusty fellows who had shown ruth for the first time began to show gall for the hundreth to nudge to snigger and to mutter that blood was thicker than water and there was much between saying and doing as the sayin was the compassion that had been growing in secret began to struggle with the ungentle impulses that came of superstitious fear it seemed to be true as old folk were whispering that daniel mylrea was the jonah of the island what had happened in the first year of his life a prolonged drought and a terrible famine what was happening now another drought that threatened another famine and people tried to persuade themselves that the sword of the lord was over them and that it would only rest and be quiet when they had executed gods judgment on the guilty man the day of tynwald came and the week before it had passed like a year there was no sun but the heat was stifling the clouds hung low and dark and hot as the roof of an open oven the air was sluggish and the earth looked blue far across the sea to the northwest there was a thin streak of fiery cloud and at some moments there was the smell of a thunderstorm in the heavy atmosphere from north and south from east and west the people trooped to tynwald hill never before within the memory of living man had so vast a concourse been witnessed on that ancient ground of assembly throughout the island the millwheel was stopped the smithy fire was raked over with ashes the plow lay in the furrow the sheep were turned out on to the mountains and men and women old men old women and young children ten thousand in all with tanned faces and white in sunbonnets mutches and capes and some with cloaks in preparation for the storm that was coming drove in their little springless carts or rode on their small manx ponies or trudged on foot through the dusty roads and over the bleached hillsides and the parched curraghs at ten oclock the open green that surrounds the hill of tynwald was densely thronged carts were tipped up in corners and their stores of food and drink were guarded by a boy or a woman who sat on the sternboard horses were tethered to the wheels or turned loose to browse on a common near at hand men lounged on the green and talked their hands in their pockets their pipes in their mouths or stood round the tynwald inn lifting pannikins to their lips and laughingfor there was merriment among them though the work for which they had come together was not a merry one the mount itself was still empty and twelve constables were stationed about the low wall that surrounded it keeping the crowd back and though as the people met and mingled the men talked of the crops and of the prospect for the fishing and women of the wool and yarn and boys tossed somersaults and young girls betook themselves to girlish games and girls of older growth in bright ribbons to ogling and giggling and though there was some coarse banter and coarser singing the excitement of the crowd beneath all was deep and strong at intervals there was a movement of the people toward a churchst johns church that stood a little to the east of tynwaldand sometimes a general rush toward the gate that looked westward toward peeltown and the sea earlier in the day some one had climbed a mountain beyond the chapel and put a light to the dry gorse at the top and now the fire smoldered in the dense air and set up a long sinuous trail of blue smoke to the empty vault of the sky the mountain was called greeba which is the native word for grief toward halfpast ten old paton gorry the sumner went down the narrow tortuous steps that led to the dungeon of peel castle he carried fetters for the hands and legs of his prisoner and fixed them in their places with nervous and fumbling fingers his prisoner helped him as far as might be and spoke cheerily in answer to his mumbled adieu im not going to st johns sir i couldnt give myself lave for it the sumner muttered in a breaking voice with a choking sensation in his throat daniel mylrea said god bless you paton and laid hold of the old mans hand twenty times during the week the sumner had tried in vain to prevail on the prisoner to explain the circumstances attending his crime and so earn the mitigation of punishment which had been partly promised the prisoner had only shaken his head in silence a few minutes afterward daniel mylrea was handed over in the guardroom to the sergeant of the barony and paton gorrys dutiesthe hardest that the world had yet given him to dowere done the sergeant and the prisoner went out of the castle and crossed the narrow harbor in a boat on the wooden jetty near the steps by which they landed a small open cart was drawn up and there was a crowd of gaping faces about it the two men got into the cart and were driven down the quay toward the path by the river that led to tynwald under the foot of slieu whallin as they passed through the town the prisoner was dimly conscious that white faces looked out of windows and that small knots of people were gathered at the corners of the alleys but all this was soon blotted out and when he came to himself he was driving under the trees and by the side of the rumbling water all the day preceding the prisoner had told himself that when his time came his great hour of suffering and expiation he must bear himself with fortitude abating nothing of the whole bitterness of the atonement he was to make asking no quarter enduring all contumely though men jeered as he passed or spat in his face he thought he had counted the cost of that trial seven sleepless nights and seven days of torment had he given to try his spirit for that furnace and he thought he could go through it and not shrink in his solitary hours he had arranged his plans while he drove from peel to st johns he was to think of nothing that would sap his resolution and his mind was to be a blank then as he approached the place he was to lift his eyes without fear and not let them drop though their gaze fell on the dread thing that must have been built there and so very calmly silently and firmly he was to meet the end of all but now that he was no longer in the dungeon of the prison where despair might breed bravery in a timid soul but under the open sky where hope and memory grow strong together he knew though he tried to shut his heart to it that his courage was oozing away he recognized this house and that gate he knew every turn of the riverwhere the trout lurked and where the eels sportedand when he looked up at the dun sky he knew how long it might take for the lightning to break through the luminous dulness of the thundercloud that hung over the head of slieu whallin do what he would to keep his mind a blank or to busy it with trifles of the way he could not help reflecting that he was seeing these things for the last time then there came a long interval in which the cart wherein he sat seemed to go wearily on on on and nothing awakened his slumbering senses when he recovered consciousness with a start he knew that his mind had been busy with many thoughts such as sap a mans resolution and bring his brave schemes to foolishness he had been asking himself where his father was that day where mona would be then and how deep their shame must be at the thought of the death he was to die to him his death was his expiation and little had he thought of the manner of it but to them it was disgrace and horror and so he shrunk within himself he knew now that his great purpose was drifting away like a foolish voice that is emptied in the air groaning audibly praying in broken snatches for strength of spirit looking up and around with fearful eyes he rode on and on until at length before he was yet near the end of his awful ride the deep sound came floating to him through the air of the voices of the people gathered at the foot of tynwald it was like the sound the sea makes as its white breakers fall on some sharp reef a mile away a deep multitudinous hum of many tongues when he lifted his head and heard it his pallid face became ashy his whitening lips trembled his head dropped back to his breast his fettered arms fell between his fettered legs river and sky were blotted out of his eyes and he knew that before the face of his death he was no better than a poor broken coward at eleven oclock the crowd at tynwald had grown to a vast concourse that covered every foot of the green with a dense mass of moving heads in an enclosed pathway that connected the chapel with the mount three carriages were drawn up the deemster sat in one of them and his wizened face was full of uncharity by his side was jarvis kerruish on an outskirt of the crowd two men stood with a small knot of people around them they were quilleash and teare the ballasalla prophetess with glittering eyes and hair in ringlets was preaching by the door of the inn and near her were corkell and crennell and they sang when she sang and while she prayed they knelt suddenly the great clamorous human billow was moved by a ruffle of silence that spread from side to side and in the midst of a deep hush the door of the chapel opened and a line of ecclesiastics came out and walked toward the mount at the end of the line was the bishop bareheaded much bent his face white and seamed his step heavy and uncertain his whole figure and carriage telling of the sword that is too keen for its scabbard when the procession reached the mount the bishop ascended to the topmost round of it and on the four green ledges below him his clergy ranged themselves almost at the same moment there was a subdued murmur among the people and at one side of the green the gate to the west the crowd opened and parted and the space widened and the line lengthened until it reached the foot of the tynwald then the cart that brought the sergeant and his prisoner from the castle entered it slowly and drew up and then with head and eyes down like a beast that is struck to its death daniel mylrea dropped to his feet on the ground he was clad in the blue cloth of a fisherman with a brown knitted guernsey under his coat and seaboots over his stockings he stood in his great stature above the shoulders of the tallest of the men around him and women who were as far away as the door of the inn could see the seamans cap he wore the sergeant drew him up to the foot of the mount but his bowed head was never raised to where the bishop stood above him an allconsuming shame sat upon him and around him was the deep breathing of the people presently a full clear voice was heard over the low murmur of the crowd and instantly the mass of moving heads was lifted to the mount and the sea of faces flashed white under the heaviness of the sky daniel mylrea said the bishop it is not for us to know if any hidden circumstance lessens the hideousness of your crime against all questions concerning your motive your lips have been sealed and we who are your earthly judges are compelled to take you at the worst but if in the fulness of your remorse your silence conceals what would soften your great offense be sure that your heavenly judge who reads your heart sees all you have taken a precious life you have spilled the blood of one who bore himself so meekly and lovingly and with such charity before the world that the hearts of all men were drawn to him and you who slew him in heat or malice you he ever loved with a great tenderness your guilt is confessed your crime is black and now your punishment is sure the crowd held its breath while the bishop spoke but the guilty man moaned feebly and his bowed head swayed to and fro daniel mylrea there is an everlasting sacredness in human life and god who gave it guards it jealously when man violates it god calls for vengeance and if we who are his lawgivers on earth shut our ears to that cry of the voice of god his fierce anger goes forth as a whirlwind and his word as a fire upon all men woe unto us if now we sin against the lord by falling short of the punishment that he has ordered righteously and without qualm of human mercy even as god has commanded we his servants must execute judgment on the evildoer lest his wrath be poured out upon this island itself upon man and upon beast and upon the fruit of the ground at that word the deep murmur broke out afresh over the people and under the low sky their upturned faces were turned to a grim paleness and now a strange light came into the eyes of the bishop and his deep voice quavered daniel mylrea he continued it is not the way of gods worse chastisement to take an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth and to spill blood for blood that has been spilled when the sword of the lord goes forth it is sometimes to destroy the guilty man and sometimes to cut him off from the land of the living to banish him to the parched places of the wilderness to end the days wherein his sleep shall be sweet to him to blot out his name from the names of men and to give him no burial at the last when the darkness of death shall cover him the bishop paused there was a dreadful silence and the distant sea sent up into the still air under the low clouds that reverberated like a vault a hoarse threatening murmur daniel mylrea you are not to die for your crime at that illomened word the prisoner staggered like a drunken man and lifted his right hand mechanically above his head as one who would avert a blow and now it was easy to see in the wild light in the eyes of the bishop and to hear in his hollow tense voice that the heart of the father was wrestling with the soul of the priest and that every word that condemned the guilty man made its sore wound on the spirit of him that uttered it you have chosen death rather than life but on this side of deaths darkness you have yet by gods awful will to become a terror to yourself you have water of gall to drink toilfully you have to live in a waste land alone where the sweet light of morning shall bring you pain and the darkness of night have eyes to peer into your soul and so on and on from year to weary year until your step shall fail and there shall be never another to help you up hopeless accursed finding death in life looking only for life in death and crying in the bitterness of your desolation cursed be the day wherein i was born let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed cursed be the man that brought tidings to my father saying a manchild is born unto thee making his heart glad one hoarse cry as of physical pain burst from the prisoner before these awful words were yet fully uttered the guilty man gripped his head between his hands and like a beast that is smitten in the shambles he stood in a stupor his body swaying slightly a film upon his eyes and his mind sullen and stunned there was silence for a moment and when the bishop spoke again his tempestbeaten head white with the flowers of the grave trembled visibly the terrified people were grasping each others hands and their harddrawn breath went through the air like the hiss of the sea at its ebb as they looked up at the bishop they understood that an awful struggle of human love and spiritual duty was going on before them and over all their terror they were moved to a deep compassion daniel mylrea said the bishop again and notwithstanding his efforts to uphold it his voice softened and all but broke vengeance belongs to god but we who are men and prone to fall are not to deny mercy when your fetters are removed and you leave this place you will go to the calf sound that flows at the extreme south of the island there you will find your fishingboat stored with such as may meet your immediate wants with that offering we part from you while life shall last use it well but henceforward look for no succor whence it has come though you loathe your life be zealous to preserve it and hasten not i warn you by one hour the great day of gods final reckoning most of all be mindful of the things of an eternal concernment that we who part from you now may not part forever as from a soul given over to everlasting darkness the prisoner gave no further sign then the bishop turned with a wild gesture to the right and to the left and lifted both his hands men and women of man he said in a voice that rose to the shrillness of a cry the sentence of the court of the barony of the island is that this man shall be cut off from his people henceforth let him have no name among us nor family nor kin from now forever let no flesh touch his flesh let no tongue speak to him let no eye look on him if he should be anhungered let none give him meat when he shall be sick let none minister to him when his death shall come let no man bury him alone let him live alone let him die and among the beasts of the field let him hide his unburied bones a great hoarse groan arose from the people such as comes from the bosom of a sullen sea the pathos of the awful struggle which they had looked upon was swallowed up in the horror of its tragedy what they had come to see was as nothing to the awfulness of the thing they had witnessed death was terrible but this was beyond deaths terror somewhere in the dark chambers of the memory of their old men the like of it lived as a grim gorgon from old time they looked up at the mount and the gaunt figure standing there above the vast multitude of moving heads seemed to be something beyond nature the trembling upraised hands the eyes of fire the white quivering lips the fever in the face which consumed the grosser senses appeared to transcend the natural man and below was the prisoner dazed stunned a beast smitten mortally and staggering to its fall the sergeant removed the fetters from the prisoners hands and feet and turned him about with his face toward the south not at first did the man seem to realize that he was no longer a prisoner but an outcast and free to go whither he would save where other men might be then recovering some partial consciousness he moved a pace or two forward and instantly the crowd opened for him and a long wide way was made through the dense mass and he walked through it slow yet strong of step with head bent and eyes that looked into the eyes of no man thus he passed away from the tynwald toward the foot of slieu whallin and the valley of foxdale that runs southward and the people looked after him and the bishop on the mount and the clergy below followed him with their eyes a great wave of compassion swept over the crowd as the solitary figure crossed the river and began to ascend the mountainpath the man was accursed and none might look upon him with pity but there were eyes that grew dim at that sight the smoke still rose in a long blue column from the side of greeba and the heavy cloud that had hung at poise over the head of slieu whallin had changed its shape to the outlines of a mighty bird luminous as a seagull but of a sickly saffron over the long line of sea and sky to the west the streak of red that had burned duskily had also changed to a dull phosphoric light that sent eastward over the skys low roof a misty glow and while the people watched the lonely man who moved away from them across the breast of the hill a pale sheet of lightning without noise of thunder flashed twice or thrice before their faces so still was the crowd and so reverberant the air that they could hear the mans footsteps on the stony hillside when he reached the topmost point of the path and was about to descend to the valley he was seen to stop and presently to turn his face gazing backward for a moment against the dun sky his figure could be seen from head to foot while he stood the people held their breath when he was gone and the mountain had hidden him the crowd breathed audibly at the next moment all eyes were turned back to the mount there the bishop a priest of god no longer but only a poor human father now had fallen to his knees and lifted his two trembling arms then the pentup anguish of the wretched heart that had steeled itself to a mighty sacrifice of duty burst forth in a prayer of great agony o father in heaven it is not for him who draws the sword of the lords vengeance among men to cry for mercy but rather to smite and spare not yea though his own flesh be smitten but o thou that fillest heaven and earth from whom none can hide himself in any secret place that thou shalt not see him look with pity on the secret place of the heart of thy servant and hear his cry o lord on high whose anger goes forth as a whirlwind and whose word is like as a fire what am i but a feeble broken desolate old man thou knowest my weakness and how my familiars watched for my halting and how for a period my soul failed me and how my earthly affections conquered my heavenly office and how gods rule among this people was most in danger from the servant of god who should be valiant for the lord on the earth and if through the trial of this day thou hast been strength of my strength woe is me now aged and full of days feeble of body and weak of faith that thou hast brought this heavy judgment upon me god of goodness and righteous judge of all the earth have mercy and forgive if we weep for him who goeth away and shall return no more nor see his home and kindred follow him with thy spirit touch him with thy finger of fire pour upon him the healing of thy grace so that after deaths great asundering when all shall stand for one judgment it may not be said of thy servant write ye this old man childless it was the cry of a great shattered soul and the terrified people dropped to their knees while the voice pealed over their heads when the bishop was silent the clergy lifted him to his feet and helped him down the pathway to the chapel there was then a dull murmur of distant thunder from across the sea the people fell apart in confusion before the last of them had left the green the cloud of pale saffron over the head of slieu whallin had broken into lightning and the rain was falling heavily the brief relation of daniel mylrea written by himself chapter xxxvii of his outcast state i daniel mylrea the son god forgive me of gilcrist mylrea bishop of mangrace and peace be with that saintly souldo set me down in the year as well as my reckoning serves me the month september the day somewhere between the twentieth and the thirtieth to begin a brief relation of certain exceeding strange accidents of this life that have befallen me since at the heavy judgment of god i first turned my face from the company of men not as the good bunyan was am i now impelled to such a narrationbear with me though i name myself with that holy manby hope or thought that the goodness and bounty of god may thereby be the more advanced before the sons of men though it is for me also to magnify the heavenly majesty insomuch as that by this door of my outcast state he has brought me to partake of grace and life alone i sit to write what perchance no eye may read but it is with hope perhaps only vain that she who is dear to me beyond words of appraisement may yet learn of the marvels which did oft occur that i try in these my last days to put my memory under wardship for it has fastened on me with conviction that god has chosen me for a vessel of mercy and that very soon he will relieve me from the body of the death i live in if i finish this writing before i go hence and if when i am gone she reads it methinks it will come to her as a deep solace that her prayer of long since was answered and that though so sorely separated we twain have yet been one even in this world and lived together by day and hour in the cheer of the spirit but if the gracious end should come before i bring my task to a period and she should know only of my forlorn condition and learn nothing of the grace wherein much of its desolation was lost and never come to an understanding of such of those strange accidents as to her knowledge have befallen then that were also well for she must therein be spared many tears it was on may seven years and four months as i reckon it back from this present timethat in punishment of my great crime the heavy sentence fell on me that cut me off forever from the number of the people what happened on that day and on the days soon following it i do partly remember with the vividness of horror and partly recall with difficulty and mistrust from certain dark places of memory that seem to be clouded over and numb when i came to myself as i was plodding over the side of slieu whallin the thunder was loud in my ears the lightning was flashing before my eyes and the rain was swirling around me i minded them not but went on hardly seeing what was about or above me on and on over mountain road and path until the long day was almost done and the dusk began to deepen then the strength of the tempest was spent and only the hinder part of it beat out from the west a thin misty rain and i found myself in rushen on the south brow of the glen below carnygree there i threw myself down on the turf with a great numbness and a great stupor upon me both in body and in mind how long i lay there i know not whether a few minutes only or as i then surmised near fourandtwenty hours but the light of day was not wholly gone from the sky when i lifted my head from where it had rested on my hands and saw that about me in a deep halfcircle stood a drift of sheep all still save for their heavy breathing and all gazing in their questioning silence down on me i think in my heart remembering my desolation i drew solace from this strange fellowship on the lone mountainside but i lifted my hand and drove the sheep away and i thought as they went they bleated but i could hear nothing of their cry and so surmised that under the sufferings of that day i had become deaf i fell back to the same stupor as before and when i came to myself again the moon was up and a white light was around the place where i sat with the smell of the sheep in my nostrils i thought they might be standing about me again but i could see nothing clearly and so stretched out my hands either way then from their confusion in scurrying away i knew that the sheep had indeed been there and that under the sufferings of that day i had also failed in my sight the tempest was over by this time the mountain turf had run dry and i lay me down at length and fell into a deep sleep without dreams and so ended the first day of my solitary state when i awoke the sun was high and the wheatear was singing on a stone very close above me whereunder her paleblue egg she had newly laid i know not what wayward humor then possessed me but it is true that i reached my hand to the little egg and looked at it and crushed it between my finger and thumb and cast its refuse away my surmise of the night before i now found to be verified that hearing and sight were both partly gone from me no man ever mourned less at first knowledge of such infirmities but in truth i was almost beyond the touch of pain and a sorer calamity would have wanted strength to torture me i rose and set my face southward for it was in the calf sound as i remembered that i was to find my boat and if any hope lived in my heart so numb of torpor it was that perchance i might set sail and get myself away i walked between barrule and dalby and came down on the eastward of cronknaireylhaa then i who had never before known my strength to fail grew suddenly weary and would fain have cast me down to rest so to succumb i could not brook but i halted in my walking and looked back and across the plain to the east and down to the bay of fleswick to the west many times since have i stood there and looked on sea and sky and mountain and dale and asked myself was ever so fair a spot and if the plains of heaven were fairer but that day my dim eyes scoured the sea for a sail and the mountains for a man and nothing did they see of either and all else was then as nothing yet though i was so eager to keep within sight of my fellowman i was anxious not to come his way and in choosing my path i walked where he was least likely to be thus holding well to the west of fleswick i took the cliffhead toward brada and then came down between port erin and portlemary to the moors that stretch to the margin of the sound some few i met chiefly shepherds and fishermen but i lifted my eyes to none and none gave me salutation this was well for my heart was bitter and if any had spoken not knowing me i doubt not i should have answered ill in my great hearttorpor halfblind halfdeaf i was that day like a wounded beast of the field ranging the moorland with a wild abandonment and dangerous to its kind when i came to cregneesh and saw it for the first time a little disjointed gipsy encampment of mudbuilt tents pitched on the bare moor the sky was reddening across the sea and from that i knew how far advanced the day must be how slow my course had been and how low my strength in half an hour more i had sighted my boat the benmychree where she lay in the doon creek of the sound at the length of some fifty fathoms inside the rocks of kitterland when i came up to her i found her anchored in some five fathoms of water with the smallboat lying dry on the shingly beach her cabin contained provisions enough for present needs and more than that i was in no mood to think about since the morning of the day before i had not broken fast but now i ate hungrily of oaten and barley cake later in the evening when the stars were out and the moon which was in its last quarter was hanging over the calf i mixed myself some porridge of ryemeal and cold water and ate it on the deck and then went below to my bunk and lay me down alone between sleeping and waking i tried to think of my position and to realize it but an owl was hooting somewhere on the land and somewhere over the waters of the sound a diver was making his unearthly laugh i could not think save of the hooting owl and the screaming diver and when i thought of them though their note was doleful and seemed to tell of suffering or perhaps of demoniac delight i could not thank god that i had been made a man thus feeling how sore a thing it is to be a creature living under the wrath of god i tossed on my bunk until i fell to sleep and so ended the second day of my unblessed condition to follow closely all that befell on the next day or the many days thereafter whereof i kept no reckoning were to weary my spirit one thing i know that a sudden numbness of the spiritual life within me left me a worse man than i had been before the day of my cutting off and that i did soon lose the little i had of human love and tenderness my gun had been put in the boat and with that i ranged the cliffs and the moor from the mull hills that lie to the west of cregneesh to the chasms that are to the east of it many puffins i shot that much frequent these shores but their flesh was rank and salt and they were scarcely worth the powder i spent on them thus it sometimes happened that being in no straits for food i cast the birds away or did not put myself to the pains of lifting them up after they fell to my gun but went on nevertheless to destroy them in my wanton humor rabbits i snared by a trick i learned when a boy and sometimes cooked them in the stove and ate them like a christian man and at other times i sat me down on the hillside and rived them asunder as a wild creature of the hills might do but whether i ate in my boat or on the cliff i took no religion to my table and thought only that i liked my food or misliked it many times in these first days i had to tear myself away from thinking of my condition for to do so was like the stab of a knife to my brain and i plainly saw that in that way madness itself would lie if i told myself that other men had been cast alone ere now in desolate places where no foot of man was and no sound of a human voice a great stroke would come upon my spirit with the thought that only their bodies had been cast away but that my soul was so the marooned seaman on an uninhabited island when at length he set eyes on his fellowman might lift up his heart to god but to me the company of men was not blessed free i was to go where men were even to the towns wherein they herded together but go where i would i must yet be alone with this thought and doubting not that for me the day of grace was past and gone since god had turned his face from the atonement i had erewhile been minded to make i grew day by day more bitter in my heart and found it easiest to shut my mind by living actively from hour to hour then like a halfstarved hound i went abroad at daybreak and scoured the hills the day long and returned to my bed at night i knew i was a baser thing than i had been and it brought some comfort then to know that i was alone and no eye saw me as i now was mine was a rank hold of life and it gave me a savage delight unknown before to live by preying on other creatures i shot and slew daily and hourly and if for a moment i told myself that what i had killed held its life on the same tenure that i did my humanity was not touched except to feel a strange wild thrill that it was not i that lay dead looking back over these seven years it comes to me as an unnatural thing that this mood can ever have been mine but mine it was and from the like of it may god in his mercy keep all christian men one dayi think it must have been somewhere toward the end of the first month of my outcast statei was ranging the cliffside above the gray rocks of the black head when i chanced on a hare and shot it on coming up with it i found it was lean and bony and so turned aside and left it as it squeaked and bounced from my feet this was in the morning and toward nightfall i returned by the same way and saw the hare lying by a brookside ragged and bleeding but still alive at sight of me the wee thing tried to move away but its weakness and a clot of its blood kept it down and feeling its extremity it lifted its two slender paws in the air while its glistening eyes streamed visibly and set up a piteous cry like the cry of a little child i can not write what then i did for it wounds me sore to think of it but when it was done and that piteous cry was no more in mine ears suddenly i said with myself this awful word i am no longer a man but a beast of the field and the god of mercy and of tenderness has cast me forever out of the hollow of his hand chapter xxxviii of his way of life this meeting with the poor hare though now it looks so trivial a thing did then make a great seizure upon my mind so that it changed my course and habit of life for ceasing not to believe that i was wholly given over to a reprobate soul i yet laid my gun aside and locked my shot and powder in a drawer beneath my bunk and set my face toward new ways of living first i put myself to counting all that i possessed thus i found that of rye and indian meal i had a peck each of barley a peck with two quarters of fine barley flour of oats a peck with two quarters of oaten meal of potatoes two kischen besides onions and a little common salt in the hold under the hatches there were stored sundry useful implementsa spade a fork a hedgeknife some hempen rope and twine and with the rest were the four herringnets which belonged to the boat a mackerelnet and some deepsea lines other things there were that i do not namewanting memory of them at this time of writingbut enough in all for most uses that a lone man might have and this had ofttimes set me wondering why if it had been meant that i should be cast utterly away i had been provided with means of life who could well have found them for myself but after that meeting with the hare i perceived the end of god in this namely that i should not without guilt descend from the state of a christian man when hunger had to be satisfied and herein also i found the way of the stern judge with guilty man that having enough for present necessities i had little for the future beyond the year that then was and that if i must eat so i must work thus upon a day somewhere as i reckon about a month after my cutting off i rose early and set myself to delve a piece of fallow groundwhere all was fallowtwo roods or more in extent lying a little to the north of the black head and to the south of the circle of stones that stand near by all day i wrought fasting and when darkness fell in the fallows were turned next morning i put down my seedof potatoes a halfkischen cut in quarters where the eyes were many and also of barley and oats half a peck each keeping back my other halfpeck lest the ground were barren or the weather against it or the year too far worn for suchlike crops and that day of the delving the first on which i wrought as a man was also the first on which i felt a mans craving for the company of other men the sun was strong all the fore part of the day and its hot rays scorched the skin of my backfor i had stripped to my waist for my laborand that set me thinking what month it was and wondering what was doing in the world and how long i had been where i then was when i returned to my boat at nightfall the air as i remember it was quiet over the sound as it might be in a cloister and only the gulls were jabbering on kitterland and the cormorants at the waters edge and i sat on the deck while the sun went down in the sea and the red sky darkened and the stars began to show and the moon to look out then i went below and ate my barley bread and thought of what it was to be alone it was that night that i bethought me of my watch which i had not once looked for since the day of my immersion in the cross vein on orrisdale when i found it stopped from being full of water in my fob it had lain with its seals and chain since then but now i took it out and cleaned it with oil from the fat of the hare and wound it up for months thereafter i set a great store by it always carrying it in my fob when i went abroad and when i came home to the boat always hanging it on a nail to the larboard of the stovepipe in the cabin and in the long silence of the night when i heard it sure i thought it is the same to me as good company very careful i was to wind it when the sun set but if perchance it ran down and i awoke in my bunk and listening heard it not then it was as if the pulse had stopped of the little world i lived in and there was nothing but a great emptiness but withal my loneliness increased rather than diminished and though i had no longer any hankering after my old way of life in ranging the moorlands with my gun yet i felt that the activity of that existence had led me off from thinking too much of my forlorn condition wherefore when my potatoes had begun to show above the ground and i had earthed them up i began to bethink me touching my boat that it must be now the time of the herringfishing come again and that i would go out of nights and see what i could take so never doubting that singlehanded i could navigate the lugger i hoisted the nets out of the hold athwart the bunkboard and took them ashore to mend and to bask them on the beach i had spread them out on the shingle and was using my knife and twine on the holes of the dogfish when suddenly from behind me there came the loud bark of a dog well i remember how i trembled at the sound of it for it was the nearest to a mans voice that i had heard these many lonesome days and how fearfully i turned my head over my shoulder as if some man had touched me and spoken but what i saw was a poor mongrel dog small as a cur and with ragged ears a peaky nose and a scant tail which for all its loud challenge it dangled wofully between its legs until then i had never smiled or wept since my cutting off and i believed myself to have lost the sense of laughter and of tears but i must have laughed at the sight of the dog so much did it call to mind certain brave vaunters i had known who would come up to a bout of wrestling with a right lusty brag and straightway set to trembling before one had well put eyes on them at the sound of my voice the dog wagged his tail and crept up timidly with his muzzle down and licked the hand i held out to him all day he sat by me and watched me at my work looking up in my face at whiles with a wistful gaze and i gave him a morsel of oaten cake which he ate greedily seeming to be halfstarved of hunger and when at dusk my task was finished and i rose and got into the dingey thinking now he would go his ways and be seen of me no more he leaped into the boat after me and when we reached the lugger he settled himself in the corner under the locker as if he had now fully considered it that with me he would make his habitation henceforth having all things in readiness for the fishing i slipped anchor upon an evening toward autumn as i reckoned for the leaves of the trammon were then closing like a withered hand and the berries of the hollin were reddening when the stars were out but no moon was yet showing i put about head to the wind and found myself in nowise hampered because shorthanded for when i had to take in my sails i lashed my tiller and being a man of more than common strength of arm it cost me nothing to step my mainmast that night and many nights thereafter i had good takings of fish and in the labor of looking after my corks and making fast my seizings the void in my mind was in somewise filled with other matter than thoughts of my abject state but one thing troubled me at first namely that i took more fish by many meshes than i could ever consume to make an end of my fishing was a thing i could not bring myself to for i counted it certain that so to do would be to sink back to my former way of living wherefore i thought it safest to seek for some mode of disposing of my fish such as would keep me at my present employment and do no harm to my feelings as a man for with this i had now to reckon watchfully being in constant danger as i thought of losing the sense of manhood so i soused some hundreds of my herrings with rought salt which i distilled from the salt water by boiling it in a pan with pebbles the remainder i concluded to give to such as would consume them and how to do this being what i was cost me many bitter thoughts wherein i seemed to be the most unblessed of all men at length i hit on a device and straightway brought it to bear leaving my fishingground while the night was not yet far spent i ran into the sound before dawn for soon i learned those narrow waters until they grew familiar as the palm of my hand then before the sun rose above the stack of scarlet and while the eastern sky was only dabbled with pink i with a basket of herrings on my shoulder crossed the moor to cregneesh where the people are poor and not proud and creeping in between the cabins laid my fish down in the open place that is before the little chapel and then went my way quickly lest a door should suddenly open or a window be lifted and a face look forth thrice i did this before i marked that there were those who were curious to know whence the fish came and then i was put on my nettle to go into the village and yet to keep myself from being seen for well i knew that if any eye beheld me that knew who i was there would thenceforward be an end of the eating of my herrings even among the poorest and an end of my fishing also but many times i went into cregneesh without being seen of any man and now i know not whether to laugh or to weep when i look back on the days i write of and see myself like a human fox stealing in by the gray of dawn among the sleeping homes of men chapter xxxix of the ghostly hand upon him all that autumn i followed the herrings choosing my ground mainly by guess but sometimes seeing the blue lights of the herring fleet rise close under my quarter and at other times when the air was still hearing voices of men or the sound of laughter rumored over the quiet waters but ever fanciful to me as a dream of a friend dead when it is past was that sound on the sea and as often as i heard it i took in my nets and hauled my sails and stood out for the sound putting no light on my mitchboard i would ofttimes pass the fleet within a cableslength and yet not be known but once and again i knew by the hush of voices and the dying away of laughter on the boats about me that my dark craft was seen scudding like a black bird of evil omen through the night in my cabin i was used to burn a tallow dip made of the fat of the birds i had shot and rushes from the soft places of the moor and while my boat drifted under the mizzen between take and take of herrings i would go below and sit with my dog he grew sleek with the fare i found him and i in these days recovered in a measure my sense of sight and hearing for the seas breath of brine is good to man millish vegveen i called him and though a man of small cheer i smiled to think what a sorry misname that name would seem in our harder english tongue for my poor mongrel cur had his little sorry vices such as did oft set me wondering what the chances of his life had been and whether like his new messmate he had not somewhere been driven out nevertheless he had his good parts too and was a creature of infinite spirits i think we were company each to the other and if he had found me a cheerier matefellow i doubt not we should have had some cheerful hours together but in truth though my fishing did much to tear me away from the burden of myself it yet left me many lonesome hours wherein my anguish was sore and deep and looking to the years that might be before me put me to the bitter question whether being a man outside gods grace i could hold out on so toilsome a course also when i fell to sleep in the daytime after my work of the night was done i was much wrought upon by troublous dreams which sometimes brought back the very breathodor of my boyish days with the dear souls that filled them with joy and sometimes plagued me with awful questions which in vain i tried to answer knowing that my souls welfare lay therein and being much followed by the thought that the spirit of the beast of the field lay in wait to fall on the spirit of the man within me i was also put to great terror in my watchfulness and the visions that came to me in hours of idleness and sleep but suddenly this sentence fell on my mind thou art free to go whithersoever thou wilt though it be the uttermost reaches of the earth go then where men are and so hold thy soul as a man long did this sentence trouble me not being able to make a judgment upon it but at length it fastened on me that i must follow it and that all the dread i had felt hitherto of the face of man was no more than a thinkso thereupon i concluded that i would go into castletown at high fair on the next marketday which i should know from other days by the carts i could descry from the top of the mull going the way of rushen church and kentraugh this resolve i never brought to bear for the same day whereon i made it a great stroke fell upon my spirit and robbed me of the little wherewith i had tried to comfort me going out of the sound that night by the spanish head for the season was far worn and the herrings lay to the eastward of the island i marked in the dusk that a smack that bore the peel brand on its canvas was rounding the chicken rocks of the calf so i stood out well to sea and did not turn my head to the wind and cast my nets until i was full two leagues from shore then it was black dark for the night was heavy and a mist lay between sea and sky but soon thereafter i saw a blue light to my starboard bow and guessed that the smack from peel had borne down in my wake how long i lay on that ground i know not for the takings were good and i noted not the passage of time but at short whiles i looked toward the blue light and marked that as my boat drifted so did the smack drift and that we were yet within hail the moon came out with white streamers from behind a rack of cloud and knowing then that the fishing was over for that nightfor the herring does not run his gills into mischief when he has light to see byi straightway fell to hauling my nets and then it was that i found the smell of smoke in the nostrils and heard loud voices from the peeltown smack lifting my eyes i could at first see nothing for though the moons light was in the sky the mist was still on the sea and through it there seemed to roll slowly for the wind was low a tunnel of smokelike fog well i knew that something was amiss and soon the mist lifted like a dark veil into the air and the smoke veered and a flash of red flame rose from the smack of the peelmen then i saw that the boat was afire and in two minutes more the silence of the sea was lost in the fires loud hiss and the mens yet louder shouts it was as if a serpent in the bowels of the boat struggled to make its way out and long tongues of fire shot out of the scuttle the hold the combings and the flue of the stove little thought had i then of those things though now by the eye of memory i see them and also the sinuous trail of red water that seemed to crawl over the dark sea from the boat afire to the boat i sailed in i had stepped my mast and hoisted sail before yet i knew what impulse possessed me but with my hand on the tiller to go to the relief of the men in peril on a sudden i was seized with a mighty fear and it was as though a ghostly hand laid on me from behind and a voice above the tumult of that moment seemed to cry in my ears not for you not for you then in great terror i turned my boats head away from the burning smack and as i did so the ghostly hand did relax and the voice did cease to peal in mine ears they will drop into their dingey i said with myself yes i said as the sweat started cold from my forehead they will drop into the dingey and be saved and turning my head i saw by the flame of the fire that over the bulwark at the stern two men were tumbling down into the smallboat that they hauled behind and i sped away in agony for now i knew how deep was the wrath upon me that it was not for me so much as to stretch my accursed hand to perishing men to save them scarce had i gone a cableslength when a great shout mingled with oaths made me turn my head thinking the crew of the boat were crying curses down on me not knowing me for deserting them in their peril but i was then in the tunnel of smoke wherein i might not be seen and lo i saw that the dingey with the two men was sheering off and that other two of their mates were left on the burning boat haul the wind and run the waistrels down d them shouted one of the two men on the smack and amid the leaping flames the mainsail shot up and filled and a man stood to the tiller and with an oath he shouted to the two in the smallboat that for their treachery they should go down to hell straightway in the glare of that fierce light and the turmoil of that moment my eyes grew dim as they had been on the day of my cutting off and i squeezed their lids together to relieve them of water then i saw how fearful a thing was going on within my cableslength two men of a crew of four in the burning smack had got themselves into the smallboat and cleared off without thought of their comrades who were struggling to save their craft and now the two abandoned men doomed to near death in fire or water were with their last power of life and in lifes last momentsfor aught they could tellthirsting for deadly vengeance on the smack went with its canvas bellied and the flames shooting through and hissing over it but just as it came by the smallboat the men therein pulled to the windward and it shot past ere this was done and while the smacks bow was dead on for the dingey i too had sheered round and was beating up after the burning boat and when the men thereon saw me come out of the smoke they ceased to curse their false comrades and made a great cry of thanks to god at a distance of six fathoms i laid to thinking the men would plunge into the sea and come to me but apprehending my thoughts one shouted me to come closer for that he could not swim closer to the burning smack i would not go from fear of firing my own boat and i dared not to risk that fate wherein we might all have been swallowed up together for despair that fortifies some men did make of me a coward and i stood in constant terror of the coming of death so i stripped me of my jacket and leaped into the water and swam to the boat and climbed its open combings as best i could through the flame and heat on the deck the two men stood enveloped in swirling clouds of smoke but i saw them where they were and pulling one into the water after me the other followed us and we reached my boat in safety then as i rubbed my face for the fire had burned one cheek the men fell to thanking me in a shamefaced wayas in the manner of their kind fearing to show feelingwhen on a sudden they stopped short for they had lifted their eyes and in the flame of their boat had seen me and at the same moment i had looked upon them and known them they were illiam quilleash and edward teare and they fell back from me and made for the bow and stood there in silence together taking the tiller i bore in by tacks for portlemary and there i landed the men who looked not my way nor ever spoke word or made sign to me but went off with their heads down and when i stood out again through the poolvash to round the spanish head and make for my moorings in the sound and saw the burning smack swallowed up by the sea with a groan that came over the still waters its smallboat passed me going into harbor and the men who rowed it were crennell and corkell and when they saw me they knew me and made a broad sweep out of my course now all this time the ghostly hand had been on my shoulder and the strange voice had pealed in mine ears and though i wanted not to speak with any man nor that any man should speak with me yet i will not say but that it went to my heart that i should be like as a leper from whose uncleanness all men should shrink away for many days hereafter this lay with a great trouble upon me so that i let go my strong intent of walking into castletown at high fair and put this question with myself whether it was written that i should carry me through this world down to deaths right ending not as before did i now so deeply abhor myself but felt for myself a secret compassion in truth i had no bitterness left in my heart for my fellowmen but tossed with the fear that if i lived alone much longer i must surely lose my reason and hence my manhood sinking down to the brute this consideration fell with weight upon me what thou hast suffered is from men who know thy crime and stand in terror of the curse upon thee wherein thou art so blotted out of the book of the living that without sin none may look thy way go therefore where no man knows thee and the so heavy burden thou bearest will straightway fall from thee now at this thought my heart was full of comfort and i went back to my former design of leaving this place forever but before i had well begun what i was minded to do a strange accident befell me and the relation thereof is as followeth by halfflood of an evening late in autumnfor though the watch showed short of six the sun was already downi left my old moorings inside the rocks of kitterland thinking to slip anchor there no more the breeze was fresh in the sound and outside it was stiff from the noreast and so i ran out with a fair wind for ireland for i had considered with myself that to that country i would go because the people there are tender of heart and not favored by god for a short while i had enough to think of in managing my cordage but when i was well away to souwest of the calf suddenly the wind slackened then for an hour full i stood by the tiller with little to do and looked back over the green waters to the purple mountains vanishing in the dusk and around to the western sky where over the line of sea the crimson streamers were still trailing where the sun had been like as the radiance of a goodly life remains a while after the man has gone and with that eye that sees doublethe thing that is without and that which is withini saw myself then in my little craft on the lonely sea like an uncompanionable bird in the wide sky and my heart began to fail me and for the first time since my cutting off i must have wept for i thought i was leaving forever the fair island of my home with all that had made it dear in dearer days though it had turned its back on me since and knew me no more but had blotted out my name from its remembrance yet it was mine and the only spot of earth on all this planet go whither i would that i could call my own how long this mood lasted i hardly can say but over the boat two gulls hovered or circled and cried and i looked up at their white transparent wings for lack of better employment until the light was gone and another day had swooned to another night the wind came up with the darkness and more in heart than before i stood out for the south of ireland and reached my old fishing port of kinsale by the dawn of the next day then in the gentle sun of that autumn morning i walked up from the harbor to the marketplace and there found a strange company assembled about the inn and in the midst were six or seven poor shipbroken men shoeless halfnaked and lean of cheek from the long peril and privation that eats the flesh and makes the eyes hollow in the middle of the night they had come ashore on a raft having lost their ship by foundering twelve days before this i learned from the gossip of the people about them and also that they had eaten supper at the inn and slept there while i stood and looked on there came out in the midst of the group two other men and one of them was their captain and the other the innkeeper and i noted well that the master of the inn was suave to his tattered customers and spoke of breakfast as being made ready but first go to the mayor said he addressing the captain and make your protest and he will lend whatever moneys you want the captain nothing loth set out with a cheerful countenance for the mayor of the town a servant of the inn going with him to guide him the shipbroken crew stayed behind and i who was curious to learn if their necessities would be relieved remained standing in the crowd around them and while we waited and the men sat on the bench in front of the inn there came down on them from every side the harpies that find seagoing men with clothes there was one with coats and one with guernseys and one with boots of leather and one of neatsskin and with these things they made every man to fit himself and if one asked the price and protested that he had got no money the samaritans laughed and bade them not to think of price or money until their captain should return from the treasury of the mayor the seamen took all with good cheer and every man picked out what he wanted and put it on throwing his rags aside laughing but presently the master of the crew returned and his face was heavy and when his men asked how he had fared and if the mayor had advanced him anything he told them no and that the mayor had said he was no usurer to lend money at that there were groans and oaths from the crew and looks of bewilderment among those who had fetched the clothes but the innkeeper said all would be well and that they had but to send for a merchant in the next street who made it his trade to advance money to shipbroken men this news brought back the light to the dark face of the captain and he sent the servant of the inn to fetch the merchant when this man came my mind misgave for i saw the stamp of uncharity in his face but the captain told his story whereof the sum was this that they were the english crew of the brig betsy and were seven days out from bristol bound for buenos ayres when they foundered on a rock and had made their way thither on a raft suffering much from hunger and the cold of the nights and that they wanted three pounds advance on their owners to carry them to dublin whence they could sail for their own port but the merchant curled his hard lip and said he had just before been deceived by strangers and could not lend money except to men of whom he knew something that they were strangers and moreover by their own words entitled to no more than six days pay apiece and so he went his way hardly had he gone when the harpies of the coats and boots and guernseys called on the men to strip off these good garments which straightway they rolled in their several bundles and then elbowed themselves out of the crowd the poor seamen resuming their rags were now in sad case scarce knowing whether most to curse their misfortunes or to laugh at the grim turn that they were taking when the captain in a chafe called on the innkeeper to give breakfast to his men for that he meant to push on to the next town where people might be found who had more humanity but the innkeeper losing his byrespects shook his head and asked where was his pay to come from for what he had already done now when i heard this and saw the men rise up to go on their toilsome way with naked bleeding feet suddenly i bethought me that though i had little money i had what would bring money and before i had taken time to consider i had whipped my watch from my fob to thrust it into the captains hands but when i would have parted the crowd to do so on a sudden that same ghostly hand that i have before mentioned seemed to seize me from behind then on the instant i faced about to hasten away for now the struggle within me was more than i could bear and i stopped and went on and stopped again and again went on and all the time the watch was in my palm and the ghostly hand on my shoulder at last thinking sure that the memory of the seven seagoing men hungry and illclad would follow me and rise up to torment me on land and sea i wheeled around and ran back hotfoot and did as i was minded then i walked rapidly away from the marketplace and passing down to the harbor i saw a peeltown fisherman and knew that he saw me also now i should have been exceeding glad if this thing had never befallen for though it made my feeling less ungentle toward the two men my old shipmates who had turned from me as from a leper when i took them from the burning boat yet it brought me to a sense that was full of terror to my oppressed spirit namely that though i might fly to lands where men knew nothing of my great crime yet that the curse thereof was mostly within mine own afflicted soul from which i could never flee away all that day i stayed in my boat and the sun shone and the sky was blue but my heart was filled with darkness and when night fell in i had found no comfort for then i knew that from my outcast state there was no escape this being so whether to go back to mine own island was now my question oh it is a goodly thing to lie down in the peace of a mind at ease and rise up from the refreshment of the gentle sleep but not for me was that blessed condition the quaking of my spirit was more than i could well stand under without losing my reason and in the fear of that mischance lay half the pain of life to me long were the dark hours and when the soft daylight came again i did resolve that go back to my own island i would for what was it to me though the world was wide if the little place i lived in was but my own narrow soul that night in the boat for lack of the tick of my watch there seemed to be a void in the air of my cabin but when the tide was about the bottom of the ebb i heard the plash of an oar alongside and presently the sound of something that fell overhead next morning i found my watch lying on the deck by the side of the hatches at the top of the flood i lifted anchor and dropped down the harbor having spoken no word to any man since i sailed into it chapter xl of his great loneliness back at my old moorings inside the rocks of kitterland i knew full well that the almighty majesty was on this side of me and on that and i had nothing to look for now or hereafter but i think the extremity of my condition gave me some false courage and my good genius seemed to say what have you to lament you have health and food and freedom and you live under no taskmasters eye let the morning see you rise in content and let the night look on you lying down in thankfulness and turn not your face to the future to the unsettling of your spirit so that when your time comes you may not die with a pale face then did i laugh at my old yearning for fellowship and asked wherefore i should be lonely since i lived in the same planet with other men and had the same moon and stars above my sleep as hung over the busy world of men in such wise did i comfort my torn heart and shut it up from troubling me but well i knew that i was like to one who cries peace where there is no peace and that in all my empty sophistry concerning the moon and the stars there was no blood of poor human neighborliness nevertheless i daily went about my businesses in pursuance whereof i walked up to the place over the black head where i had planted my corn and potatoes these in their course i reaped and delved cutting the barley and rye with my claspknife for sickle and digging a burrow in the earth for my potatoes little of either i had but enough for my frugal needs until more might grow when my work was done and i had no longer any employment to take me ashore the autumn had sunk to winter for in this island of man the cold and the mist come at a stride then sitting alone in my boat with no task save such as i could make for myself and no companion but little vegveen the strength of the sophistry wherewith i had appeased myself broke down pitifully the nights were long and dark and the sun shone but rarely for many days together few were the ships that passed the mouth of the sound either to east or west of it and since my coming to moorage there no boat had crossed its water cold and bleak and sullen it lay around my boat reflecting no more the forehead of the calf and lying now under the sunless sky like a dead mans face that is moved neither to smiles nor tears and an awful weariness of the sea came to me then such as the loneliest land never brought to the spirit of a christian man for sitting on the deck of my little swaying craft with the beat of the sea on its timbers and the seafowl jabbering on kitterland and perhaps a wild colt racing the wind on the calf it came into my mind to think that as far as eye could see or ear could hear there was nothing around me but the hand of god then all was darkness within me and i did oft put the question to myself if it was possible for man to be with god alone and live now it chanced upon a day that i wanted potatoes out of my burrow over the black head and that returning therefrom toward nightfall i made a circuit of the stone circle above the chasm and the northernmost side of it midway to cregneesh came on a sight that arrested my breath this was a hut built against a steepness of rugged land from which stones had sometimes been quarried the walls were of turf the roof was of gorse and sticks with a hole in it for chimney window there was none and the doorway was half closed by a broken gate whereof the bars were intertwined with old straw mean it was and desolate it looked on the wild moorland but it was a mark of the hand of man and i who had dwelt so long with gods hand everywhere about me was touched with a sense of human friendliness hearing no voice within i crept up and looked into the little place a bed of straw was in one corner and facing it was a lump of freestone hollowed out for the bed of a fire a broken pipe lay near this rude hearth and the floor was of mountain turf worn bare and hard two sacks a kettle a saucepan and some potatoparings were the only other things in the hut and poor as it all was it touched me so that in looking upon it i think my eyes were wet because it was a mans habitation i remember that as i turned to go away the rain began to fall and the pattering drops on the roof seemed to my eye and ear to make the place more human in going back to my boat that day i came nearer to cregneesh than was my wont in the daytime and though the darkness was coming down from the mountains i could yet see into the streets from the knoll i passed over and there in the unpaved way before a group of houses i saw a witless man in coat and breeches but no vest or shirt and with a rope about his waist dancing and singing to a little noisy crowd gathered about him after that i had come upon the hut my mind ran much on the thought of it and in three days or thereabouts i went back to look at it again and coming near to it from behind saw sundry beehives of a rude fashioning made of straw and sticks vegveen was with me for he was now my constant company and in a moment he had bounced in at the doorway and out again at yet more speed with three of his kind close at his tail before i could turn me about to go away a man followed the dogs out of the hut and he was the same witless being that i had seen at his dancing in the streets of cregnesh his lip lagged low and his eyes were dull as a rabbits on his head was a crownless hat through which his hair was seen and i saw that his breast where his shirt would be was blackened as with soot i would have gone about my own employments but he spoke telling me not to fear him for it was false that he was possessed as hardspoken people said with the spirit of delusion i answered nothing to this but stood and listened with eyes turned aside while the broken brain of the poor creature rambled on they call me billy the bees he said because i catch them and rear themlook and he pointed to his hives he talked of his three dogs and named them saying that they slept in a sack together and that in the same sack he slept with them something he said of the cold that had been coming latterly and pointed to the soot on his breast saying that it kept him warm he told how he made a circuit of the farmhouses once a week dancing and singing at all of them and how the people gave him barleymeal and eggs much more he said but because the method of itwhere method there was anyhas gone from my memory i pass it that the world was night about its end he knew of a surety because he saw that if a man had money and great store of gear it mattered not what else he wanted these with other such words he spoke ramblingly and i stood aside and answered him nothing neither did i look up into his face at last he said timidly i know i have always been weak in my intellects and hearing that i could bear to hear no more but went about my business with a great weight of trouble upon me and o god i cried that night in my agony i am an ignorant sot without the grace of human tenderness or the gift of understanding i am guilty before thee and no man careth for my soul but from this affliction o almighty master save me save me from this degradation for it threatens me and when death comes that stands at the foot of lifes awful account i will pay its price with thankfulness now after this meeting with the witless man the weariness that i had felt of my home on the sea lay the heavier on my spirits and i concluded with myself that i should forsake my boat and build me a home on the land within sight of mans habitation so i walked the cliffs from the mull hills to the noggin head and at last i lit on the place i looked for near to the land where i had lately broken the fallows and grown me a crop of corn and potatoes there were four roofless walls some time a house had stood there but being built on the brink of the great clefts in the earth that we call the chasms it had shrunken in some settlement of the ground this had affrighted the poor souls who inhabited it and they had left it to fall into ruins such was the tale i heard long afterward but none came near it then and none have come near to it since save the four bare walls and a wall that crossed it midway nothing was left where the floor had been the grass was growing wormwood was in the settle nook and whinberries had ripened and rotted on the hearth the door lintel was gone and the sill of the window was fallen off there was a round patch of long grass where the well had been and near to where the porch once stood the trammontree still grew and thus though the good people who had lived and died there been born and buried were gone from it forever the sign of their faith or their superstition lived after them better for me than this forsaken place it was hard for any place to be on a dangerous spot it stood and therefore none would come anigh it near to cregneesh it was and from the rising ground above it i could look down on the homes of men truly it looked out on the sea and had a great steepness of shelving rocks going down to an awesome depth where on the narrow beach of shingle the tide beat with a woful moan but though the sea was so near and the seafowl screamed of an evening from the great rock like a cone that lifted its gaunt finger a cables length away yet to me it was within the very pulse of human life so i set to work and roofed it with driftwood and turf and gorse and then with lime from a cliff at the tubdale creek in the calf i whitened it within and without walls and roof a door i made in somewise and for a window i had a piece of transparent skin having no glass and when all was made ready i moved my goods from the boat to my house taking all that seemed necessaryflour and meat and salt and my implements as well as my bed and the spare clothes i had which were not many i had been in no haste with this work being well content with such employment but it came to an end at last and the day that i finished my task was a day late in the first year after my cutting off this i knew because the nights were long and i had been trying with my watch to cast on the shortest day and thereby recover my lost count of time on the night of my first sleeping in my new home there came a fierce storm of wind and rain from the east four hours the gale lasted and often the gulls were dashed screaming at the walls wherein i sat by the first fire i had yet kindled on my hearth toward midnight the wind fell suddenly to a dead calm and looking out i saw that the moon was coming very bright in its rising from behind a heavy cloud over the sea so wondering what chance had befallen my boatfor though i had left it i had a tenderness for it and meant perchance to use it againi set out for the sound when i got to the head of the cliff i could plainly see the rocks of kitterland and the whole length of the doon creek but where my boat had been moored no boat could i see nor any trace of one from fistard head on the east to halfwalk rock on the west next morning under a bright winters sun i continued the search for my boat and with the rising tide at noon i saw her thrown up on to the beach of the doon dismasted without spar or boom bilged below her waterline and altogether a hopeless hulk i made some scabbling shift to pull her above highwater mark and then went my ways now this loss for so i considered it did at first much to depress me thinking with a bitter envy of my late past that my future showed me a far more unblessed condition seeing that i was now forever imprisoned on this island and could never leave it again whatsoever evil might befall but when i had thought twice upon it my mind came to that point that i was filled with gratitude first because the wrecking of my boat on the very day of my leaving it seemed to give assurance that in making my home on the land i had done that which was written for me to do and next because i must inevitably have been swallowed up in the storm if i had stayed on the sea a single night longer and my terror of death was such that to have escaped the peril of it seemed a greater blessing than releasement from this island could ever be every day thereafter and oftenest at daybreak i walked up to the crest of the rising ground at the back of my house and stood awhile looking down on cregneesh and watching for the white smoke that lay like a low cloud over the hollow place wherein port erin lay after that i had done this i felt strangely refreshed as by a sense of companionship and went about my work such as it was with content but on a bitter morning some time in december as i thought i came upon a sight that wellnigh froze my heart within me for outstretched on the bare moorland under the bleak sky and in the lee of a thick gorse bush tipped with yellow i found the witless man billy the bees lying cold and dead his bare chest was blue as with starvation under the soot wherewith in his simpleness he had blackened it and his pinched face told of privation and of pain and now that he lay stretched out dead i saw that he had been a man of my own stature in his hut which was farther away than my own house from the place where he lay there was neither bite nor sup and his dogs seemed to have deserted him in his poverty for they were gone the air had softened perceptibly for some minutes while i went thither and as i returned to the poor body wondering what to do with it the snow began to fall in big flakes it will cover it i said with myself the snow will bury it i thought and casting a look back over my shoulder i went home with a great burden of trouble upon me all that day and other two days the snow continued to fall until the walls of my house were blocked up to the level of my window and i had to cut a deep trench to the gable where i piled my wood and for more than a week following shut in from my accustomed walk i sat alone in the great silence and tried to keep my mind away from the one fearful thought that now followed it remembering those long hours and the sorry employments i found for themscrabbling on allfours in play with millishvegveen laughing loud and barking back at the dogs shrill bark i could almost weep while here i write to think of the tragic business that was at the same time lying heavy on my spirit christmas day fell while thus i was imprisoned for near to midnight i heard the church bells ring for oiel verree when the snow began to melt i saw that the dog put his muzzle to the bottom of the door instantly and as often as i drove him away he returned to the same place i will not say what awful thing came to my mind knowing a dogs nature and how near to my door lay the body of the witless man only that i shuddered with a fear that was new to me when i remembered that by the curse i lived under the time would come when my unburied bones would lie on the bare face of the moor as soon as the snow had melted down to within a foots depth of the earth i went out of my house and turned toward where my poor neighbor lay but before i had come close to him i saw that three men were coming over the hillside by way of portlemary and wishing not to be seen by them i crept back and lay by the hinder wall of my house to watch what they did then i saw that they came up to the body of the witless man and saw it and stood over it some minutes talking earnestly and then passed along on their way and as they walked they turned aside and came close up by the front of my house and looked in at the window pushing the skin away standing by the wall holding vegveen by the throat lest he should betray me i heard some words the men said each to the other before they went on again well man hes dead at last poor craythur said one and goodluck too and the other answered aw dear to think to think no man alive could stand up agen it aw terble terble i was at the tynwald myself yander day said the first and ill give it a year i was saying to finish him and behould ye hes lying dead in half the time then both together said god bless me and passed on at that moment my eyes became dim and a sound as of running water went through my ears i staggered into my house and sat down by the cold hearth for in my eagerness to go forth on my errand at first awakening no fire had i kindled i recalled the words that the men had spoken and repeated them aloud one by one and very slowly that i might be sure i took their meaning rightly this done i said with myself this error will go far until the wide island will say that he who was cut off he who is nameless among men is dead dead what then i had heard that when death came and took away a bad man its twinangel the angel of mercy bent over those who were left behind on the earth and drew out of their softened hearts all evil reports and all uncharity and a great awe slid over me at that thought and the gracious dew of a strange peace fell upon me but close behind it came the other thought that this error would reach my father alsogod preserve himand monagods holy grace be with herand bring them pain and then it came to me to think that when men said in their hearing he whom you wot of is newly dead they would take heart and answer no he died long ago it was only his misery and gods wrath that died yesterday with this thought i rose up and went out and put some shovels of earth over the body of my poor neighbor that his face might be hidden from the sky chapter xli of how he kept his manhood the great snow lay long on the mountains and died off in its silence like one who passes away in sleep and the spring came the summer and the winter yet again and to set down in this writing all that befell would be a weariness for i feel as i write that the pulse of my life is low and neither am i one who can paint his words with wit my way of life has now grown straight and even and at my simple employments i wrought early and late that by much bodily toil i might keep in check the distempers of my mind with my fishingboat my gun which i had left behind me of design had been carried to the bottom of the sound and when the hulk of the lugger drifted up with the tide the gun was no longer within her this i took for a direction to me that i should hunt no more nevertheless for some while i went on to fish with a line from my smallboat which being on the beach the storm had spared but soon it was gotten into my head that if to shoot a hare was an ill deed to take a cod was but a poor business well i knew that there was some touch of insanity in such fancies and that for man to kill and eat was the law of life and the rather because it was enjoined of god that so he should do but being a man like as i was cut off from the land of the living never more to have footing there for the great crime committed of spilling blood i think it was not an ungentle madness that made me fear to take life whether wantonly or of hungers need this dread lay close to me and got to extremities whereat one of healthy mind might smile for being awakened some nights in succession by the nibble of a mouse i arose from my bed in the dawn and saw the wee mite and struck it with an iron rod and killed it and then suffered many foolish twitches not from pity for the mouse for of humanity i had none left but from the sudden thought that the spirit of its life which i had driven from its harmless body was now about me as an invisible thing though i had fallen into such a weakness yet i think that where choice was none for one like me between the weakness of a man and the strength of a beast i did least injury to my own nature and disposition by yielding with childish indulgence toward the gentler side and truly it is a beautiful thing to mark how the creatures of earth and air will answer with confidence to mans tenderness whether as with my saintly father it comes of the love of them or as with me of the love of myself the seafowl flew in at my door and pecked up the morsels that fell at my feet the wild duck on the moor would not rise though i walked within a stride of it a fat hare nested in a hole under my house and came out at dusk to nibble the parings of potatoes that i threw at the door and but for millishvegveen and his sly treacheries with the rabbits of the black head i might have sported as with a kitten i could fill this account with the shifts i was put to by want of many things that even a lone man may need for his comfort or his cheer thus i was at pains to devise a substitute for tinder having lost much of all i had in the wrecking of my boat and to find leather for the soles of my shoes when they were worn to the welt was long a search yet herein my case was but that of many another man who has told of his privation and the less painful was my position for that i had much to begin my battle of life with in this first year of my unblessed condition my senses not only recovered their wonted strength but grew keener than before my cutting off oft did my body seem to act without help of my intelligence and with a mind on other matters i would find my way over the trackless moor back to my home in the pitch of darkness and never so much as stumble by a stone when the wind was from the north or when the air lay still i could hear the church bells that rang in the market square at castletown and thereby i knew what the day of the week was none came nigh to my dwelling but if a man passed it by at the space of two furlongs i seemed to feel his tread on the turf and now as i hold the pen for these writings my hand is loth and my spirit is not fain to tell of the strange humors of these times so ridiculous and yet so tragic do they look as they come back to me in the graveclothes of memory that my imagination being no longer turned wayward shrinks from them as sorry things that none shall see to be of nature save he who has lived in an outcast state but if the eyes i look for should ever read these lines the tender soul behind them will bring me no laughter for my pains and i ask no tears only for my weakness let it be remembered that the terror of my life was that the spirit of madness and of the beast of the field waited and watched to fall upon me and to destroy the spirit of the man within me it is not to be expressed with what eagerness i strove to live in my solitude as a man should live in the company of his fellows down to the pettiest detail of personal manners i tried to do as other men must be doing whatsoever seemed to be the habit of a christian man that i practised and though all alone and having no mans eye to see me with a grim and awesome earnestness thus before food i not only washed but dressed afresh taking off the seaboots or the curranes i worked in and putting on my shoes with silver buckles my seamans jacket i removed for a long coat of blue and i was careful that my shirt was spotless in this wise i also never failed to attire myself in the evening of the day for the short hours of rest between my work and my bed that my cheeks should be kept clean of hair and that the hair of my head should never outgrow itself was a constant care for i stood in fear of the creeping consciousness which my face in the glass might bring me that i was other than other men but i am loth to set down my little foolish formalities on sitting to meat and rising from it and the silly ceremonies wherewith i indulged myself at going abroad and coming home inexpressibly comic and ridiculous some of them would seem to me now but for the tragic meaning that in my terror underlay them and remembering how much a defaulter i had been in all such courtesies of life when most they were called for i could almost laugh to think how scrupulous i was in their observance when i was quite alone with never an eye to see me what i did or how i was clad or in what sorry fashion i in my solitude acquitted myself like a man but though i could be well disposed to laugh at my notions of how to keep my manhood while compelled to live the life of a beast alone like a wolf and useless for any purposes of man or the world it is not with laughter that i recall another form of the insanity that in these times possessed me this was the conviction that i was visited by ewan mona and my father madness i call it but never did my pulse beat more temperately or my brain seem clearer than when conscious of these visitations if i had spent the long day delving or gathering limestone on the beach of the sound and returned to my house at twilight i would perhaps be suddenly aware as i lifted the latchhaving thought only of my work until thenthat within my kitchen these three sat together and that they turned their eyes to me as i entered nothing would be more convincing to my intelligence than that i actually saw what i say and yet i always seemed to know that it was not with my bodily eyes that i was seeing these indeed were open and i was broad awake with plain power of common sight on common thingsmy stool my table the settle i had made myself and perhaps the fire of turf that burned red on the hearth but over this bodily vision there was a spiritual vision more stable than that of a dream more soft and variable than that of material reality in which i clearly beheld ewan and mona and my father and saw their eyes turned toward me madness it may have been but i could say it at the foot of the white throne that what i speak of i have seen not once or twice but many times and well i remember how these visitations affected me first as a terror for when on a sudden they came to me as i lifted the latch i would shrink back and go away again and return to my house with trembling and then as a strange comfort for they were a sort of silent company in my desolation more than once in these days of great loneliness did i verily believe that i had sat me down in the midst of the three to spend a long hour in thinking of the brave good things that might have been for all of us but for my headstrong passion helped out by the cruel tangle of our fate one thing i noted that even yet seems strange in the hours when my imagination is least given to waywardness throughout the period wherein i lived in the boat and for some time after i removed me to my house the three i have named seemed to visit me together but after that i had found my witless neighbor lying dead on the moor and after that i had heard the converse of the men who mistook his poor body for my own the visitations of mona and my father ceased altogether and ewan alone did i afterward seem to see this i pondered long and at length it fastened on me with a solemn conviction that what i had looked for had come about and that the error that i was a dead man had reached the ears of my father and of mona with ewan i sat alone when he came to me and oft did it appear that we were loving company for in his eyes were looks of deep pity and i on my part had ceased to rail at the blind passion that had parted us flesh from flesh these my writings are not for men who will look at such words as i have here set down with a cold indifference or my hand would have kept me back from this revelation but that i saw apparently what i have described is as sure before god as that i was a man cut off from the land of the living a more material sequel came of the finding of the body on the moor i was so closely followed by dread of a time that was coming when i must die and stretch out my body on the bare ground with no man to give it christian burial in the earth that i could take no rest until i had devised a means whereby this terror might not haunt me in my last hours in front of my house there were as i have said the places we call the chasms wherein the rock of this hungry coast is honeycombed into a hundred deep gullies by the sea one of these gullies i descended by means of a cradle of rope swung overthwart a strong log of driftwood and there i found a long shelf of stone a deep fissure in the earth a tomb of shelving rock coated with fungus and mold whereto no dog could come and wherein no bird of prey could lift its wing to this place i resolved that i would descend when the power of life was on the point of ebbing away having lowered myself by my cradle of rope i meant to draw the cordage after me and then being already near my end to lie down in this close gully under the earth that was to serve me for grave and deathbed but i was still a strong man and ungracious as my condition was i shrank from the thought of death and did what i could to put by the fear of it never a day did i fail to walk to the crest of the rising ground behind me and look down to where in the valley lay the habitations of men life life life was now the constant cry of the voice of my heart and a right goodly thing it seemed to me to be alive though i might be said not to live but only to exist whether from the day whereon i heard the converse of the two men who went by my house i was ever seen of any man for a twelvemonth or more i scarce can tell great was my care to keep out of the ways wherein even the shepherds walked and never a foot seemed to come within two furlongs of these abandoned parts from the bleak black head to the margin of the sound but it happened upon a day toward winter beginning the second year since my cutting off that i turned toward portlemary and walking on with absent mind came nearer than i had purposed to the village over the kallow point there i was suddenly encountered by four or five men who much in liquor were playing at leapfrog among the gorse english seamen they seemed to be and perhaps from the brig that some time before i had noted where she lay anchored to the lee of the carrick rock in the poolvash below at sight of them i was for turning quickly aside but they raised such a cry and shot out such a volley of levities and blasphemies that try how i would to go on i could not but stop on the instant and turn my face to them then i saw that of me the men took no note whatever and that all their eyes were on my dog millishvegveen who was with me and was now creeping between my feet with his stump of a tail under his belly and his little cunning face full of terror why heres the dog that killed our monkey said one and another shouted its my old cur sure enough and a third laughed and said he had kept a rod in pickle for more than a year and the first cried again ill teach the beast to kill no more jackeys then before i was yet fully conscious of what was being done one of the brawny swaggerers made toward us and kicked at the dog with the fierce lunge of a heavy seamans boot the dog yelped and would have made off but another of the blusterers kicked him back and then a third kicked him and whatever way he tried to escape between them one of them lifted his foot and kicked again while they were doing this i felt myself struggling to cry out to them to stop but not a syllable could i utter and like a man paralyzed i stood stockstill and did nothing to save my housemate and only companion in life at length one of the men laughing a great roistering laugh stooped and seized the dog by the nape of the neck and swung him round in the air then i saw the poor curs piteous look toward me and heard its bitter cry but at the next instant it was flying ten feet above our heads and when it fell to the ground it was killed on the instant at that sight i heard an awful groan burst from my mouth and i saw a cloud of fire flash before my eyes when next i knew what i was doing i was holding one of the men by a fierce grip about the waist and was swinging him high above my shoulders now if the good god had not given me back my consciousness at that moment i know full well that at the next he who was then in my power would have drawn no more the breath of a living man but i felt on a sudden the same ghostly hand upon me that i have written of before and heard the same ghostly voice in mine ear so dropping the man gently to his feet as gently as a mother might slip her babe to its cot i lifted up my poor mangled beast by its hinder legs and turned away with it and as i went the other men fell apart from me with looks of terror for they saw that god had willed it that with an awful strength should i a man of great passions go through life in peril when i had found coolness to think of this that had happened i mourned for the loss of the only companion that had ever shared with me my desolate state but more than my grief for the dog was my fear for myself remembering with horror that when i would have called on the men to desist i could not utter one word truly it may have been the swift access of anger that then tied my tongue but i could not question that my sudden speechlessness told me i was losing the faculty of speech this conclusion fastened upon me with great pain and i saw that for a twelvemonth or more i had been zealously preserving the minor qualities of humanity while this its greatest faculty speech that distinguishes man from the brute had been silently slipping from me preserve my power of speech also i resolved i would and though an evil spirit within me seemed to make a mock at me and to say wherefore this anxiety to keep your speech seeing that you will never require it being a man cut off forever from all intercourse with other men yet i held to my purpose then i asked myself how i was to preserve my speech save by much and frequent speaking and how i was to speak having nonenot even my dog nowto speak to for to speak constantly with myself was a practise i shrank from as leading perchance to madness since i had noted that men of broken wit were much given to mumbling vain words to themselves at last i concluded that there was but one way for me and that was to pray having lighted on this thought i had still some misgivings for the evil spirit within me again made a mock at me asking why i should speak to god being a man outside gods grace and why i should waste myself in the misspent desire of prayer seeing that the heavenly majesty had set his face from me in rejecting the atonement of my life which i had offered for my crime but after great inward strivings i came back to my old form of selfishness and was convinced that though when i prayed god would not hear me yet that the yearning and uplooking of prayer might be a good thing for the spiritual part of my nature as a manfor when was the beast known to pray at this i tried to recall a few good words such as my father used and at length after much beating of the wings of my memory i remembered some that were the words of bishop jeremy taylor and did betake myself to prayer in this manner o most gracious god i tremble to come into thy presence so polluted and dishonored as i am by my foul stain of sin which i have contracted but i must come or i perish i am useless to any purposes of god and man and like one that is dead unconcerned in the changes and necessities of the world living only to spend my time and like a vermin eat of the fruits of the earth o my god i can not help it now miserable man that i am to reduce myself to so sad a state that i neither am worthy to come to thee nor dare i stay from thee the greatness of my crime brings me to my remedy and now i humbly pray thee to be merciful to my sin for it is great and this prayer i spoke aloud twice daily thenceforward at the rising and the setting of the sun going out of my house and kneeling on the turf on the top of the black head and when i had prayed i sang what i could remember of the psalm that runs it is good for me that i have been in trouble that i may learn thy statutes in my minds eye i see myself a solitary man in that lone place with the sea stretching wide below me and only the sound of its heavy beat on the rocks rising over me in the quiet air chapter xlii of the breaking of the curse thus far have i written these four days past amid pain and the quick lessening of the powers of life in sleepless hours of the night i have made this writing sitting oftenest by the light of my feeble candles until the day has been blue over the sea and now that i glance back and see my own heart in the mirror i have made for it i am like to one who has been brought through a fearsome sickness that has left its marks upon him to look for the first time at his altered face in the glass and can it be that i who have penned these words am the man of seven years ago ah now i see how profound has been the change that my great punishment has made in me and perceive the end of god in refusing my poor atonement of life for life and cutting me off from among men i will not say that what i have already written has not cost me some pangs and perhaps some tears but now i am come to that place where i must tell of the great turningpoint in my sad state and though the strength fails me wherewith i hold the pen to write of it my spirit rises before it like as the lark awakened by the dawn this yearsurely the darkest within the memory of our poor people of manbegan with more than its share of a winter of heavy rains the spring that followed was also rainy and when i looked for the summer to begin the rains were still incessant heavy and sodden was the ground even of the moor whereon i lived so that my feet sank into it as into a morass and much of the seed i sowed was washed from it and wasted when at length the long rains ceased to fall the year was far worn into june and then the sun came quick and hot my house stood on a brow descending to the cliffs of the coast and beneath me were less than two feet of mold above the rock but when the great heat came after the great rain out of the ground there arose a thick miasmic mist that filled the air obscured the light lay heavy in sweat upon my hair and flesh and made the walls and floor the furniture and the bed of my home damp and dripping with constant dew quickly i set myself to the digging of deep trenches that went vertically down the brow to the cliff head and soon the ground about me across many acres was drained dry but though i lived in a clear air and could now see the sun as well as feel it yet i perceived that the mists stood in a wide halfcircle around me like walls of rain seen afar while the spot whereon you stand is fair and in the sunshine in my daily walks to the top of the moor i could no longer see the houses of cregneesh for the cloud of vapor that lay over it and when i walked to the kallow head for the first time since the day i lost my dog the basin below where portlemary stands was even as a vast vaporous sea without one islet of house or hill my health suffered little from this unaccustomed humidity for my bodily strength was ever wonderful but my spirits sank to a deep depression and oft did i wonder how the poor souls must fare who lived on the low wet curraghs near to where my own home once lay from day to day and week to week the mist continued to rise from the dank ground under the hot sun and still the earth came up in thick clods to the spade the nights alone were clear and toward midsummer i was witness to strange sights in the heavens thus i saw a comet pass close across the island from coast to coast with a visible motion as of quivering flame what this visitation could foretell i pondered long and sadly and much i hungered for knowledge of what was being done in the world of men but therein it seemed to my wayward mind that i was like a man buried in the churchyard while he is yet alive who hears the bell in the tower that peals and tolls but has no window in his tomb from which to see who comes to rejoice and who to mourn when the fleet of fishingboats should have put out from port erin for the ground that lies south of the calf scarce a sail could i see and not a boat had i noted coming from the poolvash where portlemary stands above the bay from the top of the mull hills i could faintly descry the road to castletown but never a cart on marketday seemed to pass over it groups of people i vaguely saw standing together and once at midday from the middle of a field of newmown hay there came to me the sounds of singing and prayer oftener than at any period during my solitary life i saw men on the mountains or felt their presence near me for my senses were grown very keen oftener also than ever before the sound of church bells seemed to come through the air and going to the beach where my shattered boat lay i one day came upon another boat beating idly down the waters of the sound her sails flapping in the wind and no hand at her tiller i stood to watch while the little craft came drifting on with the flow of the tide she ran head on to the cliff at fistard and then i went down to her and found never a living soul aboard of her from these and other startling occurrences that came to me vaguely as if by the one sense of the buried man i felt that with the poor people of this island all was not well but nothing did i know of a certainty until a day toward the first week of septemberas i have reckoned itand then a strange thing befell the sun was not shining and when there was no sun there was little mist a strong wind too had got up from the northeast and the atmosphere over land and sea grew clearer as the day wore on the wind strengthened after the turn of the ebb and at halfflood which was toward three in the afternoon it had risen to the pitch of a gale with heavy swirling rain the rain ceased in a few hours and in the lift of the heavy clouds i could see from the rising ground above my house a brig with shortened sail toiling heavily to the southwest of the calf she was struggling in the strong currents that flow there to get into the lee of the island but was beaten back and back never catching the shelter of the cliffs for the rush of the wind that swept over them the darkness was falling in while i watched her and when she was swept back and hidden from me by the forehead of the calf i turned my face homeward then i noticed that on the top of the mull hills a great company of people had gathered and i thought i saw that they were watching the brig that was laboring heavily in the sea that night i had close employment at my fireside for i was finishing a coat that i had someways fashioned with my undeft fingers from the best pieces of many garments that of themselves would no longer hold together rough as a monks long sack it was and all but as shapeless but nevertheless a fit companion for the curranes on my feet which i had made some time before from the coat of my hapless millishvegveen while i wrought with my great sailmakers needle and twine the loud wind moaned about the walls of my house and whistled through its many crevices and made the candle whereby i worked to flicker and gutter yet my mind was more cheerful than had lately been its wont and i sang to myself with my face to the glow of the fire but when toward ten oclock the sea below sent up a louder hiss than before followed by a deeper undergroan suddenly there was a clash at my window and a poor panting seamew with open beak came through it and fell helpless on the floor i picked up the stormbeaten creature and calmed it and patched with the needle the skin of the window which it had broken by its entrance then all at once my mind went back to the brig laboring in the sea behind the calf almost at the same moment and for the first time these seven years a quick knock came to my door i was startled and made no answer but stood stockstill in the middle of the floor with the frightened bird in my hand before i was yet fully conscious of what was happening the wooden latch of the door had been lifted and a man had stepped across the threshold in another moment he had closed the door behind him and was speaking to me you will never find heart to deny me shelter on such a night as this he said i answered him nothing surely with my mind i did not hear him but only with mine ears i was like the one who is awakened suddenly out of a long dream and can scarce be sure which is the dream and which the reality what is behind and what is before the man stumbled a step forward and said speaking falteringly i am faint from a blow he staggered another pace forward and would have fallen but i recovering in some measure my selfcommand caught him in my arms and put him to sit on the settle before the hearth scarce had he gained this rest when his eyelids trembled and closed and he became insensible he was a large swart and bony man bearing in his face the marks of lifes hard storms his dress was plainly the dress of a priest but of an order of priesthood quite unknown to me a proud poverty sat upon the man and before i yet knew wherefor my heart went out to him in a strange uncertain reverence loosening the hard collar that bound his neck i made bare his throat and then moistened his lips with water some other offices i did for him such as with difficulty removing his great boots which were full of water and stretching his feet toward the fire i stirred the peats too and the glow was full and grateful then i looked for the mark of the blow he spoke of and found it where most it was to be feared on the hinder part of the head though there was no blood flowing yet was the skull driven in upon the brain leaving a hollow spot over a space that might have been covered by a copper token he did not soon return to consciousness but toiled hard at intervals to regain it and then lapsed back to a breathless quiet and i not knowing what else to do took a basin of water lukewarm and bathed the wound with it damping the forehead with water that was cold all this time the seamew which i had cast from my hand when the priest stumbled lay in one corner panting its head down its tail up and its powerless wings stretched useless on either side then the man taking a long breath opened his eyes and seeing me he made some tender of gratitude he told me that in being put ashore out of the brig bridget from cork in ireland he had been struck on the head by the boom as it shifted with the wind but that heeding not his injury and thinking he could make portlemary to lie there that night he had set out over the moor while his late comrades of the brig put off from our perilous coast for england whither they were bound so much had he said speaking painfully when again he fell in unconsciousness and this time a strong delirium took hold of him i tried not to hear what then he said for it seemed to me an awful thing that in such an hour of reasons vanquishment the eye of man might look into the heart which only gods eye should see but hear him i must or leave him alone in his present need and he talked loudly of some great outrage wherein helpless women were thrown on the roads without shelter and even the dead in their graves were desecrated when he came to himself again he knew that his mind had wandered and he told me that four years before he had been confessor at the convent of port royal in france he said that in that place they had been men and women of the order of jansenists teaching simple goodness and piety but their convent had been suppressed by commission of the jesuits and being banished from france he had fled to his native country of ireland where now he held the place of parish priest more in this manner he said but my mind was sorely perplexed and i cannot recall his words faithfully or rightly tell of the commerce of conversation between us save that he put to me some broken questions in his moments of ease from pain and muttered many times to himself after i had answered him briefly or when i had answered him not at all for the sense that i was a man awakening out of a dream a long dream of seven lonesome years grew stronger as he told of what traffic the world had lately seen and he himself been witness to and my old creeping terror of the judgment upon me that forbade that any man should speak with me or that i should speak with any man struggled hard with the necessity now before me to make a swift choice whether i should turn away and leave this man who had sought the shelter of my house or break through the curse that bound me choice of any kind i did not make with a conscious mind but before i was yet aware i was talking with the priest and he with me the priest he said i am the catholic priest that your good bishop sent for out of ireland as you have heard i doubt not myself i answered no that i had not heard the priest he asked me did i live alone in this house and how long i had been here myself i said yes and that i had been seven years in this place come christmas the priest he asked what and do you never go up to the towns myself i answered no the priest then said the priest thinking long before he spoke you have not heard of the great sickness that has broken out among your people myself i told him i had heard nothing the priest he said it was the sweating sickness and that vast numbers had fallen to it and many had died i think he saidi can not be surethat after fruitless efforts of his own to combat the disease the bishop of the island had sent to ireland a message for him having heard that the almighty had blessed his efforts in a like terrible scourge that broke out two years before over the bogs of western ireland i listened with fear and began to comprehend much that had of late been a puzzle to me but before the priest had gone far his sickness overcame him afresh and he fell in another long unconsciousness while he lay thus very silent or rambling afresh through the ways of the past i know not what feelings possessed me for my heart was in a great turmoil but when he opened his eyes again very peaceful in their quiet light but with less than before of the power of life in them he said he perceived that his errand had been fruitless and that he had but come to my house to die at that word i started to my feet with a cry but hethinking that my thoughts were of our poor people who would lose a deliverer by his deathtold me to have patience for that god who had smitten him down would surely raise up in his stead a far mightier savior of my afflicted countrymen then in the lapses of his pain he talked of the sickness that had befallen his own people how it was due to long rains that soaked the soil and was followed by the hot sun that drew out of the earth its foul sweat how the sickness fell chiefly on such as had their houses on bogs and lowlying ground and how the cure for it was to keep the body of the sick person closely wrapped in blankets and to dry the air about him with many fires he told me too that all medicines he had yet seen given for this disease were useless and being oftenest of a cooling nature were sometimes deadly he said that those of his own people who had lived on the mountains had escaped the malady much he also said of how men had fled from their wives and women from their children in terror of the infection but that save only in the worst cases contagion from the sweating sickness there could be none more of this sort he said than i can well set down in this writing often he spoke with sore labor as though a strong impulse prompted him and i who listened eagerly heard what he said with a mighty fear for well i knew that if death came to him as he foretold i had now that knowledge which it must be sin to hide after he had said this the lapses into unconsciousness were more frequent than before and the intervals of cool reason and sweet respite from pain were briefer but a short while after midnight he came to himself with a smile on his meagre face and peace in his eyes he asked me would i promise to do one thing for him for that he was a dying man and i told him yes before i had heard what it was that he wished of me then he asked did i know where the bishop lived and at first i made no answer bishops court they call his house he said and it lies to the northwest of this island by the land they have named the curraghs do you know it i bent my head by way of assent the priest i would have you to go to him he said and saythe catholic priest you sent for out of ireland father dalby fulfilled his pledge to you and came to your island but died by the visitation of god on the night of his landing on your shores will you deliver me this message i did not make him an answer and he put the question again still my tongue clave to the roof of my mouth and i could not speak the priest you need not fear he said to go to the bishop for he is a holy man as i have heard without pride of worldly place and the poor and outcast are his constant guests even yet i answered nothing but only held down my head while my heart surged within me the priest the fame of him as a righteous servant of god had gone far into other lands and therefore it was i who love protestantism not at all and hold no dalliance with it came to your island at his call he took my hand in his hands and asked me again if i would go to the bishop to say the words which he had given me and i with swimming eyes that saw nothing of the dying face before me bowed my head and answered i will go near three hours longer he lived and much of that time he passed in a feeble delirium but just before the end came he awoke and motioned to a small bag that hung about his waist i guessed his meaning and drawing out a crucifix i placed it in his hands then he passed silently away and death the black camel that had knelt at the gate of my lone house these seven years of deathinlife had entered it at last to take another man than me chapter xliii of his great resolve when he had ceased to breathe the air of my house became suddenly void and empty with a great awe upon me i rose and stretched him out on the settle and covered his white face with a cloth then in the silence i sat and tried to think of the strange accident that had that night befallen one thing i saw with a fearful certainty that a great burden of responsibility had fallen upon me i thought of the people of this island perishing in their sickness and i remembered that i alone of all men here knew how to succor and save them i alone and who was i the one man accursed among men the one man cut off forever from the company of the living the man without family or kin or name among the people whose flesh no man might touch with his flesh whose eye no other eye might look upon and thus with the burden of responsibility came a yet more terrible burden of doubt was it for me to break through the dread judgment pronounced upon me and go down among the people to heal them and if i went would the people receive me even in this their last extreme before the face of death would all other fears sink out of their sight or fearing death itself less than the curse would they rise up and drive me from them long i sat in the anguish of black misgivings and then rose and ranged my room from side to side if perchance i might find some light in my darkness and oft did the strangeness of that nights accidents so far bewilder me that for an instant it would seem that i must be in a dream once i lifted the facecloth from the face on the settle that i might be sure that i was awake at length it fixed itself on my mind that whatsoever the judgment upon me and whatsoever the peoples terror of it i had no choice but to bear the burden that was now mine own go down among my sick countrymen i should and must let the end be what it would accursed man though i was yet to fulfil the dead priests mission was a mission wherewith god himself seemed to charge me and now i scarce can say how it escaped me that my first duty was to take the body of the priest who had died in my house to one of the churchyards for christian burial there must have been some end of providence in my strange forgetfulness for if this thing had but come into my wild thoughts and i had indeed done what it was fitting that i should do then must certain wonderful consequences have fallen short of the blessing with which god has blessed them what i did thinking no evil was to pick up my spade and go out on the moor and delve for the dead man a shallow grave as i turned to the door i stumbled over something that lay on the floor stooping to look at it i found it to be the poor seamew it was dead and stiff and had still its wings outstretched as if in the act of flight i had not noted until now when with a fearful glance backward i stepped out into the night that the storm had gone a thick dewcloud lay deep over the land and the round moon was shining through it i chose a spot a little to the south of the stone circle on the black head and there by the moons light i howket a barrow of earth the better part of an hour i wrought and when my work was done i went back to my house and then the dead man was cold i took a piece of old canvas and put it about the body from head to feet wrapping it over the clothes and covering the face this done i lifted the dead in my arms and carried it out very hollow and heavy was the thud of my feet on the turf in that uncertain light as i toiled along i recalled the promise that i had given to the priest to see my father and speak with him this memory brought me the sore pain of a wounded tenderness but it strengthened my resolve when i had reached the grave which i had made the night was near to morning the dewcloud had lifted away and out of the unseen murmuring sea that lay far and wide in front of me a gray streak like an arrows barb was shooting up into the darkness of the sky one glance more i took at the dead mans face in that vague foredawn and its swart meagreness seemed to have passed off under deaths composing hand i covered the body with the earth and then i said my prayer for it was nigh to my accustomed hour also i sang my psalm kneeling with my face toward the sea and while i sang in that dank air the sky lightened and the sun rose out of the deep i know not what touched me then if it was not the finger of god himself but suddenly a great burden seemed to fall from me and my heart grew full of a blessed joy and o father i cried i am delivered from the body of the death i lived in i have lived i have died and i live again i saw apparently that the night of my long imprisonment was past that the doors of my dungeon were broken open and that its air was to be the breath of my nostrils no more then the tears gushed from mine eyes and rained down my bony cheeks for well i knew that god had seen that i even i had suffered enough and when i rose to my feet from beside the dead mans grave i felt of a certainty that the curse had fallen away his last words three days have gone since last i put my hand to this writing and now i know that though the curse has fallen from me yet must its earthly penalties be mine to the end sorely weary and more sorely ashamed i have within these three hours past escaped from the tumult of the people how their wild huzzas ring in my ears god bless the priest heaven save the priest their loud cries of a blind gratitude how they follow me oh that i could fly from the memory of them and wipe them out of my mind there were those that appeared to know me among the many that knew me not the tearstained faces the faces hard and stony the faces abashed and confusedhow they live before my eyes and at the tynwald how the children were thrust under my hand for my blessing my blessingmine and at the tynwald thank god it is all over i am away from it forever home i am at last and for the last time better than three weeks have passed since the priest died in my house and i buried him on the moor what strange events have since befallen and in what a strange new world the deemsters terrible end and my own going with the priests message to the bishop my father but i shall not live to set it down nor is it needful so to do for she whom i write for knows all that should be written henceforward everything she knows save one thing only and if this writing should yet come to her hand that also she will then learn gods holy grace be with her i have not seen her the deemster i have seen the bishop i have spoken with and a living vision of our ewan his sweet childdaughter have i held to my knee but not once these many days has she who is dearest of all to me passed before my eyes it is better so i shunned her where she was there i would not go yet through all these heavy years i have borne her upon my heart day and night she has been with me oh mona mona my mona apart forever are our paths in this dim world and my tarnished name is your reproach my love my lost love as a man i yearned for you to hold you to my breast but i was dead to you and i would not break in with an earthly love that must be brief and might not be blessed on a memory that death has purified of its stains adieu adieu my love my own mona though we are never to clasp hands again yet do i know that you will be with me as an unseen presence when the hour comesah how soonof deaths asundering for the power of life is low in me i have taken the sickness it is from the deemster that i have taken it no longer do i fear death yet i hesitate to do with myself what i have long thought that i would do when the end should come tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow i say in my heart and still i am here chapter xliv the sweating sickness i when the sweating sickness first appeared in the island it carried off the lone body known as auntie nan who had lived on the curragh death never came without an excusethe woman was old the people said and went their way but presently a bright young girl who had taken herbs and broths and odd comforts to auntie nan while she lay helpless was stricken down then the people began to hold their heads together four days after the girl was laid to rest her mother died suddenly and two or three days after the mothers death the father was smitten then three other children died in quick succession and in less than three weeks not a soul of that household was left alive this was on the southwest of the curragh and on the north of it near to the church of andreas a similar outbreak occurred about the same time two old people named creer were the first to be taken and a child at cregans farm and a servant at the rectory of the archdeacon followed quickly the truth had now dawned upon the people and they went about with white faces it was the time of the hay harvest and during the two hours rest for the midday meal the haymakers gathered together in the fields for prayer at night when work was done they met again in the streets of the villages to call on god to avert his threatened judgment on sundays they thronged the churches at morning and afternoon services and in the evening they congregated on the shore to hear the quaker preachers who went about under the shadow of the terror without hindrance or prosecution one such preacher a townwatch at castletown known as billybynite threw up his calling and traveled the country in the cart of a carrier prophesying a visitation of gods wrath wherein the houses should be laid waste and the land be left utterly desolate the sickness spread rapidly and passed from the curraghs to the country south and east of them not by ones but tens were the dead now counted day after day and the terror spread yet faster than the malady the herring season had run a month only and it was brought to a swift close men who came in from the boats after no more than a nights absence were afraid to go up to their homes lest the sickness had gone up before them then they went out to sea no longer but rambled for herbs in the rank places where herbs grew and finding them good and bad fit and unfit they boiled and ate them still the sickness spread and the dead were now counted in hundreds of doctors there were but two in the island and these two were closely engaged sitting by the bedsides of the richer folk feeling the pulse with one hand and holding the watch with the other better service they did not do for rich and poor alike fell before the sickness the people turned to the clergy and got beautiful texes but no cure they went to the old bishop and prayed for the same help that he had given them in the old days of their great need he tried to save them and failed a preparation of laudanum which had served him in good stead for the flux produced no effect on the sweating sickness with other and other medicines he tried and tried again his old head was held very low my poor people he said with a look of shame i fear that by reason of the sins of me and mine the spirit of the lord is gone from me then the people set up a cry as bitter as that which was wrung from them long before when they were in the grip of their hunger the sweat is on us they groaned and the old bishop that he might not hear their voice of reproach shut himself up from them like a servant whom the lord had forsaken then terror spread like a fire but terror in some minds begets a kind of courage and soon there were those who would no longer join the prayermeetings in the hayfields or listen to the preaching on the shore one of these was a woman of middle life an idle slattern who had for six or seven years lived a wandering life while others prayed she laughed mockingly and protested that for the sweat as well as for every other scare of life there was no better preventive than to think nothing about it she carried out her precept by spending her days in the inns and her nights on the roads being supported in her dissolute existence by secret means whereof gossip spoke frequently the terrified world about her busy with its loud prayers took small heed of her blasphemies until the numbers of the slain had risen from hundreds to thousands then in their frenzy the people were carried away by superstition and heard in the womans laughter the ring of the devils own ridicule somebody chanced to see her early one morning drawing water to bathe her hot forehead and before night of that day the evil word had passed from mouth to mouth that it was she who had brought the sweating sickness by poisoning the wells thereupon half a hundred lusty fellows with fear in their wild eyes gathered in the street and set out to search for the woman in her accustomed haunt the three legs of man they found her and she was heavy with drink they hounded her out of the inn into the road and there amid oaths and curses they tossed her from hand to hand until her dress was in rags her face and arms were bleeding and she was screaming in the great fright that had sobered her it was tuesday night and the deemster who had been holding court at peeltown late that day was riding home in the darkness when he heard this tumult in the road in front of him putting spurs to his horse he came upon the scene of it before he had gathered the meaning of what was proceeding in the dark road the woman had broken from her tormentors and thrown herself before him crawling on the ground and gripping his foot in the stirrup deemster save me save me deemster she cried in her frantic terror the men gathered round and told their story the woman had poisoned the wells and the bad water had brought the sweat she was a charmer by common report and should be driven out of the island what pedlers french is this said the deemster turning hotly on the crowd about him men men what forgotten age have you stepped out of that you come to me with such driveling doddering blank idiocy but the woman carried away by her terror and not grasping the deemsters meaning cried that if he would but save her she would confess yes she had poisoned the wells it was true she was a charmer she acknowledged to the evil eye but save her save her save her and she would tell all the deemster listened with a feverish impatience the woman lies he said under his breath and then lifting his voice he asked if any one had a torch who is the woman he asked i seem to know her voice d her shes a witch said one of the men thrusting his hot face forward in the darkness over the womans cowering body ay and so was her mother before her he said again tell me woman whats your name said the deemster stoutly but this question seemed to break down as he asked it there was a moments pause mally kerruish the woman answered him slobbering at his stirrup in the dark road before him let her go said the deemster in a thick underbreath in another moment he had disengaged his foot from the womans grasp and was riding away that night mally kerruish died miserably of her fright in the little toolshed of a cottage by the cross vein where six years before her mother had dropped to a lingering death alone news of her end was taken straightway to ballamona by one of the many tongues of evil rumor with jarvis kerruish who was in lace collar and silverbuckled shoes the deemster had sat down to supper he rose left his meat untouched and jarvis supped alone late that night he said uneasily i intend to send in my resignation to castletownburden of my office as deemster is too much for my strength good said jarvis and if sir you should ever think of resigning the management of your estate also you know with how much willingness i would undertake it solely in order that you might spend your days in rest and comfort i have often thought of it latterly said the deemster half an hour thereafter he spent in an uneasy perambulation of the diningroom while jarvis picked his teeth and cleaned his nails i think i must surely be growing old he said then and drawing a long breath he took up his bedroom candle ii the sickness increased the deaths were many in the houses about ballamona and in less than a week after the night of mally kerruishs death thorkell mylrea a deemster no longer had made over to jarvis kerruish all absolute interest in his estates i shall spend my last days in the cause of religion he said he had paid up his tithe in poundnotesfive years tithe in arrears with interest added at the rate of six per cent blankets he had ordered for the poor of his own parish a double blanket for each family with cloaks for some of the old women this done he relinquished his worldly possessions and shut himself from the sickness in a back room of ballamona admitting none and never stirring abroad except to go to church the bishop had newly opened the chapel at bishops court for daily prayers and of all constant worshipers there thorkell was now the most constant every morning his little shriveled figure knelt at the form before the communion and from his blanched lips the prayers were mumbled audibly much he sought the bishops society and in every foolish trifle he tried to imitate his brother a new canon of the church had lately ordered that every bishop should wear an episcopal wig and over his flowing white hair the bishop of man had perforce to put the grotesque headcovering seeing this thorkell sent to england for a periwig and perched the powdered curls on his own bald crown the sickness was at its worst the terror was at its height and men were flying from their sick families to caves in the mountains when one day the bishop announced in church that across in ireland as he had heard there was a good man who had been blessed under god with miraculous powers of curing this awful malady send for him send for him the people shouted with one voice little heeding the place they sat in but said the bishop with a failing voice the good man is a roman catholicindeed a romish priest at that word a groan came from the people for they were protestants of protestants let us not think that no good can come out of nazareth the bishop continued and who shall say though we love the papacy not at all but that holy men adhere to it there was a murmur of disapproval my good people the bishop went on falteringly we are in gods hands and his anger burns among us the people broke up abruptly and talking of what the bishop had said they shook their heads but their terror continued and before its awful power their qualms of faith went down as before a flood then they cried send for the priest and the bishop sent for him seven weary days passed and at length with a brightening countenance the bishop announced that the priest had answered that he would come other three days went by and the news passed from north to south that in the brig bridget of cork bound for whitehaven with liberty to call at peeltown the romish priest father dalby had sailed for the isle of man then day after day the men went up to the hilltops to catch sight of the sail of an irish brig at last they sighted one from the mull hills and she was five leagues south of the calf but the wind was high and the brig labored hard in a heavy sea four hours the people watched her and saw her bearing down into the most dangerous currents about their coast night closed in and the wind rose to the strength of a gale next morning at early dawn the people climbed the headlands again but no brig could they now see and none had yet made their ports she must be gone down they told themselves and so saying they went home with heavy hearts but two days afterward there went through the island a thrilling cry he is herehe has comethe priest and at that word a wave of rosy health swept over a thousand haggard faces iii in the dark sleepingroom of a little ivycovered cottage that stood endon to the highroad through michael a blind woman lay dying of the sickness it was old kerry and on a threelegged stool before her bed her husband hommy sat pitiful enough was hommys poor ugly face his thick lubber lips were drawn heavily downward and under his besom brows his little eyes were red and his eyelids swollen in his hands he held a shovel and he was using it as a fan to puff air into kerrys face its all as one man the sick woman moaned yere only keeping the breath in me im bound to lave ye and thereupon hommy groaned lustily and redoubled his efforts with the shovel there was a knock at the door and a lady entered it was mona pale of face but very beautiful in her pallor and with an air of restful sadness and how are you now dear kerry she asked leaning over the bed middling badly mam kerry answered feebly ill be took sarten sure as the saying is dont lose heart kerry have you not heard that the priest is coming chut mam ill be gone plaze god where none of the like will follow me hush kerry he was in patrick yesterday he will be in german tomorrow and the next day he will be here in michael he is a good man and is doing wonders with the sick kerry turned face to the wall and hommy talked with mona what was to become of him when kerry was gone who would be left to give him a bit of a tidy funeral the dempster bad cess to the like of him what could be expected from a master who had turned his own daughter out of doors i am better where i am mona whispered and that was her sole answer to the deaf mans too audible questions and hommy after a pause assented to the statement with his familiar comment the bishops a rael ould archangel so he is thereupon kerry turned her gaze from the wall and said didnt i tell ye mam that he wasnt dead who whyhimhim that we maynt namehim hush dear kerry he died long ago i tell ye mam hes a living man and coming backi know ithes coming back immadienti saw him drop it woman its drames said hommy i saw him last night as plain as plainwearing a long gray sack and curranes on his feet and a queer sort of hat it must have been the priest that you saw in your dream dear kerry the sick woman raised herself on one elbow and answered eagerly i tell you no mam but himhim lie still kerry you will be worse if you uncover yourself to the cool air there was a moments quiet and then the blind woman said finally im going where ill have my eyes same as another body at that hommys rugged face broadened to a look of gruesome sorrow and he renewed his exertions with the shovel iv at seven oclock that day the darkness had closed in a bright turf fire burned in a room in bishops court and the bishop sat before it with his slippered feet on a sheepskin rug his face was mellower than of old and showed less of strength and more of sadness mona stood at a teatable by his side cutting slices of bread and butter a white face with eyes of fear looked in at the dark window it was davy fayle he was but little older to look upon for the seven years that had gone heavily over his troubled head his simple look was as vacant and his lagging lip hung as low but his sluggish intellect had that night become suddenly charged with a ready mans swiftness mona went to the door come in she said but davy would not come he must speak with her outside and she went out to him he was trembling visibly what is it she said mistress mona said davy in a voice of great emotion its as true as the living god what she said hes aliveould kerry said truehes alive and coming back mona glanced into his face by the dull light that came through the window his eyes usually dull and vacant were aflame with a strange fire she laid one hand on the doorjamb and said catching her breath davy remember what the men said long agothat they saw him lying in the snow hes alive im telling youive seen him with my own eyes where i went down to patrick this morning to meet the priest coming upbut its no priest at allitsitsits him again mona drew her breath audibly think what you are saying davy if it should not be true oh if you should be mistaken its bible truth mistress monaill go bail on it afore god amighty the priest you say aw lave it to me to know masthai meanhim i must go in davy goodnight to you and thank yougoodnight and the plaintive tenderness of her voice broke down to a sob oh what can it all mean she exclaimed more vehemently davy turned away the low moan of the sea came up through the dark night v it happened that after service the next morning the bishop and thorkell walked out of the chapel side by side we are old men now gilcrist said thorkell and should be good friends together that is so the bishop answered weve both lost a son and can feel for each other the bishop made no reply were childless men in fact theres mona god bless her the bishop said very softly true true said thorkell and there was silence for a moment it was partly her fault when she left mepartly i saydont you think so gilcrist said thorkell nervously shes a dear sweet soul the bishop said its true they stepped on a few paces and passed by the spot whereon the two fishermen laid down their dread burden from the mooragh seven years before then thorkell spoke again and in a feverish voice dye know gilcrist i sometimes awake in the night crying ewan ewan the bishop did not answer and thorkell in another tone asked when the irish priest was to reach michael he may be here tomorrow the bishop said thorkell shuddered it must be that god is revenging himself upon us with this fearful scourge it dishonors god to say so the bishop replied he is calling upon us to repent there was another pause and then thorkell asked what a man should do to set things right in this world if perchance he had taken a little more in usury than was fair and honest give back whatever was more than justice said the bishop promptly but that is often impossible gilcrist if he has robbed the widow and she is dead let him repay the fatherless it is impossiblei tell you gilcrist it is impossibleimpossible as they were entering the house thorkell asked if there was truth in the rumor that the wells had been charmed to believe such stories is to be drawn off from a trust in god and a dependence on his good providence said the bishop but i must say brother that strange things are known to happen now i myself have witnessed extraordinary fulfilments superstition is a forsaking of god whom we have most need to fly to in trouble and distress the bishop answered truevery truei loathe it but still its a sort of religion isnt it gilcrist so the wise man saysas the ape is a sort of a man vi three days later the word went round that he who had been looked for was come to michael and many went out to meet him he was a stalwart man straight and tall bony and muscular his dress was povertys own livery a gray shapeless sackcoat reaching below his knees curranes on his feet of untanned skin with open clocks and a cap of cloth half helmet and half hood drawn closely down over his head his cheeks were shaven and deeply bronzed the expression of his face was of a strange commingling of strength and tenderness his gestures were few slow and gentle his measured step was a rhythmic stridethe stride of a man who has learned in the long endurance of solitude to walk alone in the ways of the world he spoke little and scarcely answered the questions which were put to him aw but i seem to have seen the good man in my drames said one and some said ay to that and some laughed at it within six hours of his coming he had set the whole parish to work half of the men he sent up into the mountains to cut gorse and drag it down to the curraghs in piles of ten feet high tied about with long sheep lankets of twisted straw the other half he set to dig trenches in the marshy places he made the women to kindle a turf fire in every room with a chimneyflue and when night came he had great fires of gorse peat withered vegetation and dried seawrack built on the open spaces about the houses in which the sickness had broken out he seemed neither to rest nor eat from sick house to sick house from trench to trench and fire to fire he moved on with his strong step and behind him at all times having never a word from him and never a look but trudging along at his heels like a dog was the manlad davy fayle many of the affrighted people who had taken refuge in the mountains returned to their homes at his coming but others husbands and fathers chiefly remained on the hills leaving their wives and families to fend for themselves seeing this he went up and found some of them in their hidingplaces and shaming them out of their cowardice brought them back behind him more docile than sheep behind a shepherd when the extownwatch billybynite next appeared on the curraghs in the round of his prophetic itineration the strange man said not a word but he cut short the vehement jeremiad by taking the quaker prophet by legs and neck and throwing him headlong into one of the draintroughs newly dug in the dampest places but the strength of this silent man was no more conspicuous than his tenderness when in the frenzy of their fever the sufferers would cast off their clothes and try to rise from their beds and rush into the cooler air from the heat by which he had surrounded them his big horny hands would restrain them with a great gentleness before he had been five days in michael and on the curraghs the sickness began to abate the deaths were fewer and some of the sick rose from their beds then the people plied him with many questions and would have overwhelmed him with their rude gratitude to their questions he gave few answers and when they thanked him he turned and left them they said that their bishop who was grown feeble the good ould angel thought it strange that he had not yet visited him to this he answered briefly that before leaving the parish he would go to bishops court they told him that mistress mona daughter of the deemster that was bad cess to him had been seeking him high and low at this his lip trembled and he bent his head the good mans face plagues me mortal said old billythegawk whiles i know it and other whiles i dont vii only another day did the stranger remain in michael but the brief times was full of strange events the night closed in before seven oclock it was then very dark across the mountains and the sea lay black beyond the cliffs but the curraghs were dotted over with the many fires which had been kindled about the infected houses within one of these houses the home of jabez gawne the stranger stood beside the bed of a sick woman the tailors wife behind him there were anxious faces davy fayle always near him leaned against the doorjamb by the porch and while the stranger wrapped the sweltering sufferer in hot blankets other sufferers sent to him to pray of him to come to them first there came an old man to tell of his grandchild who had been smitten down that day and she was the last of his kin whom the sweat had left alive then a woman to say that her husband who had started again with the boats but yesterday had been brought home to her that night with the sickness he listened to all who came and answered quietly i will go at length a young man ran in and said the dempsters down hes shouting for you sir he sent me hotfoot to fetch you the stranger listened as before and seemed to think rapidly for a moment for his under lip trembled and was drawn painfully inward then he answered as briefly as ever and with as calm a voice i will go the man ran back with his answer but presently returned saying with panting breath hes rambling sir raving mad sir and shouting that he must be coming after you if youre not for coming to him we will go together the stranger said and they went out immediately davy fayle followed them at a few paces viii through the darkness of that night a woman young and beautiful in cloak and hood like a nuns walked from house to house of the curraghs where the fires showed that the sickness was still raging it was mona these three days past she had gone hither and thither partly to tend the sick people partly in hope of meeting the strange man who had come to cure them again and again she had missed him being sometimes only a few minutes before or after him still she passed on from house to house looking for him as she went in at every fresh door yet half dreading the chance that might bring them face to face she entered the house where he had received her fathers message almost on the instant when he left it the three men had gone by her in the darkness jabez the tailor who sat whimpering in the ingle told her that the priest had that moment gone off to ballamona where the dempster that washadnt she heard the newseswas new down with the sweat her delicate face whitened at that and after a pause she turned to follow but going back to the hearth she asked if the stranger had been told that the bishop wanted to see him jabez told her yes and that he had said he would go up to bishops court before leaving the parish then another question trembled on her tongue but she could not utter it at last she asked what manner of man the stranger was to look upon aw big and sthraight and tall said jabez and billythegawk who sat at the opposite side of the ingle being kin to jabezs sick wife said ay and quiet like and solemn extraordinary a wonderful man wonderful wonderful said jabez still whimpering and wherever he comes the sweat goes down before him with a flood as i say said billythegawk the good mans face plagues me mortal i cant bethink me where ive seen the like of it afore monas lips quivered at that word and she seemed to be about to speak but she said nothing and the strong he is said jabez i never knew but one man in the island with half the strength of arm as him monas pale face twitched visibly and she listened as with every faculty who dye mane asked billythegawk at that question there was a moments silence between the men then each drew a long breath dislodged a heavy burden from his throat glanced significantly up at mona and looked into the others face him said jabez in a faint underbreath speaking behind his hand him billythegawk straightened his crooked back opened wide his rheumy eyes pursed up his wizened cheeks and emitted a low long whistle lord amighty for an instant jabez looked steadily into the old mendicants face and then drew himself up in his seat lord amassy monas heart leaped to her mouth she was almost beside herself with suspense and felt an impulse to scream ix within a week after old thorkell had conversed with the bishop about the rumor that the wells had been charmed his terror of the sickness had grown nigh to madness he went to church no longer but shut himself up in his house night and day his restless footstep could be heard to pass from room to room and floor to floor he ate little and such was his dread of the water from his well that for three days together he drank nothing at length burning from thirst he went up the dhoon glen and drank at a pool going down on hands and knees to lap the water like a dog always he seemed to be mumbling prayers and when the bell of the church rang no matter for what occasion he dropped to his knees and prayed audibly he forbade the servants of the house to bring him news of deaths but waited and watched and listened at open doors for their conversation among themselves at night he went to the front windows to look at the fires that were kindled about the infected houses on the curraghs he never failed to turn from that sight with bitter words such work was but the devils play it was making a mock of god who had sent the sickness to revenge himself on the islands guilty people thorkell told jarvis kerruish as much time after time jarvis answered contemptuously and thorkell retorted angrily at length they got to high words and jarvis flung away one morning thorkell called for hommybeg they told him that hommy had been nursing his wife the blind woman was now dead and hommy was burying her at this thorkells terror was appalling to look upon all night long he had been telling himself that he despised the belief in second sight but that he would see if kerry pretended to know whether he himself was to outlive the scourge no matter the woman was dead so much the better later the same day thorkell remembered that somewhere on the mountains there lived an old farmer who was a seer and bard he would go to see the old charlatan yes he would amuse himself with the superstition that aped religion thorkell set out and found the bards lonely house far up above the sherragh vane in a corner of the big fireplace the old man sat with a black shawl bound about his head and tied under his chin he was past eighty years of age and his face was as old a face as thorkell had ever looked upon on his knee a young child was sitting and two or three small boys were playing about his feet a brisk middleaged woman was stirring the peats and settling the kettle on the chimneyhook she was the old mans wife and the young brood were the old mans children thorkell began to talk of carvals and said he had come to hear some of them the old bards eyes brightened he had written a carol about the sickness from the lath he took a parchment pan full of papers that were worn thumbmarked and greasy from one of these papers he began to read and thorkell tried to listen the poem was an account of a dream the dreamer had dreamt that he had gone into a church there was a congregation gathered and a preacher was in the pulpit but when the preacher prayed the dreamer heard nothing of god at length he discovered that it was a congregation of the dead in the region of the damned they had all died of the sweat every man of them had been warned by wise men and women in this world the congregation sang a joyless psalm and when their service was done they began to break up then the dreamer recognized some whom he had known in the flesh among them was one who had killed his own son and he was afflicted with a burning thirst to this unhappy man the dreamer offered a basin of milkandwater but the damned soul could not get the basin to his parched lips struggle as he might to lift it in his stiff arms at first thorkell listened with the restless mind of a man who had come on better business and then with a feverish interest the sky had darkened since he entered the house and while the old bard chanted in his singsong voice and the children made their clatter around his feet a storm of heavy rain pelted against the windowpane the ballad ended in the grim doggerel of a harrowing appeal to the sinner to shun his evil courses o sinner see your dangerous state and think of hell ere tis too late when worldly cares would drown each thought pray call to mind that hell is hot still to increase your godly fears let this be sounding in your ears still bear in mind that hell is hot remember and forget it not thus with a swinging motion of the body the old bard of the mountains chanted this rude song on the dangers of damnation thorkell leaped up from the settle and sputtered out an expression of contempt what madness was this if he had his way he would clap all superstitious people into the castle the next morning when sitting down to breakfast thorkell told jarvis kerruish that he had three nights running dreamt the same dream and it was a terrible one jarvis laughed in his face and said he was a foolish old man thorkell answered with heat and they parted on the instant neither touching food toward noon thorkell imagined he felt feverish and asked for jarvis kerruish but jarvis was at his toilet and would not be disturbed at five oclock the same day thorkell was sweating from every pore and crying lustily that he had taken the sickness toward seven he ordered the servanta young man named juan caine who had come to fill hommys placeto go in search of the romish priest father dalby when the stranger came the young man opened the door to him and whispered that the old masters wits were gone hes not been wise these two hours the young man said and then led the way to thorkells bedroom he missed the corridor and the stranger pointed to the proper door thorkell was sitting up in his bed his clothes had not been taken off but his coata blue coat lacedand also his long yellow vest were unbuttoned his wig was perched on the top of a highbacked chair and over his bald head hung a torn piece of red flannel his long hairy hands with the prominent blue veins crawled over the counterpane his eyes were open very wide when he saw the stranger he was for getting out of bed i am not ill he said its folly to think that ive taken the sickness i sent for you to tell you something that you should know then he called to the young man to bring him water juan water he cried juan i say more water he turned to the stranger its true im always athirst but is that any proof that i have taken the sickness juan be quickwater the young man brought a pewter pot of cold water and thorkell clutched at it but as he was stretching his neck to drink his hot lips working visibly and his white tongue protruding he drew suddenly back is it from the well he asked the stranger took the pewter out of his hands unlocking his stiff fingers with his own great bony ones make the water hot he said to the servant thorkell fell back to his pillow and the rag of red blanket dropped from his bald crown then he lifted himself on one elbow and began again to talk of the sickness you have made a mistake he said it is not to be cured it is gods revenge on the people of this sinful island shall i tell you for what offense for superstition superstition is the ape of religion it is the reproach of god juan juan i say help me off with this coat and these bedclothes also why are there so many its true sirfather is itits true father im hot but what of that water juan more waterglen water juan the stranger pushed thorkell gently back and covered him closely from the air as i say it is superstition sir said thorkell again i would have it put down by law it is the curse of this island what are those twentyfour keys doing that they dont stamp it out and the clergywhat are they wrangling about now that they dont see to it ill tell you how it is sir it is this way a man does something and some old woman sneezes straightway he thinks himself accursed and that what is predicted must certainly come about and it does come about why because the man himself with his blundering doddering fears brings it about he brings it about himselfthats how it is and then every old woman in the island sneezes again saying this thorkell began to laugh loudly frantically atrociously jarvis kerruish had entered while he was running on with his tirade the stranger did not lift his eyes to jarvis but jarvis looked at him attentively when thorkell had finished his hideous laugh he turned to jarvis and asked if superstition was not the plague of the island and if it ought not to be put down by law jarvis curled his lips for answer but his form of contempt was lost on old thorkells dim eyes have we not often agreed that it is so said thorkell and that you said jarvis speaking slowly and bitterly are the most superstitious man alive what what thorkell cried the stranger lifted his face and looked steadily into jarviss eyes you he said calmly have some reason to say so jarvis reddened turned about stepped to the door glanced back at the stranger and went out of the room thorkell was now moaning on the pillow i am all alone he said and he fell to a bout of weeping the stranger waited until the hysterical fit was over and then said where is your daughter ah said thorkell dropping his red eyes send for her i will juan go to bishops court juan i say run fast and fetch mistress mona tell her that her father is ill as thorkell gave this order jarvis kerruish returned to the room no said jarvis lifting his hand against the young man no cried thorkell if this is my house i will be master in it said jarvis master your house yours thorkell cried and then he fell to a fiercer bout of hysterical curses bastard i gave you all but for me you would be on the roadsay the dunghill this violence will avail you nothing said jarvis with hard constraint mistress mona shall not enter this house jarvis placed himself with his back to the door the stranger stepped up to him laid one powerful hand on his arm and drew him aside go for mistress mona he said to the young man knock at the door on your return i will open it the young man obeyed the stranger jarvis stood a moment looking blankly into the strangers face then he went out of the room thorkell was whimpering on the pillow it is true he said with laboring breath though i hate superstition and loathe it i was once its victimonce only my son ewan was killed by my brothers son dan they loved each other like david and jonathan but i told ewan a lie and they fought and ewan was brought home dead yes i told a lie but i believed it then i made myself believe it i listened to some old wifes balderdash and thought it true and dan was cut offthat is to say banished excommunicated worse worse but hes dead now he was found dead in the snow again thorkell tried to laugh a poor despairing laugh that was half a cry dead they threatened me that he would push me from my place and he is dead before me so much for divination but tell meyou are a priesttell me if that sin will drag me down totobut then remember i believed it was trueyes i the strangers face twitched and his breathing became quick and it was you who led the way to all that followed he said in a subdued voice it was it was the stranger had suddenly reached over the bed and taken thorkell by the shoulders at the next instant he had relinquished his hard grasp and was standing upright as before and with as calm a face and thorkell went jabbering on these three nights i have dreamt a fearful dream shall i tell you what it was shall i i thought dan my brothers son arose out of his grave and came to my bedside and peered into my face then i thought i shrieked and died and the first thing i saw in the other world was my son ewan and he peered into my face also and told me that i was damned eternally but tell me dont you think it was only a dream father father i say tell me thorkell was clambering up by hold of the strangers coat the stranger pushed him gently back lie still lie stillyou too have suffered much he said lie quietgod is merciful just then jarvis kerruish entered in wild excitement now i know who this man is he said pointing to the stranger father dalby said thorkell pshawit is dan mylrea thorkell lifted himself stiffly on his elbow and rigidly drew his face closely up to the strangers face and peered into the strangers eyes then he took a convulsive hold of the strangers coat shrieked and fell back on to the pillow at that moment there was a loud knocking at the door below the stranger left the room in the hall a candle was burning he put it out then he opened the door a woman entered she was alone she passed him in the darkness without speaking he went out of the house and pulled the door after him x an hour later than this terrible interview wherein his identity never hidden by any sorry masquerade was suddenly revealed daniel mylrea followed closely at his heels by davy fayle walked amid the fires of the valley to bishops court he approached the old house by the seafront and went into its grounds by a gate that opened on a footpath to the library through a clump of elms sluggish as was davys intellect he reflected that this was a path that no stranger could know the sky of the night had lightened and here and there a star gleamed through the thinning branches overhead in a faint breeze the withering leaves of the dying summer rustled slightly on the meadow before the house a silvery haze of nightdew lay in its silence sometimes the croak of a frog came from the glen and from the sea beyond though seemingly from the mountains opposite there rose into the air the rumble of the waves on the shore daniel mylrea passed on with a slow strong step but a secret pain oppressed him he was walking on the ground that was dear with a thousand memories of happy childhood he was going back for some brief moments that must be painful and joyful awful and delicious to the house which he had looked to see no more already he was very near to those who were very dear to him and to whom he tooyes it must be soto whom he too in spite of all must still be dear father father he whispered to himself and mona my mona my love my love only the idle chatter of the sapless leaves answered to the yearning cry of his broken spirit he had passed out of the shade of the elms into the open green of the meadow with the stars above it when another voice came to him it was the voice of a child singing clear and sweet and with a burden of tenderness such as a childs voice rarely carries it floated through the quiet air daniel mylrea passed on until he came by the library window which was alight with a rosy glow there he stood for a moment and looked into the room his father the bishop was seated in the oak chair that was clamped with iron clamps older he seemed to be and with the lines a thought deeper on his massive brow on a stool at his feet with one elbow resting on the apron in front of him a little maiden sat and she was singing a fire burned red on the hearth before them presently the bishop rose from his chair and went out of the room walking feebly and with drooping head then daniel mylrea walked round to the front of the house and knocked the door was opened by a servant whose face was strange to him everything that he saw was strange and yet everything was familiar the hall was the same but smaller and when it echoed to his foot a thrill passed through him he asked for the bishop and was led like a stranger through his fathers house to the door of the library the little maiden was now alone in the room she rose from her stool as he entered and without the least reserve stepped up to him and held out her hand he took her tender little palm in his great fingers and held it for a moment while he looked into her face it was a beautiful childface soft and fair and oval with a faint tinge of olive in the pale cheeks and with yellow hairalmost white in the glow of the red firefalling in thin tresses over a full smooth forehead he sat and drew her closer to him still looking steadily into her face then in a tremulous voice he asked her what her name was and the little maiden who had shown no fear at all nor any bashfulness answered that her name was aileen but they call me ailee she added promptly everybody calls me ailee everybody who oh everybody she answered with a true childs emphasis your mother she shook her head youryourperhapsyour she shook her head more vigorously i know what youre going to say but ive got none she said got none he repeated the little maidens face took suddenly a wondrous solemnity and she said my father died a long long long time agowhen i was only a little baby his lips quivered and his eyes fell from her face such a long long while agoyou wouldnt think and auntie says i cant even remember him auntie but shall i tell you what kerry said it was that made him dieshall ionly i must whisperand you wont tell auntie will youbecause auntie doesnt knowshall i tell you his quivering lips whitened and with trembling hands he drew aside the little maidens head that her innocent eyes might not gaze into his face how old are you ailee ven he asked in a brave voice oh im sevenand auntie shes seven too auntie and i are twins and you can sing can you not will you sing for me what shall i sing anything sweetheartwhat you sang a little while since for grandpa grandpa kerry says no its uncle not grandpa but thats wrong with a look of outraged honor and besides how should kerry know its not her grandpa is it do you know kerry then the little face saddened all at once oh i forgotpoor kerry poor kerry i used to go and see her you go up the road and then on and on and on until you come to some children and then on and on and on until you get to a little boyand then youre there wont you sing sweetheart ill sing grandpas song grandpas yes the one he likes then the little maidens dimpled face smoothened out and her simple eyes turned gravely upward as she began to sing o myle charaine where got you your gold lone lone you have left me here o not in the curragh deep under the mold lone lone and void of cheer it was the favorite song of his own boyish days and while the little maiden sang it seemed to the crimestained man who gazed through a dim haze into her cherub face that the voice of her dead father had gone into her voice he listened while he could and when the tears welled up to his eyes with his horny hands he drew her fair head down to his heaving breast and sobbed beneath his breath ailee ven ailee ven the little maiden stopped in her song to look up in bewilderment at the bony wet face that was stooping over her at that moment the door of the room opened and the bishop entered noiselessly a moment he stood on the threshold with a look of perplexity then he made a few halting steps and said my eyes are not what they were sir and i see there is no light but the firelight but i presume you are the good father dalby daniel mylrea fell to his knees at the bishops feet i come from him he answered is he not coming himself he can not come he charged me with a message to you you are very welcome my niece will be home presently be seated sir daniel mylrea did not sit but continued to stand before his father with head held down after a moment he spoke again father dalby he said is dead the bishop sunk to his chair whenwhen he died the better part of a month ago the bishop rose to his feet he was in this island but yesterday he bade me tell you that he had fulfilled his pledge to you and come to the island but died by the visitation of god the same night whereon he landed here the bishop put one hand to his forehead sir he said my hearing is also failing me for as you see i am an old man now and besides i have had trouble in my time perhaps sir i did not hear you aright then daniel mylrea told in few words the story of the priests accident and death and how the man at whose house he died had made bold to take the good priests mission upon himself the bishop listened with visible pain and for a while said nothing then speaking in a faltering voice with breath that came quickly he asked who the other man had been for the good man has been a blessing to us he added nervously to this question there was no reply and he asked again who myself the bishop lifted with trembling fingers his hornbridged spectacles to his eyes your voice is strangely familiar he said what is your name again there was no answer give me your name sirthat i may pray of god to bless you still there was no answer let me remember it in my prayers then in a breaking voice daniel mylrea replied in your prayers my poor name has never been forgotten at that the bishop tottered a pace backward light he said faintly more light he touched a bell on the table and sank quietly into his chair daniel mylrea fell to his knees at the bishops feet father he said in a fervent whisper and put his lips to the bishops hand the door was opened and a servant entered with candles at the same moment daniel mylrea stepped quickly out of the room then the little maiden leaped from the floor to the bishops side grandpa grandpa oh what has happened to grandpa she cried the bishops head had dropped into his breast and he had fainted when he opened his eyes in consciousness mona was bathing his forehead and damping his lips my child he said nervously one has come back to us from the dead and mona answered him with the thought that was now uppermost in her mind dear uncle she said my poor father died half an hour ago chapter xlv our father which art in heaven not many days after the events recorded in the foregoing chapter the people of man awoke to the joyful certainty that the sweating sickness had disappeared the solid wave of heat had gone the ground had become dry and the soil light and no fetid vapors floated over the curraghs at midday also the air had grown keener the nights had sharpened and in the morning the fronds of hoarfrost hung on the withering leaves of the trammon then the poor folk began to arrange their thoughts concerning the strange things that had happened to count up their losses by death to talk of children that were fatherless and of old men left alone in the world like naked trunks without bough or branch flung on the bare earth by yesterdays storm and in that first rollcall after the battle of life and death the people suddenly became aware that with the sweating sickness the man who had brought the cure for it had also disappeared he was not on the curraghs he was no longer in michael and further east he had not traveled none could tell what had become of him when seen last he was walking south through german toward patrick he was then alone save for the halfdaft lad davy fayle who slouched at his heels like a dog as he passed up creg willeys hill the people of st johns followed him in ones and twos and threes to offer him their simple thanks but he pushed along as one who hardly heard them when he came by the tynwald he paused and turned partly toward greeba as though half minded to alter his course but hesitating no longer he followed the straight path toward the village at the foot of slieu whallin as he crossed the green the people of st johns who followed him up the hill road had grown to a great number being joined there by the people of tynwald and when he passed under the ancient mount walking with long rapid steps his chin on his breast and his eyes kept steadfastly down the grayheaded men uncovered their heads the young women thrust their young children under his hands for his blessing and all by one impulse shouted in one voice god bless the priest heaven save the priest there were spectators of that scene who were wont to say when this sequel had freshened their memories that amid the wild tumult of the gratitude of the islands poor people he who was the subject of it made one quick glance of pain upward to the mount now standing empty above the green and then parting the crowds that encircled him pushed through them without word or glance or sign seeing at last that he shrunk from their thanks the people followed him no further but remained on the green watching him as he passed on toward slieu whallin and then up by the mountain track when he had reached the top of the path where it begins its descent to the valley beyond he paused again and turned about glancing back the people below saw his full figure clearly outlined against the sky and once more they sent up their shout by one great impulse in one great voice that drowned the distant rumble of the sea god bless the priest heaven save the priest and he heard it for instantly he faced about and disappeared when he was gone it seemed as if a spell had broken the people looked into one anothers faces in bewilderment as if vaguely conscious that somewhere and some time under conditions the same yet different all that they had then seen their eyes had seen before and bit by bit the memory came back to them linked with a name that might not be spoken then many things that had seemed strange became plain in a few days the whisper passed over man from north to south from east to west from the sod cabins on the curragh to the castle at castletown that he who had cured the people of the sickness he who had been mistaken for the priest out of ireland was none other than the unblessed man long thought to be dead and that he had lived to be the savior of his people the great news was brought to bishops court and it was found to be there already rumor said that from castletown an inquiry had come asking if the news were true but none could tell what answer bishops court had made the bishop had shut himself up from all visits even those of his clergy with mona and the child ewans little daughter he had passed the days since thorkells death and not until the day of thorkells funeral did he break in upon his solitude then he went down to the little churchyard that stands over by the sea they buried the exdeemster near to his son ewan and with scarcely a foots space between them except jarvis kerruish the bishop was thorkells sole mourner and hardly had the service ended or the second shovel of earth fallen from old willasthorns spade when jarvis whipped about and walked away then the bishop stood alone by his brothers unhonored grave trying to forget his malice and uncharity and his senseless superstitions that had led to many disasters thinking only with the pity that is nigh to love of the great ruin whereunto his poor beliefs had tottered down and when the bishop had returned home the rollcall of near kindred showed him pitiful gaps the island grows very lonesome mona he said that night davy fayle came to bishops court with a book in his hand he told mona how he had found the benmychree a complete wreck on the shingle of the dhoon creek in the calf sound and the book in its locker not a syllable could davy read but he knew that the book was the fishinglog of the lugger and that since he saw it last it had been filled with writings mona took the book into the library and with the bishop she examined it it was a small quarto bound in sheepskin with corners and back of untanned leather longways on the back the words benmychree fishinglog were lettered as with a soft quill in a bold hand on the front page there was this inscription benmychree owner daniel mylrea bishops court isle of man master illiam quilleash over page was the word accounts and then followed the various items of the earnings and expenditure of the boat the handwriting was strong and free but the bookkeeping was not lucid eight pages of faintlytinted paper much frayed and with lines ruled by hand one way of the sheet only were filled with the accounts of the herring season of at the bottom there was an attempt at picking out the items of profit and loss and at reckoning the shares of owner master and man the balance stood but too sadly on the wrong side there was a deficit of forty pounds four shillings and sixpence the bishop glanced at the entries and passed them over with a sigh but turning the leaves he came upon other matter of more pathetic interest this was a long personal narrative from the owners pen covering some two hundred of the pages the bishop looked it through hurriedly nervously and with eager eyes then he gave up the book to mona read it aloud child he said in a voice unlike his own and with a brave show of composure he settled himself to listen for two hours thereafter mona read from the narrative that was written in the book what that narrative was does not need to be told often the voice of the reader failed her sometimes it could not support itself and in the lapses of her voice the silence was broken by her low sobs the bishop listened long with a great outer calmness for the affections of the father were struggling with a sense of the duty of the servant of god at some points of the narrative these seemed so to conflict as to tear his old heart wofully but he bore up very bravely and tried to think that in what he had done seven years before he had done well at an early stage of monas reading he stopped her to say men have been cast on desert islands beforetime and too often they have been adrift on unknown seas again he stopped her to add with a slow shake of the head men have been outlawed and dragged out weary years in exilemen have been oftentimes under the ban and chain of the law and once again he interrupted and said in a trembling undertone it is trueit has been what i looked forit has been a death in life but as mona went on to read of how the outcast man kept back from speech with every living soul struggled to preserve the spiritual part of him the bishop interrupted once more and said in a faltering voice this existence has been quite alone in its desolation as mona went on again to read of how the unblessed creature said his prayer in his solitude not hoping that god would hear but thinking himself a man outside gods grace though gods hand was upon himthinking himself a man doomed to everlasting death though the blessing of heaven had already fallen over him like morning dewthen all that remained of spiritual pride in the heart of the bishop was borne down by the love of the father and his old head fell into his breast and the hot tears rained down his wrinkled cheeks later the same night mona sent for davy fayle the lad was easily found he had been waiting in the darkness outside the house struggling hard with a desire to go in and tell mistress mona where daniel mylrea was to be found davy she said do you know where he is sure said davy and you could lead me to him i could then come here very early in the morning and we will go together next day when mona attired for her journey went down for a hasty breakfast she found the bishop fumbling a letter in his trembling fingers read this child he said in a thick voice and he handed the letter to her she turned it over nervously the superscription ran these to the lord bishop of man at his palace of bishops court and the seal on the other face was that of the insular government while the bishop made pretense of wiping with his handkerchief the hornbridged spectacles on his nose mona opened and read the letter it was from the governor at castletown and said that the lord of man and the isles in recognition of the great services done by daniel mylrea to the people of the island during their recent affliction would be anxious to appoint him deemster of man in succession to his late uncle thorkell mylrea being satisfied that he was otherwise qualified for the post if the steward of the ecclesiastical courts were willing to remove the censure of the church under which he now labored when she had finished reading mona cast one glance of nervous supplication upward to the bishops face and then with a quick cry of joy which was partly pain she flung her arms about his neck the old bishop was quite broken down mans judgments on man he said are but as the anger of little childrenhere today gone tomorrow and the fathers face is over all what need to tell of one of the incidents of monas journey or of the brave hopes that buoyed her up on the long and toilsome way many a time during these seven years past she had remembered that it was she who had persuaded dan to offer his life as an atonement for his sin and often the thought came back to her with the swiftness of remorse that it was she who in her blindness had sent him to a doom that was worse than death but heavens ways had not been her ways and all was well the atonement had been made and the sin had been wiped out of the book of life dan her love her beloved had worked out his redemption he had proved himself the great man she had always known he must be he was to come back loaded with honor and gratitude and surrounded by multitudes of friends more than once when the journey was heaviest she put her hand to her bosom and touched the paper that nestled so warmly there then in her minds eye she saw dan in the seat of the deemster the righteous judge of his own people oh yes he would be the deemster but he would be dan still her dan the lively cheerful joyous perhaps even frolicsome dan once more he would sport with her like ailee he would play with her as he used to play long ago with another little girl that she herself could remembertickling her under her armpits and under her chin and in twenty different cozy nests of her pretty body where whole broods of birdies sent up a chorus of squealing songlaughter the burden of monas long years of weary sorrow had been so suddenly lifted away that she could not restrain her thoughts from childish sportiveness but sometimes she remembered ewan and then her heart saddened and sometimes she thought of herself and then it flushed full of quick hot blood and oh how delicious was the secret thing that sometimes stole up between her visions of dan and the high destiny that was before him it was a vision of herself transfigured by his noble love resting upon and looking up to him and thus passing on and on and on to the end once she remembered with a chill passing through her that in the writing which she had read dan had said he was ill but what of that she was going to him and would nurse him back to health and davy fayle walking at her side was full of his own big notions too mastha dan would be dempster true but hed have a boat for his pleasure sarten sure davy fayle would sail man in her perhaps mate and maybe skipper some daywho knows and thenlying aft and drifting at the herrings and smokin and the stars out and the moon makin a peepaw well well well they reached the end of their journey at last it was in a small gorsecovered house far over the wild moor on the edge of the chasms looking straight out on the hungry sea in its one bare room which was without fire and was cheerless with little light there was a table a settle a chair a stool and a sort of trucklebed dan was there the same yet oh how different he lay on the bed unconscious near to death of the sicknessthe last that the scourge was to slay of this story of great love and great suffering what is left to tell there are moments when life seems like the blind swirl of a bat in the duskblundering irresponsible not to be counted with the swift creature of evil chance we see a little childs white face at a hospital window a strong man toiling hopelessly against wrong the innocent suffering with the guilty good instincts thwarted and base purposes promoted and we ask ourselves with a thrill of the heart what after all is god doing in this his world and from such blind laboring of chance the tired and beaten generations of men seem to find it reward enough to drop one after one to the hushed realms of rest shall we marvel very much if such a moment came to this pure and noble woman as she stood in the deathchamber of her beloved with whom after years of longing she was at last brought face to face but again there are other moments higher and better when there is such a thing in this so bewildering world as the victory of vanquishment when the true man crushed by evil chance is yet the true man undestroyed by it and destroying it when job on his dunghill is more to be envied than pharaoh on his throne and death is as good as life and such a higher moment came to mona in that deathchamber she sat many hours by dans side waiting for the breaking of his delirium and the brief space of consciousness and of peace which would be the beginning of the end it came at long long length and ah how soon it came the night had come and gone while she sat and watched when the sunrise shot red through the skincovered window it fell on dan and awakened him opening his eyes he saw mona and his soul smiled over his wasted face he could not speak nor could he lift his worn hands she knew that the time was near and holding back her grief like wild creatures held by the leash she dropped to her knees and clasped her hands together to pray and while she prayed the dying man repeated some of the words after her our father ourfather which art in heaven hallowed be thy name hallowedbethyname thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil but deliver us from evil amen amen

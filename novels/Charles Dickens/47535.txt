who stole a sexton illustration in an old abbey town down in this part of the country a long long while ago so long that the story must be a true one because our great grandfathers implicitly believed it there officiated as sexton and grave digger in the churchyard one gabriel grub it by no means follows that because a man is a sexton and constantly surrounded by the emblems of mortality therefore he should be a morose and melancholy man your undertakers are the merriest fellows in the world and i once had the honour of being on intimate terms with a mute who in private life and off duty was as comical and jocose a little fellow as ever chirped out a devil may care song without a hitch in his memory or drained off the contents of a good stiff glass without stopping for breath but notwithstanding these precedents to the contrary gabriel grub was an ill conditioned cross grained surly fellow a morose and lonely man who consorted with nobody but himself and an old wicker bottle which fitted into his large deep waistcoat pocket and who eyed each merry face as it passed him by with such a deep scowl of malice and ill humour as it was difficult to meet without feeling something the worse for a little before twilight one christmas eve gabriel shouldered his spade lighted his lantern and betook himself towards the old churchyard for he had got a grave to finish by next morning and feeling very low he thought it might raise his spirits perhaps if he went on with his work at once as he went his way up the ancient street he saw the cheerful light of blazing fires gleam through the old casements and heard the loud laugh and the cheerful shouts of those who were assembled around them he marked the bustling preparations for next day's cheer and smelt the numerous savoury odours consequent thereupon as they steamed up from the kitchen windows in clouds all this was gall and wormwood to the heart of gabriel grub and when groups of children bounded out of the houses tripped across the road and were met before they could knock at the opposite door by half a dozen curly headed little rascals who crowded round them as they flocked up stairs to spend the evening in their christmas games gabriel smiled grimly and clutched the handle of his spade with a firmer grasp as he thought of measles scarlet fever thrush hooping cough and a good many other sources of consolation besides in this happy frame of mind gabriel strode along returning a short sullen growl to the good humoured greetings of such of his neighbours as now and then passed him until he turned into the dark lane which led to the churchyard now gabriel had been looking forward to reaching the dark lane because it was generally speaking a nice gloomy mournful place into which the townspeople did not much care to go except in broad daylight and when the sun was shining consequently he was not a little indignant to hear a young urchin roaring out some jolly song about a merry christmas in this very sanctuary which had been called coffin lane ever since the days of the old abbey and the time of the shaven headed monks as gabriel walked on and the voice drew nearer he found it proceeded from a small boy who was hurrying along to join one of the little parties in the old street and who partly to keep himself company and partly to prepare himself for the occasion was shouting out the song at the highest pitch of his lungs so gabriel waited until the boy came up and then dodged him into a corner and rapped him over the head with his lantern five or six times to teach him to modulate his voice and as the boy hurried away with his hand to his head singing quite a different sort of tune gabriel grub chuckled very heartily to himself and entered the churchyard locking the gate behind him he took off his coat put down his lantern and getting into the unfinished grave worked at it for an hour or so with right good will but the earth was hardened with the frost and it was no very easy matter to break it up and shovel it out and although there was a moon it was a very young one and shed little light upon the grave which was in the shadow of the church at any other time these obstacles would have made gabriel grub very moody and miserable but he was so well pleased with having stopped the small boy's singing that he took little heed of the scanty progress he had made and looked down into the grave when he had finished work for the night with grim satisfaction murmuring as he gathered up his things 'brave lodgings for one brave lodgings for one a few feet of cold earth when life is done a stone at the head a stone at the feet a rich juicy meal for the worms to eat rank grass over head and damp clay around brave lodgings for one these in holy ground' 'ho ho' laughed gabriel grub as he sat himself down on a flat tombstone which was a favourite resting place of his and drew forth his wicker bottle 'a coffin at christmas a christmas box ho ho ho' 'ho ho ho' repeated a voice which sounded close behind him gabriel paused in some alarm in the act of raising the wicker bottle to his lips and looked round the bottom of the oldest grave about him was not more still and quiet than the churchyard in the pale moonlight the cold hoar frost glistened on the tombstones and sparkled like rows of gems among the stone carvings of the old church the snow lay hard and crisp upon the ground and spread over the thickly strewn mounds of earth so white and smooth a cover that it seemed as if corpses lay there hidden only by their winding sheets not the faintest rustle broke the profound tranquillity of the solemn scene sound itself appeared to be frozen up all was so cold and still 'it was the echoes' said gabriel grub raising the bottle to his lips again 'it was not' said a deep voice gabriel started up and stood rooted to the spot with astonishment and terror for his eyes rested on a form that made his blood run cold seated on an upright tombstone close to him was a strange unearthly figure whom gabriel felt at once was no being of this world his long fantastic legs which might have reached the ground were cocked up and crossed after a quaint fantastic fashion his sinewy arms were bare and his hands rested on his knees on his short round body he wore a close covering ornamented with small slashes a short cloak dangled at his back the collar was cut into curious peaks which served the goblin in lieu of ruff or neckerchief and his shoes curled up at his toes into long points on his head he wore a broad brimmed sugar loaf hat garnished with a single feather the hat was covered with the white frost and the goblin looked as if he had sat on the same tombstone very comfortably for two or three hundred years he was sitting perfectly still his tongue was put out as if in derision and he was grinning at gabriel grub with such a grin as only a goblin could call up 'it was not the echoes' said the goblin gabriel grub was paralysed and could make no reply 'what do you do here on christmas eve' said the goblin sternly 'i came to dig a grave sir' stammered gabriel grub 'what man wanders among graves and churchyards on such a night as this' cried the goblin 'gabriel grub gabriel grub' screamed a wild chorus of voices that seemed to fill the churchyard gabriel looked fearfully round nothing was to be seen 'what have you got in that bottle' said the goblin 'hollands sir' replied the sexton trembling more than ever for he had bought it of the smugglers and he thought that perhaps his questioner might be in the excise department of the goblins 'who drinks hollands alone and in the churchyard on such a night as this' said the goblin 'gabriel grub gabriel grub' exclaimed the wild voices again the goblin leered maliciously at the terrified sexton and then raising his voice exclaimed 'and who then is our fair and lawful prize' to this inquiry the invisible chorus replied in a strain that sounded like the voices of many choristers singing to the mighty swell of the old church organ a strain that seemed borne to the sexton's ears upon a wild wind and to die away as it passed onward but the burden of the reply was still the same 'gabriel grub gabriel grub' the goblin grinned a broader grin than before as he said 'well gabriel what do you say to this' the sexton gasped for breath 'what do you think of this gabriel' said the goblin kicking up his feet in the air on either side of the tombstone and looking at the turned up points with as much complacency as if he had been contemplating the most fashionable pair of wellingtons in all bond street 'it's it's very curious sir' replied the sexton half dead with fright 'very curious and very pretty but i think i'll go back and finish my work sir if you please' 'work' said the goblin 'what work' 'the grave sir making the grave' stammered the sexton 'oh the grave eh' said the goblin 'who makes graves at a time when all other men are merry and takes a pleasure in it' again the mysterious voices replied 'gabriel grub gabriel grub' 'i'm afraid my friends want you gabriel' said the goblin thrusting his tongue further into his cheek than ever and a most astonishing tongue it was 'i'm afraid my friends want you gabriel' said the goblin 'under favour sir' replied the horror stricken sexton 'i don't think they can sir they don't know me sir i don't think the gentlemen have ever seen me sir' 'oh yes they have' replied the goblin 'we know the man with the sulky face and grim scowl that came down the street to night throwing his evil looks at the children and grasping his burying spade the tighter we know the man who struck the boy in the envious malice of his heart because the boy could be merry and he could not we know him we know him' here the goblin gave a loud shrill laugh which the echoes returned twenty fold and throwing his legs up in the air stood upon his head or rather upon the very point of his sugar loaf hat on the narrow edge of the tombstone whence he threw a somerset with extraordinary agility right to the sexton's feet at which he planted himself in the attitude in which tailors generally sit upon the shop board 'i i am afraid i must leave you sir' said the sexton making an effort to move 'leave us' said the goblin 'gabriel grub going to leave us ho ho ho' as the goblin laughed the sexton observed for one instant a brilliant illumination within the windows of the church as if the whole building were lighted up it disappeared the organ pealed forth a lively air and whole troops of goblins the very counterpart of the first one poured into the churchyard and began playing at leap frog with the tombstones never stopping for an instant to take breath but 'overing' the highest among them one after the other with the utmost marvellous dexterity the first goblin was a most astonishing leaper and none of the others could come near him even in the extremity of his terror the sexton could not help observing that while his friends were content to leap over the common sized gravestones the first one took the family vaults iron railings and all with as much ease as if they had been so many street posts at last the game reached to a most exciting pitch the organ played quicker and quicker and the goblins leaped faster and faster coiling themselves up rolling head over heels upon the ground and bounding over the tombstones like footballs the sexton's brain whirled round with the rapidity of the motion he beheld and his legs reeled beneath him as the spirits flew before his eyes when the goblin king suddenly darting towards him laid his hand upon his collar and sank with him through the earth when gabriel grub had had time to fetch his breath which the rapidity of his descent had for the moment taken away he found himself in what appeared to be a huge cavern surrounded on all sides by crowds of goblins ugly and grim in the centre of the room on an elevated seat was stationed his friend of the churchyard and close beside him stood gabriel grub himself without power of motion 'cold to night' said the king of the goblins 'very cold a glass of something warm here' at this command half a dozen officious goblins with a perpetual smile upon their faces whom gabriel grub imagined to be courtiers on that account hastily disappeared and presently returned with a goblet of liquid fire which they presented to the king 'ah' cried the goblin whose cheeks and throat were transparent as he tossed down the flame 'this warms one indeed bring a bumper of the same for mr grub' it was in vain for the unfortunate sexton to protest that he was not in the habit of taking anything warm at night one of the goblins held him while another poured the blazing liquid down his throat the whole assembly screeched with laughter as he coughed and choked and wiped away the tears which gushed plentifully from his eyes after swallowing the burning draught 'and now' said the king fantastically poking the taper corner of his sugar loaf hat into the sexton's eye and thereby occasioning him the most exquisite pain 'and now show the man of misery and gloom a few of the pictures from our own great storehouse' as the goblin said this a thick cloud which obscured the remoter end of the cavern rolled gradually away and disclosed apparently at a great distance a small and scantily furnished but neat and clean apartment a crowd of little children were gathered round a bright fire clinging to their mother's gown and gambolling around her chair the mother occasionally rose and drew aside the window curtain as if to look for some expected object a frugal meal was ready spread upon the table and an elbow chair was placed near the fire a knock was heard at the door the mother opened it and the children crowded round her and clapped their hands for joy as their father entered he was wet and weary and shook the snow from his garments as the children crowded round him and seizing his cloak hat stick and gloves with busy zeal ran with them from the room then as he sat down to his meal before the fire the children climbed about his knee and the mother sat by his side and all seemed happiness and comfort but a change came upon the view almost imperceptibly the scene was altered to a small bed room where the fairest and youngest child lay dying the roses had fled from his cheek and the light from his eye and even as the sexton looked upon him with an interest he had never felt or known before he died his young brothers and sisters crowded round his little bed and seized his tiny hand so cold and heavy but they shrunk back from its touch and looked with awe on his infant face for calm and tranquil as it was and sleeping in rest and peace as the beautiful child seemed to be they saw that he was dead and they knew that he was an angel looking down upon and blessing them from a bright and happy heaven again the light cloud passed across the picture and again the subject changed the father and mother were old and helpless now and the number of those about them was diminished more than half but content and cheerfulness sat on every face and beamed in every eye as they crowded round the fireside and told and listened to old stories of earlier and bygone days slowly and peacefully the father sank into the grave and soon after the sharer of all his cares and troubles followed him to a place of rest the few who yet survived them knelt by their tomb and watered the green turf which covered it with their tears then rose and turned away sadly and mournfully but not with bitter cries or despairing lamentations for they knew that they should one day meet again and once more they mixed with the busy world and their content and cheerfulness were restored the cloud settled upon the picture and concealed it from the sexton's view 'what do you think of that' said the goblin turning his large face towards gabriel grub gabriel murmured out something about its being very pretty and looked somewhat ashamed as the goblin bent his fiery eyes upon him 'you a miserable man' said the goblin in a tone of excessive contempt 'you' he appeared disposed to add more but indignation choked his utterance so he lifted up one of his very pliable legs and flourishing it above his head a little to insure his aim administered a good sound kick to gabriel grub immediately after which all the goblins in waiting crowded round the wretched sexton and kicked him without mercy according to the established and invariable custom of courtiers upon earth who kick whom royalty kicks and hug whom royalty hugs 'show him some more' said the king of the goblins at these words the cloud was dispelled and a rich and beautiful landscape was disclosed to view there is just such another to this day within half a mile of the old abbey town the sun shone from out the clear blue sky the water sparkled beneath his rays and the trees looked greener and the flowers more gay beneath his cheering influence the water rippled on with a pleasant sound the trees rustled in the light wind that murmured among their leaves the birds sang upon the boughs and the lark carolled on high her welcome to the morning yes it was morning the bright balmy morning of summer the minutest leaf the smallest blade of grass was instinct with life the ant crept forth to her daily toil the butterfly fluttered and basked in the warm rays of the sun myriads of insects spread their transparent wings and revelled in their brief but happy existence man walked forth elated with the scene and all was brightness and splendour 'you a miserable man' said the king of the goblins in a more contemptuous tone than before and again the king of the goblins gave his leg a flourish again it descended on the shoulders of the sexton and again the attendant goblins imitated the example of their chief many a time the cloud went and came and many a lesson it taught to gabriel grub who although his shoulders smarted with pain from the frequent applications of the goblins' feet looked on with an interest that nothing could diminish he saw that men who worked hard and earned their scanty bread with lives of labour were cheerful and happy and that to the most ignorant the sweet face of nature was a never failing source of cheerfulness and joy he saw those who had been delicately nurtured and tenderly brought up cheerful under privations and superior to suffering that would have crushed many of a rougher grain because they bore within their own bosoms the materials of happiness contentment and peace he saw that women the tenderest and most fragile of all god's creatures were the oftenest superior to sorrow adversity and distress and he saw that it was because they bore in their own hearts an inexhaustible well spring of affection and devotion above all he saw that men like himself who snarled at the mirth and cheerfulness of others were the foulest weeds on the fair face of the earth and setting all the good of the world against the evil he came to the conclusion that it was a very decent and respectable sort of world after all no sooner had he formed it than the cloud which closed over the last picture seemed to settle on his senses and lull him to repose one by one the goblins faded from his sight and as the last one disappeared he sunk to sleep the day had broken when gabriel grub awoke and found himself lying at full length on the flat grave stone in the churchyard with the wicker bottle lying empty by his side and his coat spade and lantern all well whitened by the last night's frost scattered on the ground the stone on which he had first seen the goblin seated stood bolt upright before him and the grave at which he had worked the night before was not far off at first he began to doubt the reality of his adventures but the acute pain in his shoulders when he attempted to rise assured him that the kicking of the goblins was certainly not ideal he was staggered again by observing no traces of footsteps in the snow on which the goblins had played at leap frog with the grave stones but he speedily accounted for this circumstance when he remembered that being spirits they would leave no visible impression behind them so gabriel grub got on his feet as well as he could for the pain in his back and brushing the frost off his coat put it on and turned his face towards the town but he was an altered man and he could not bear the thought of returning to a place where his repentance would be scoffed at and his reformation disbelieved he hesitated for a few moments and then turned away to wander where he might and seek his bread elsewhere the lantern the spade and the wicker bottle were found that day in the churchyard there were a great many speculations about the sexton's fate at first but it was speedily determined that he had been carried away by the goblins and there were not wanting some very credible witnesses who had distinctly seen him whisked through the air on the back of a chestnut horse blind of one eye with the hind quarters of a lion and the tail of a bear at length all this was devoutly believed and the new sexton used to exhibit to the curious for a trifling emolument a good sized piece of the church weathercock which had been accidentally kicked off by the aforesaid horse in his arial flight and picked up by himself in the churchyard a year or two afterwards unfortunately these stories were somewhat disturbed by the unlooked for reappearance of gabriel grub himself some ten years afterwards a ragged contented rheumatic old man he told his story to the clergyman and also to the mayor and in course of time it began to be received as a matter of history in which form it has continued down to this very day the believers in the weathercock tale having misplaced their confidence once were not easily prevailed upon to part with it again so they looked as wise as they could shrugged their shoulders touched their foreheads and murmured something about gabriel grub having drunk all the hollands and then fallen asleep on the flat tombstone and they affected to explain what he supposed he had witnessed in the goblins' cavern by saying that he had seen the world and grown wiser but this opinion which was by no means a popular one at any time gradually died off and be the matter how it may as gabriel grub was afflicted with rheumatism to the end of his days this story has at least one moral if it teach no better one and that is that if a man turn sulky and drink by himself at christmas time he may make up his mind to be not a bit the better for it let the spirits be never so good or let them be even as many degrees beyond proof as those which gabriel grub saw in the goblins' cavern chapter ii illustration how the pickwickians made and cultivated the acquaintance of a couple of nice young men belonging to one of the liberal professions how they disported themselves on the ice and how their first visit came to a conclusion well sam said mr pickwick as that favoured servitor entered his bed chamber with his warm water on the morning of christmas day still frosty water in the wash hand basin's a mask o' ice sir responded sam severe weather sam observed mr pickwick fine time for them as is well wropped up as the polar bear said to himself ven he was practising his skating replied mr weller i shall be down in a quarter of an hour sam said mr pickwick untying his nightcap wery good sir replied sam there's a couple o' sawbones downstairs a couple of what exclaimed mr pickwick sitting up in bed a couple o' sawbones said sam what's a sawbones inquired mr pickwick not quite certain whether it was a live animal or something to eat what don't you know what a sawbones is sir inquired mr weller i thought everybody know'd as a sawbones was a surgeon oh a surgeon eh said mr pickwick with a smile just that sir replied sam these here ones as is below though ain't reg'lar thorough bred sawbones they're only in trainin' in other words they're medical students i suppose said mr pickwick sam weller nodded assent i am glad of it said mr pickwick casting his nightcap energetically on the counterpane they are fine fellows very fine fellows with judgments matured by observation and reflection tastes refined by reading and study i am very glad of it they're a smokin' cigars by the kitchen fire said sam ah observed mr pickwick rubbing his hands overflowing with kindly feelings and animal spirits just what i like to see and one on 'em said sam not noticing his master's interruption one on 'em's got his legs on the table and is a drinkin' brandy neat vile the tother one him in the barnacles has got a barrel o' oysters atween his knees wich he's a openin' like steam and as fast as he eats 'em he takes a aim vith the shells at young dropsy who's a sittin' down fast asleep in the chimbley corner eccentricities of genius sam said mr pickwick you may retire sam did retire accordingly mr pickwick at the expiration of the quarter of an hour went down to breakfast here he is at last said old mr wardle pickwick this is miss allen's brother mr benjamin allen ben we call him and so may you if you like this gentleman is his very particular friend mr mr bob sawyer interposed mr benjamin allen whereupon mr bob sawyer and mr benjamin allen laughed in concert mr pickwick bowed to bob sawyer and bob sawyer bowed to mr pickwick bob and his very particular friend then applied themselves most assiduously to the eatables before them and mr pickwick had an opportunity of glancing at them both mr benjamin allen was a coarse stout thickset young man with black hair cut rather short and a white face cut rather long he was embellished with spectacles and wore a white neckerchief below his single breasted black surtout which was buttoned up to his chin appeared the usual number of pepper and salt coloured legs terminating in a pair of imperfectly polished boots although his coat was short in the sleeves it disclosed no vestige of a linen wristband and although there was quite enough of his face to admit of the encroachment of a shirt collar it was not graced by the smallest approach to that appendage he presented altogether rather a mildewy appearance and emitted a fragrant odour of full flavoured cubas mr bob sawyer who was habited in a coarse blue coat which without being either a great coat or a surtout partook of the nature and qualities of both had about him that sort of slovenly smartness and swaggering gait which is peculiar to young gentlemen who smoke in the streets by day shout and scream in the same by night call waiters by their christian names and do various other acts and deeds of an equally facetious description he wore a pair of plaid trousers and a large rough double breasted waistcoat out of doors he carried a thick stick with a big top he eschewed gloves and looked upon the whole something like a dissipated robinson crusoe such were the two worthies to whom mr pickwick was introduced as he took his seat at the breakfast table on christmas morning splendid morning gentlemen said mr pickwick mr bob sawyer slightly nodded his assent to the proposition and asked mr benjamin allen for the mustard have you come far this morning gentlemen inquired mr pickwick blue lion at muggleton briefly responded mr allen you should have joined us last night said mr pickwick so we should replied bob sawyer but the brandy was too good to leave in a hurry wasn't it ben certainly said mr benjamin allen and the cigars were not bad or the pork chops either were they bob decidedly not said bob the particular friends resumed their attack upon the breakfast more freely than before as if the recollection of last night's supper had imparted a new relish to the meal peg away bob said mr allen to his companion encouragingly so i do replied bob sawyer and so to do him justice he did nothing like dissecting to give one an appetite said mr bob sawyer looking round the table mr pickwick slightly shuddered by the bye bob said mr allen have you finished that leg yet nearly replied sawyer helping himself to half a fowl as he spoke it's a very muscular one for a child's is it inquired mr allen carelessly very said bob sawyer with his mouth full i've put my name down for an arm at our place said mr allen we're clubbing for a subject and the list is nearly full only we can't get hold of any fellow that wants a head i wish you'd take it no replied bob sawyer can't afford expensive luxuries nonsense said allen can't indeed rejoined bob sawyer i wouldn't mind a brain but i couldn't stand a whole head hush hush gentlemen pray said mr pickwick i hear the ladies as mr pickwick spoke the ladies gallantly escorted by messrs snodgrass winkle and tupman returned from an early walk why ben said arabella in a tone which expressed more surprise than pleasure at the sight of her brother come to take you home to morrow replied benjamin mr winkle turned pale don't you see bob sawyer arabella inquired mr benjamin allen somewhat reproachfully arabella gracefully held out her hand in acknowledgment of bob sawyer's presence a thrill of hatred struck to mr winkle's heart as bob sawyer inflicted on the proffered hand a perceptible squeeze ben dear said arabella blushing have have you been introduced to mr winkle i have not been but i shall be very happy to be arabella replied her brother gravely here mr allen bowed grimly to mr winkle while mr winkle and mr bob sawyer glanced mutual distrust out of the corners of their eyes the arrival of the two new visitors and the consequent check upon mr winkle and the young lady with the fur round her boots would in all probability have proved a very unpleasant interruption to the hilarity of the party had not the cheerfulness of mr pickwick and the good humour of the host been exerted to the very utmost for the common weal mr winkle gradually insinuated himself into the good graces of mr benjamin allen and even joined in a friendly conversation with mr bob sawyer who enlivened with the brandy and the breakfast and the talking gradually ripened into a state of extreme facetiousness and related with much glee an agreeable anecdote about the removal of a tumour on some gentleman's head which he illustrated by means of an oyster knife and a half quartern loaf to the great edification of the assembled company then the whole train went to church where mr benjamin allen fell fast asleep while mr bob sawyer abstracted his thoughts from worldly matters by the ingenious process of carving his name on the seat of the pew in corpulent letters of four inches long now said wardle after a substantial lunch with the agreeable items of strong beer and cherry brandy had been done ample justice to what say you to an hour on the ice we shall have plenty of time capital said mr benjamin allen prime ejaculated mr bob sawyer you skate of course winkle said wardle ye yes oh yes replied mr winkle i i am rather out of practice oh do skate mr winkle said arabella i like to see it so much oh it is so graceful said another young lady a third young lady said it was elegant and a fourth expressed her opinion that it was swan like i should be very happy i'm sure said mr winkle reddening but i have no skates this objection was at once overruled trundle had a couple of pair and the fat boy announced that there were half a dozen more down stairs whereat mr winkle expressed exquisite delight and looked exquisitely uncomfortable old wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice and the fat boy and mr weller having shovelled and swept away the snow which had fallen on it during the night mr bob sawyer adjusted his skates with a dexterity which to mr winkle was perfectly marvellous and described circles with his left leg and cut figures of eight and inscribed upon the ice without once stopping for breath a great many other pleasant and astonishing devices to the excessive satisfaction of mr pickwick mr tupman and the ladies which reached a pitch of positive enthusiasm when old wardle and benjamin allen assisted by the aforesaid bob sawyer performed some mystic evolutions which they called a reel all this time mr winkle with his face and hands blue with the cold had been forcing a gimlet into the soles of his feet and putting his skates on with the points behind and getting the straps into a very complicated and entangled state with the assistance of mr snodgrass who knew rather less about skates than a hindoo at length however with the assistance of mr weller the unfortunate skates were firmly screwed and buckled on and mr winkle was raised to his feet now then sir said sam in an encouraging tone off vith you and show 'em how to do it stop sam stop said mr winkle trembling violently and clutching hold of sam's arms with the grasp of a drowning man how slippery it is sam not an uncommon thing upon ice sir replied mr weller hold up sir this last observation of mr weller's bore reference to a demonstration mr winkle made at the instant of a frantic desire to throw his feet in the air and dash the back of his head on the ice these these are very awkward skates ain't they sam inquired mr winkle staggering illustration now then sir said sam off vith you and show 'em how to do it i'm afeerd there's a orkard gen'l'm'n in 'em sir replied sam now winkle cried mr pickwick quite unconscious that there was anything the matter come the ladies are all anxiety yes yes replied mr winkle with a ghastly smile i'm coming just a goin' to begin said sam endeavouring to disengage himself now sir start off stop an instant sam gasped mr winkle clinging most affectionately to mr weller i find i've got a couple of coats at home i don't want sam you may have them sam thank'ee sir replied mr weller never mind touching your hat sam said mr winkle hastily you needn't take your hand away to do that i meant to have given you five shillings this morning for a christmas box sam i'll give it you this afternoon sam you're wery good sir replied mr weller just hold me at first sam will you said mr winkle there that's right i shall soon get in the way of it sam not too fast sam not too fast mr winkle stooping forward with his body half doubled up was being assisted over the ice by mr weller in a most singular and un swan like manner when mr pickwick most innocently shouted from the opposite bank sam sir here i want you let go sir said sam don't you hear the governor a callin' let go sir with a violent effort mr weller disengaged himself from the grasp of the agonised pickwickian and in so doing administered a considerable impetus to the unhappy mr winkle with an accuracy which no degree of dexterity or practice could have insured that unfortunate gentleman bore swiftly down into the centre of the reel at the very moment when mr bob sawyer was performing a flourish of unparalleled beauty mr winkle struck wildly against him and with a loud crash they both fell heavily down mr pickwick ran to the spot bob sawyer had risen to his feet but mr winkle was far too wise to do anything of the kind in skates he was seated on the ice making spasmodic efforts to smile but anguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance are you hurt inquired mr benjamin allen with great anxiety not much said mr winkle rubbing his back very hard i wish you'd let me bleed you said mr benjamin with great eagerness no thank you replied mr winkle hurriedly i really think you had better said allen thank you replied mr winkle i'd rather not what do you think mr pickwick inquired bob sawyer mr pickwick was excited and indignant he beckoned to mr weller and said in a stern voice take his skates off no but really i had scarcely begun remonstrated mr winkle take his skates off repeated mr pickwick firmly the command was not to be resisted mr winkle allowed sam to obey it in silence lift him up said mr pickwick sam assisted him to rise mr pickwick retired a few paces apart from the bystanders and beckoning his friend to approach fixed a searching look upon him and uttered in a low but distinct and emphatic tone these remarkable words you're a humbug sir a what said mr winkle starting a humbug sir i will speak plainer if you wish it an impostor sir with these words mr pickwick turned slowly on his heel and rejoined his friends while mr pickwick was delivering himself of the sentiment just recorded mr weller and the fat boy having by their joint endeavours cut out a slide were exercising themselves thereupon in a very masterly and brilliant manner sam weller in particular was displaying that beautiful feat of fancy sliding which is currently denominated knocking at the cobbler's door and which is achieved by skimming over the ice on one foot and occasionally giving a postman's knock upon it with the other it was a good long slide and there was something in the motion which mr pickwick who was very cold with standing still could not help envying it looks a nice warm exercise that doesn't it he inquired of wardle when that gentleman was thoroughly out of breath by reason of the indefatigable manner in which he had converted his legs into a pair of compasses and drawn complicated problems on the ice ah it does indeed replied wardle do you slide i used to do so on the gutters when i was a boy replied mr pickwick illustration went slowly and gravely down the slide try it now said wardle oh do please mr pickwick cried all the ladies i should be very happy to afford you any amusement replied mr pickwick but i haven't done such a thing these thirty years pooh pooh nonsense said wardle dragging off his skates with the impetuosity which characterised all his proceedings here i'll keep you company come along and away went the good tempered old fellow down the slide with a rapidity which came very close upon mr weller and beat the fat boy all to nothing mr pickwick paused considered pulled off his gloves and put them in his hat took two or three short runs baulked himself as often and at last took another run and went slowly and gravely down the slide with his feet about a yard and a quarter apart amidst the gratified shouts of all the spectators keep the pot a bilin' sir said sam and down went wardle again and then mr pickwick and then sam and then mr winkle and then mr bob sawyer and then the fat boy and then mr snodgrass following closely upon each other's heels and running after each other with as much eagerness as if all their future prospects in life depended on their expedition it was the most intensely interesting thing to observe the manner in which mr pickwick performed his share in the ceremony to watch the torture of anxiety with which he viewed the person behind gaining upon him at the imminent hazard of tripping him up to see him gradually expend the painful force he had put on at first and turn slowly round on the slide with his face towards the point from which he had started to contemplate the playful smile which mantled on his face when he had accomplished the distance and the eagerness with which he turned round when he had done so and ran after his predecessor his black gaiters tripping pleasantly through the snow and his eyes beaming cheerfulness and gladness through his spectacles and when he was knocked down which happened upon the average every third round it was the most invigorating sight that can possibly be imagined to behold him gather up his hat gloves and handkerchief with a glowing countenance and resume his station in the rank with an ardour and enthusiasm that nothing could abate the sport was at its height the sliding was at the quickest the laughter was at the loudest when a sharp smart crack was heard there was a quick rush towards the bank a wild scream from the ladies and a shout from mr tupman a large mass of ice disappeared the water bubbled up over it mr pickwick's hat gloves and handkerchief were floating on the surface and this was all of mr pickwick that anybody could see dismay and anguish were depicted on every countenance the males turned pale and the females fainted mr snodgrass and mr winkle grasped each other by the hand and gazed at the spot where their leader had gone down with frenzied eagerness while mr tupman by way of rendering the promptest assistance and at the same time conveying to any persons who might be within hearing the clearest possible notion of the catastrophe ran off across the country at his utmost speed screaming fire with all his might it was at this moment when old wardle and sam weller were approaching the hole with cautious steps and mr benjamin allen was holding a hurried consultation with bob sawyer on the advisability of bleeding the company generally as an improving little bit of professional practice it was at this very moment that a face head and shoulders emerged from beneath the water and disclosed the features and spectacles of mr pickwick illustration a face head and shoulders emerged from beneath the water and disclosed the features and spectacles of mr pickwick keep yourself up for an instant for only one instant bawled mr snodgrass yes do let me implore you for my sake roared mr winkle deeply affected the adjuration was rather unnecessary the probability being that if mr pickwick had declined to keep himself up for anybody else's sake it would have occurred to him that he might as well do so for his own do you feel the bottom there old fellow said wardle yes certainly replied mr pickwick wringing the water from his head and face and gasping for breath i fell upon my back i couldn't get on my feet at first the clay upon so much of mr pickwick's coat as was yet visible bore testimony to the accuracy of this statement and as the fears of the spectators were still further relieved by the fat boy's suddenly recollecting that the water was nowhere more than five feet deep prodigies of valour were performed to get him out after a vast quantity of splashing and cracking and struggling mr pickwick was at length fairly extricated from his unpleasant position and once more stood on dry land oh he'll catch his death of cold said emily dear old thing said arabella let me wrap this shawl round you mr pickwick ah that's the best thing you can do said wardle and when you've got it on run home as fast as your legs can carry you and jump into bed directly a dozen shawls were offered on the instant three or four of the thickest having been selected mr pickwick was wrapped up and started off under the guidance of mr weller presenting the singular phenomenon of an elderly gentleman dripping wet and without a hat with his arms bound down to his sides skimming over the ground without any clearly defined purpose at the rate of six good english miles an hour but mr pickwick cared not for appearances in such an extreme case and urged on by sam weller he kept at the very top of his speed until he reached the door of manor farm where mr tupman had arrived some five minutes before and had frightened the old lady into palpitations of the heart by impressing her with the unalterable conviction that the kitchen chimney was on fire a calamity which always presented itself in glowing colours to the old lady's mind when anybody about her evinced the smallest agitation mr pickwick paused not an instant until he was snug in bed sam weller lighted a blazing fire in the room and took up his dinner a bowl of punch was carried up afterwards and a grand carouse held in honour of his safety old wardle would not hear of his rising so they made the bed the chair and mr pickwick presided a second and a third bowl were ordered in and when mr pickwick awoke next morning there was not a symptom of rheumatism about him which proves as mr bob sawyer very justly observed that there is nothing like hot punch in such cases and that if ever hot punch did fail to act as a preventive it was merely because the patient fell into the vulgar error of not taking enough of it the jovial party broke up next morning breakings up are capital things in our school days but in after life they are painful enough death self interest and fortune's changes are every day breaking up many a happy group and scattering them far and wide and the boys and girls never come back again we do not mean to say that it was exactly the case in this particular instance all we wish to inform the reader is that the different members of the party dispersed to their several homes that mr pickwick and his friends once more took their seats on the top of the muggleton coach and that arabella allen repaired to her place of destination wherever it might have been we dare say mr winkle knew but we confess we don't under the care and guardianship of her brother benjamin and his most intimate friend mr bob sawyer before they separated however that gentleman and mr benjamin allen drew mr pickwick aside with an air of some mystery and mr bob sawyer thrusting his forefinger between two of mr pickwick's ribs and thereby displaying his native drollery and his knowledge of the anatomy of the human frame at one and the same time inquired i say old boy where do you hang out mr pickwick replied that he was at present suspended at the george and vulture i wish you'd come and see me said bob sawyer nothing would give me greater pleasure replied mr pickwick there's my lodgings said mr bob sawyer producing a card lant street borough it's near guy's and handy for me you know little distance after you've passed st george's church turns out of the high street on the right hand side the way i shall find it said mr pickwick come on thursday fortnight and bring the other chaps with you said mr bob sawyer i'm going to have a few medical fellows that night mr pickwick expressed the pleasure it would afford him to meet the medical fellows and after mr bob sawyer had informed him that he meant to be very cosy and that his friend ben was to be one of the party they shook hands and separated we feel that in this place we lay ourselves open to inquiry whether mr winkle was whispering during this brief conversation to arabella allen and if so what he said and furthermore whether mr snodgrass was conversing apart with emily wardle and if so what he said to this we reply that whatever they might have said to the ladies they said nothing at all to mr pickwick or mr tupman for eight and twenty miles and that they sighed very often refused ale and brandy and looked gloomy if our observant lady readers can deduce any satisfactory inferences from these facts we beg them by all means to do so chapter iii illustration which is all about the law and sundry great authorities learned therein scattered about in various holes and corners of the temple are certain dark and dirty chambers in and out of which all the morning in vacation and half the evening too in term times there may be seen constantly hurrying with bundles of papers under their arms and protruding from their pockets an almost uninterrupted succession of lawyers' clerks there are several grades of lawyers' clerks there is the articled clerk who has paid a premium and is an attorney in perspective who runs a tailor's bill receives invitations to parties knows a family in gower street and another in tavistock square who goes out of town every long vacation to see his father who keeps live horses innumerable and who is in short the very aristocrat of clerks there is the salaried clerk out of door or in door as the case may be who devotes the major part of his thirty shillings a week to his personal pleasure and adornment repairs half price to the adelphi theatre at least three times a week dissipates majestically at the cider cellars afterwards and is a dirty caricature of the fashion which expired six months ago there is the middle aged copying clerk with a large family who is always shabby and often drunk and there are the office lads in their first surtouts who feel a befitting contempt for boys at day schools club as they go home at night for saveloys and porter and think there's nothing like life there are varieties of the genus too numerous to recapitulate but however numerous they may be they are all to be seen at certain regulated business hours hurrying to and from the places we have just mentioned these sequestered nooks are the public offices of the legal profession where writs are issued judgments signed declarations filed and numerous other ingenious machines put in motion for the torture and torment of his majesty's liege subjects and the comfort and emolument of the practitioners of the law they are for the most part low roofed mouldy rooms where innumerable rolls of parchment which have been perspiring in secret for the last century send forth an agreeable odour which is mingled by day with the scent of the dry rot and by night with the various exhalations which arise from damp cloaks festering umbrellas and the coarsest tallow candles about half past seven o'clock in the evening some ten days or a fortnight after mr pickwick and his friends returned to london there hurried into one of these offices an individual in a brown coat and brass buttons whose long hair was scrupulously twisted round the rim of his napless hat and whose soiled drab trousers were so tightly strapped over his blucher boots that his knees threatened every moment to start from their concealment he produced from his coat pocket a long and narrow strip of parchment on which the presiding functionary impressed an illegible black stamp he then drew forth four scraps of paper of similar dimensions each containing a printed copy of the strip of parchment with blanks for a name and having filled up the blanks put all the five documents in his pocket and hurried away the man in the brown coat with the cabalistic documents in his pocket was no other than our old acquaintance mr jackson of the house of dodson and fogg freeman's court cornhill instead of returning to the office from whence he came however he bent his steps direct to sun court and walking straight into the george and vulture demanded to know whether one mr pickwick was within call mr pickwick's servant tom said the barmaid of the george and vulture don't trouble yourself said mr jackson i've come on business if you'll show me mr pickwick's room i'll step up myself what name sir said the waiter jackson replied the clerk the waiter stepped up stairs to announce mr jackson but mr jackson saved him the trouble by following close at his heels and walking into the apartment before he could articulate a syllable mr pickwick had that day invited his three friends to dinner they were all seated round the fire drinking their wine when mr jackson presented himself as above described how de do sir said mr jackson nodding to mr pickwick that gentleman bowed and looked somewhat surprised for the physiognomy of mr jackson dwelt not on his recollection i have called from dodson and fogg's said mr jackson in an explanatory tone mr pickwick roused at the name i refer you to my attorney sir mr perker of gray's inn said he waiter show this gentleman out beg your pardon mr pickwick said jackson deliberately depositing his hat on the floor and drawing from his pocket the strip of parchment but personal service by clerk or agent in these cases you know mr pickwick nothing like caution sir in all legal forms here mr jackson cast his eye on the parchment and resting his hands on the table and looking round with a winning and persuasive smile said now come don't let's have no words about such a little matter as this which of you gentlemen's name's snodgrass at this inquiry mr snodgrass gave such a very undisguised and palpable start that no further reply was needed ah i thought so said mr jackson more affably than before i've got a little something to trouble you with sir me exclaimed mr snodgrass it's only a subpoena in bardell and pickwick on behalf of the plaintiff replied mr jackson singling out one of the slips of paper and producing a shilling from his waistcoat pocket it'll come on in the settens after term fourteenth of febooary we expect we've marked it a special jury cause and it's only ten down the paper that's yours mr snodgrass as jackson said this he presented the parchment before the eyes of mr snodgrass and slipped the paper and the shilling into his hand mr tupman had witnessed this process in silent astonishment when jackson turning sharply upon him said i think i ain't mistaken when i say your name's tupman am i mr tupman looked at mr pickwick but perceiving no encouragement in that gentleman's widely opened eyes to deny his name said yes my name is tupman sir and that other gentleman's mr winkle i think said jackson mr winkle faltered out a reply in the affirmative and both gentlemen were forthwith invested with a slip of paper and a shilling each by the dexterous mr jackson now said jackson i'm afraid you'll think me rather troublesome but i want somebody else if it ain't inconvenient i have samuel weller's name here mr pickwick send my servant here waiter said mr pickwick the waiter retired considerably astonished and mr pickwick motioned jackson to a seat there was a painful pause which was at length broken by the innocent defendant i suppose sir said mr pickwick his indignation rising while he spoke i suppose sir that it is the intention of your employers to seek to criminate me upon the testimony of my own friends mr jackson struck his forefinger several times against the left side of his nose to intimate that he was not there to disclose the secrets of the prison house and playfully rejoined not knowin' can't say for what other reason sir pursued mr pickwick are these subpoenas served upon them if not for this very good plant mr pickwick replied jackson slowly shaking his head but it won't do no harm in trying but there's little to be got out of me here mr jackson smiled once more upon the company and applying his left thumb to the tip of his nose worked a visionary coffee mill with his right hand thereby performing a very graceful piece of pantomime then much in vogue but now unhappily almost obsolete which was familiarly denominated taking a grinder no no mr pickwick said jackson in conclusion perker's people must guess what we've served these subpoenas for if they can't they must wait till the action comes on and then they'll find out mr pickwick bestowed a look of excessive disgust on his unwelcome visitor and would probably have hurled some tremendous anathema at the heads of messrs dodson and fogg had not sam's entrance at the instant interrupted him samuel weller said mr jackson inquiringly vun o' the truest things as you've said for many a long year replied sam in a most composed manner here's a subpoena for you mr weller said jackson what's that in english inquired sam here's the original said jackson declining the required explanation which said sam this replied jackson shaking the parchment oh that's the 'rig'nal is it said sam well i'm wery glad i've seen the 'rig'nal 'cos it's a gratifyin' sort o' thing and eases vun's mind so much and here's the shilling said jackson it's from dodson and fogg's and it's uncommon handsome o' dodson and fogg as knows so little of me to come down vith a present said sam i feel it as a wery high compliment sir it's a wery hon'rable thing to them as they knows how to reward merit werever they meets it besides wich it's affectin' to one's feelin's as mr weller said this he inflicted a little friction on his right eyelid with the sleeve of his coat after the most approved manner of actors when they are in domestic pathetics mr jackson seemed rather puzzled by sam's proceedings but as he had served the subpoenas and had nothing more to say he made a feint of putting on the one glove which he usually carried in his hand for the sake of appearances and returned to the office to report progress mr pickwick slept little that night his memory had received a very disagreeable refresher on the subject of mrs bardell's action he breakfasted betimes next morning and desiring sam to accompany him set forth towards gray's inn square sam said mr pickwick looking round when they got to the end of cheapside sir said sam stepping up to his master which way up newgate street mr pickwick did not turn round immediately but looked vacantly in sam's face for a few seconds and heaved a deep sigh what's the matter sir inquired sam this action sam said mr pickwick is expected to come on on the fourteenth of next month remarkable coincidence that 'ere sir replied sam why remarkable sam inquired mr pickwick walentine's day sir responded sam reg'lar good day for a breach o' promise trial mr weller's smile awakened no gleam of mirth in his master's countenance mr pickwick turned abruptly round and led the way in silence they had walked some distance mr pickwick trotting on before plunged in profound meditation and sam following behind with a countenance expressive of the most enviable and easy defiance of everything and everybody when the latter who was always especially anxious to impart to his master any exclusive information he possessed quickened his pace until he was close at mr pickwick's heels and pointing up at a house they were passing said wery nice pork shop that 'ere sir yes it seems so said mr pickwick celebrated sassage factory said sam is it said mr pickwick is it reiterated sam with some indignation i should rayther think it was why sir bless your innocent eyebrows that's where the mysterious disappearance of a 'spectable tradesman took place four year ago you don't mean to say he was burked sam said mr pickwick looking hastily round no i don't indeed sir replied mr weller i wish i did far worse than that he was the master o' that 'ere shop sir and the inwenter o' the patent never leavin' off sassage steam ingine as 'ud swaller up a pavin' stone if you put it too near and grind it into sassages as easy as if it was a tender young baby wery proud o' that machine he was as it was nat'ral he should be and he'd stand down in the cellar a lookin' at it wen it was in full play till he got quite melancholy with joy a wery happy man he'd ha' been sir in the procession o' that 'ere ingine and two more lovely hinfants besides if it hadn't been for his wife who was a most ow dacious wixin she was always a follerin' him about and dinnin' in his ears till at last he couldn't stand it no longer 'i'll tell you what it is my dear' he says one day 'if you persewere in this here sort of amusement' he says 'i'm blessed if i don't go away to 'merriker and that's all about it' 'you're a idle willin' says she 'and i wish the 'merrikins joy of their bargain' arter wich she keeps on abusin' of him for half an hour and then runs into the little parlour behind the shop sets to a screamin' says he'll be the death on her and falls in a fit which lasts for three good hours one o' them fits wich is all screamin' and kickin' well next mornin' the husband was missin' he hadn't taken nothin' from the till hadn't even put on his great coat so it was quite clear he warn't gone to 'merriker didn't come back next day didn't come back next week missis had bills printed sayin' that if he'd come back he should be forgiven everythin' which was very liberal seein' that he hadn't done nothin' at all the canals was dragged and for two months artervards wenever a body turned up it was carried as a reg'lar thing straight off to the sassage shop hows'ever none on 'em answered so they gave out that he'd run avay and she kep' on the bis'ness one saturday night a little thin old gen'l'm'n comes into the shop in a great passion and says 'are you the missis o' this here shop' 'yes i am' says she 'well ma'am' says he 'then i've just looked in to say that me and my family ain't a goin' to be choked for nothin' and more than that ma'am' he says 'you'll allow me to observe that as you don't use the primest parts of the meat in the manafacter o' sassages i think you'd find beef come nearly as cheap as buttons' 'as buttons sir' says she 'buttons ma'am' says the little old gen'l'm'n unfolding a bit of paper and showing twenty or thirty halves o' buttons 'nice seasonin' for sassages is trousers buttons ma'am' 'they're my husband's buttons' says the widder beginnin' to faint 'what' screams the little old gen'l'm'n turnin' wery pale 'i see it all' says the widder 'in a fit of temporary insanity he rashly converted his self into sassages' and so he had sir said mr weller looking steadily into mr pickwick's horror stricken countenance or else he'd been draw'd into the ingine but however that might ha' been the little old gen'l'm'n who had been remarkably partial to sassages all his life rushed out o' the shop in a wild state and was never heard on artervards the relation of this affecting incident of private life brought master and man to mr perker's chambers lowten holding the door half open was in conversation with a rustily clad miserable looking man in boots without toes and gloves without fingers there were traces of privation and suffering almost of despair in his lank and careworn countenance he felt his poverty for he shrunk to the dark side of the staircase as mr pickwick approached it's very unfortunate said the stranger with a sigh very said lowten scribbling his name on the door post with his pen and rubbing it out again with the feather will you leave a message for him when do you think he'll be back inquired the stranger quite uncertain replied lowten winking at mr pickwick as the stranger cast his eyes towards the ground you don't think it would be of any use my waiting for him said the stranger looking wistfully into the office oh no i'm sure it wouldn't replied the clerk moving a little more into the centre of the doorway he's certain not to be back this week and it's a chance whether he will be next for when perker once gets out of town he's never in a hurry to come back again out of town said mr pickwick dear me how unfortunate don't go away mr pickwick said lowten i've got a letter for you the stranger seeming to hesitate once more looked towards the ground and the clerk winked slily at mr pickwick as if to intimate that some exquisite piece of humour was going forward though what it was mr pickwick could not for the life of him divine step in mr pickwick said lowten well will you leave a message mr watty or will you call again ask him to be so kind as to leave out word what has been done in my business said the man for god's sake don't neglect it mr lowten no no i won't forget it replied the clerk walk in mr pickwick good morning mr watty it's a fine day for walking isn't it seeing that the stranger still lingered he beckoned sam weller to follow his master in and shut the door in his face there never was such a pestering bankrupt as that since the world began i do believe said lowten throwing down his pen with the air of an injured man his affairs haven't been in chancery quite four years yet and i'm d d if he don't come worrying here twice a week step this way mr pickwick perker is in and he'll see you i know devilish cold he added pettishly standing at that door wasting one's time with such seedy vagabonds having very vehemently stirred a particularly large fire with a particularly small poker the clerk led the way to his principal's private room and announced mr pickwick ah my dear sir said little mr perker bustling up from his chair well my dear sir and what's the news about your matter eh anything more about our friends in freeman's court they've not been sleeping i know that ah they're smart fellows very smart indeed as the little man concluded he took an emphatic pinch of snuff as a tribute to the smartness of messrs dodson and fogg they are great scoundrels said mr pickwick aye aye said the little man that's a matter of opinion you know and we won't dispute about terms because of course you can't be expected to view these subjects with a professional eye well we've done everything that's necessary i have retained serjeant snubbin is he a good man inquired mr pickwick good man replied perker bless your heart and soul my dear sir serjeant snubbin is at the very top of his profession gets treble the business of any man in court engaged in every case you needn't mention it abroad but we say we of the profession that serjeant snubbin leads the court by the nose the little man took another pinch of snuff as he made this communication and nodded mysteriously to mr pickwick they have subpoena'd my three friends said mr pickwick ah of course they would replied perker important witnesses saw you in a delicate situation but she fainted of her own accord said mr pickwick she threw herself into my arms very likely my dear sir replied perker very likely and very natural nothing more so my dear sir nothing but who's to prove it they have subpoena'd my servant too said mr pickwick quitting the other point for there mr perker's question had somewhat staggered him sam said perker mr pickwick replied in the affirmative of course my dear sir of course i knew they would i could have told you that a month ago you know my dear sir if you will take the management of your affairs into your own hands after intrusting them to your solicitor you must also take the consequences here mr perker drew himself up with conscious dignity and brushed some stray grains of snuff from his shirt frill and what do they want him to prove asked mr pickwick after two or three minutes' silence that you sent him up to the plaintiff's to make some offer of a compromise i suppose replied perker it don't matter much though i don't think many counsel could get a great deal out of him i don't think they could said mr pickwick smiling despite his vexation at the idea of sam's appearance as a witness what course do we pursue we have only one to adopt my dear sir replied perker cross examine the witnesses trust to snubbin's eloquence throw dust in the eyes of the judge throw ourselves on the jury and suppose the verdict is against me said mr pickwick mr perker smiled took a very long pinch of snuff stirred the fire shrugged his shoulders and remained expressively silent you mean that in that case i must pay the damages said mr pickwick who had watched this telegraphic answer with considerable sternness perker gave the fire another very unnecessary poke and said i am afraid so then i beg to announce to you my unalterable determination to pay no damages whatever said mr pickwick most emphatically none perker not a pound not a penny of my money shall find its way into the pockets of dodson and fogg that is my deliberate and irrevocable determination mr pickwick gave a heavy blow on the table before him in confirmation of the irrevocability of his intention very well my dear sir very well said perker you know best of course of course replied mr pickwick hastily where does serjeant snubbin live in lincoln's inn old square replied perker i should like to see him said mr pickwick see serjeant snubbin my dear sir rejoined perker in utter amazement pooh pooh my dear sir impossible see serjeant snubbin bless you my dear sir such a thing was never heard of without a consultation fee being previously paid and a consultation fixed it couldn't be done my dear sir it couldn't be done mr pickwick however had made up his mind not only that it could be done but that it should be done and the consequence was that within ten minutes after he had received the assurance that the thing was impossible he was conducted by his solicitor into the outer office of the great serjeant snubbin himself it was an uncarpeted room of tolerable dimensions with a large writing table drawn up near the fire the baize top of which had long since lost all claim to its original hue of green and had gradually grown grey with dust and age except where all traces of its natural colour were obliterated by ink stains upon the table were numerous little bundles of papers tied with red tape and behind it sat an elderly clerk whose sleek appearance and heavy gold watch chain presented imposing indications of the extensive and lucrative practice of mr serjeant snubbin is the serjeant in his room mr mallard inquired perker offering his box with all imaginable courtesy yes he is was the reply but he's very busy look here not an opinion given yet on any one of these cases and an expedition fee paid with all of 'em the clerk smiled as he said this and inhaled a pinch of snuff with a zest which seemed to be compounded of a fondness for snuff and a relish for fees something like practice that said perker yes said the barrister's clerk producing his own box and offering it with the greatest cordiality and the best of it is that as nobody alive except myself can read the serjeant's writing they are obliged to wait for the opinions when he has given them till i have copied 'em ha ha ha which makes good for we know who besides the serjeant and draws a little more out of the clients eh said perker ha ha ha at this the serjeant's clerk laughed again not a noisy boisterous laugh but a silent internal chuckle which mr pickwick disliked to hear when a man bleeds inwardly it is a dangerous thing for himself but when he laughs inwardly it bodes no good to other people you haven't made me out that little list of the fees that i'm in your debt have you said perker no i have not replied the clerk i wish you would said perker let me have them and i'll send you a cheque but i suppose you're too busy pocketing the ready money to think of the debtors eh ha ha ha this sally seemed to tickle the clerk amazingly and he once more enjoyed a little quiet laugh to himself but mr mallard my dear friend said perker suddenly recovering his gravity and drawing the great man's great man into a corner by the lappel of his coat you must persuade the serjeant to see me and my client here come come said the clerk that's not bad either see the serjeant come that's too absurd notwithstanding the absurdity of the proposal however the clerk allowed himself to be gently drawn beyond the hearing of mr pickwick and after a short conversation conducted in whispers walked softly down a little dark passage and disappeared into the legal luminary's sanctum whence he shortly returned on tiptoe and informed mr perker and mr pickwick that the serjeant had been prevailed upon in violation of all established rules and customs to admit them at once mr serjeant snubbin was a lantern faced sallow complexioned man of about five and forty or as the novels say he might be fifty he had that dull looking boiled eye which is often to be seen in the heads of people who have applied themselves during many years to a weary and laborious course of study and which would have been sufficient without the additional eye glass which dangled from a broad black riband round his neck to warn a stranger that he was very near sighted his hair was thin and weak which was partly attributable to his having never devoted much time to its arrangement and partly to his having worn for five and twenty years the forensic wig which hung on a block beside him the marks of hair powder on his coat collar and the ill washed and worse tied white neckerchief round his throat showed that he had not found leisure since he left the court to make any alteration in his dress while the slovenly style of the remainder of his costume warranted the inference that his personal appearance would not have been very much improved if he had books of practice heaps of papers and opened letters were scattered over the table without any attempt at order or arrangement the furniture of the room was old and rickety the doors of the bookcase were rotting in their hinges the dust flew out from the carpet in little clouds at every step the blinds were yellow with age and dirt the state of everything in the room showed with a clearness not to be mistaken that mr serjeant snubbin was far too much occupied with his professional pursuits to take any great heed or regard of his personal comforts the serjeant was writing when his clients entered he bowed abstractedly when mr pickwick was introduced by his solicitor and then motioning them to a seat put his pen carefully in the inkstand nursed his left leg and waited to be spoken to mr pickwick is the defendant in bardell and pickwick serjeant snubbin said perker i am retained in that am i said the serjeant you are sir replied perker the serjeant nodded his head and waited for something else mr pickwick was anxious to call upon you serjeant snubbin said perker to state to you before you entered upon the case that he denies there being any ground or pretence whatever for the action against him and that unless he came into court with clean hands and without the most conscientious conviction that he was right in resisting the plaintiff's demand he would not be there at all i believe i state your views correctly do not my dear sir said the little man turning to mr pickwick quite so replied that gentleman mr serjeant snubbin unfolded his glasses raised them to his eyes and after looking at mr pickwick for a few seconds with great curiosity turned to mr perker and said smiling slightly as he spoke has mr pickwick a strong case the attorney shrugged his shoulders do you propose calling witnesses no the smile on the serjeant's countenance became more defined he rocked his leg with increased violence and throwing himself back in his easy chair coughed dubiously these tokens of the serjeant's presentiments on the subject slight as they were were not lost on mr pickwick he settled the spectacles through which he had attentively regarded such demonstrations of the barrister's feelings as he had permitted himself to exhibit more firmly on his nose and said with great energy and in utter disregard of all mr perker's admonitory winkings and frownings my wishing to wait upon you for such a purpose as this sir appears i have no doubt to a gentleman who sees so much of these matters as you must necessarily do a very extraordinary circumstance the serjeant tried to look gravely at the fire but the smile came back again gentlemen of your profession sir continued mr pickwick see the worst side of human nature all its disputes all its ill will and bad blood rise up before you you know from your experience of juries i mean no disparagement to you or them how much depends upon effect and you are apt to attribute to others a desire to use for purposes of deception and self interest the very instruments which you in pure honesty and honour of purpose and with a laudable desire to do your utmost for your client know the temper and worth of so well from constantly employing them yourselves i really believe that to this circumstance may be attributed the vulgar but very general notion of your being as a body suspicious distrustful and over cautious conscious as i am sir of the disadvantage of making such a declaration to you under such circumstances i have come here because i wish you distinctly to understand as my friend mr perker has said that i am innocent of the falsehood laid to my charge and although i am very well aware of the inestimable value of your assistance sir i must beg to add that unless you sincerely believe this i would rather be deprived of the aid of your talents than have the advantage of them long before the close of this address which we are bound to say was of a very prosy character for mr pickwick the serjeant had relapsed into a state of abstraction after some minutes however during which he had reassumed his pen he appeared to be again aware of the presence of his clients raising his head from the paper he said rather snappishly who is with me in this case mr phunky serjeant snubbin replied the attorney phunky phunky said the serjeant i never heard the name before he must be a very young man yes he is a very young man replied the attorney he was only called the other day let me see he has not been at the bar eight years yet ah i thought not said the serjeant in that sort of pitying tone in which ordinary folks would speak of a very helpless little child mr mallard send round to mr mr phunky's holborn court gray's inn interposed perker holborn court by the bye is south square now mr phunky and say i should be glad if he'd step here a moment mr mallard departed to execute his commission and serjeant snubbin relapsed into abstraction until mr phunky himself was introduced although an infant barrister he was a full grown man he had a very nervous manner and a painful hesitation in his speech it did not appear to be a natural defect but seemed rather the result of timidity arising from the consciousness of being kept down by want of means or interests or connection or impudence as the case might be he was overawed by the serjeant and profoundly courteous to the attorney i have not had the pleasure of seeing you before mr phunky said serjeant snubbin with a haughty condescension mr phunky bowed he had had the pleasure of seeing the serjeant and of envying him too with all a poor man's envy for eight years and a quarter you are with me in this case i understand said the serjeant if mr phunky had been a rich man he would have instantly sent for his clerk to remind him if he had been a wise one he would have applied his forefinger to his forehead and endeavoured to recollect whether in the multiplicity of his engagements he had undertaken this one or not but as he was neither rich nor wise in this sense at all events he turned red and bowed have you read the papers mr phunky inquired the serjeant here again mr phunky should have professed to have forgotten all about the merits of the case but as he had read such papers as had been laid before him in the course of the action and had thought of nothing else waking or sleeping throughout the two months during which he had been retained as mr serjeant snubbin's junior he turned a deeper red and bowed again this is mr pickwick said the serjeant waving his pen in the direction in which that gentleman was standing mr phunky bowed to mr pickwick with a reverence which a first client must ever awaken and again inclined his head towards his leader perhaps you will take mr pickwick away said the serjeant and and and hear anything mr pickwick may wish to communicate we shall have a consultation of course with this hint that he had been interrupted quite long enough mr serjeant snubbin who had been gradually growing more and more abstracted applied his glass to his eyes for an instant bowed slightly round and was once more deeply immersed in the case before him which arose out of an interminable lawsuit originating in the act of an individual deceased a century or so ago who had stopped up a pathway leading from some place which nobody ever came from to some other place which nobody ever went to mr phunky would not hear of passing through any door until mr pickwick and his solicitor had passed through before him so it was some time before they got into the square and when they did reach it they walked up and down and held a long conference the result of which was that it was a very difficult matter to say how the verdict would go that nobody could presume to calculate on the issue of an action that it was very lucky they had prevented the other party from getting serjeant snubbin and other topics of doubt and consolation common in such a position of affairs mr weller was then roused by his master from a sweet sleep of an hour's duration and bidding adieu to lowten they returned to the city chapter iv illustration describes far more fully than the court newsman ever did a bachelor's party given by mr bob sawyer at his lodgings in the borough there is a repose about lant street in the borough which sheds a gentle melancholy upon the soul there are always a good many houses to let in the street it is a by street too and its dulness is soothing a house in lant street would not come within the denomination of a first rate residence in the strict acceptation of the term but it is a most desirable spot nevertheless if a man wished to abstract himself from the world to remove himself from within the reach of temptation to place himself beyond the possibility of any inducement to look out of the window he should by all means go to lant street in this happy retreat are colonised a few clear starchers a sprinkling of journeymen bookbinders one or two prison agents for the insolvent court several small housekeepers who are employed in the docks a handful of mantua makers and a seasoning of jobbing tailors the majority of the inhabitants either direct their energies to the letting of furnished apartments or devote themselves to the healthful and invigorating pursuit of mangling the chief features in the still life of the street are green shutters lodging bills brass door plates and bell handles the principal specimens of animated nature the pot boy the muffin youth and the baked potato man the population is migratory usually disappearing on the verge of quarter day and generally by night his majesty's revenues are seldom collected in this happy valley the rents are dubious and the water communication is very frequently cut off mr bob sawyer embellished one side of the fire in his first floor front early in the evening for which he had invited mr pickwick and mr ben allen the other the preparations for the reception of visitors appeared to be completed the umbrellas in the passage had been heaped into the little corner outside the back parlour door the bonnet and shawl of the landlady's servant had been removed from the banisters there were not more than two pairs of pattens on the street door mat and the kitchen candle with a very long snuff burnt cheerfully on the ledge of the staircase window mr bob sawyer had himself purchased the spirits at a wine vaults in high street and had returned home preceding the bearer thereof to preclude the possibility of their delivery at the wrong house the punch was ready made in a red pan in the bedroom a little table covered with a green baize cloth had been borrowed from the parlour to play cards on and the glasses of the establishment together with those which had been borrowed for the occasion from the public house were all drawn up in a tray which was deposited on the landing outside the door notwithstanding the highly satisfactory nature of all these arrangements there was a cloud on the countenance of mr bob sawyer as he sat by the fireside there was a sympathising expression too in the features of mr ben allen as he gazed intently on the coals and a tone of melancholy in his voice as he said after a long silence well it is unlucky she should have taken it in her head to turn sour just on this occasion she might at least have waited till to morrow that's her malevolence that's her malevolence returned mr bob sawyer vehemently she says that if i can afford to give a party i ought to be able to pay her confounded 'little bill' how long has it been running inquired mr ben allen a bill by the bye is the most extraordinary locomotive engine that the genius of man ever produced it would keep on running during the longest lifetime without ever once stopping of its own accord only a quarter and a month or so replied mr bob sawyer ben allen coughed hopelessly and directed a searching look between the two top bars of the stove it'll be a deuced unpleasant thing if she takes it into her head to let out when those fellows are here won't it said mr ben allen at length horrible replied bob sawyer horrible a low tap was heard at the room door mr bob sawyer looked expressively at his friend and bade the tapper come in whereupon a dirty slipshod girl in black cotton stockings who might have passed for the neglected daughter of a superannuated dustman in very reduced circumstances thrust in her head and said please mister sawyer missis raddle wants to speak to you before mr bob sawyer could return any answer the girl suddenly disappeared with a jerk as if somebody had given her a violent pull behind this mysterious exit was no sooner accomplished than there was another tap at the door a smart pointed tap which seemed to say here i am and in i'm coming mr bob sawyer glanced at his friend with a look of abject apprehension and once more cried come in the permission was not at all necessary for before mr bob sawyer had uttered the words a little fierce woman bounced into the room all in a tremble with passion and pale with rage now mr sawyer said the little fierce woman trying to appear very calm if you'll have the kindness to settle that little bill of mine i'll thank you because i've got my rent to pay this afternoon and my landlord's a waiting below now here the little woman rubbed her hands and looked steadily over mr bob sawyer's head at the wall behind him i am very sorry to put you to any inconvenience mrs raddle said bob sawyer deferentially but oh it isn't any inconvenience replied the little woman with a shrill titter i didn't want it particular before to day leastways as it has to go to my landlord directly it was as well for you to keep it as me you promised me this afternoon mr sawyer and every gentleman as has ever lived here has kept his word sir as of course anybody as calls himself a gentleman does mrs raddle tossed her head bit her lips rubbed her hands harder and looked at the wall more steadily than ever it was plain to see as mr bob sawyer remarked in a style of eastern allegory on a subsequent occasion that she was getting the steam up illustration if you'll have the kindness to settle that little bill of mine i'll thank you i am very sorry mrs raddle said bob sawyer with all imaginable humility but the fact is that i have been disappointed in the city to day extraordinary place that city an astonishing number of men always are getting disappointed there well mr sawyer said mrs raddle planting herself firmly on a purple cauliflower in the kidderminster carpet and what's that to me sir i i have no doubt mrs raddle said bob sawyer blinking this last question that before the middle of next week we shall be able to set ourselves quite square and go on on a better system afterwards this was all mrs raddle wanted she had bustled up to the apartment of the unlucky bob sawyer so bent upon going into a passion that in all probability payment would have rather disappointed her than otherwise she was in excellent order for a little relaxation of the kind having just exchanged a few introductory compliments with mr r in the front kitchen do you suppose mr sawyer said mrs raddle elevating her voice for the information of the neighbours do you suppose that i'm a going day after day to let a fellar occupy my lodgings as never thinks of paying his rent nor even the very money laid out for the fresh butter and lump sugar that's bought for his breakfast and the very milk that's took in at the street door do you suppose a hard working and industrious woman as has lived in this street for twenty year ten year over the way and nine year and three quarter in this very house has nothing else to do but to work herself to death after a parcel of lazy idle fellars that are always smoking and drinking and lounging when they ought to be glad to turn their hands to anything that would help them to pay their bills do you my good soul interposed mr benjamin allen soothingly have the goodness to keep your observashuns to yourself sir i beg said mrs raddle suddenly arresting the rapid torrent of her speech and addressing the third party with impressive slowness and solemnity i am not aweer sir that you have any right to address your conversation to me i don't think i let these apartments to you sir no you certainly did not said mr benjamin allen very good sir responded mrs raddle with lofty politeness then p'raps sir you'll confine yourself to breaking the arms and legs of the poor people in the hospitals and keep yourself to yourself sir or there may be some persons here as will make you sir but you are such an unreasonable woman remonstrated mr benjamin allen i beg your parding young man said mrs raddle in a cold perspiration of anger but will you have the goodness just to call me that again sir i didn't make use of the word in any invidious sense ma'am replied mr benjamin allen growing somewhat uneasy on his own account i beg your parding young man demanded mrs raddle in a louder and more imperative tone but who do you call a woman did you make that remark to me sir why bless my heart said mr benjamin allen did you apply that name to me i ask of you sir interrupted mrs raddle with intense fierceness throwing the door wide open why of course i did replied mr benjamin allen yes of course you did said mrs raddle backing gradually to the door and raising her voice to its loudest pitch for the special behoof of mr raddle in the kitchen yes of course you did and everybody knows that they may safely insult me in my own 'ouse while my husband sits sleeping down stairs and taking no more notice than if i was a dog in the streets he ought to be ashamed of himself here mrs raddle sobbed to allow his wife to be treated in this way by a parcel of young cutters and carvers of live people's bodies that disgraces the lodgings another sob and leaving her exposed to all manner of abuse a base faint hearted timorous wretch that's afraid to come up stairs and face the ruffinly creatures that's afraid that's afraid to come mrs raddle paused to listen whether the repetition of the taunt had roused her better half and finding that it had not been successful proceeded to descend the stairs with sobs innumerable when there came a loud double knock at the street door whereupon she burst into an hysterical fit of weeping accompanied with dismal moans which was prolonged until the knock had been repeated six times when in an uncontrollable burst of mental agony she threw down all the umbrellas and disappeared into the back parlour closing the door after her with an awful crash does mr sawyer live here said mr pickwick when the door was opened yes said the girl first floor it's the door straight afore you when you gets to the top of the stairs having given this instruction the handmaid who had been brought up among the aboriginal inhabitants of southwark disappeared with the candle in her hand down the kitchen stairs perfectly satisfied that she had done everything that could possibly be required of her under the circumstances mr snodgrass who entered last secured the street door after several ineffectual efforts by putting up the chain and the friends stumbled up stairs where they were received by mr bob sawyer who had been afraid to go down lest he should be waylaid by mrs raddle how are you said the discomfited student glad to see you take care of the glasses this caution was addressed to mr pickwick who had put his hat in the tray dear me said mr pickwick i beg your pardon don't mention it don't mention it said bob sawyer i'm rather confined for room here but you must put up with all that when you come to see a young bachelor walk in you've seen this gentleman before i think mr pickwick shook hands with mr benjamin allen and his friends followed his example they had scarcely taken their seats when there was another double knock i hope that's jack hopkins said mr bob sawyer hush yes it is come up jack come up a heavy footstep was heard upon the stairs and jack hopkins presented himself he wore a black velvet waistcoat with thunder and lightning buttons and a blue striped shirt with a white false collar you're late jack said mr benjamin allen been detained at bartholomew's replied hopkins anything new no nothing particular rather a good accident brought into the casualty ward what was that sir inquired mr pickwick only a man fallen out of a four pair of stairs' window but it's a very fair case very fair case indeed do you mean that the patient is in a fair way to recover inquired mr pickwick no replied hopkins carelessly no i should rather say he wouldn't there must be a splendid operation though to morrow magnificent sight if slasher does it you consider mr slasher a good operator said mr pickwick best alive replied hopkins took a boy's leg out of the socket last week boy ate five apples and a gingerbread cake exactly two minutes after it was all over boy said he wouldn't lie there to be made game of and he'd tell his mother if they didn't begin dear me said mr pickwick astonished pooh that's nothing that ain't said jack hopkins is it bob nothing at all replied mr bob sawyer by the bye bob said hopkins with a scarcely perceptible glance at mr pickwick's attentive face we had a curious accident last night a child was brought in who had swallowed a necklace swallowed what sir interrupted mr pickwick a necklace replied jack hopkins not all at once you know that would be too much you couldn't swallow that if the child did eh mr pickwick ha ha mr hopkins appeared highly gratified with his own pleasantry and continued no the way was this child's parents were poor people who lived in a court child's eldest sister bought a necklace common necklace made of large black wooden beads child being fond of toys cribbed the necklace hid it played with it cut the string and swallowed a bead child thought it capital fun went back next day and swallowed another bead bless my heart said mr pickwick what a dreadful thing i beg your pardon sir go on next day child swallowed two beads the day after that he treated himself to three and so on till in a week's time he had got through the necklace five and twenty beads in all the sister who was an industrious girl and seldom treated herself to a bit of finery cried her eyes out at the loss of the necklace looked high and low for it but i needn't say didn't find it a few days afterwards the family were at dinner baked shoulder of mutton and potatoes under it the child who wasn't hungry was playing about the room when suddenly there was heard a devil of a noise like a small hailstorm 'don't do that my boy' said the father 'i ain't a doin' nothing' said the child 'well don't do it again' said the father there was a short silence and then the noise again began worse than ever 'if you don't mind what i say my boy' said the father 'you'll find yourself in bed in something less than a pig's whisper' he gave the child a shake to make him obedient and such a rattling ensued as nobody ever heard before 'why damme it's in the child' said the father 'he's got the croup in the wrong place' 'no i haven't father' said the child beginning to cry 'it's the necklace i swallowed it father' the father caught the child up and ran with him to the hospital the beads in the boy's stomach rattling all the way with the jolting and the people looking up in the air and down in the cellars to see where the unusual sound came from he's in the hospital now said jack hopkins and he makes such a devil of a noise when he walks about that they're obliged to muffle him in a watchman's coat for fear he should wake the patients that's the most extraordinary case i ever heard of said mr pickwick with an emphatic blow on the table oh that's nothing said jack hopkins is it bob certainly not replied mr bob sawyer very singular things occur in our profession i can assure you sir said hopkins so i should be disposed to imagine replied mr pickwick another knock at the door announced a large headed young man in a black wig who brought with him a scorbutic youth in a long stock the next comer was a gentleman in a shirt emblazoned with pink anchors who was closely followed by a pale youth with a plated watchguard the arrival of a prim personage in clean linen and cloth boots rendered the party complete the little table with the green baize cover was wheeled out the first instalment of punch was brought in in a white jug and the succeeding three hours were devoted to vingt et un at sixpence a dozen which was only once interrupted by a slight dispute between the scorbutic youth and the gentleman with the pink anchors in the course of which the scorbutic youth intimated a burning desire to pull the nose of the gentleman with the emblems of hope in reply to which that individual expressed his decided unwillingness to accept of any sauce on gratuitous terms either from the irascible young gentleman with the scorbutic countenance or any other person who was ornamented with a head when the last natural had been declared and the profit and loss account of fish and sixpences adjusted to the satisfaction of all parties mr bob sawyer rang for supper and the visitors squeezed themselves into corners while it was getting ready it was not so easily got ready as some people may imagine first of all it was necessary to awaken the girl who had fallen asleep with her face on the kitchen table this took a little time and even when she did answer the bell another quarter of an hour was consumed in fruitless endeavours to impart to her a faint and distant glimmering of reason the man to whom the order for the oysters had been sent had not been told to open them it is a very difficult thing to open an oyster with a limp knife or a two pronged fork and very little was done in this way very little of the beef was done either and the ham which was also from the german sausage shop round the corner was in a similar predicament however there was plenty of porter in a tin can and the cheese went a great way for it was very strong so upon the whole perhaps the supper was quite as good as such matters usually are after supper another jug of punch was put upon the table together with a paper of cigars and a couple of bottles of spirits then there was an awful pause and this awful pause was occasioned by a very common occurrence in this sort of place but a very embarrassing one notwithstanding the fact is the girl was washing the glasses the establishment boasted four we do not record the circumstance as at all derogatory to mrs raddle for there never was a lodging house yet that was not short of glasses the landlady's glasses were little thin blown glass tumblers and those which had been borrowed from the public house were great dropsical bloated articles each supported on a huge gouty leg this would have been in itself sufficient to have possessed the company with the real state of affairs but the young woman of all work had prevented the possibility of any misconception arising in the mind of any gentleman upon the subject by forcibly dragging every man's glass away long before he had finished his beer and audibly stating despite the winks and interruptions of mr bob sawyer that it was to be conveyed down stairs and washed forthwith it is a very ill wind that blows nobody any good the prim man in the cloth boots who had been unsuccessfully attempting to make a joke during the whole time the round game lasted saw his opportunity and availed himself of it the instant the glasses disappeared he commenced a long story about a great public character whose name he had forgotten making a particularly happy reply to another eminent and illustrious individual whom he had never been able to identify he enlarged at some length and with great minuteness upon divers collateral circumstances distantly connected with the anecdote in hand but for the life of him he couldn't recollect at that precise moment what the anecdote was although he had been in the habit of telling the story with great applause for the last ten years dear me said the prim man in the cloth boots it is a very extraordinary circumstance i am sorry you have forgotten it said mr bob sawyer glancing eagerly at the door as he thought he heard the noise of glasses jingling very sorry so am i responded the prim man because i know it would have afforded so much amusement never mind i dare say i shall manage to recollect it in the course of half an hour or so the prim man arrived at this point just as the glasses came back when mr bob sawyer who had been absorbed in attention during the whole time said he should very much like to hear the end of it for so far as it went it was without exception the very best story he had ever heard the sight of the tumblers restored bob sawyer to a degree of equanimity which he had not possessed since his interview with his landlady his face brightened up and he began to feel quite convivial now betsy said mr bob sawyer with great suavity and dispersing at the same time the tumultuous little mob of glasses the girl had collected in the centre of the table now betsy the warm water be brisk there's a good girl you can't have no warm water replied betsy no warm water exclaimed mr bob sawyer no said the girl with a shake of the head which expressed a more decided negative than the most copious language could have conveyed missis raddle said you warn't to have none the surprise depicted on the countenances of his guests imparted new courage to the host bring up the warm water instantly instantly said mr bob sawyer with desperate sternness no i can't replied the girl missis raddle raked out the kitchen fire afore she went to bed and locked up the kittle oh never mind never mind pray don't disturb yourself about such a trifle said mr pickwick observing the conflict of bob sawyer's passions as depicted in his countenance cold water will do very well oh admirably said mr benjamin allen my landlady is subject to some slight attacks of mental derangement remarked bob sawyer with a ghastly smile and i fear i must give her warning no don't said ben allen i fear i must said bob with heroic firmness i'll pay her what i owe her and give her warning to morrow morning poor fellow how devoutly he wished he could mr bob sawyer's heart sickening attempts to rally under this last blow communicated a dispiriting influence on the company the greater part of whom with the view of raising their spirits attached themselves with extra cordiality to the cold brandy and water the first perceptible effects of which were displayed in a renewal of hostilities between the scorbutic youth and the gentleman in the shirt the belligerents vented their feelings of mutual contempt for some time in a variety of frownings and snortings until at last the scorbutic youth felt it necessary to come to a more explicit understanding on the matter when the following clear understanding took place sawyer said the scorbutic youth in a loud voice well noddy replied mr bob sawyer i should be very sorry sawyer said mr noddy to create any unpleasantness at any friend's table and much less at yours sawyer very but i must take this opportunity of informing mr gunter that he is no gentleman and i should be very sorry sawyer to create any disturbance in the street in which you reside said mr gunter but i'm afraid i shall be under the necessity of alarming the neighbours by throwing the person who has just spoken out o' window what do you mean by that sir inquired mr noddy what i say sir replied mr gunter i should like to see you do it sir said mr noddy you shall feel me do it in half a minute sir replied mr gunter i request that you'll favour me with your card sir said mr noddy i'll do nothing of the kind sir replied mr gunter why not sir inquired mr noddy because you'll stick it up over your chimney piece and delude your visitors into the false belief that a gentleman has been to see you sir replied mr gunter sir a friend of mine shall wait on you in the morning said mr noddy sir i'm very much obliged to you for the caution and i'll leave particular directions with the servant to lock up the spoons replied mr gunter at this point the remainder of the guests interposed and remonstrated with both parties on the impropriety of their conduct on which mr noddy begged to state that his father was quite as respectable as mr gunter's father to which mr gunter replied that his father was to the full as respectable as mr noddy's father and that his father's son was as good a man as mr noddy any day in the week as this announcement seemed the prelude to a recommencement of the dispute there was another interference on the part of the company and a vast quantity of talking and clamouring ensued in the course of which mr noddy gradually allowed his feelings to overpower him and professed that he had ever entertained a devoted personal attachment towards mr gunter to this mr gunter replied that upon the whole he rather preferred mr noddy to his own brother on hearing which admission mr noddy magnanimously rose from his seat and proffered his hand to mr gunter mr gunter grasped it with affecting fervour and everybody said that the whole dispute had been conducted in a manner which was highly honourable to both parties concerned now said jack hopkins just to set us going again bob i don't mind singing a song and hopkins incited thereto by tumultuous applause plunged himself at once into the king god bless him which he sang as loud as he could to a novel air compounded of the bay of biscay and a frog he would the chorus was the essence of the song and as each gentleman sang it to the tune he knew best the effect was very striking indeed it was at the end of the chorus to the first verse that mr pickwick held up his hand in a listening attitude and said as soon as silence was restored hush i beg your pardon i thought i heard somebody calling from up stairs a profound silence immediately ensued and mr bob sawyer was observed to turn pale i think i hear it now said mr pickwick have the goodness to open the door the door was no sooner opened than all doubt on the subject was removed mr sawyer mr sawyer screamed a voice from the two pair landing it's my landlady said bob sawyer looking round him with great dismay yes mrs raddle what do you mean by this mr sawyer replied the voice with great shrillness and rapidity of utterance ain't it enough to be swindled out of one's rent and money lent out of pocket besides and abused and insulted by your friends that dares to call themselves men without having the house turned out of window and noise enough made to bring the fire engines here at two o'clock in the morning turn them wretches away you ought to be ashamed of yourselves said the voice of mr raddle which appeared to proceed from beneath some distant bed clothes ashamed of themselves said mrs raddle why don't you go down and knock 'em every one down stairs you would if you was a man i should if i was a dozen men my dear replied mr raddle pacifically but they've the advantage of me in numbers my dear ugh you coward replied mrs raddle with supreme contempt do you mean to turn them wretches out or not mr sawyer they're going mrs raddle they're going said the miserable bob i am afraid you'd better go said mr bob sawyer to his friends i thought you were making too much noise it's a very unfortunate thing said the prim man just as we were getting so comfortable too the prim man was just beginning to have a dawning recollection of the story he had forgotten it's hardly to be borne said the prim man looking round hardly to be borne is it not to be endured replied jack hopkins let's have the other verse bob come here goes no no jack don't interrupted bob sawyer it's a capital song but i am afraid we had better not have the other verse they are very violent people the people of the house shall i step up stairs and pitch into the landlord inquired hopkins or keep on ringing the bell or go and groan on the staircase you may command me bob i am very much indebted to you for your friendship and good nature hopkins said the wretched mr bob sawyer but i think the best plan to avoid any further dispute is for us to break up at once now mr sawyer screamed the shrill voice of mrs raddle are them brutes going they're only looking for their hats mrs raddle said bob they are going directly going said mrs raddle thrusting her night cap over the banisters just as mr pickwick followed by mr tupman emerged from the sitting room going what did they ever come for my dear ma'am remonstrated mr pickwick looking up get along with you you old wretch replied mrs raddle hastily withdrawing the night cap old enough to be his grandfather you willin you're worse than any of 'em mr pickwick found it in vain to protest his innocence so hurried down stairs into the street whither he was closely followed by mr tupman mr winkle and mr snodgrass mr ben allen who was dismally depressed with spirits and agitation accompanied them as far as london bridge and in the course of the walk confided to mr winkle as an especially eligible person to entrust the secret to that he was resolved to cut the throat of any gentleman except mr bob sawyer who should aspire to the affections of his sister arabella having expressed his determination to perform this painful duty of a brother with proper firmness he burst into tears knocked his hat over his eyes and making the best of his way back knocked double knocks at the door of the borough market office and took short naps on the steps alternately until daybreak under the firm impression that he lived there and had forgotten the key the visitors having all departed in compliance with the rather pressing request of mrs raddle the luckless mr bob sawyer was left alone to meditate on the probable events of to morrow and the pleasures of the evening chapter v illustration mr weller the elder delivers some critical sentiments respecting literary composition and assisted by his son samuel pays a small instalment of retaliation to the account of the reverend gentleman with the red nose the morning of the thirteenth of february which the readers of this authentic narrative know as well as we do to have been the day immediately preceding that which was appointed for the trial of mrs bardell's action was a busy time for mr samuel weller who was perpetually engaged in travelling from the george and vulture to mr perker's chambers and back again from and between the hours of nine o'clock in the morning and two in the afternoon both inclusive not that there was anything whatever to be done for the consultation had taken place and the course of proceeding to be adopted had been finally determined on but mr pickwick being in a most extreme state of excitement persevered in constantly sending small notes to his attorney merely containing the inquiry dear perker is all going on well to which mr perker invariably forwarded the reply dear pickwick as well as possible the fact being as we have already hinted that there was nothing whatever to go on either well or ill until the sitting of the court on the following morning but people who go voluntarily to law or are taken forcibly there for the first time may be allowed to labour under some temporary irritation and anxiety and sam with a due allowance for the frailties of human nature obeyed all his master's behests with that imperturbable good humour and unruffable composure which formed one of his most striking and amiable characteristics sam had solaced himself with a most agreeable little dinner and was waiting at the bar for the glass of warm mixture in which mr pickwick had requested him to drown the fatigues of his morning's walks when a young boy of about three feet high or thereabouts in a hairy cap and fustian over alls whose garb bespoke a laudable ambition to attain in time the elevation of an hostler entered the passage of the george and vulture and looked first up the stairs and then along the passage and then into the bar as if in search of somebody to whom he bore a commission whereupon the barmaid conceiving it not improbable that the said commission might be directed to the tea or table spoons of the establishment accosted the boy with now young man what do you want is there anybody here named sam inquired the youth in a loud voice of treble quality illustration is there anybody here named sam what's the t'other name said sam weller looking round how should i know briskly replied the young gentleman below the hairy cap you're a sharp boy you are said mr weller only i wouldn't show that wery fine edge too much if i was you in case anybody took it off what do you mean by comin' to a hot el and asking arter sam vith as much politeness as a vild indian 'cos an old gen'l'm'n told me to replied the boy what old gen'l'm'n inquired sam with deep disdain him as drives a ipswich coach and uses our parlour rejoined the boy he told me yesterday mornin' to come to the george and wultur this arternoon and ask for sam it's my father my dear said mr weller turning with an explanatory air to the young lady in the bar blessed if i think he hardly knows wot my other name is vell young brockiley sprout wot then why then said the boy you was to come to him at six o'clock to our 'ouse 'cos he wants to see you blue boar leaden'all markit shall i say you're comin' you may wenture on that 'ere statement sir replied sam and thus empowered the young gentleman walked away awakening all the echoes in george yard as he did so with several chaste and extremely correct imitations of a drover's whistle delivered in a tone of peculiar richness and volume mr weller having obtained leave of absence from mr pickwick who in his then state of excitement and worry was by no means displeased at being left alone set forth long before the appointed hour and having plenty of time at his disposal sauntered down as far as the mansion house where he paused and contemplated with a face of great calmness and philosophy the numerous cads and drivers of short stages who assemble near that famous place of resort to the great terror and confusion of the old lady population of these realms having loitered here for half an hour or so mr weller turned and began wending his way towards leadenhall market through a variety of by streets and courts as he was sauntering away his spare time and stopped to look at almost every object that met his gaze it is by no means surprising that mr weller should have paused before a small stationer's and print seller's window but without further explanation it does appear surprising that his eyes should have no sooner rested on certain pictures which were exposed for sale therein than he gave a sudden start smote his right leg with great vehemence and exclaimed with energy if it hadn't been for this i should ha' forgot all about it till it was too late the particular picture on which sam weller's eyes were fixed as he said this was a highly coloured representation of a couple of human hearts skewered together with an arrow cooking before a cheerful fire while a male and female cannibal in modern attire the gentleman being clad in a blue coat and white trousers and the lady in a deep red pelisse with a parasol of the same were approaching the meal with hungry eyes up a serpentine gravel path leading thereunto a decidedly indelicate young gentleman in a pair of wings and nothing else was depicted as superintending the cooking a representation of the spire of the church in langham place london appeared in the distance and the whole formed a valentine of which as a written inscription in the window testified there was a large assortment within which the shopkeeper pledged himself to dispose of to his countrymen generally at the reduced rate of one and sixpence each i should ha' forgot it i should certainly ha' forgot it said sam so saying he at once stepped into the stationer's shop and requested to be served with a sheet of the best gilt edged letter paper and a hard nibbed pen which could be warranted not to splutter these articles having been promptly supplied he walked on direct towards leadenhall market at a good round pace very different from his recent lingering one looking round him he there beheld a sign board on which the painter's art had delineated something remotely resembling a cerulean elephant with an aquiline nose in lieu of trunk rightly conjecturing that this was the blue boar himself he stepped into the house and inquired concerning his parent he won't be here this three quarters of an hour or more said the young lady who superintended the domestic arrangements of the blue boar wery good my dear replied sam let me have nine penn'orth o' brandy and water luke and the inkstand will you miss the brandy and water luke and the inkstand having been carried into the little parlour and the young lady having carefully flattened down the coals to prevent their blazing and carried away the poker to preclude the possibility of the fire being stirred without the full privity and concurrence of the blue boar being first had and obtained sam weller sat himself down in a box near the stove and pulled out the sheet of gilt edged letter paper and the hard nibbed pen then looking carefully at the pen to see that there were no hairs in it and dusting down the table so that there might be no crumbs of bread under the paper sam tucked up the cuffs of his coat squared his elbows and composed himself to write to ladies and gentlemen who are not in the habit of devoting themselves practically to the science of penmanship writing a letter is no very easy task it being always considered necessary in such cases for the writer to recline his head on his left arm so as to place his eyes as nearly as possible on a level with the paper while glancing sideways at the letters he is constructing and to form with his tongue imaginary characters to correspond these motions although unquestionably of the greatest assistance to original composition retard in some degree the progress of the writer and sam had unconsciously been a full hour and a half writing words in small text smearing out wrong letters with his little finger and putting in new ones which required going over often to render them visible through the old blots when he was roused by the opening of the door and the entrance of his parent vell sammy said the father vell my prooshan blue responded the son laying down his pen what's the last bulletin about mother in law 'mrs weller passed a very good night but is uncommon perwerse and unpleasant this mornin' signed upon oath s veller esquire senior' that's the last vun as was issued sammy replied mr weller untying his shawl no better yet inquired sam all the symptoms aggerawated replied mr weller shaking his head but wot's that you're a doin' of pursuit of knowledge under difficulties sammy i've done now said sam with slight embarrassment i've been a writin' so i see replied mr weller not to any young 'ooman i hope sammy why it's no use a sayin' it ain't replied sam it's a walentine a what exclaimed mr weller apparently horror stricken by the word illustration a what asked mr weller apparently horror stricken by the word a walentine replied sam a walentine replied sam samivel samivel said mr weller in reproachful accents i didn't think you'd ha' done it arter the warnin' you've had o' your father's wicious propensities arter all i've said to you upon this here wery subject arter actiwally seein' and bein' in the company o' your own mother in law vich i should ha' thought wos a moral lesson as no man could never ha' forgotten to his dyin' day i didn't think you'd ha' done it sammy i didn't think you'd ha' done it these reflections were too much for the good old man he raised sam's tumbler to his lips and drank off its contents wot's the matter now said sam nev'r mind sammy replied mr weller it'll be a wery agonizin' trial to me at my time of life but i'm pretty tough that's vun consolation as the wery old turkey remarked ven the farmer said he wos afeerd he should be obliged to kill him for the london market wot'll be a trial inquired sam to see you married sammy to see you a dilluded wictim and thinkin' in your innocence that it's all wery capital replied mr weller it's a dreadful trial to a father's feelin's that 'ere sammy nonsense said sam i ain't a goin' to get married don't you fret yourself about that i know you're a judge of these things order in your pipe and i'll read you the letter there we cannot distinctly say whether it was the prospect of the pipe or the consolatory reflection that a fatal disposition to get married ran in the family and couldn't be helped which calmed mr weller's feelings and caused his grief to subside we should be rather disposed to say that the result was attained by combining the two sources of consolation for he repeated the second in a low tone very frequently ringing the bell meanwhile to order in the first he then divested himself of his upper coat and lighting the pipe and placing himself in front of the fire with his back towards it so that he could feel its full heat and recline against the mantelpiece at the same time turned towards sam and with a countenance greatly mollified by the softening influence of tobacco requested him to fire away sam dipped his pen into the ink to be ready for any corrections and began with a very theatrical air 'lovely ' stop said mr weller ringing the bell a double glass o' the inwariable my dear very well sir replied the girl who with great quickness appeared vanished returned and disappeared they seem to know your ways here observed sam yes replied his father i've been here before in my time go on sammy 'lovely creetur' repeated sam 'tain't in poetry is it interposed his father no no replied sam wery glad to hear it said mr weller poetry's unnat'ral no man ever talked poetry 'cept a beadle on boxin' day or warren's blackin' or rowland's oil or some o' them low fellows never you let yourself down to talk poetry my boy begin agin sammy mr weller resumed his pipe with critical solemnity and sam once more commenced and read as follows 'lovely creetur i feel myself a damned ' that ain't proper said mr weller taking his pipe from his mouth no it ain't 'damned' observed sam holding the letter up to the light it's 'shamed' there's a blot there 'i feel myself ashamed' wery good said mr weller go on 'feel myself ashamed and completely cir ' i forget what this here word is said sam scratching his head with the pen in vain attempts to remember why don't you look at it then inquired mr weller so i am a lookin' at it replied sam but there's another blot here's a 'c' and a 'i' and a 'd' circumwented p'raps suggested mr weller no it ain't that said sam circumscribed that's it that ain't as good a word as circumwented sammy said mr weller gravely think not said sam nothin' like it replied his father but don't you think it means more inquired sam vell p'raps it is a more tenderer word said mr weller after a moment's reflection go on sammy 'feel myself ashamed and completely circumscribed in a dressin' of you for you are a nice gal and nothin' but it' that's a wery pretty sentiment said the elder mr weller removing his pipe to make way for the remark yes i think it is rayther good observed sam highly flattered wot i like in that 'ere style of writin' said the elder mr weller is that there ain't no callin' names in it no wenuses nor nothin' o' that kind wot's the good o' callin' a young 'ooman a wenus or a angel sammy ah what indeed replied sam you might jist as well call her a griffin or a unicorn or a king's arms at once which is wery well known to be a col lection o' fabulous animals added mr weller just as well replied sam drive on sammy said mr weller sam complied with the request and proceeded as follows his father continuing to smoke with a mixed expression of wisdom and complacency which was particularly edifying 'afore i see you i thought all women was alike' so they are observed the elder mr weller parenthetically 'but now' continued sam 'now i find what a reg'lar soft headed inkred'lous turnip i must ha' been for there ain't nobody like you though i like you better than nothin' at all' i thought it best to make that rayther strong said sam looking up mr weller nodded approvingly and sam resumed 'so i take the privilidge of the day mary my dear as the gen'l'm'n in difficulties did ven he walked out of a sunday to tell you that the first and only time i see you your likeness was took on my hart in much quicker time and brighter colours than ever a likeness was took by the profeel macheen vich p'raps you may have heerd on mary my dear altho it does finish a portrait and put the frame and glass on complete with a hook at the end to hang it up by and all in two minutes and a quarter' i am afeerd that werges on the poetical sammy said mr weller dubiously no it don't replied sam reading on very quickly to avoid contesting the point 'except of me mary my dear as your walentine and think over what i've said my dear mary i will now conclude' that's all said sam that's rather a sudden pull up ain't it sammy inquired mr weller not a bit on it said sam she'll vish there wos more and that's the great art o' letter writin' well said mr weller there's somethin' in that and i wish your mother in law 'ud only conduct her conwersation on the same gen teel principle ain't you a goin' to sign it that's the difficulty said sam i don't know what to sign it sign it veller said the oldest surviving proprietor of that name won't do said sam never sign a walentine with your own name sign it 'pickvick' then said mr weller it's a wery good name and an easy one to spell the wery thing said sam i could end with a werse what do you think i don't like it sam rejoined mr weller i never know'd a respectable coachman as wrote poetry 'cept one as made an affectin' copy o' werses the night afore he wos hung for a highway robbery and he wos only a cambervell man so even that's no rule but sam was not to be dissuaded from the poetical idea that had occurred to him so he signed the letter your love sick pickwick and having folded it in a very intricate manner squeezed a down hill direction in one corner to mary housemaid at mr nupkins's mayor's ipswich suffolk and put it into his pocket wafered and ready for the general post this important business having been transacted mr weller the elder proceeded to open that on which he had summoned his son the first matter relates to your governor sammy said mr weller he's a goin' to be tried to morrow ain't he the trial's a comin' on replied sam vell said mr weller now i s'pose he'll want to call some witnesses to speak to his character or p'raps to prove a alleybi i've been a turnin' the business over in my mind and he may make his self easy sammy i've got some friends as'll do either for him but my adwice 'ud be this here never mind the character and stick to the alleybi nothing like a alleybi sammy nothing mr weller looked very profound as he delivered this legal opinion and burying his nose in his tumbler winked over the top thereof at his astonished son why what do you mean said sam you don't think he's a goin' to be tried at the old bailey do you that ain't no part of the present con sideration sammy replied mr weller verever he's a goin' to be tried my boy a alleybi's the thing to get him off ve got tom vildspark off that 'ere manslaughter with a alleybi ven all the big vigs to a man said as nothin' couldn't save him and my 'pinion is sammy that if your governor don't prove a alleybi he'll be what the italians call reg'larly flummoxed and that's all about it as the elder mr weller entertained a firm and unalterable conviction that the old bailey was the supreme court of judicature in this country and that its rules and forms of proceeding regulated and controlled the practice of all other courts of justice whatsoever he totally disregarded the assurances and arguments of his son tending to show that the alibi was inadmissible and vehemently protested that mr pickwick was being wictimised finding that it was of no use to discuss the matter further sam changed the subject and inquired what the second topic was on which his revered parent wished to consult him that's a pint o' domestic policy sammy said mr weller this here stiggins red nosed man inquired sam the wery same replied mr weller this here red nosed man sammy wisits your mother in law vith a kindness and constancy as i never see equalled he's sitch a friend o' the family sammy that ven he's avay from us he can't be comfortable unless he has somethin' to remember us by and i'd give him somethin' as 'ud turpentine and bees' vax his memory for the next ten year or so if i wos you interposed sam stop a minute said mr weller i wos a going to say he always brings now a flat bottle as holds about a pint and a half and fills it vith the pine apple rum afore he goes avay and empties it afore he comes back i s'pose said sam clean replied mr weller never leaves nothin' in it but the cork and the smell trust him for that sammy now these here fellows my boy are a goin' to night to get up the monthly meetin' o' the brick lane branch o' the united grand junction ebenezer temperance association your mother in law wos a goin' sammy but she's got the rheumatics and can't and i sammy i've got the two tickets as wos sent her mr weller communicated his secret with great glee and winked so indefatigably after doing so that sam began to think he must have got the tic doloureux in his right eye lid well said that young gentleman well continued his progenitor looking round him very cautiously you and i'll go punctival to the time the deputy shepherd won't sammy the deputy shepherd won't here mr weller was seized with a paroxysm of chuckles which gradually terminated in as near an approach to a choke as an elderly gentleman can with safety sustain well i never see sitch an old ghost in all my born days exclaimed sam rubbing the old gentleman's back hard enough to set him on fire with friction what are you a laughin' at corpilence hush sammy said mr weller looking round him with increased caution and speaking in a whisper two friends o' mine as works the oxford road and is up to all kinds o' games has got the deputy shepherd safe in tow sammy and ven he does come to the ebenezer junction vich he's sure to do for they'll see him to the door and shove him in if necessary he'll be as far gone in rum and water as ever he wos at the markis o' granby dorkin' and that's not sayin' a little neither and with this mr weller once more laughed immoderately and once more relapsed into a state of partial suffocation in consequence nothing could have been more in accordance with sam weller's feelings than the projected exposure of the real propensities and qualities of the red nosed man and it being very near the appointed hour of meeting the father and son took their way at once to brick lane sam not forgetting to drop his letter into a general post office as they walked along the monthly meetings of the brick lane branch of the united grand junction ebenezer temperance association were held in a large room pleasantly and airily situated at the top of a safe and commodious ladder the president was the straight walking mr anthony humm a converted fireman now a schoolmaster and occasionally an itinerant preacher and the secretary was mr jonas mudge chandler's shop keeper an enthusiastic and disinterested vessel who sold tea to the members previous to the commencement of business the ladies sat upon forms and drank tea till such time as they considered it expedient to leave off and a large wooden money box was conspicuously placed upon the green baize cloth of the business table behind which the secretary stood and acknowledged with a gracious smile every addition to the rich vein of copper which lay concealed within on this particular occasion the women drank tea to a most alarming extent greatly to the horror of mr weller senior who utterly regardless of all sam's admonitory nudgings stared about him in every direction with the most undisguised astonishment sammy whispered mr weller if some o' these here people don't want tappin' to morrow mornin' i ain't your father and that's wot it is why this here old lady next me is a drowndin' herself in tea be quiet can't you murmured sam sam whispered mr weller a moment afterwards in a tone of deep agitation mark my words my boy if that 'ere secretary fellow keeps on for only five minutes more he'll blow hisself up with toast and water well let him if he likes replied sam it ain't no bis'ness o' yourn if this here lasts much longer sammy said mr weller in the same low voice i shall feel it my duty as a human bein' to rise and address the cheer there's a young 'ooman on the next form but two as has drunk nine breakfast cups and a half and she's a swellin' wisibly before my wery eyes there is little doubt that mr weller would have carried his benevolent intention into immediate execution if a great noise occasioned by putting up the cups and saucers had not very fortunately announced that the tea drinking was over the crockery having been removed the table with the green baize cover was carried out into the centre of the room and the business of the evening was commenced by a little emphatic man with a bald head and drab shorts who suddenly rushed up the ladder at the imminent peril of snapping the two little legs encased in the drab shorts and said ladies and gentlemen i move our excellent brother mr anthony humm into the chair the ladies waved a choice collection of pocket handkerchiefs at this proposition and the impetuous little man literally moved mr humm into the chair by taking him by the shoulders and thrusting him into a mahogany frame which had once represented that article of furniture the waving of handkerchiefs was renewed and mr humm who was a sleek white faced man in a perpetual perspiration bowed meekly to the great admiration of the females and formally took his seat silence was then proclaimed by the little man in the drab shorts and mr humm rose and said that with the permission of his brick lane branch brothers and sisters then and there present the secretary would read the report of the brick lane branch committee a proposition which was again received with a demonstration of pocket handkerchiefs the secretary having sneezed in a very impressive manner and the cough which always seizes an assembly when anything particular is going to be done having been duly performed the following document was read report of the committee of the brick lane branch of the united grand junction ebenezer temperance association your committee have pursued their grateful labours during the past month and have the unspeakable pleasure of reporting the following additional cases of converts to temperance h walker tailor wife and two children when in better circumstances owns to having been in the constant habit of drinking ale and beer says he is not certain whether he did not twice a week for twenty years taste 'dog's nose' which your committee find upon inquiry to be compounded of warm porter moist sugar gin and nutmeg a groan and 'so it is' from an elderly female is now out of work and penniless thinks it must be the porter cheers or the loss of the use of his right hand is not certain which but thinks it very likely that if he had drunk nothing but water all his life his fellow workman would never have stuck a rusty needle in him and thereby occasioned his accident tremendous cheering has nothing but cold water to drink and never feels thirsty great applause betsy martin widow one child and one eye goes out charing and washing by the day never had more than one eye but knows her mother drank bottled stout and shouldn't wonder if that caused it immense cheering thinks it not impossible that if she had always abstained from spirits she might have had two eyes by this time tremendous applause used at every place she went to to have eighteenpence a day a pint of porter and a glass of spirits but since she became a member of the brick lane branch has always demanded three and sixpence instead the announcement of this most interesting fact was received with deafening enthusiasm henry beller was for many years toast master at various corporation dinners during which time he drank a great deal of foreign wine may sometimes have carried a bottle or two home with him is not quite certain of that but is sure if he did that he drank the contents feels very low and melancholy is very feverish and has a constant thirst upon him thinks it must be the wine he used to drink cheers is out of employ now and never touches a drop of foreign wine by any chance tremendous plaudits thomas burton is a purveyor of cats' meat to the lord mayor and sheriffs and several members of the common council the announcement of this gentleman's name was received with breathless interest has a wooden leg finds a wooden leg expensive going over the stones used to wear second hand wooden legs and drink a glass of hot gin and water regularly every night sometimes two deep sighs found the second hand wooden legs split and rot very quickly is firmly persuaded that their constitution was undermined by the gin and water prolonged cheering buys new wooden legs now and drinks nothing but water and weak tea the new legs last twice as long as the others used to do and he attributes this solely to his temperate habits triumphant cheers anthony humm now moved that the assembly do regale itself with a song with a view to their rational and moral enjoyment brother mordlin had adapted the beautiful words of who hasn't heard of a jolly young waterman to the tune of the old hundredth which he would request them to join him in singing great applause he might take that opportunity of expressing his firm persuasion that the late mr dibdin seeing the errors of his former life had written that song to show the advantages of abstinence it was a temperance song whirlwinds of cheers the neatness of the young man's attire the dexterity of his feathering the enviable state of mind which enabled him in the beautiful words of the poet to row along thinking of nothing at all all combined to prove that he must have been a water drinker cheers oh what a state of virtuous jollity rapturous cheering and what was the young man's reward let all young men present mark this the maidens all flock'd to his boat so readily loud cheers in which the ladies joined what a bright example the sisterhood the maidens flocking round the young waterman and urging him along the stream of duty and of temperance but was it the maidens of humble life only who soothed consoled and supported him no he was always first oars with the fine city ladies immense cheering the soft sex to a man he begged pardon to a female rallied round the young waterman and turned with disgust from the drinker of spirits cheers the brick lane branch brothers were watermen cheers and laughter that room was their boat that audience were the maidens and he mr anthony humm however unworthily was first oars unbounded applause wot does he mean by the soft sex sammy inquired mr weller in a whisper the womin said sam in the same tone he ain't far out there sammy replied mr weller they must be a soft sex a wery soft sex indeed if they let themselves be gammoned by such fellers as him any further observations from the indignant old gentleman were cut short by the announcement of the song which mr anthony humm gave out two lines at a time for the information of such of his hearers as were unacquainted with the legend while it was being sung the little man with the drab shorts disappeared he returned immediately on its conclusion and whispered mr anthony humm with a face of the deepest importance my friends said mr humm holding up his hand in a deprecatory manner to bespeak the silence of such of the stout old ladies as were yet a line or two behind my friends a delegate from the dorking branch of our society brother stiggins attends below out came the pocket handkerchiefs again in greater force than ever for mr stiggins was excessively popular among the female constituency of brick lane he may approach i think said mr humm looking round him with a fat smile brother tadger let him come forth and greet us the little man in drab shorts who answered to the name of brother tadger bustled down the ladder with great speed and was immediately afterwards heard tumbling up with the reverend mr stiggins he's a comin' sammy whispered mr weller purple in the countenance with suppressed laughter don't say nothin' to me replied sam for i can't bear it he's close to the door i hear him a knockin' his head again the lath and plaster now as sam weller spoke the little door flew open and brother tadger appeared closely followed by the reverend mr stiggins who no sooner entered than there was a great clapping of hands and stamping of feet and flourishing of handkerchiefs to all of which manifestations of delight brother stiggins returned no other acknowledgment than staring with a wild eye and a fixed smile at the extreme top of the wick of the candle on the table swaying his body to and fro meanwhile in a very unsteady and uncertain manner are you unwell brother stiggins whispered mr anthony humm i am all right sir replied mr stiggins in a tone in which ferocity was blended with an extreme thickness of utterance i am all right sir oh very well rejoined mr anthony humm retreating a few paces i believe no man here has ventured to say that i am not all right sir said mr stiggins oh certainly not said mr humm i should advise him not to sir i should advise him not said mr stiggins by this time the audience were perfectly silent and waited with some anxiety for the resumption of business will you address the meeting brother said mr humm with a smile of invitation no sir rejoined mr stiggins no sir i will not sir the meeting looked at each other with raised eyelids and a murmur of astonishment ran through the room it's my opinion sir said mr stiggins unbuttoning his coat and speaking very loudly it's my opinion sir that this meeting is drunk sir brother tadger sir said mr stiggins suddenly increasing in ferocity and turning sharp round on the little man in the drab shorts you are drunk sir with this mr stiggins entertaining a praiseworthy desire to promote the sobriety of the meeting and to exclude therefrom all improper characters hit brother tadger on the summit of the nose with such unerring aim that the drab shorts disappeared like a flash of lightning brother tadger had been knocked head first down the ladder upon this the women set up a loud and dismal screaming and rushing in small parties before their favourite brothers flung their arms around them to preserve them from danger an instance of affection which had nearly proved fatal to humm who being extremely popular was all but suffocated by the crowd of female devotees that hung about his neck and heaped caresses upon him the greater part of the lights were quickly put out and nothing but noise and confusion resounded on all sides now sammy said mr weller taking off his great coat with much deliberation just you step out and fetch in a watchman and wot are you a goin' to do the while inquired sam never you mind me sammy replied the old gentleman i shall ockipy myself in havin' a small settlement with that 'ere stiggins before sam could interfere to prevent it his heroic parent had penetrated into a remote corner of the room and attacked the reverend mr stiggins with manual dexterity come off said sam come on cried mr weller and without further invitation he gave the reverend mr stiggins a preliminary tap on the head and began dancing round him in a buoyant and cork like manner which in a gentleman at his time of life was a perfect marvel to behold finding all remonstrance unavailing sam pulled his hat firmly on threw his father's coat over his arm and taking the old man round the waist forcibly dragged him down the ladder and into the street never releasing his hold or permitting him to stop until they reached the corner as they gained it they could hear the shouts of the populace who were witnessing the removal of the reverend mr stiggins to strong lodgings for the night and could hear the noise occasioned by the dispersion in various directions of the members of the brick lane branch of the united grand junction ebenezer temperance association chapter vi illustration is wholly devoted to a full and faithful report of the memorable trial of bardell against pickwick i wonder what the foreman of the jury whoever he'll be has got for breakfast said mr snodgrass by way of keeping up a conversation on the eventful morning of the fourteenth of february ah said perker i hope he's got a good one why so inquired mr pickwick highly important very important my dear sir replied perker a good contented well breakfasted juryman is a capital thing to get hold of discontented or hungry jurymen my dear sir always find for the plaintiff bless my heart said mr pickwick looking very blank what do they do that for why i don't know replied the little man coolly saves time i suppose if it's near the dinner time the foreman takes out his watch when the jury has retired and says 'dear me gentlemen ten minutes to five i declare i dine at five gentlemen' so do i' says everybody else except two men who ought to have dined at three and seem more than half disposed to stand out in consequence the foreman smiles and puts up his watch 'well gentlemen what do we say plaintiff or defendant gentlemen i rather think so far as i am concerned gentlemen i say i rather think but don't let that influence you i rather think the plaintiff's the man' upon this two or three other men are sure to say that they think so too as of course they do and then they get on very unanimously and comfortably ten minutes past nine said the little man looking at his watch time we were off my dear sir breach of promise trial court is generally full in such cases you had better ring for a coach my dear sir or we shall be rather late mr pickwick immediately rang the bell and a coach having been procured the four pickwickians and mr perker ensconced themselves therein and drove to guildhall sam weller mr lowten and the blue bag following in a cab lowten said perker when they reached the outer hall of the court put mr pickwick's friends in the students' box mr pickwick himself had better sit by me this way my dear sir this way taking mr pickwick by the coat sleeve the little man led him to the low seat just beneath the desks of the king's counsel which is constructed for the convenience of attorneys who from that spot can whisper into the ear of the leading counsel in the case any instructions that may be necessary during the progress of the trial the occupants of this seat are invisible to the great body of spectators inasmuch as they sit on a much lower level than either the barristers or the audience whose seats are raised above the floor of course they have their backs to both and their faces towards the judge that's the witness box i suppose said mr pickwick pointing to a kind of pulpit with a brass rail on his left hand that's the witness box my dear sir replied perker disinterring a quantity of papers from the blue bag which lowten had just deposited at his feet and that said mr pickwick pointing to a couple of enclosed seats on his right that's where the jurymen sit is it not the identical place my dear sir replied perker tapping the lid of his snuff box mr pickwick stood up in a state of great agitation and took a glance at the court there were already a pretty large sprinkling of spectators in the gallery and a numerous muster of gentlemen in wigs in the barristers' seats who presented as a body all that pleasing and extensive variety of nose and whisker for which the bar of england is so justly celebrated such of the gentlemen as had a brief to carry carried it in as conspicuous a manner as possible and occasionally scratched their noses therewith to impress the fact more strongly on the observation of the spectators other gentlemen who had no briefs to show carried under their arms goodly octavos with a red label behind and that under done pie crust coloured cover which is technically known as law calf others who had neither briefs nor books thrust their hands into their pockets and looked as wise as they conveniently could others again moved here and there with great restlessness and earnestness of manner content to awaken thereby the admiration and astonishment of the uninitiated strangers the whole to the great wonderment of mr pickwick were divided into little groups who were chatting and discussing the news of the day in the most unfeeling manner possible just as if no trial at all were coming on a bow from mr phunky as he entered and took his seat behind the row appropriated to the king's counsel attracted mr pickwick's attention and he had scarcely returned it when mr serjeant snubbin appeared followed by mr mallard who half hid the serjeant behind a large crimson bag which he placed on the table and after shaking hands with perker withdrew then there entered two or three more serjeants and among them one with a fat body and a red face who nodded in a friendly manner to mr serjeant snubbin and said it was a fine morning who's that red faced man who said it was a fine morning and nodded to our counsel whispered mr pickwick mr serjeant buzfuz replied perker he's opposed to us he leads on the other side that gentleman behind him is mr skimpin his junior mr pickwick was on the point of inquiring with great abhorrence of the man's cold blooded villainy how mr serjeant buzfuz who was counsel for the opposite party dared to presume to tell mr serjeant snubbin who was counsel for him that it was a fine morning when he was interrupted by a general rising of the barristers and a loud cry of silence from the officers of the court looking round he found that this was caused by the entrance of the judge mr justice stareleigh who sat in the absence of the chief justice occasioned by indisposition was a most particularly short man and so fat that he seemed all face and waistcoat he rolled in upon two little turned legs and having bobbed gravely to the bar who bobbed gravely to him put his little legs underneath his table and his little three cornered hat upon it and when mr justice stareleigh had done this all you could see of him was two queer little eyes one broad pink face and somewhere about half of a big and very comical looking wig the judge had no sooner taken his seat than the officer on the floor of the court called out silence in a commanding tone upon which another officer in the gallery cried silence in an angry manner whereupon three or four more ushers shouted silence in a voice of indignant remonstrance this being done a gentleman in black who sat below the judge proceeded to call over the names of the jury and after a great deal of bawling it was discovered that only ten special jurymen were present upon this mr serjeant buzfuz prayed a tales the gentleman in black then proceeded to press into the special jury two of the common jurymen and a greengrocer and a chemist were caught directly answer to your names gentlemen that you may be sworn said the gentleman in black richard upwitch here said the greengrocer thomas groffin here said the chemist take the book gentlemen you shall well and truly try i beg this court's pardon said the chemist who was a tall thin yellow visaged man but i hope this court will excuse my attendance on what grounds sir said mr justice stareleigh i have no assistant my lord said the chemist i can't help that sir replied mr justice stareleigh you should hire one i can't afford it my lord rejoined the chemist then you ought to be able to afford it sir said the judge reddening for mr justice stareleigh's temper bordered on the irritable and brooked no contradiction i know i ought to do if i got on as well as i deserved but i don't my lord answered the chemist swear the gentleman said the judge peremptorily the officer had got no further than the you shall well and truly try when he was again interrupted by the chemist i am to be sworn my lord am i said the chemist certainly sir said the testy little judge very well my lord replied the chemist in a resigned manner then there'll be murder before this trial's over that's all swear me if you please sir and sworn the chemist was before the judge could find words to utter i merely wanted to observe my lord said the chemist taking his seat with great deliberation that i've left nobody but an errand boy in my shop he is a very nice boy my lord but he is not acquainted with drugs and i know that the prevailing impression on his mind is that epsom salts means oxalic acid and syrup of senna laudanum that's all my lord with this the tall chemist composed himself into a comfortable attitude and assuming a pleasant expression of countenance appeared to have prepared himself for the worst mr pickwick was regarding the chemist with feelings of the deepest horror when a slight sensation was perceptible in the body of the court and immediately afterwards mrs bardell supported by mrs cluppins was led in and placed in a drooping state at the other end of the seat on which mr pickwick sat an extra sized umbrella was then handed in by mr dodson and a pair of pattens by mr fogg each of whom had prepared a most sympathising and melancholy face for the occasion mrs sanders then appeared leading in master bardell at sight of her child mrs bardell started suddenly recollecting herself she kissed him in a frantic manner then relapsing into a state of hysterical imbecility the good lady requested to be informed where she was in reply to this mrs cluppins and mrs sanders turned their heads away and wept while messrs dodson and fogg entreated the plaintiff to compose herself serjeant buzfuz rubbed his eyes very hard with a large white handkerchief and gave an appealing look towards the jury while the judge was visibly affected and several of the beholders tried to cough down their emotions very good notion that indeed whispered perker to mr pickwick capital fellows those dodson and fogg excellent ideas of effect my dear sir excellent as perker spoke mrs bardell began to recover by slow degrees while mrs cluppins after a careful survey of master bardell's buttons and the button holes to which they severally belonged placed him on the floor of the court in front of his mother a commanding position in which he could not fail to awaken the full commiseration and sympathy of both judge and jury this was not done without considerable opposition and many tears on the part of the young gentleman himself who had certain inward misgivings that the placing him within the full glare of the judge's eye was only a formal prelude to his being immediately ordered away for instant execution or for transportation beyond the seas during the whole term of his natural life at the very least bardell and pickwick cried the gentleman in black calling on the case which stood first on the list i am for the plaintiff my lord said mr serjeant buzfuz who is with you brother buzfuz said the judge mr skimpin bowed to intimate that he was i appear for the defendant my lord said mr serjeant snubbin anybody with you brother snubbin inquired the court mr phunky my lord replied serjeant snubbin serjeant buzfuz and mr skimpin for the plaintiff said the judge writing down the names in his note book and reading as he wrote for the defendant serjeant snubbin and mr monkey beg your lordship's pardon phunky oh very good said the judge i never had the pleasure of hearing the gentleman's name before here mr phunky bowed and smiled and the judge bowed and smiled too and then mr phunky blushing into the very whites of his eyes tried to look as if he didn't know that everybody was gazing at him a thing which no man ever succeeded in doing yet or in all reasonable probability ever will go on said the judge the ushers again called silence and mr skimpin proceeded to open the case and the case appeared to have very little inside it when he had opened it for he kept such particulars as he knew completely to himself and sat down after a lapse of three minutes leaving the jury in precisely the same advanced stage of wisdom as they were in before serjeant buzfuz then rose with all the majesty and dignity which the grave nature of the proceedings demanded and having whispered to dodson and conferred briefly with fogg pulled his gown over his shoulders settled his wig and addressed the jury serjeant buzfuz began by saying that never in the whole course of his professional experience never from the very first moment of his applying himself to the study and practice of the law had he approached a case with feelings of such deep emotion or with such a heavy sense of the responsibility imposed upon him a responsibility he would say which he could never have supported were he not buoyed up and sustained by a conviction so strong that it amounted to positive certainty that the cause of truth and justice or in other words the cause of his much injured and most oppressed client must prevail with the high minded and intelligent dozen of men whom he now saw in that box before him counsel usually begin in this way because it puts the jury on the very best terms with themselves and makes them think what sharp fellows they must be a visible effect was produced immediately several jurymen beginning to take voluminous notes with the utmost eagerness you have heard from my learned friend gentlemen continued serjeant buzfuz well knowing that from the learned friend alluded to the gentlemen of the jury had heard just nothing at all you have heard from my learned friend gentlemen that this is an action for a breach of promise of marriage in which the damages are laid at but you have not heard from my learned friend inasmuch as it did not come within my learned friend's province to tell you what are the facts and circumstances of the case those facts and circumstances gentlemen you shall hear detailed by me and proved by the unimpeachable female whom i will place in that box before you here mr serjeant buzfuz with a tremendous emphasis on the word box smote his table with a mighty sound and glanced at dodson and fogg who nodded admiration of the serjeant and indignant defiance of the defendant the plaintiff gentlemen continued serjeant buzfuz in a soft and melancholy voice the plaintiff is a widow yes gentlemen a widow the late mr bardell after enjoying for many years the esteem and confidence of his sovereign as one of the guardians of his royal revenues glided almost imperceptibly from the world to seek elsewhere for that repose and peace which a custom house can never afford at this pathetic description of the decease of mr bardell who had been knocked on the head with a quart pot in a public house cellar the learned serjeant's voice faltered and he proceeded with emotion some time before his death he had stamped his likeness upon a little boy with this little boy the only pledge of her departed exciseman mrs bardell shrunk from the world and courted the retirement and tranquillity of goswell street and here she placed in her front parlour window a written placard bearing this inscription 'apartments furnished for a single gentleman inquire within' here serjeant buzfuz paused while several gentlemen of the jury took a note of the document there is no date to that is there sir inquired a juror there is no date gentlemen replied serjeant buzfuz but i am instructed to say that it was put in the plaintiff's parlour window just this time three years i entreat the attention of the jury to the wording of this document 'apartments furnished for a single gentleman' mrs bardell's opinions of the opposite sex gentlemen were derived from a long contemplation of the inestimable qualities of her lost husband she had no fear she had no distrust she had no suspicion all was confidence and reliance 'mr bardell' said the widow 'mr bardell was a man of honour mr bardell was a man of his word mr bardell was no deceiver mr bardell was once a single gentleman himself to single gentlemen i look for protection for assistance for comfort and for consolation in single gentlemen i shall perpetually see something to remind me of what mr bardell was when he first won my young and untried affections to a single gentleman then shall my lodgings be let' actuated by this beautiful and touching impulse among the best impulses of our imperfect nature gentlemen the lonely and desolate widow dried her tears furnished the first floor caught the innocent boy to her maternal bosom and put the bill up in her parlour window did it remain there long no the serpent was on the watch the train was laid the mine was preparing the sapper and miner was at work before the bill had been in the parlour window three days three days gentlemen a being erect upon two legs and bearing all the outward semblance of a man and not of a monster knocked at the door of mrs bardell's house he inquired within he took the lodgings and on the very next day he entered into possession of them this man was pickwick pickwick the defendant serjeant buzfuz who had proceeded with such volubility that his face was perfectly crimson here paused for breath the silence awoke mr justice stareleigh who immediately wrote down something with a pen without any ink in it and looked unusually profound to impress the jury with the belief that he always thought most deeply with his eyes shut serjeant buzfuz proceeded of this man pickwick i will say little the subject presents but few attractions and i gentlemen am not the man nor are you gentlemen the men to delight in the contemplation of revolting heartlessness and of systematic villainy here mr pickwick who had been writhing in silence for some time gave a violent start as if some vague idea of assaulting serjeant buzfuz in the august presence of justice and law suggested itself to his mind an admonitory gesture from perker restrained him and he listened to the learned gentleman's continuation with a look of indignation which contrasted forcibly with the admiring faces of mrs cluppins and mrs sanders i say systematic villainy gentlemen said serjeant buzfuz looking through mr pickwick and talking at him and when i say systematic villainy let me tell the defendant pickwick if he be in court as i am informed he is that it would have been more decent in him more becoming in better judgment and in better taste if he had stopped away let me tell him gentlemen that any gestures of dissent or disapprobation in which he may indulge in this court will not go down with you that you will know how to value and how to appreciate them and let me tell him further as my lord will tell you gentlemen that a counsel in the discharge of his duty to his client is neither to be intimidated nor bullied nor put down and that any attempt to do either the one or the other or the first or the last will recoil on the head of the attempter be he plaintiff or be he defendant be his name pickwick or noakes or stoakes or stiles or brown or thompson this little divergence from the subject in hand had of course the intended effect of turning all eyes to mr pickwick serjeant buzfuz having partially recovered from the state of moral elevation into which he had lashed himself resumed i shall show you gentlemen that for two years pickwick continued to reside constantly and without interruption or intermission at mrs bardell's house i shall show you that mrs bardell during the whole of that time waited on him attended to his comforts cooked his meals looked out his linen for the washerwoman when it went abroad darned aired and prepared it for wear when it came home and in short enjoyed his fullest trust and confidence i shall show you that on many occasions he gave halfpence and on some occasions even sixpences to her little boy and i shall prove to you by a witness whose testimony it will be impossible for my learned friend to weaken or controvert that on one occasion he patted the boy on the head and after inquiring whether he had won alley tors or commoneys lately both of which i understand to be a particular species of marbles much prized by the youth of this town made use of this remarkable expression 'how should you like to have another father' i shall prove to you gentlemen that about a year ago pickwick suddenly began to absent himself from home during long intervals as if with the intention of gradually breaking off from my client but i shall show you also that his resolution was not at that time sufficiently strong or that his better feelings conquered if better feelings he has or that the charms and accomplishments of my client prevailed against his unmanly intentions by proving to you that on one occasion when he returned from the country he distinctly and in terms offered her marriage previously however taking special care that there should be no witness to their solemn contract and i am in a situation to prove to you on the testimony of three of his own friends most unwilling witnesses gentlemen most unwilling witnesses that on that morning he was discovered by them holding the plaintiff in his arms and soothing her agitation by his caresses and endearments a visible impression was produced upon the auditors by this part of the learned serjeant's address drawing forth two very small scraps of paper he proceeded and now gentlemen but one word more two letters have passed between these parties letters which are admitted to be in the handwriting of the defendant and which speak volumes indeed these letters too bespeak the character of the man they are not open fervent eloquent epistles breathing nothing but the language of affectionate attachment they are covert sly underhanded communications but fortunately far more conclusive than if couched in the most glowing language and the most poetic imagery letters that must be viewed with a cautious and suspicious eye letters that were evidently intended at the time by pickwick to mislead and delude any third parties into whose hands they might fall let me read the first 'garraway's twelve o'clock dear mrs b chops and tomato sauce yours pickwick' gentlemen what does this mean 'chops and tomato sauce yours pickwick' chops gracious heavens and tomato sauce gentlemen is the happiness of a sensitive and confiding female to be trifled away by such shallow artifices as these the next has no date whatever which is in itself suspicious 'dear mrs b i shall not be at home till to morrow slow coach' and then follows this very remarkable expression 'don't trouble yourself about the warming pan' the warming pan why gentlemen who does trouble himself about a warming pan when was the peace of mind of man or woman broken or disturbed by a warming pan which is in itself a harmless a useful and i will add gentlemen a comforting article of domestic furniture why is mrs bardell so earnestly entreated not to agitate herself about this warming pan unless as is no doubt the case it is a mere cover for hidden fire a mere substitute for some endearing word of promise agreeably to a preconcerted system of correspondence artfully contrived by pickwick with a view to his contemplated desertion and which i am not in a condition to explain and what does this allusion to the slow coach mean for aught i know it may be a reference to pickwick himself who has most unquestionably been a criminally slow coach during the whole of this transaction but whose speed will now be very unexpectedly accelerated and whose wheels gentlemen as he will find to his cost will very soon be greased by you mr serjeant buzfuz paused in this place to see whether the jury smiled at his joke but as nobody took it but the greengrocer whose sensitiveness on the subject was very probably occasioned by his having subjected a chaise cart to the process in question on that identical morning the learned serjeant considered it advisable to undergo a slight relapse into the dismals before he concluded but enough of this gentlemen said mr serjeant buzfuz it is difficult to smile with an aching heart it is ill jesting when our deepest sympathies are awakened my client's hopes and prospects are ruined and it is no figure of speech to say that her occupation is gone indeed the bill is down but there is no tenant eligible single gentlemen pass and repass but there is no invitation for them to inquire within or without all is gloom and silence in the house even the voice of the child is hushed his infant sports are disregarded when his mother weeps his 'alley tors' and his 'commoneys' are alike neglected he forgets the long familiar cry of 'knuckle down' and at tip cheese or odd and even his hand is out but pickwick gentlemen pickwick the ruthless destroyer of this domestic oasis in the desert of goswell street pickwick who has choked up the well and thrown ashes on the sward pickwick who comes before you to day with his heartless tomato sauce and warming pans pickwick still rears his head with unblushing effrontery and gazes without a sigh on the ruin he has made damages gentlemen heavy damages is the only punishment with which you can visit him the only recompense you can award to my client and for those damages she now appeals to an enlightened a high minded a right feeling a conscientious a dispassionate a sympathising a contemplative jury of her civilised countrymen with this beautiful peroration mr serjeant buzfuz sat down and mr justice stareleigh woke up call elizabeth cluppins said serjeant buzfuz rising a minute afterwards with renewed vigour the nearest usher called for elizabeth tuppins another one at a little distance off demanded elizabeth jupkins and a third rushed in a breathless state into king street and screamed for elizabeth muffins till he was hoarse meanwhile mrs cluppins with the combined assistance of mrs bardell mrs sanders mr dodson and mr fogg was hoisted into the witness box and when she was safely perched on the top step mrs bardell stood on the bottom one with the pocket handkerchief and pattens in one hand and a glass bottle that might hold about a quarter of a pint of smelling salts in the other ready for any emergency mrs sanders whose eyes were intently fixed on the judge's face planted herself close by with the large umbrella keeping her right thumb pressed on the spring with an earnest countenance as if she were fully prepared to put it up at a moment's notice mrs cluppins said serjeant buzfuz pray compose yourself ma'am of course directly mrs cluppins was desired to compose herself she sobbed with increased vehemence and gave divers alarming manifestations of an approaching fainting fit or as she afterwards said of her feelings being too many for her do you recollect mrs cluppins said serjeant buzfuz after a few unimportant questions do you recollect being in mrs bardell's back one pair of stairs on one particular morning in july last when she was dusting pickwick's apartment yes my lord and jury i do replied mrs cluppins mr pickwick's sitting room was the first floor front i believe yes it were sir replied mrs cluppins what were you doing in the back room ma'am inquired the little judge my lord and jury said mrs cluppins with interesting agitation i will not deceive you you had better not ma'am said the little judge i was there resumed mrs cluppins unbeknown to mrs bardell i had been out with a little basket gentlemen to buy three pound of red kidney purtaties which was three pound tuppense ha'penny when i see mrs bardell's street door on the jar on the what exclaimed the little judge partly open my lord said serjeant snubbin she said on the jar said the little judge with a cunning look it's all the same my lord said serjeant snubbin the little judge looked doubtful and said he'd make a note of it mrs cluppins then resumed i walked in gentlemen just to say good mornin' and went in a permiscuous manner up stairs and into the back room gentlemen there was the sound of voices in the front room and and you listened i believe mrs cluppins said serjeant buzfuz beggin' your pardon sir replied mrs cluppins in a majestic manner i would scorn the haction the voices was very loud sir and forced themselves upon my ear well mrs cluppins you were not listening but you heard the voices was one of these voices pickwick's yes it were sir and mrs cluppins after distinctly stating that mr pickwick addressed himself to mrs bardell repeated by slow degrees and by dint of many questions the conversation with which our readers are already acquainted the jury looked suspicious and mr serjeant buzfuz smiled and sat down they looked positively awful when serjeant snubbin intimated that he should not cross examine the witness for mr pickwick wished it to be distinctly stated that it was due to her to say that her account was in substance correct mrs cluppins having once broken the ice thought it a favourable opportunity for entering into a short dissertation on her own domestic affairs so she straightway proceeded to inform the court that she was the mother of eight children at that present speaking and that she entertained confident expectations of presenting mr cluppins with a ninth somewhere about that day six months at this interesting point the little judge interposed most irascibly and the effect of the interposition was that both the worthy lady and mrs sanders were politely taken out of court under the escort of mr jackson without further parley nathaniel winkle said mr skimpin here replied a feeble voice mr winkle entered the witness box and having been duly sworn bowed to the judge with considerable deference don't look at me sir said the judge sharply in acknowledgment of the salute look at the jury mr winkle obeyed the mandate and looked at the place where he thought it most probable the jury might be for seeing anything in his then state of intellectual complication was wholly out of the question mr winkle was then examined by mr skimpin who being a promising young man of two or three and forty was of course anxious to confuse a witness who was notoriously predisposed in favour of the other side as much as he could now sir said mr skimpin have the goodness to let his lordship and the jury know what your name is will you and mr skimpin inclined his head on one side to listen with great sharpness to the answer and glanced at the jury meanwhile as if to imply that he rather expected mr winkle's natural taste for perjury would induce him to give some name which did not belong to him winkle replied the witness what's your christian name sir angrily inquired the little judge nathaniel sir daniel any other name nathaniel sir my lord i mean nathaniel daniel or daniel nathaniel no my lord only nathaniel not daniel at all what did you tell me it was daniel for then sir inquired the judge i didn't my lord replied mr winkle you did sir replied the judge with a severe frown how could i have got daniel on my notes unless you told me so sir this argument was of course unanswerable mr winkle has rather a short memory my lord interposed mr skimpin with another glance at the jury we shall find means to refresh it before we have quite done with him i dare say you had better be careful sir said the little judge with a sinister look at the witness poor mr winkle bowed and endeavoured to feign an easiness of manner which in his then state of confusion gave him rather the air of a disconcerted pickpocket now mr winkle said mr skimpin attend to me if you please sir and let me recommend you for your own sake to bear in mind his lordship's injunction to be careful i believe you are a particular friend of pickwick the defendant are you not i have known mr pickwick now as well as i recollect at this moment nearly pray mr winkle do not evade the question are you or are you not a particular friend of the defendant's i was just about to say that will you or will you not answer my question sir if you don't answer the question you'll be committed sir interposed the little judge looking over his note book come sir said mr skimpin yes or no if you please yes i am replied mr winkle yes you are and why couldn't you say that at once sir perhaps you know the plaintiff too eh mr winkle i don't know her i've seen her oh you don't know her but you've seen her now have the goodness to tell the gentlemen of the jury what you mean by that mr winkle i mean that i am not intimate with her but i have seen her when i went to call on mr pickwick in goswell street how often have you seen her sir how often yes mr winkle how often i'll repeat the question for you a dozen times if you require it sir and the learned gentleman with a firm and steady frown placed his hands on his hips and smiled suspiciously at the jury on this question there arose the edifying brow beating customary on such points first of all mr winkle said it was quite impossible for him to say how many times he had seen mrs bardell then he was asked if he had seen her twenty times to which he replied certainly more than that then he was asked whether he hadn't seen her a hundred times whether he couldn't swear that he had seen her more than fifty times whether he didn't know that he had seen her at least seventy five times and so forth the satisfactory conclusion which was arrived at at last being that he had better take care of himself and mind what he was about the witness having been by these means reduced to the requisite ebb of nervous perplexity the examination was continued as follows pray mr winkle do you remember calling on the defendant pickwick at these apartments in the plaintiff's house in goswell street on one particular morning in the month of july last yes i do were you accompanied on that occasion by a friend of the name of tupman and another of the name of snodgrass yes i was are they here yes they are replied mr winkle looking very earnestly towards the spot where his friends were stationed pray attend to me mr winkle and never mind your friends said mr skimpin with another expressive look at the jury they must tell their stories without any previous consultation with you if none has yet taken place another look at the jury now sir tell the gentlemen of the jury what you saw on entering the defendant's room on this particular morning come out with it sir we must have it sooner or later the defendant mr pickwick was holding the plaintiff in his arms with his hands clasping her waist replied mr winkle with natural hesitation and the plaintiff appeared to have fainted away did you hear the defendant say anything i heard him call mrs bardell a good creature and i heard him ask her to compose herself for what a situation it was if anybody should come or words to that effect now mr winkle i have only one more question to ask you and i beg you to bear in mind his lordship's caution will you undertake to swear that pickwick the defendant did not say on the occasion in question 'my dear mrs bardell you're a good creature compose yourself to this situation for to this situation you must come' or words to that effect i didn't understand him so certainly said mr winkle astounded at this ingenious dove tailing of the few words he had heard i was on the staircase and couldn't hear distinctly the impression on my mind is the gentlemen of the jury want none of the impressions on your mind mr winkle which i fear would be of little service to honest straightforward men interposed mr skimpin you were on the staircase and didn't distinctly hear but you will not swear that mr pickwick did not make use of the expressions i have quoted do i understand that no i will not replied mr winkle and down sat mr skimpin with a triumphant countenance mr pickwick's case had not gone off in so particularly happy a manner up to this point that it could very well afford to have any additional suspicion cast upon it but as it could afford to be placed in a rather better light if possible mr phunky rose for the purpose of getting something important out of mr winkle in cross examination whether he did get anything important out of him will immediately appear i believe mr winkle said mr phunky that mr pickwick is not a young man oh no replied mr winkle old enough to be my father you have told my learned friend that you have known mr pickwick a long time had you ever any reason to suppose or believe that he was about to be married oh no certainly not replied mr winkle with so much eagerness that mr phunky ought to have got him out of the box with all possible despatch lawyers hold that there are two kinds of particularly bad witnesses a reluctant witness and a too willing witness it was mr winkle's fate to figure in both characters i will even go further than this mr winkle continued mr phunky in a most smooth and complacent manner did you ever see anything in mr pickwick's manner and conduct towards the opposite sex to induce you to believe that he ever contemplated matrimony of late years in any case oh no certainly not replied mr winkle has his behaviour when females have been in the case always been that of a man who having attained a pretty advanced period of life content with his own occupations and amusements treats them only as a father might his daughters not the least doubt of it replied mr winkle in the fulness of his heart that is yes oh yes certainly you have never known anything in his behaviour towards mrs bardell or any other female in the least degree suspicious said mr phunky preparing to sit down for serjeant snubbin was winking at him n n no replied mr winkle except on one trifling occasion which i have no doubt might be easily explained now if the unfortunate mr phunky had sat down when serjeant snubbin winked at him or if serjeant buzfuz had stopped this irregular cross examination at the outset which he knew better than to do observing mr winkle's anxiety and well knowing it would in all probability lead to something serviceable to him this unfortunate admission would not have been elicited the moment the words fell from mr winkle's lips mr phunky sat down and serjeant snubbin rather hastily told him he might leave the box which mr winkle prepared to do with great readiness when serjeant buzfuz stopped him stay mr winkle stay said serjeant buzfuz will your lordship have the goodness to ask him what this one instance of suspicious behaviour towards females on the part of this gentleman who is old enough to be his father was you hear what the learned counsel says sir observed the judge turning to the miserable and agonised mr winkle describe the occasion to which you refer my lord said mr winkle trembling with anxiety i i'd rather not perhaps so said the little judge but you must amid the profound silence of the whole court mr winkle faltered out that the trifling circumstance of suspicion was mr pickwick's being found in a lady's sleeping apartment at midnight which had terminated he believed in the breaking off of the projected marriage of the lady in question and had led he knew to the whole party being forcibly carried before george nupkins esq magistrate and justice of the peace for the borough of ipswich you may leave the box sir said serjeant snubbin mr winkle did leave the box and rushed with delirious haste to the george and vulture where he was discovered some hours afterwards by the waiter groaning in a hollow and dismal manner with his head buried beneath the sofa cushions tracy tupman and augustus snodgrass were severally called into the box both corroborated the testimony of their unhappy friend and each was driven to the verge of desperation by excessive badgering susannah sanders was then called and examined by serjeant buzfuz and cross examined by serjeant snubbin had always said and believed that pickwick would marry mrs bardell knew that mrs bardell's being engaged to pickwick was the current topic of conversation in the neighbourhood after the fainting in july had been told it herself by mrs mudberry which kept a mangle and mrs bunkin which clear starched but did not see either mrs mudberry or mrs bunkin in court had heard pickwick ask the little boy how he should like to have another father did not know that mrs bardell was at that time keeping company with the baker but did know that the baker was then a single man and is now married couldn't swear that mrs bardell was not very fond of the baker but should think that the baker was not very fond of mrs bardell or he wouldn't have married somebody else thought mrs bardell fainted away on the morning in july because pickwick asked her to name the day knew that she witness fainted away stone dead when mr sanders asked her to name the day and believed that everybody as called herself a lady would do the same under similar circumstances heard pickwick ask the boy the question about the marbles but upon her oath did not know the difference between an alley tor and a commoney by the court during the period of her keeping company with mr sanders had received love letters like other ladies in the course of their correspondence mr sanders had often called her a duck but never chops nor yet tomato sauce he was particularly fond of ducks perhaps if he had been as fond of chops and tomato sauce he might have called her that as a term of affection serjeant buzfuz now rose with more importance than he had yet exhibited if that were possible and vociferated call samuel weller it was quite unnecessary to call samuel weller for samuel weller stepped briskly into the box the instant his name was pronounced and placing his hat on the floor and his arms on the rail took a bird's eye view of the bar and a comprehensive survey of the bench with a remarkably cheerful and lively aspect what's your name sir inquired the judge sam weller my lord replied that gentleman do you spell it with a 'v' or a 'w' inquired the judge that depends upon the taste and fancy of the speller my lord replied sam i never had occasion to spell it more than once or twice in my life but i spells it with a 'v' here a voice in the gallery exclaimed aloud quite right too samivel quite right put it down a 'we' my lord put it down a 'we' who is that who dares to address the court said the little judge looking up usher yes my lord bring that person here instantly yes my lord but as the usher didn't find the person he didn't bring him and after a great commotion all the people who had got up to look for the culprit sat down again the little judge turned to the witness as soon as his indignation would allow him to speak and said do you know who that was sir i rayther suspect it was my father my lord replied sam do you see him here now said the judge no i don't my lord replied sam staring right up into the lantern in the roof of the court if you could have pointed him out i would have committed him instantly said the judge sam bowed his acknowledgments and turned with unimpaired cheerfulness of countenance towards serjeant buzfuz now mr weller said serjeant buzfuz now sir replied sam i believe you are in the service of mr pickwick the defendant in this case speak up if you please mr weller i mean to speak up sir replied sam i am in the service of that 'ere gen'l'm'n and a wery good service it is little to do and plenty to get i suppose said serjeant buzfuz with jocularity oh quite enough to get sir as the soldier said ven they ordered him three hundred and fifty lashes replied sam you must not tell us what the soldier or any other man said sir interposed the judge it's not evidence wery good my lord replied sam do you recollect anything particular happening on the morning when you were first engaged by the defendant eh mr weller said serjeant buzfuz yes i do sir replied sam have the goodness to tell the jury what it was i had a reg'lar new fit out o' clothes that mornin' gen'l'm'n of the jury said sam and that was a wery partickler and uncommon circumstance vith me in those days hereupon there was a general laugh and the little judge looking with an angry countenance over his desk said you had better be careful sir so mr pickwick said at the time my lord replied sam and i wos wery careful o' that 'ere suit o' clothes wery careful indeed my lord the judge looked sternly at sam for full two minutes but sam's features were so perfectly calm and serene that the judge said nothing and motioned serjeant buzfuz to proceed do you mean to tell me mr weller said serjeant buzfuz folding his arms emphatically and turning half round to the jury as if in mute assurance that he would bother the witness yet do you mean to tell me mr weller that you saw nothing of this fainting on the part of the plaintiff in the arms of the defendant which you have heard described by the witnesses certainly not replied sam i was in the passage till they called me up and then the old lady was not there now attend mr weller said serjeant buzfuz dipping a large pen into the inkstand before him for the purpose of frightening sam with a show of taking down his answer you were in the passage and yet saw nothing of what was going forward have you a pair of eyes mr weller yes i have a pair of eyes replied sam and that's just it if they wos a pair o' patent double million magnifyin' gas microscopes of hextra power p'raps i might be able to see through a flight o' stairs and a deal door but bein' only eyes you see my wision's limited at this answer which was delivered without the slightest appearance of irritation and with the most complete simplicity and equanimity of manner the spectators tittered the little judge smiled and serjeant buzfuz looked particularly foolish after a short consultation with dodson and fogg the learned serjeant again turned towards sam and said with a painful effort to conceal his vexation now mr weller i'll ask you a question on another point if you please if you please sir rejoined sam with the utmost good humour do you remember going up to mrs bardell's house one night in november last oh yes wery well oh you do remember that mr weller said serjeant buzfuz recovering his spirits i thought we should get something at last i rayther thought that too sir replied sam and at this the spectators tittered again well i suppose you went up to have a little talk about this trial eh mr weller said serjeant buzfuz looking knowingly at the jury i went up to pay the rent but we did get a talkin' about the trial replied sam oh you did get a talking about the trial said serjeant buzfuz brightening up with the anticipation of some important discovery now what passed about the trial will you have the goodness to tell us mr weller vith all the pleasure in life sir replied sam arter a few unimportant obserwations from the two virtuous females as has been examined here to day the ladies gets into a wery great state o' admiration at the honourable conduct of mr dodson and fogg them two gen'l'm'n as is settin' near you now this of course drew general attention to dodson and fogg who looked as virtuous as possible the attorneys for the plaintiff said mr serjeant buzfuz well they spoke in high praise of the honourable conduct of messrs dodson and fogg the attorneys for the plaintiff did they yes said sam they said what a wery gen'rous thing it was o' them to have taken up the case on spec and to charge nothing at all for costs unless they got 'em out of mr pickwick at this very unexpected reply the spectators tittered again and dodson and fogg turning very red leant over to serjeant buzfuz and in a hurried manner whispered something in his ear you are quite right said serjeant buzfuz aloud with affected composure it's perfectly useless my lord attempting to get at any evidence through the impenetrable stupidity of this witness i will not trouble the court by asking him any more questions stand down sir would any other gen'l'm'n like to ask me anythin' inquired sam taking up his hat and looking round most deliberately not i mr weller thank you said serjeant snubbin laughing you may go down sir said serjeant buzfuz waving his hand impatiently sam went down accordingly after doing messrs dodson and fogg's case as much harm as he conveniently could and saying just as little respecting mr pickwick as might be which was precisely the object he had had in view all along i have no objection to admit my lord said serjeant snubbin if it will save the examination of another witness that mr pickwick has retired from business and is a gentleman of considerable independent property very well said serjeant buzfuz putting in the two letters to be read then that's my case my lord serjeant snubbin then addressed the jury on behalf of the defendant and a very long and a very emphatic address he delivered in which he bestowed the highest possible eulogiums on the conduct and character of mr pickwick but inasmuch as our readers are far better able to form a correct estimate of that gentleman's merits and deserts than serjeant snubbin could possibly be we do not feel called upon to enter at any length into the learned gentleman's observations he attempted to show that the letters which had been exhibited merely related to mr pickwick's dinner or to the preparations for receiving him in his apartments on his return from some country excursion it is sufficient to add in general terms that he did the best he could for mr pickwick and the best as everybody knows on the infallible authority of the old adage could do no more mr justice stareleigh summed up in the old established and most approved form he read as much of his notes to the jury as he could decipher on so short a notice and made running comments on the evidence as he went along if mrs bardell were right it was perfectly clear that mr pickwick was wrong and if they thought the evidence of mrs cluppins worthy of credence they would believe it and if they didn't why they wouldn't if they were satisfied that a breach of promise of marriage had been committed they would find for the plaintiff with such damages as they thought proper and if on the other hand it appeared to them that no promise of marriage had ever been given they would find for the defendant with no damages at all the jury then retired to their private room to talk the matter over and the judge retired to his private room to refresh himself with a mutton chop and a glass of sherry an anxious quarter of an hour elapsed the jury came back the judge was fetched in mr pickwick put on his spectacles and gazed at the foreman with an agitated countenance and a quickly beating heart gentlemen said the individual in black are you all agreed upon your verdict we are replied the foreman do you find for the plaintiff gentlemen or for the defendant for the plaintiff with what damages gentlemen seven hundred and fifty pounds mr pickwick took off his spectacles carefully wiped the glasses folded them into their case and put them in his pocket then having drawn on his gloves with great nicety and stared at the foreman all the while he mechanically followed mr perker and the blue bag out of court they stopped in a side room while perker paid the court fees and here mr pickwick was joined by his friends here too he encountered messrs dodson and fogg rubbing their hands with every token of outward satisfaction well gentlemen said mr pickwick well sir said dodson for self and partner you imagine you'll get your costs don't you gentlemen said mr pickwick fogg said they thought it rather probable dodson smiled and said they'd try you may try and try and try again messrs dodson and fogg said mr pickwick vehemently but not one farthing of costs or damages do you ever get from me if i spend the rest of my existence in a debtor's prison ha ha laughed dodson you'll think better of that before next term mr pickwick he he he we'll soon see about that mr pickwick grinned fogg speechless with indignation mr pickwick allowed himself to be led by his solicitor and friends to the door and there assisted into a hackney coach which had been fetched for the purpose by the ever watchful sam weller sam had put up the steps and was preparing to jump upon the box when he felt himself gently touched on the shoulder and looking round his father stood before him the old gentleman's countenance wore a mournful expression as he shook his head gravely and said in warning accents i know'd what 'ud come o' this here mode o' doin' bisness oh sammy sammy vy worn't there a alleybi chapter vii illustration in which mr pickwick thinks he had better go to bath and goes accordingly but surely my dear sir said little perker as he stood in mr pickwick's apartment on the morning after the trial surely you don't really mean really and seriously now and irritation apart that you won't pay these costs and damages not one halfpenny said mr pickwick firmly not one halfpenny hooroar for the principle as the money lender said ven he vouldn't renew the bill observed mr weller who was clearing away the breakfast things sam said mr pickwick have the goodness to step down stairs cert'nly sir replied mr weller and acting on mr pickwick's gentle hint sam retired no perker said mr pickwick with great seriousness of manner my friends here have endeavoured to dissuade me from this determination but without avail i shall employ myself as usual until the opposite party have the power of issuing a legal process of execution against me and if they are vile enough to avail themselves of it and to arrest my person i shall yield myself up with perfect cheerfulness and content of heart when can they do this they can issue execution my dear sir for the amount of the damages and taxed costs next term replied perker just two months hence my dear sir very good said mr pickwick until that time my dear fellow let me hear no more of the matter and now continued mr pickwick looking round on his friends with a good humoured smile and a sparkle in the eye which no spectacles could dim or conceal the only question is where shall we go next mr tupman and mr snodgrass were too much affected by their friend's heroism to offer any reply mr winkle had not yet sufficiently recovered the recollection of his evidence at the trial to make any observations on any subject so mr pickwick paused in vain well said that gentleman if you leave me to suggest our destination i say bath i think none of us have ever been there nobody had and as the proposition was warmly seconded by perker who considered it extremely probable that if mr pickwick saw a little change and gaiety he would be inclined to think better of his determination and worse of a debtor's prison it was carried unanimously and sam was at once despatched to the white horse cellar to take five places by the half past seven o'clock coach next morning there were just two places to be had inside and just three to be had out so sam weller booked for them all and having exchanged a few compliments with the booking office clerk on the subject of a pewter half crown which was tendered him as a portion of his change walked back to the george and vulture where he was pretty busily employed until bed time in reducing clothes and linen into the smallest possible compass and exerting his mechanical genius in constructing a variety of ingenious devices for keeping the lids on boxes which had neither locks nor hinges the next was a very unpropitious morning for a journey muggy damp and drizzly the horses in the stages that were going out and had come through the city were smoking so that the outside passengers were invisible the newspaper sellers looked moist and smelt mouldy the wet ran off the hats of the orange vendors as they thrust their heads into the coach windows and diluted the insides in a refreshing manner the jews with the fifty bladed penknives shut them up in despair the men with the pocket books made pocket books of them watch guards and toasting forks were alike at a discount and pencil cases and sponges were a drug in the market leaving sam weller to rescue the luggage from the seven or eight porters who flung themselves savagely upon it the moment the coach stopped and finding that they were about twenty minutes too early mr pickwick and his friends went for shelter into the travellers' room the last resource of human dejection the travellers' room at the white horse cellar is of course uncomfortable it would be no travellers' room if it were not it is the right hand parlour into which an aspiring kitchen fire place appears to have walked accompanied by a rebellious poker tongs and shovel it is divided into boxes for the solitary confinement of travellers and is furnished with a clock a looking glass and a live waiter which latter article is kept in a small kennel for washing glasses in the corner of the apartment one of these boxes was occupied on this particular occasion by a stern eyed man of about five and forty who had a bald and glossy forehead with a good deal of black hair at the sides and back of his head and large black whiskers he was buttoned up to the chin in a brown coat and had a large sealskin travelling cap and a great coat and cloak lying on the seat beside him he looked up from his breakfast as mr pickwick entered with a fierce and peremptory air which was very dignified and having scrutinised that gentleman and his companions to his entire satisfaction hummed a tune in a manner which seemed to say that he rather suspected somebody wanted to take advantage of him but it wouldn't do waiter said the gentleman with the whiskers sir replied a man with a dirty complexion and a towel of the same emerging from the kennel before mentioned some more toast yes sir buttered toast mind said the gentleman fiercely d'rectly sir replied the waiter the gentleman with the whiskers hummed a tune in the same manner as before and pending the arrival of the toast advanced to the front of the fire and taking his coat tails under his arms looked at his boots and ruminated i wonder whereabouts in bath this coach puts up said mr pickwick mildly addressing mr winkle hum eh what's that said the strange man i made an observation to my friend sir replied mr pickwick always ready to enter into conversation i wondered at what house the bath coach put up perhaps you can inform me are you going to bath said the strange man i am sir replied mr pickwick and those other gentlemen they are going also said mr pickwick not inside i'll be damned if you're going inside said the strange man not all of us said mr pickwick no not all of you said the strange man emphatically i've taken two places if they try to squeeze six people into an infernal box that only holds four i'll take a post chaise and bring an action i've paid my fare it won't do i told the clerk when i took my places that it wouldn't do i know these things have been done i know they are done every day but i never was done and i never will be those who know me best best know it crush me here the fierce gentleman rang the bell with great violence and told the waiter he'd better bring the toast in five seconds or he'd know the reason why my good sir said mr pickwick you will allow me to observe that this is a very unnecessary display of excitement i have only taken places inside for two i am glad to hear it said the fierce man i withdraw my expressions i tender an apology there's my card give me your acquaintance with great pleasure sir replied mr pickwick we are to be fellow travellers and i hope shall find each other's society mutually agreeable i hope we shall said the fierce gentleman i know we shall i like your looks they please me gentlemen your hands and names know me of course an interchange of friendly salutations followed this gracious speech and the fierce gentleman immediately proceeded to inform the friends in the same short abrupt jerking sentences that his name was dowler that he was going to bath on pleasure that he was formerly in the army that he had now set up in business as a gentleman that he lived upon the profits and that the individual for whom the second place was taken was a personage no less illustrious than mrs dowler his lady wife she's a fine woman said mr dowler i am proud of her i have reason i hope i shall have the pleasure of judging said mr pickwick with a smile you shall replied dowler she shall know you she shall esteem you i courted her under singular circumstances i won her through a rash vow thus i saw her i loved her i proposed she refused me 'you love another' 'spare my blushes' 'i know him' 'you do' 'very good if he remains here i'll skin him' lord bless me exclaimed mr pickwick involuntarily did you skin the gentleman sir inquired mr winkle with a very pale face i wrote him a note i said it was a painful thing and so it was certainly interposed mr winkle i said i had pledged my word as a gentleman to skin him my character was at stake i had no alternative as an officer in his majesty's service i was bound to skin him i regretted the necessity but it must be done he was open to conviction he saw that the rules of the service were imperative he fled i married her here's the coach that's her head as mr dowler concluded he pointed to a stage which had just driven up from the open window of which a rather pretty face in a bright blue bonnet was looking among the crowd on the pavement most probably for the rash man himself mr dowler paid his bill and hurried out with his travelling cap coat and cloak and mr pickwick and his friends followed to secure their places mr tupman and mr snodgrass had seated themselves at the back part of the coach mr winkle had got inside and mr pickwick was preparing to follow him when sam weller came up to his master and whispering in his ear begged to speak to him with an air of the deepest mystery well sam said mr pickwick what's the matter now here's rayther a rum go sir replied sam what inquired mr pickwick this here sir rejoined sam i'm wery much afeerd sir that the properiator o' this here coach is a playin' some imperence vith us how is that sam said mr pickwick aren't the names down on the way bill the names is not only down on the vay bill sir replied sam but they've painted vun on 'em up on the door o' the coach as sam spoke he pointed to that part of the coach door on which the proprietor's name usually appears and there sure enough in gilt letters of a goodly size was the magic name of pickwick dear me exclaimed mr pickwick quite staggered by the coincidence what a very extraordinary thing yes but that ain't all said sam again directing his master's attention to the coach door not content vith writin' up pickwick they puts 'moses' afore it vich i call addin' insult to injury as the parrot said ven they not only took him from his native land but made him talk the english langwidge arterwards it's odd enough certainly sam said mr pickwick but if we stand talking here we shall lose our places wot ain't nothin' to be done in consequence sir exclaimed sam perfectly aghast at the coolness with which mr pickwick prepared to ensconce himself inside done said mr pickwick what should be done ain't nobody to be whopped for takin' this here liberty sir said mr weller who had expected that at least he would have been commissioned to challenge the guard and coachman to a pugilistic encounter on the spot certainly not replied mr pickwick eagerly not on any account jump up to your seat directly i'm wery much afeerd muttered sam to himself as he turned away that somethin' queer's come over the governor or he'd never ha' stood this so quiet i hope that 'ere trial hasn't broke his spirit but it looks bad wery bad mr weller shook his head gravely and it is worthy of remark as an illustration of the manner in which he took this circumstance to heart that he did not speak another word until the coach reached the kensington turnpike which was so long a time for him to remain taciturn that the fact may be considered wholly unprecedented nothing worthy of special mention occurred during the journey mr dowler related a variety of anecdotes all illustrative of his own personal prowess and desperation and appealed to mrs dowler in corroboration thereof when mrs dowler invariably brought in in the form of an appendix some remarkable fact or circumstance which mr dowler had forgotten or had perhaps through modesty omitted for the addenda in every instance went to show that mr dowler was even more wonderful a fellow than he made himself out to be mr pickwick and mr winkle listened with great admiration and at intervals conversed with mrs dowler who was a very agreeable and fascinating person so what between mr dowler's stories and mrs dowler's charms and mr pickwick's good humour and mr winkle's good listening the insides contrived to be very companionable all the way the outsides did as outsides always do they were very cheerful and talkative at the beginning of every stage and very dismal and sleepy in the middle and very bright and wakeful again towards the end there was one young gentleman in an india rubber cloak who smoked cigars all day and there was another young gentleman in a parody upon a great coat who lighted a good many and feeling obviously unsettled after the second whiff threw them away when he thought nobody was looking at him there was a third young man on the box who wished to be learned in cattle and an old one behind who was familiar with farming there was a constant succession of christian names in smock frocks and white coats who were invited to have a lift by the guard and who knew every horse and hostler on the road and off it and there was a dinner which would have been cheap at half a crown a mouth if any moderate number of mouths could have eaten it in the time and at seven o'clock pm mr pickwick and his friends and mr dowler and his wife respectively retired to their private sitting rooms at the white hart hotel opposite the great pump room bath where the waiters from their costume might be mistaken for westminster boys only they destroy the illusion by behaving themselves much better breakfast had scarcely been cleared away on the succeeding morning when a waiter brought in mr dowler's card with a request to be allowed permission to introduce a friend mr dowler at once followed up the delivery of the card by bringing himself and the friend also the friend was a charming young man of not much more than fifty dressed in a very bright blue coat with resplendent buttons black trousers and the thinnest possible pair of highly polished boots a gold eye glass was suspended from his neck by a short broad black ribbon a gold snuff box was lightly clasped in his left hand gold rings innumerable glittered on his fingers and a large diamond pin set in gold glistened in his shirt frill he had a gold watch and a gold curb chain with large gold seals and he carried a pliant ebony cane with a heavy gold top his linen was of the very whitest finest and stiffest his wig of the glossiest blackest and curliest his snuff was prince's mixture his scent bouquet du roi his features were contracted into a perpetual smile and his teeth were in such perfect order that it was difficult at a small distance to tell the real from the false mr pickwick said mr dowler my friend angelo cyrus bantam esquire mc bantam mr pickwick know each other welcome to ba ath sir this is indeed an acquisition most welcome to ba ath sir it is long very long mr pickwick since you drank the waters it appears an age mr pickwick re markable such were the expressions with which angelo cyrus bantam esquire mc took mr pickwick's hand retaining it in his meantime and shrugging up his shoulders with a constant succession of bows as if he really could not make up his mind to the trial of letting it go again it is a very long time since i drank the waters certainly replied mr pickwick for to the best of my knowledge i was never here before never in ba ath mr pickwick exclaimed the grand master letting the hand fall in astonishment never in ba ath he he mr pickwick you are a wag not bad not bad good good he he he re markable to my shame i must say that i am perfectly serious rejoined mr pickwick i really never was here before oh i see exclaimed the grand master looking extremely pleased yes yes good good better and better you are the gentleman of whom we have heard yes we know you mr pickwick we know you the reports of the trial in those confounded papers thought mr pickwick they have heard all about me you are the gentleman residing on clapham green resumed bantam who lost the use of his limbs from imprudently taking cold after port wine who could not be moved in consequence of acute suffering and who had the water from the king's bath bottled at one hundred and three degrees and sent by waggon to his bed room in town where he bathed sneezed and same day recovered very re markable mr pickwick acknowledged the compliment which the supposition implied but had the self denial to repudiate it notwithstanding and taking advantage of a moment's silence on the part of the mc begged to introduce his friends mr tupman mr winkle and mr snodgrass an introduction which overwhelmed the mc with delight and honour bantam said mr dowler mr pickwick and his friends are strangers they must put their names down where's the book the register of the distinguished visitors in ba ath will be at the pump room this morning at two o'clock replied the mc will you guide our friends to that splendid building and enable me to procure their autographs i will rejoined dowler this is a long call it's time to go i shall be here again in an hour come this is a ball night said the mc again taking mr pickwick's hand as he rose to go the ball nights in ba ath are moments snatched from paradise rendered bewitching by music beauty elegance fashion etiquette and and above all by the absence of tradespeople who are quite inconsistent with paradise and who have an amalgamation of themselves at the guildhall every fortnight which is to say the least remarkable good bye good bye and protesting all the way down stairs that he was most satisfied and most delighted and most overpowered and most flattered angelo cyrus bantam esquire mc stepped into a very elegant chariot that waited at the door and rattled off at the appointed hour mr pickwick and his friends escorted by dowler repaired to the assembly rooms and wrote their names down in a book an instance of condescension at which angelo bantam was even more overpowered than before tickets of admission to that evening's assembly were to have been prepared for the whole party but as they were not ready mr pickwick undertook despite all the protestations to the contrary of angelo bantam to send sam for them at four o'clock in the afternoon to the mc's house in queen square having taken a short walk through the city and arrived at the unanimous conclusion that park street was very much like the perpendicular streets a man sees in a dream which he cannot get up for the life of him they returned to the white hart and despatched sam on the errand to which his master had pledged him sam weller put on his hat in a very easy and graceful manner and thrusting his hands in his waistcoat pockets walked with great deliberation to queen square whistling as he went along several of the most popular airs of the day as arranged with entirely new movements for that noble instrument the organ either mouth or barrel arriving at the number in queen square to which he had been directed he left off whistling and gave a cheerful knock which was instantaneously answered by a powdered headed footman in gorgeous livery and of symmetrical stature is this here mr bantam's old feller inquired sam weller nothing abashed by the blaze of splendour which burst upon his sight in the person of the powdered headed footman with the gorgeous livery why young man was the haughty inquiry of the powdered headed footman 'cos if it is jist you step into him with that 'ere card and say mr veller's a waitin' will you said sam and saying it he very coolly walked into the hall and sat down the powdered headed footman slammed the door very hard and scowled very grandly but both the slam and the scowl were lost upon sam who was regarding a mahogany umbrella stand with every outward token of critical approval apparently his master's reception of the card had impressed the powdered headed footman in sam's favour for when he came back from delivering it he smiled in a friendly manner and said that the answer would be ready directly wery good said sam tell the old gen'l'm'n not to put himself in a perspiration no hurry six foot i've had my dinner you dine early sir said the powdered headed footman i find i gets on better at supper when i does replied sam have you been long in bath sir inquired the powdered headed footman i have not had the pleasure of hearing of you before i haven't created any wery surprisin' sensation here as yet rejoined sam for me and the other fashionables only come last night nice place sir said the powdered headed footman seems so observed sam pleasant society sir remarked the powdered headed footman very agreeable servants sir i should think they wos replied sam affable unaffected say nothing to nobody sort o' fellers oh very much so indeed sir said the powdered headed footman taking sam's remark as a high compliment very much so indeed do you do anything in this way sir inquired the tall footman producing a small snuff box with a fox's head on the top of it not without sneezing replied sam why it is difficult sir i confess said the tall footman it may be done by degrees sir coffee is the best practice i carried coffee sir for a long time it looks very like rappee sir here a sharp peal at the bell reduced the powdered headed footman to the ignominious necessity of putting the fox's head in his pocket and hastening with a humble countenance to mr bantam's study by the bye who ever knew a man who never read or wrote either who hadn't got some small back parlour which he would call a study there is the answer sir said the powdered headed footman i am afraid you'll find it inconveniently large don't mention it said sam taking a letter with a small enclosure it's just possible as exhausted nature may manage to surwive it i hope we shall meet again sir said the powdered headed footman rubbing his hands and following sam out to the door step you are wery obligin' sir replied sam now don't allow yourself to be fatigued beyond your powers there's a amiable bein' consider what you owe to society and don't let yourself be injured by too much work for the sake o' your feller creeturs keep yourself as quiet as you can only think what a loss you would be with these pathetic words sam weller departed a very singular young man that said the powdered headed footman looking after mr weller with a countenance which clearly showed he could make nothing of him sam said nothing at all he winked shook his head smiled winked again and with an expression of countenance which seemed to denote that he was greatly amused with something or other walked merrily away illustration do you do anything in this way sir inquired the tall footman at precisely twenty minutes before eight o'clock that night angelo cyrus bantam esq the master of the ceremonies emerged from his chariot at the door of the assembly rooms in the same wig the same teeth the same eye glass the same watch and seals the same rings the same shirt pin and the same cane the only observable alterations in his appearance were that he wore a brighter blue coat with a white silk lining black tights black silk stockings and pumps and a white waistcoat and was if possible just a thought more scented thus attired the master of the ceremonies in strict discharge of the important duties of his all important office planted himself in the rooms to receive the company bath being full the company and the sixpences for tea poured in in shoals in the ball room the long card room the octagonal card room the staircases and the passages the hum of many voices and the sound of many feet were perfectly bewildering dresses rustled feathers waved lights shone and jewels sparkled there was the music not of the quadrille band for it had not yet commenced but the music of soft tiny footsteps with now and then a clear merry laugh low and gentle but very pleasant to hear in a female voice whether in bath or elsewhere brilliant eyes lighted up with pleasurable expectation gleamed from every side and look where you would some exquisite form glided gracefully through the throng and was no sooner lost than it was replaced by another as dainty and bewitching in the tea room and hovering round the card tables were a vast number of queer old ladies and decrepit old gentlemen discussing all the small talk and scandal of the day with a relish and gusto which sufficiently bespoke the intensity of the pleasure they derived from the occupation mingled with these groups were three or four matchmaking mammas appearing to be wholly absorbed by the conversation in which they were taking part but failing not from time to time to cast an anxious sidelong glance upon their daughters who remembering the maternal injunction to make the best use of their youth had already commenced incipient flirtations in the mislaying of scarves putting on gloves setting down cups and so forth slight matters apparently but which may be turned to surprisingly good account by expert practitioners lounging near the doors and in remote corners were various knots of silly young men displaying various varieties of puppyism and stupidity amusing all sensible people near them with their folly and conceit and happily thinking themselves the objects of general admiration a wise and merciful dispensation which no good man will quarrel with and lastly seated on some of the back benches where they had already taken up their positions for the evening were divers unmarried ladies past their grand climacteric who not dancing because there were no partners for them and not playing cards lest they should be set down as irretrievably single were in the favourable situation of being able to abuse everybody without reflecting on themselves in short they could abuse everybody because everybody was there it was a scene of gaiety glitter and show of richly dressed people handsome mirrors chalked floors girandoles and wax candles and in all parts of the scene gliding from spot to spot in silent softness bowing obsequiously to this party nodding familiarly to that and smiling complacently on all was the sprucely attired person of angelo cyrus bantam esquire master of the ceremonies stop in the tea room take your sixpenn'orth they lay on hot water and call it tea drink it said mr dowler in a loud voice directing mr pickwick who advanced at the head of the little party with mrs dowler on his arm into the tea room mr pickwick turned and catching sight of him mr bantam cork screwed his way through the crowd and welcomed him with ecstasy my dear sir i am highly honoured ba ath is favoured mrs dowler you embellish the rooms i congratulate you on your feathers re markable anybody here inquired dowler suspiciously anybody the lite of ba ath mr pickwick do you see the lady in the gauze turban the fat old lady inquired mr pickwick innocently hush my dear sir nobody's fat or old in ba ath that's the dowager lady snuphanuph is it indeed said mr pickwick no less a person i assure you said the master of the ceremonies hush draw a little nearer mr pickwick you see the splendidly dressed young man coming this way the one with the long hair and the particularly small forehead inquired mr pickwick the same the richest young man in ba ath at this moment young lord mutanhed you don't say so said mr pickwick yes you'll hear his voice in a moment mr pickwick he'll speak to me the other gentleman with him in the red under waistcoat and dark moustache is the honourable mr crushton his bosom friend how do you do my lord veway hot bantam said his lordship it is very warm my lord replied the mc confounded assented the honourable mr crushton have you seen his lordship's mail cart bantam inquired the honourable mr crushton after a short pause during which young lord mutanhed had been endeavouring to stare mr pickwick out of countenance and mr crushton had been reflecting what subject his lordship could talk about best dear me no replied the mc a mail cart what an excellent idea re markable gwacious heavens said his lordship i thought evewebody had seen the new mail cart it's the neatest pwettiest gwacefullest thing that ever wan upon wheels painted wed with a cweam piebald with a real box for the letters and all complete said the honourable mr crushton and a little seat in fwont with an iwon wail for the dwiver added his lordship i dwove it over to bristol the other morning in a cwimson coat with two servants widing a quarter of a mile behind and confound me if the people didn't wush out of their cottages and awest my pwogwess to know if i wasn't the post glorwious glorwious at this anecdote his lordship laughed very heartily as did the listeners of course then drawing his arm through that of the obsequious mr crushton lord mutanhed walked away delightful young man his lordship said the master of the ceremonies so i should think rejoined mr pickwick drily the dancing having commenced the necessary introductions having been made and all preliminaries arranged angelo bantam rejoined mr pickwick and led him into the card room just at the very moment of their entrance the dowager lady snuphanuph and two other ladies of an ancient and whist like appearance were hovering over an unoccupied card table and they no sooner set eyes upon mr pickwick under the convoy of angelo bantam than they exchanged glances with each other seeing that he was precisely the very person they wanted to make up the rubber my dear bantam said the dowager lady snuphanuph coaxingly find us some nice creature to make up this table there's a good soul mr pickwick happened to be looking another way at the moment so her ladyship nodded her head towards him and frowned expressively my friend mr pickwick my lady will be most happy i am sure re markably so said the mc taking the hint mr pickwick lady snuphanuph mrs colonel wugsby miss bolo mr pickwick bowed to each of the ladies and finding escape impossible cut mr pickwick and miss bolo against lady snuphanuph and mrs colonel wugsby as the trump card was turned up at the commencement of the second deal two young ladies hurried into the room and took their stations on either side of mrs colonel wugsby's chair where they waited patiently until the hand was over now jane said mrs colonel wugsby turning to one of the girls what is it i came to ask ma whether i might dance with the youngest mr crawley whispered the prettier and younger of the two good god jane how can you think of such things replied the mamma indignantly haven't you repeatedly heard that his father has eight hundred a year which dies with him i am ashamed of you not on any account ma whispered the other who was much older than her sister and very insipid and artificial lord mutanhed has been introduced to me i said i thought i wasn't engaged ma you're a sweet pet my love replied mrs colonel wugsby tapping her daughter's cheek with her fan and are always to be trusted he's immensely rich my dear bless you with these words mrs colonel wugsby kissed her eldest daughter most affectionately and frowning in a warning manner upon the other sorted her cards poor mr pickwick he had never played with three thorough paced female card players before they were so desperately sharp that they quite frightened him if he played a wrong card miss bolo looked a small armoury of daggers if he stopped to consider which was the right one lady snuphanuph would throw herself back in her chair and smile with a mingled glance of impatience and pity to mrs colonel wugsby at which mrs colonel wugsby would shrug up her shoulders and cough as much as to say she wondered whether he ever would begin then at the end of every hand miss bolo would inquire with a dismal countenance and reproachful sigh why mr pickwick had not returned that diamond or led the club or roughed the spade or finessed the heart or led through the honour or brought out the ace or played up to the king or some such thing and in reply to all these grave charges mr pickwick would be wholly unable to plead any justification whatever having by this time forgotten all about the game people came and looked on too which made mr pickwick nervous besides all this there was a great deal of distracting conversation near the table between angelo bantam and the two miss matinters who being single and singular paid great court to the master of the ceremonies in the hope of getting a stray partner now and then all these things combined with the noises and interruptions of constant comings in and goings out made mr pickwick play rather badly the cards were against him also and when they left off at ten minutes past eleven miss bolo rose from the table considerably agitated and went straight home in a flood of tears and a sedan chair being joined by his friends who one and all protested that they had scarcely ever spent a more pleasant evening mr pickwick accompanied them to the white hart and having soothed his feelings with something hot went to bed and to sleep almost simultaneously chapter viii illustration the chief features of which will be found to be an authentic version of the legend of prince bladud and a most extraordinary calamity that befell mr winkle as mr pickwick contemplated a stay of at least two months in bath he deemed it advisable to take private lodgings for himself and friends for that period and as a favourable opportunity offered for their securing on moderate terms the upper portion of a house in the royal crescent which was larger than they required mr and mrs dowler offered to relieve them of a bedroom and sitting room this proposition was at once accepted and in three days' time they were all located in their new abode when mr pickwick began to drink the waters with the utmost assiduity mr pickwick took them systematically he drank a quarter of a pint before breakfast and then walked up a hill and another quarter of a pint after breakfast and then walked down a hill and after every fresh quarter of a pint mr pickwick declared in the most solemn and emphatic terms that he felt a great deal better whereat his friends were very much delighted though they had not been previously aware that there was anything the matter with him the great pump room is a spacious saloon ornamented with corinthian pillars and a music gallery and a tompion clock and a statue of nash and a golden inscription to which all the water drinkers should attend for it appeals to them in the cause of a deserving charity there is a large bar with a marble vase out of which the pumper gets the water and there are a number of yellow looking tumblers out of which the company get it and it is a most edifying and satisfactory sight to behold the perseverance and gravity with which they swallow it there are baths near at hand in which a part of the company wash themselves and a band plays afterwards to congratulate the remainder on their having done so there is another pump room into which infirm ladies and gentlemen are wheeled in such an astonishing variety of chairs and chaises that any adventurous individual who goes in with the regular number of toes is in imminent danger of coming out without them and there is a third into which the quiet people go for it is less noisy than either there is an immensity of promenading on crutches and off with sticks and without and a great deal of conversation and liveliness and pleasantry every morning the regular water drinkers mr pickwick among the number met each other in the pump room took their quarter of a pint and walked constitutionally at the afternoon's promenade lord mutanhed and the honourable mr crushton the dowager lady snuphanuph mrs colonel wugsby and all the great people and all the morning water drinkers met in grand assemblage after this they walked out or drove out or were pushed out in bath chairs and met one another again after this the gentlemen went to the reading rooms and met divisions of the mass after this they went home if it were theatre night perhaps they met at the theatre if it were assembly night they met at the rooms and if it were neither they met the next day a very pleasant routine with perhaps a slight tinge of sameness mr pickwick was sitting up by himself after a day spent in this manner making entries in his journal his friends having retired to bed when he was roused by a gentle tap at the room door beg your pardon sir said mrs craddock the landlady peeping in but did you want anything more sir nothing more ma'am replied mr pickwick my young girl is gone to bed sir said mrs craddock and mr dowler is good enough to say that he'll sit up for mrs dowler as the party isn't expected to be over till late so i was thinking if you wanted nothing more mr pickwick i would go to bed by all means ma'am replied mr pickwick wish you good night sir said mrs craddock good night ma'am rejoined mr pickwick mrs craddock closed the door and mr pickwick resumed his writing in half an hour's time the entries were concluded mr pickwick carefully rubbed the last page on the blotting paper shut up the book wiped his pen on the bottom of the inside of his coat tail and opened the drawer of the inkstand to put it carefully away there were a couple of sheets of writing paper pretty closely written over in the inkstand drawer and they were folded so that the title which was in a good round hand was fully disclosed to him seeing from this that it was no private document and as it seemed to relate to bath and was very short mr pickwick unfolded it lighted his bed room candle that it might burn up well by the time he finished and drawing his chair nearer the fire read as follows the true legend of prince bladud less than two hundred years agone on one of the public baths in this city there appeared an inscription in honour of its mighty founder the renowned prince bladud that inscription is now erased for many hundred years before that time there had been handed down from age to age an old legend that the illustrious prince being afflicted with leprosy on his return from reaping a rich harvest of knowledge in athens shunned the court of his royal father and consorted moodily with husbandmen and pigs among the herd so said the legend was a pig of grave and solemn countenance with whom the prince had a fellow feeling for he too was wise a pig of thoughtful and reserved demeanour an animal superior to his fellows whose grunt was terrible and whose bite was sharp the young prince sighed deeply as he looked upon the countenance of the majestic swine he thought of his royal father and his eyes were bedewed with tears this sagacious pig was fond of bathing in rich moist mud not in summer as common pigs do now to cool themselves and did even in those distant ages which is a proof that the light of civilisation had already begun to dawn though feebly but in the cold sharp days of winter his coat was ever so sleek and his complexion so clear that the prince resolved to essay the purifying qualities of the same water that his friend resorted to he made the trial beneath that black mud bubbled the hot springs of bath he washed and was cured hastening to his father's court he paid his best respects and returning quickly hither founded this city and its famous baths he sought the pig with all the ardour of their early friendship but alas the waters had been his death he had imprudently taken a bath at too high a temperature and the natural philosopher was no more he was succeeded by pliny who also fell a victim to his thirst for knowledge this was the legend listen to the true one a great many centuries since there flourished in great state the famous and renowned lud hudibras king of britain he was a mighty monarch the earth shook when he walked he was so very stout his people basked in the light of his countenance it was so red and glowing he was indeed every inch a king and there were a good many inches of him too for although he was not very tall he was a remarkable size round and the inches that he wanted in height he made up in circumference if any degenerate monarch of modern times could be in any way compared with him i should say the venerable king cole would be that illustrious potentate this good king had a queen who eighteen years before had had a son who was called bladud he was sent to a preparatory seminary in his father's dominions until he was ten years old and was then despatched in charge of a trusty messenger to a finishing school at athens and as there was no extra charge for remaining during the holidays and no notice required previous to the removal of a pupil there he remained for eight long years at the expiration of which time the king his father sent the lord chamberlain over to settle the bill and to bring him home which the lord chamberlain doing was received with shouts and pensioned immediately when king lud saw the prince his son and found he had grown up such a fine young man he perceived at once what a grand thing it would be to have him married without delay so that his children might be the means of perpetuating the glorious race of lud down to the very latest ages of the world with this view he sent a special embassy composed of great noblemen who had nothing particular to do and wanted lucrative employment to a neighbouring king and demanded his fair daughter in marriage for his son stating at the same time that he was anxious to be on the most affectionate terms with his brother and friend but that if they couldn't agree in arranging this marriage he should be under the unpleasant necessity of invading his kingdom and putting his eyes out to this the other king who was the weaker of the two replied that he was very much obliged to his friend and brother for all his goodness and magnanimity and that his daughter was quite ready to be married whenever prince bladud liked to come and fetch her this answer no sooner reached britain than the whole nation were transported with joy nothing was heard on all sides but the sounds of feasting and revelry except the chinking of money as it was paid in by the people to the collector of the royal treasures to defray the expenses of the happy ceremony it was upon this occasion that king lud seated on the top of his throne in full council rose in the exuberance of his feelings and commanded the lord chief justice to order in the richest wines and the court minstrels an act of graciousness which has been through the ignorance of traditionary historians attributed to king cole in those celebrated lines in which his majesty is represented as 'calling for his pipe and calling for his pot and calling for his fiddlers three' which is an obvious injustice to the memory of king lud and a dishonest exaltation of the virtues of king cole but in the midst of all this festivity and rejoicing there was one individual present who tasted not when the sparkling wines were poured forth and who danced not when the minstrels played this was no other than prince bladud himself in honour of whose happiness a whole people were at that very moment straining alike their throats and purse strings the truth was that the prince forgetting the undoubted right of the minister for foreign affairs to fall in love on his behalf had contrary to every precedent of policy and diplomacy already fallen in love on his own account and privately contracted himself unto the fair daughter of a noble athenian here we have a striking example of one of the manifold advantages of civilisation and refinement if the prince had lived in later days he might at once have married the object of his father's choice and then set himself seriously to work to relieve himself of the burden which rested heavily upon him he might have endeavoured to break her heart by a systematic course of insult and neglect or if the spirit of her sex and a proud consciousness of her many wrongs had upheld her under this ill treatment he might have sought to take her life and so get rid of her effectually but neither mode of relief suggested itself to prince bladud so he solicited a private audience and told his father it is an old prerogative of kings to govern everything but their passions king lud flew into a frightful rage tossed his crown up to the ceiling and caught it again for in those days kings kept their crowns on their heads and not in the tower stamped the ground rapped his forehead wondered why his own flesh and blood rebelled against him and finally calling in his guards ordered the prince away to instant confinement in a lofty turret a course of treatment which the kings of old very generally pursued towards their sons when their matrimonial inclinations did not happen to point to the same quarter as their own when prince bladud had been shut up in the lofty turret for the greater part of a year with no better prospect before his bodily eyes than a stone wall or before his mental vision than prolonged imprisonment he naturally began to ruminate on a plan of escape which after months of preparation he managed to accomplish considerately leaving his dinner knife in the heart of his gaoler lest the poor fellow who had a family should be considered privy to his flight and punished accordingly by the infuriated king the monarch was frantic at the loss of his son he knew not on whom to vent his grief and wrath until fortunately bethinking himself of the lord chamberlain who had brought him home he struck off his pension and his head together meanwhile the young prince effectually disguised wandered on foot through his father's dominions cheered and supported in all his hardships by sweet thoughts of the athenian maid who was the innocent cause of his weary trials one day he stopped to rest in a country village and seeing that there were gay dances going forward on the green and gay faces passing to and fro ventured to inquire of a reveller who stood near him the reason for this rejoicing 'know you not o stranger' was the reply 'of the recent proclamation of our gracious king' 'proclamation no what proclamation' rejoined the prince for he had travelled along the bye and little frequented ways and knew nothing of what had passed upon the public roads such as they were 'why' replied the peasant 'the foreign lady that our prince wished to wed is married to a foreign noble of her own country and the king proclaims the fact and a great public festival besides for now of course prince bladud will come back and marry the lady his father chose who they say is as beautiful as the noonday sun your health sir god save the king' the prince remained to hear no more he fled from the spot and plunged into the thickest recesses of a neighbouring wood on on he wandered night and day beneath the blazing sun and the cold pale moon through the dry heat of noon and the damp cold of night in the grey light of morn and the red glare of eve so heedless was he of time or object that being bound for athens he wandered as far out of his way as bath there was no city where bath stands then there was no vestige of human habitation or sign of man's resort to bear the name but there was the same noble country the same broad expanse of hill and dale the same beautiful channel stealing on far away the same lofty mountains which like the troubles of life viewed at a distance and partially obscured by the bright mist of its morning lose their ruggedness and asperity and seem all ease and softness moved by the gentle beauty of the scene the prince sank upon the green turf and bathed his swollen feet in his tears 'oh' said the unhappy bladud clasping his hands and mournfully raising his eyes towards the sky 'would that my wanderings might end here would that these grateful tears with which i now mourn hope misplaced and love despised might flow in peace for ever' the wish was heard it was in the time of the heathen deities who used occasionally to take people at their words with a promptness in some cases extremely awkward the ground opened beneath the prince's feet he sunk into the chasm and instantaneously it closed upon his head for ever save where his hot tears welled up through the earth and where they have continued to gush forth ever since it is observable that to this day large numbers of elderly ladies and gentlemen who have been disappointed in procuring partners and almost as many young ones who are anxious to obtain them repair annually to bath to drink the waters from which they derive much strength and comfort this is most complimentary to the virtue of prince bladud's tears and strongly corroborative of the veracity of this legend mr pickwick yawned several times when he had arrived at the end of this little manuscript carefully refolded and replaced it in the inkstand drawer and then with a countenance expressive of the utmost weariness lighted his chamber candle and went upstairs to bed he stopped at mr dowler's door according to custom and knocked to say good night ah said dowler going to bed i wish i was dismal night windy isn't it very said mr pickwick good night good night mr pickwick went to his bed chamber and mr dowler resumed his seat before the fire in fulfilment of his rash promise to sit up till his wife came home there are few things more worrying than sitting up for somebody especially if that somebody be at a party you cannot help thinking how quickly the time passes with them which drags so heavily with you and the more you think of this the more your hopes of their speedy arrival decline clocks tick so loud too when you are sitting up alone and you seem as if you had an under garment of cobwebs on first something tickles your right knee and then the same sensation irritates your left you have no sooner changed your position than it comes again in the arms when you have fidgeted your limbs into all sorts of odd shapes you have a sudden relapse in the nose which you rub as if to rub it off as there is no doubt you would if you could eyes too are mere personal inconveniences and the wick of one candle gets an inch and a half long while you are snuffing the other these and various other little nervous annoyances render sitting up for a length of time after everybody else has gone to bed anything but a cheerful amusement this was just mr dowler's opinion as he sat before the fire and felt honestly indignant with all the inhuman people at the party who were keeping him up he was not put into better humour either by the reflection that he had taken it into his head early in the evening to think that he had got an ache there and so stopped at home at length after several droppings asleep and fallings forward towards the bars and catchings backward soon enough to prevent being branded in the face mr dowler made up his mind that he would throw himself on the bed in the back room and think not sleep of course i'm a heavy sleeper said mr dowler as he flung himself on the bed i must keep awake i suppose i shall hear a knock here yes i thought so i can hear the watchman there he goes fainter now though a little fainter he's turning the corner ah when mr dowler arrived at this point he turned the corner at which he had been long hesitating and fell fast asleep just as the clock struck three there was blown into the crescent a sedan chair with mrs dowler inside borne by one short fat chairman and one long thin one who had much ado to keep their bodies perpendicular to say nothing of the chair but on that high ground and in the crescent which the wind swept round and round as if it were going to tear the paving stones up its fury was tremendous they were very glad to set the chair down and give a good round loud double knock at the street door they waited some time but nobody came servants is in the arms o' porpus i think said the short chairman warming his hands at the attendant link boy's torch i wish he'd give 'em a squeeze and wake 'em observed the long one knock again will you if you please cried mrs dowler from the chair knock two or three times if you please the short man was quite willing to get the job over as soon as possible so he stood on the step and gave four or five most startling double knocks of eight or ten knocks a piece while the long man went into the road and looked up at the windows for a light nobody came it was all as silent and dark as ever dear me said mrs dowler you must knock again if you please theer ain't a bell is there ma'am said the short chairman yes there is interposed the link boy i've been a ringing at it ever so long it's only a handle said mrs dowler the wire's broken i wish the servants' heads wos growled the long man i must trouble you to knock again if you please said mrs dowler with the utmost politeness the short man did knock again several times without producing the smallest effect the tall man growing very impatient then relieved him and kept on perpetually knocking double knocks of two loud knocks each like an insane postman at length mr winkle began to dream that he was at a club and that the members being very refractory the chairman was obliged to hammer the table a good deal to preserve order then he had a confused notion of an auction room where there were no bidders and the auctioneer was buying everything in and ultimately he began to think it just within the bounds of possibility that somebody might be knocking at the street door to make quite certain however he remained quiet in bed for ten minutes or so and listened and when he had counted two or three and thirty knocks he felt quite satisfied and gave himself a great deal of credit for being so wakeful rap rap rap rap rap rap ra ra ra ra ra rap went the knocker mr winkle jumped out of bed wondering very much what could possibly be the matter and hastily putting on his stockings and slippers folded his dressing gown round him lighted a flat candle from the rushlight that was burning in the fireplace and hurried downstairs here's somebody comin' at last ma'am said the short chairman i wish i wos behind him vith a bradawl muttered the long one who's there cried mr winkle undoing the chain don't stop to ask questions cast iron head replied the long man with great disgust taking it for granted that the inquirer was a footman but open the door come look sharp timber eyelids added the other encouragingly mr winkle being half asleep obeyed the command mechanically opened the door a little and peeped out the first thing he saw was the red glare of the link boy's torch startled by the sudden fear that the house might be on fire he hastily threw the door wide open and holding the candle above his head stared eagerly before him not quite certain whether what he saw was a sedan chair or a fire engine at this instant there came a violent gust of wind the light was blown out mr winkle felt himself irresistibly impelled on to the steps and the door blew to with a loud crash well young man now you have done it said the short chairman mr winkle catching sight of a lady's face at the window of the sedan turned hastily round plied the knocker with all his might and main and called frantically upon the chairman to take the chair away again take it away take it away cried mr winkle here's somebody coming out of another house put me into the chair hide me do something with me all this time he was shivering with cold and every time he raised his hand to the knocker the wind took the dressing gown in a most unpleasant manner the people are coming down the crescent now there are ladies with 'em cover me up with something stand before me roared mr winkle but the chairmen were too much exhausted with laughing to afford him the slightest assistance and the ladies were every moment approaching nearer and nearer mr winkle gave a last hopeless knock the ladies were only a few doors off he threw away the extinguished candle which all this time he had held above his head and fairly bolted into the sedan chair where mrs dowler was now mrs craddock had heard the knocking and the voices at last and only waiting to put something smarter on her head than her night cap ran down into the front drawing room to make sure that it was the right party throwing up the window sash as mr winkle was rushing into the chair she no sooner caught sight of what was going forward below than she raised a vehement and dismal shriek and implored mr dowler to get up directly for his wife was running away with another gentleman upon this mr dowler bounced off the bed as abruptly as an india rubber ball and rushing into the front room arrived at one window just as mr pickwick threw up the other when the first object that met the gaze of both was mr winkle bolting into the sedan chair watchman shouted dowler furiously stop him hold him keep him tight shut him in till i come down i'll cut his throat give me a knife from ear to ear mrs craddock i will and breaking from the shrieking landlady and from mr pickwick the indignant husband seized a small supper knife and tore into the street but mr winkle didn't wait for him he no sooner heard the horrible threat of the valorous dowler than he bounced out of the sedan quite as quickly as he had bounced in and throwing off his slippers into the road took to his heels and tore round the crescent hotly pursued by dowler and the watchman he kept ahead the door was open as he came round the second time he rushed in slammed it in dowler's face mounted to his bed room locked the door piled a washhand stand chest of drawers and table against it and packed up a few necessaries ready for flight with the first ray of morning illustration mr winkle took to his heels and tore round the crescent dowler came up to the outside of the door avowed through the keyhole his steadfast determination of cutting mr winkle's throat next day and after a great confusion of voices in the drawing room amidst which that of mr pickwick was distinctly heard endeavouring to make peace the inmates dispersed to their several bed chambers and all was quite once more it is not unlikely that the inquiry may be made where mr weller was all this time we will state where he was in the next chapter chapter ix illustration honourably accounts for mr weller's absence by describing a soiree to which he was invited and went also relates how he was entrusted by mr pickwick with a private mission of delicacy and importance mr weller said mrs craddock upon the morning of this very eventful day here's a letter for you wery odd that said sam i'm afeerd there must be somethin' the matter for i don't recollect any gen'l'm'n in my circle of acquaintance as is capable o' writin' one perhaps something uncommon has taken place observed mrs craddock it must be somethin' wery uncommon indeed as could produce a letter out o' any friend o' mine replied sam shaking his head dubiously nothin' less than a nat'ral conwulsion as the young gen'l'm'n observed ven he was took with fits it can't be from the gov'ner said sam looking at the direction he always prints i know 'cos he learnt writin' from the large bills in the bookin' offices it's a wery strange thing now where this here letter can ha' come from as sam said this he did what a great many people do when they are uncertain about the writer of a note looked at the seal and then at the front and then at the back and then at the sides and then at the superscription and as a last resource thought perhaps he might as well look at the inside and try to find out from that it's wrote on gilt edged paper said sam as he unfolded it and sealed in bronze vax with the top of a door key now for it and with a very grave face mr weller slowly read as follows a select company of the bath footmen presents their compliments to mr weller and requests the pleasure of his company this evening to a friendly swarry consisting of a boiled leg of mutton with the usual trimmings the swarry to be on table at half past nine o'clock punctually this was enclosed in another note which ran thus mr john smauker the gentleman who had the pleasure of meeting mr weller at the house of their mutual acquaintance mr bantam a few days since begs to inclose mr weller the herewith invitation if mr weller will call on mr john smauker at nine o'clock mr john smauker will have the pleasure of introducing mr weller signed john smauker the envelope was directed to blank weller esq at mr pickwick's and in a parenthesis in the left hand corner were the words airy bell as an instruction to the bearer vell said sam this is comin' it rayther powerful this is i never heerd a biled leg of mutton called a swarry afore i wonder wot they'd call a roast one however without waiting to debate the point sam at once betook himself into the presence of mr pickwick and requested leave of absence for that evening which was readily granted with this permission and the street door key sam weller issued forth a little before the appointed time and strolled leisurely towards queen square which he no sooner gained than he had the satisfaction of beholding mr john smauker leaning his powdered head against a lamp post at a short distance off smoking a cigar through an amber tube how do you do mr weller said mr john smauker raising his hat gracefully with one hand while he gently waved the other in a condescending manner how do you do sir why reasonably conwalessent replied sam how do you find yourself my dear feller only so so said mr john smauker ah you've been a workin' too hard observed sam i was fearful you would it won't do you know you must not give way to that 'ere uncompromisin' spirit o' your'n it's not so much that mr weller replied mr john smauker as bad wine i'm afraid i've been dissipating oh that's it is it said sam that's a wery bad complaint that and yet the temptation you see mr weller observed mr john smauker ah to be sure said sam plunged into the very vortex of society you know mr weller said mr john smauker with a sigh dreadful indeed rejoined sam but it's always the way said mr john smauker if your destiny leads you into public life and public station you must expect to be subjected to temptations which other people is free from mr weller precisely what my uncle said ven he vent into the public line remarked sam and wery right the old gen'l'm'n wos for he drank hisself to death in somethin' less than a quarter mr john smauker looked deeply indignant at any parallel being drawn between himself and the deceased gentleman in question but as sam's face was in the most immovable state of calmness he thought better of it and looked affable again perhaps we had better be walking said mr smauker consulting a copper timepiece which dwelt at the bottom of a deep watch pocket and was raised to the surface by means of a black string with a copper key at the other end perhaps we had replied sam or they'll overdo the swarry and that'll spile it have you drank the waters mr weller inquired his companion as they walked towards high street once replied sam what did you think of 'em sir i thought they wos particklery unpleasant replied sam ah said mr john smauker you disliked the killibeate taste perhaps i don't know much about that 'ere said sam i thought they'd a wery strong flavour o' warm flat irons that is the killibeate mr weller observed mr john smauker contemptuously well if it is it's a wery inexpressive word that's all said sam it may be but i ain't much in the chimical line myself so i can't say and here to the great horror of mr john smauker sam weller began to whistle illustration and here to the great horror of mr john smauker sam weller began to whistle i beg your pardon mr weller said mr john smauker agonised at the exceedingly ungenteel sound will you take my arm thankee you're wery good but i won't deprive you of it replied sam i've rayther a way o' puttin' my hands in my pockets if it's all the same to you as sam said this he suited the action to the word and whistled far louder than before this way said his new friend apparently much relieved as they turned down a by street we shall soon be there shall we said sam quite unmoved by the announcement of his close vicinity to the select footmen of bath yes said mr john smauker don't be alarmed mr weller oh no said sam you'll see very handsome uniforms mr weller continued mr john smauker and perhaps you'll find some of the gentlemen rather high at first you know but they'll soon come round that's wery kind on 'em replied sam and you know resumed mr john smauker with an air of sublime protection you know as you're a stranger perhaps they'll be rather hard upon you at first they won't be wery cruel though will they inquired sam no no replied mr john smauker pulling forth the fox's head and taking a gentlemanly pinch there are some funny dogs among us and they will have their joke you know but you mustn't mind 'em you mustn't mind 'em i'll try and bear up agin such a reg'lar knock down o' talent replied sam that's right said mr john smauker putting up the fox's head and elevating his own i'll stand by you by this time they had reached a small greengrocer's shop which mr john smauker entered followed by sam who the moment he got behind him relapsed into a series of the very broadest and most unmitigated grins and manifested other demonstrations of being in a highly enviable state of inward merriment crossing the greengrocer's shop and putting their hats on the stairs in the little passage behind it they walked into a small parlour and here the full splendour of the scene burst upon mr weller's view a couple of tables were put together in the middle of the parlour covered with three or four cloths of different ages and dates of washing arranged to look as much like one as the circumstances of the case would allow upon these were laid knives and forks for six or eight people some of the knife handles were green others red and a few yellow and as all the forks were black the combination of colours was exceedingly striking plates for a corresponding number of guests were warming behind the fender and the guests themselves were warming before it the chief and most important of whom appeared to be a stoutish gentleman in a bright crimson coat with long tails vividly red breeches and a cocked hat who was standing with his back to the fire and had apparently just entered for besides retaining his cocked hat on his head he carried in his hand a high stick such as gentlemen of his profession usually elevate in a sloping position over the roofs of carriages smauker my lad your fin said the gentleman with the cocked hat mr smauker dovetailed the top joint of his right hand little finger into that of the gentleman with the cocked hat and said he was charmed to see him looking so well well they tell me i am looking pretty blooming said the man with the cocked hat and it's a wonder too i've been following our old woman about two hours a day for the last fortnight and if a constant contemplation of the manner in which she hooks and eyes that infernal old lavender coloured gown of hers behind isn't enough to throw anybody into a low state of despondency for life stop my quarter's salary at this the assembled selections laughed very heartily and one gentleman in a yellow waistcoat with a coach trimming border whispered a neighbour in green foil smalls that tuckle was in spirits to night by the bye said mr tuckle smauker my boy you the remainder of the sentence was forwarded into mr john smauker's ear by whisper oh dear me i quite forgot said mr john smauker gentlemen my friend mr weller sorry to keep the fire off you weller said mr tuckle with a familiar nod hope you're not cold weller not by no means blazes replied sam it 'ud be a wery chilly subject as felt cold ven you stood opposit you'd save coals if they put you behind the fender in the waitin' room at a public office you would as this retort appeared to convey rather a personal allusion to mr tuckle's crimson livery that gentleman looked majestic for a few seconds but gradually edging away from the fire broke into a forced smile and said it wasn't bad wery much obliged for your good opinion sir replied sam we shall get on by degrees i des say we'll try a better one by and by at this point the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a gentleman in orange coloured plush accompanied by another selection in purple cloth with a great extent of stocking the new comers having been welcomed by the old ones mr tuckle put the question that supper be ordered in which was carried unanimously the greengrocer and his wife then arranged upon the table a boiled leg of mutton hot with caper sauce turnips and potatoes mr tuckle took the chair and was supported at the other end of the board by the gentleman in orange plush the greengrocer put on a pair of wash leather gloves to hand the plates with and stationed himself behind mr tuckle's chair harris said mr tuckle in a commanding tone sir said the greengrocer have you got your gloves on yes sir then take the kiver off yes sir the greengrocer did as he was told with a show of great humility and obsequiously handed mr tuckle the carving knife in doing which he accidentally gaped what do you mean by that sir said mr tuckle with great asperity i beg your pardon sir replied the crestfallen greengrocer i din't mean to do it sir i was up very late last night sir i tell you what my opinion of you is harris said mr tuckle with a most impressive air you're a wulgar beast i hope gentlemen said harris that you won't be severe with me gentlemen i'm very much obliged to you indeed gentlemen for your patronage and also for your recommendations gentlemen whenever additional assistance in waiting is required i hope gentlemen i give satisfaction no you don't sir said mr tuckle very far from it sir we consider you an inattentive reskel said the gentleman in the orange plush and a low thief added the gentleman in the green foil smalls and an unreclaimable blaygaird added the gentleman in purple the poor greengrocer bowed very humbly while these little epithets were bestowed upon him in the true spirit of the very smallest tyranny and when everybody had said something to show his superiority mr tuckle proceeded to carve the leg of mutton and to help the company this important business of the evening had hardly commenced when the door was thrown briskly open and another gentleman in a light blue suit and leaden buttons made his appearance against the rules said mr tuckle too late too late no no positively i couldn't help it said the gentleman in blue i appeal to the company an affair of gallantry now an appointment at the theayter oh that indeed said the gentleman in the orange plush yes raly now honour bright said the man in blue i made a promese to fetch our youngest daughter at half past ten and she is such an uncauminly fine gal that i raly hadn't the art to disappoint her no offence to the present company sir but a petticut sir a petticut sir is irrevokeable i begin to suspect there's something in that quarter said tuckle as the new comer took his seat next sam i've remarked once or twice that she leans very heavy on your shoulder when she gets in and out of the carriage oh raly raly tuckle you shouldn't said the man in blue it's not fair i may have said to one or two friends that she was a very divine creechure and had refused one or two offers without any hobvus cause but no no no indeed tuckle before strangers too it's not right you shouldn't delicacy my dear friend delicacy and the man in blue pulling up his neckerchief and adjusting his coat cuffs nodded and frowned as if there were more behind which he could say if he liked but was bound in honour to suppress the man in blue being a light haired stiff necked free and easy sort of footman with a swaggering air and pert face had attracted mr weller's especial attention at first but when he began to come out in this way sam felt more than ever disposed to cultivate his acquaintance so he launched himself into the conversation at once with characteristic independence your health sir said sam i like you conwersation much i think it's wery pretty at this the man in blue smiled as if it were a compliment he was well used to but looked approvingly on sam at the same time and said he hoped he should be better acquainted with him for without any flattery at all he seemed to have the makings of a very nice fellow about him and to be just the man after his own heart you're wery good sir said sam what a lucky feller you are how do you mean inquired the gentleman in blue that 'ere young lady replied sam she knows wot's wot she does ah i see mr weller closed one eye and shook his head from side to side in a manner which was highly gratifying to the personal vanity of the gentleman in blue i'm afraid you're a cunning fellow mr weller said that individual no no said sam i leave all that 'ere to you it's a great deal more in your way than mine as the gen'l'm'n on the right side o' the garden vall said to the man on the wrong 'un ven the mad bull wos a comin' up the lane well well mr weller said the gentleman in blue i think she has remarked my air and manner mr weller i should think she couldn't wery vell be off o' that said sam have you any little thing of that kind in hand sir inquired the favoured gentleman in blue drawing a toothpick from his waistcoat pocket not exactly said sam there's no daughters at my place else o' course i should ha' made up to vun on 'em as it is i don't think i can do anything under a female markis i might take up vith a young 'ooman o' large property as hadn't a title if she made wery fierce love to me not else of course not mr weller said the gentleman in blue one can't be troubled you know and we know mr weller we who are men of the world that a good uniform must work its way with the women sooner or later in fact that's the only thing between you and me that makes the service worth entering into just so said sam that's it o' course when this confidential dialogue had gone thus far glasses were placed round and every gentleman ordered what he liked best before the public house shut up the gentleman in blue and the man in orange who were the chief exquisites of the party ordered cold scrub and water but with the others gin and water sweet appeared to be the favourite beverage sam called the greengrocer a desp'rate willin and ordered a large bowl of punch two circumstances which seemed to raise him very much in the opinion of the selections gentlemen said the man in blue with an air of the most consummate dandyism i'll give you 'the ladies' come hear hear said sam the young mississes here there was a loud cry of order and mr john smauker as the gentleman who had introduced mr weller into that company begged to inform him that the word he had just made use of was unparliamentary which word was that 'ere sir inquired sam missesses sir replied mr john smauker with an alarming frown we don't recognise such distinctions here oh wery good said sam then i'll amend the observation and call 'em the dear creeturs if blazes vill allow me some doubt appeared to exist in the mind of the gentleman in the green foil smalls whether the chairman could be legally appealed to as blazes but as the company seemed more disposed to stand upon their own rights than his the question was not raised the man with the cocked hat breathed short and looked long at sam but apparently thought it as well to say nothing in case he should get the worst of it after a short silence a gentleman in an embroidered coat reaching down to his heels and a waistcoat of the same which kept one half of his legs warm stirred his gin and water with great energy and putting himself upon his feet all at once by a violent effort said he was desirous of offering a few remarks to the company whereupon the person in the cocked hat had no doubt that the company would be very happy to hear any remarks that the man in the long coat might wish to offer i feel a great delicacy gentlemen in coming for'ard said the man in the long coat having the misforchune to be a coachman and being admitted as a honorary member of these agreeable swarrys but i do feel myself bound gentlemen drove into a corner if i may use the expression to make known an afflicting circumstance which has come to my knowledge which has happened i may say within the soap of my everyday contemplation gentlemen our friend mr whiffers everybody looked at the individual in orange our friend mr whiffers has resigned universal astonishment fell upon the hearers each gentleman looked in his neighbour's face and then transferred his glance to the upstanding coachman you may well be sapparised gentlemen said the coachman i will not wenchure to state the reasons of this irrepairabel loss to the service but i will beg mr whiffers to state them himself for the improvement and imitation of his admiring friends the suggestion being loudly approved of mr whiffers explained he said he certainly could have wished to have continued to hold the appointment he had just resigned the uniform was extremely rich and expensive the females of the family was most agreeable and the duties of the situation was not he was bound to say too heavy the principal service that was required of him being that he should look out of the hall window as much as possible in company with another gentleman who had also resigned he could have wished to have spared that company the painful and disgusting detail on which he was about to enter but as the explanation had been demanded of him he had no alternative but to state boldly and distinctly that he had been required to eat cold meat it is impossible to conceive the disgust which this avowal awakened in the bosoms of the hearers loud cries of shame mingled with groans and hisses prevailed for a quarter of an hour mr whiffers then added that he feared a portion of this outrage might be traced to his own forbearing and accommodating disposition he had a distinct recollection of having once consented to eat salt butter and he had moreover on an occasion of sudden sickness in the house so far forgotten himself as to carry a coal scuttle up to the second floor he trusted he had not lowered himself in the good opinion of his friends by this frank confession of his faults and he hoped the promptness with which he had resented the last unmanly outrage on his feelings to which he had referred would reinstate him in their good opinion if he had mr whiffers' address was responded to with a shout of admiration and the health of the interesting martyr was drunk in a most enthusiastic manner for this the martyr returned thanks and proposed their visitor mr weller a gentleman whom he had not the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with but who was the friend of mr john smauker which was a sufficient letter of recommendation to any society of gentlemen whatever or wherever on this account he should have been disposed to have given mr weller's health with all the honours if his friends had been drinking wine but as they were taking spirits by way of a change and as it might be inconvenient to empty a tumbler at every toast he should propose that the honours be understood at the conclusion of this speech everybody took a sip in honour of sam and sam having ladled out and drunk two full glasses of punch in honour of himself returned thanks in a neat speech wery much obliged to you old fellers said sam ladling away at the punch in the most unembarrassed manner possible for this here compliment wich comin' from sich a quarter is wery overvelmin' i've heerd a good deal on you as a body but i will say that i never thought you was sich uncommon nice men as i find you air i only hope you'll take care o' yourselves and not compromise nothin' o' your dignity which is a wery charmin' thing to see when one's out a walkin' and has always made me wery happy to look at ever since i was a boy about half as high as the brass headed stick o' my wery respectable friend blazes there as to the wictim of oppression in the suit o' brimstone all i can say of him is that i hope he'll get jist as good a berth as he deserves in vich case it's wery little cold swarry as ever he'll be troubled with agin here sam sat down with a pleasant smile and his speech having been vociferously applauded the company broke up vy you don't mean to say you're a goin' old feller said sam weller to his friend mr john smauker i must indeed said mr smauker i promised bantam oh wery well said sam that's another thing p'raps he'd resign if you disappointed him you ain't a goin' blazes yes i am said the man with the cocked hat wot and leave three quarters of a bowl of punch behind you said sam nonsense set down agin mr tuckle was not proof against this invitation he laid aside the cocked hat and stick which he had just taken up and said he would have one glass for good fellowship's sake as the gentleman in blue went home the same way as mr tuckle he was prevailed upon to stop too when the punch was about half gone sam ordered in some oysters from the greengrocer's shop and the effect of both was so extremely exhilarating that mr tuckle dressed out with the cocked hat and stick danced the frog hornpipe among the shells on the table while the gentleman in blue played an accompaniment upon an ingenious musical instrument formed of a hair comb and a curl paper at last when the punch was all gone and the night nearly so they sallied forth to see each other home mr tuckle no sooner got into the open air than he was seized with a sudden desire to lie on the curb stone sam thought it would be a pity to contradict him and so let him have his own way as the cocked hat would have been spoilt if left there sam very considerately flattened it down on the head of the gentleman in blue and putting the big stick in his hand propped him up against his own street door rang the bell and walked quietly home at a much earlier hour next morning than his usual time of rising mr pickwick walked down stairs completely dressed and rang the bell sam said mr pickwick when mr weller appeared in reply to the summons shut the door mr weller did so there was an unfortunate occurrence here last night sam said mr pickwick which gave mr winkle some cause to apprehend violence from mr dowler so i've heerd from the old lady down stairs sir replied sam and i'm sorry to say sam continued mr pickwick with a most perplexed countenance that in dread of this violence mr winkle has gone away gone avay said sam left the house early this morning without the slightest previous communication with me replied mr pickwick and is gone i know not where he should ha' stopped and fought it out sir replied sam contemptuously it wouldn't take much to settle that 'ere dowler sir well sam said mr pickwick i may have my doubts of his great bravery and determination also but however that may be mr winkle is gone he must be found sam found and brought back to me and s'pose he won't come back sir said sam he must be made sam said mr pickwick who's to do it sir inquired sam with a smile you replied mr pickwick wery good sir with these words mr weller left the room and immediately afterwards was heard to shut the street door in two hours' time he returned with as much coolness as if he had been despatched on the most ordinary message possible and brought the information that an individual in every respect answering mr winkle's description had gone over to bristol that morning by the branch coach from the royal hotel sam said mr pickwick grasping his hand you're a capital fellow an invaluable fellow you must follow him sam cert'nly sir replied mr weller the instant you discover him write to me immediately sam said mr pickwick if he attempts to run away from you knock him down or lock him up you have my full authority sam i'll be wery careful sir rejoined sam you'll tell him said mr pickwick that i am highly excited highly displeased and naturally indignant at the very extraordinary course he has thought proper to pursue i will sir replied sam you'll tell him said mr pickwick that if he does not come back to this very house with you he will come back with me for i will come and fetch him i'll mention that 'ere sir rejoined sam you think you can find him sam said mr pickwick looking earnestly in his face oh i'll find him if he's anyvere rejoined sam with great confidence very well said mr pickwick then the sooner you go the better with these instructions mr pickwick placed a sum of money in the hands of his faithful servitor and ordered him to start for bristol immediately in pursuit of the fugitive sam put a few necessaries in a carpet bag and was ready for starting he stopped when he had got to the end of the passage and walking quietly back thrust his head in at the parlour door sir whispered sam well sam said mr pickwick i fully understands my instructions do i sir inquired sam i hope so said mr pickwick it's reg'larly understood about the knockin' down is it sir inquired sam perfectly replied mr pickwick thoroughly do what you think necessary you have my orders sam gave a nod of intelligence and withdrawing his head from the door set forth on his pilgrimage with a light heart chapter x illustration how mr winkle when he stepped out of the frying pan walked gently and comfortably into the fire the ill starred gentleman who had been the unfortunate cause of the unusual noise and disturbance which alarmed the inhabitants of the royal crescent in manner and form already described after passing a night of great confusion and anxiety left the roof beneath which his friends still slumbered bound he knew not whither the excellent and considerate feelings which prompted mr winkle to take this step can never be too highly appreciated or too warmly extolled if reasoned mr winkle with himself if this dowler attempts as i have no doubt he will to carry into execution his threat of personal violence against myself it will be incumbent on me to call him out he has a wife that wife is attached to and dependent on him heavens if i should kill him in the blindness of my wrath what would be my feelings ever afterwards this painful consideration operated so powerfully on the feelings of the humane young man as to cause his knees to knock together and his countenance to exhibit alarming manifestations of inward emotion impelled by such reflections he grasped his carpet bag and creeping stealthily down stairs shut the detestable street door with as little noise as possible and walked off bending his steps towards the royal hotel he found a coach on the point of starting for bristol and thinking bristol as good a place for his purpose as any other he could go to he mounted the box and reached the place of destination in such time as the pair of horses who went the whole stage and back again twice a day or more could be reasonably supposed to arrive there he took up his quarters at the bush and designing to postpone any communication by letter with mr pickwick until it was probable that mr dowler's wrath might have in some degree evaporated walked forth to view the city which struck him as being a shade more dirty than any place he had ever seen having inspected the docks and shipping and viewed the cathedral he inquired his way to clifton and being directed thither took the route which was pointed out to him but as the pavements of bristol are not the widest or cleanest upon earth so its streets are not altogether the straightest or least intricate mr winkle being greatly puzzled by their manifold windings and twistings looked about him for a decent shop in which he could apply afresh for counsel and instruction his eyes fell upon a newly painted tenement which had been recently converted into something between a shop and a private house and which a red lamp projecting over the fanlight of the street door would have sufficiently announced as the residence of a medical practitioner even if the word surgery had not been inscribed in golden characters on a wainscot ground above the window of what in times bygone had been the front parlour thinking this an eligible place wherein to make his inquiries mr winkle stepped into the little shop where the gilt labelled drawers and bottles were and finding nobody there knocked with a half crown on the counter to attract the attention of anybody who might happen to be in the back parlour which he judged to be the innermost and peculiar sanctum of the establishment from the repetition of the word surgery on the door painted in white letters this time by way of taking off the monotony at the first knock a sound as of persons fencing with fire irons which had until now been very audible suddenly ceased at the second a studious looking young gentleman in green spectacles with a very large book in his hand glided quietly into the shop and stepping behind the counter requested to know the visitor's pleasure i am sorry to trouble you sir said mr winkle but will you have the goodness to direct me to ha ha ha roared the studious young gentleman throwing the large book up into the air and catching it with great dexterity at the very moment when it threatened to smash to atoms all the bottles on the counter here's a start there was without a doubt for mr winkle was so very much astonished at the extraordinary behaviour of the medical gentleman that he involuntarily retreated towards the door and looked very much disturbed at this strange reception what don't you know me said the medical gentleman mr winkle murmured in reply that he had not that pleasure why then said the medical gentleman there are hopes for me yet i may attend half the old women in bristol if i've decent luck get out you mouldy old villain get out with this adjuration which was addressed to the large book the medical gentleman kicked the volume with remarkable agility to the further end of the shop and pulling off his green spectacles grinned the identical grin of robert sawyer esquire formerly of guy's hospital in the borough with a private residence in lant street you don't mean to say you weren't down upon me said mr bob sawyer shaking mr winkle's hand with friendly warmth upon my word i was not replied mr winkle returning the pressure i wonder you didn't see the name said bob sawyer calling his friend's attention to the outer door on which in the same white paint were traced the words sawyer late nockemorf it never caught my eye returned mr winkle lord if i had known who you were i should have rushed out and caught you in my arms said bob sawyer but upon my life i thought you were the king's taxes no said mr winkle i did indeed responded bob sawyer and i was just going to say that i wasn't at home but if you'd leave a message i'd be sure to give it to myself for he don't know me no more does the lighting and paving i think the church rates guesses who i am and i know the water works does because i drew a tooth of his when i first came down here but come in come in chattering in this way mr bob sawyer pushed mr winkle into the back room where amusing himself by boring little circular caverns in the chimney piece with a red hot poker sat no less a person than mr benjamin allen well said mr winkle this is indeed a pleasure i did not expect what a very nice place you have here pretty well pretty well replied bob sawyer i passed soon after the precious party and my friends came down with the needful for this business so i put on a black suit of clothes and a pair of spectacles and came here to look as solemn as i could and a very snug little business you have no doubt said mr winkle knowingly very replied bob sawyer so snug that at the end of a few years you might put all the profits in a wine glass and cover 'em over with a gooseberry leaf you cannot surely mean that said mr winkle the stock itself dummies my dear boy said bob sawyer half the drawers have nothing in 'em and the other half don't open nonsense said mr winkle fact honour returned bob sawyer stepping out into the shop and demonstrating the veracity of the assertion by divers hard pulls at the little gilt knobs on the counterfeit drawers hardly anything real in the shop but the leeches and they are second hand i shouldn't have thought it exclaimed mr winkle much surprised i hope not replied bob sawyer else where's the use of appearances eh but what will you take do as we do that's right ben my fine fellow put your hand into the cupboard and bring out the patent digester mr benjamin allen smiled his readiness and produced from the closet at his elbow a black bottle half full of brandy you don't take water of course said bob sawyer thank you replied mr winkle it's rather early i should like to qualify it if you have no objection none in the least if you can reconcile it to your conscience replied bob sawyer tossing off as he spoke a glass of the liquor with great relish ben the pipkin mr benjamin allen drew forth from the same hiding place a small brass pipkin which bob sawyer observed he prided himself upon particularly because it looked so business like the water in the professional pipkin having been made to boil in course of time by various little shovelsful of coal which mr bob sawyer took out of a practicable window seat labelled soda water mr winkle adulterated his brandy and the conversation was becoming general when it was interrupted by the entrance into the shop of a boy in a sober grey livery and a gold laced hat with a small covered basket under his arm whom mr bob sawyer immediately hailed with tom you vagabond come here the boy presented himself accordingly you've been stopping to over all the posts in bristol you idle young scamp said mr bob sawyer no sir i haven't replied the boy you had better not said mr bob sawyer with a threatening aspect who do you suppose will ever employ a professional man when they see his boy playing at marbles in the gutter or flying the garter in the horse road have you no feeling for your profession you groveller did you leave all the medicine yes sir the powders for the child at the large house with the new family and the pills to be taken four times a day at the ill tempered old gentleman's with the gouty leg yes sir then shut the door and mind the shop come said mr winkle as the boy retired things are not quite so bad as you would have me believe either there is some medicine to be sent out mr bob sawyer peeped out the shop to see that no stranger was within hearing and leaning forward to mr winkle said in a low tone he leaves it all at the wrong houses mr winkle looked perplexed and bob sawyer and his friend laughed illustration you've been stopping to over all the posts in bristol don't you see said bob he goes up to a house rings the area bell pokes a packet of medicine without a direction into the servant's hand and walks off servant takes it into the dining parlour master open it and reads the label 'draught to be taken at bed time pills as before lotion as usual the powder from sawyer's late nockemorf's physicians' prescriptions carefully prepared' and all the rest of it shows it to his wife she reads the label it goes down to the servants they read the label next day boy calls 'very sorry his mistake immense business great many parcels to deliver mr sawyer's compliments late nockemorf' the name gets known and that's the thing my boy in the medical way bless your heart old fellow it's better than all the advertising in the world we have got one four ounce bottle that's been to half the houses in bristol and hasn't done yet dear me i see observed mr winkle what an excellent plan oh ben and i have hit upon a dozen such replied bob sawyer with great glee the lamplighter has eighteenpence a week to pull the night bell for ten minutes every time he comes round and my boy always rushes into church just before the psalms when the people have got nothing to do but look about 'em and calls me out with horror and dismay depicted on his countenance 'bless my soul' everybody says 'somebody taken suddenly ill sawyer late nockemorf sent for what a business that young man has' at the termination of this disclosure of some of the mysteries of medicine mr bob sawyer and his friend ben allen threw themselves back in their respective chairs and laughed boisterously when they had enjoyed the joke to their hearts' content the discourse changed to topics in which mr winkle was more immediately interested we think we have hinted elsewhere that mr benjamin allen had a way of becoming sentimental after brandy the case is not a peculiar one as we ourselves can testify having on a few occasions had to deal with patients who have been afflicted in a similar manner at this precise period of his existence mr benjamin allen had perhaps a greater predisposition to maudlinism than he had ever known before the cause of which malady was briefly this he had been staying nearly three weeks with mr bob sawyer mr bob sawyer was not remarkable for temperance nor was mr benjamin allen for the ownership of a very strong head the consequence was that during the whole space of time just mentioned mr benjamin allen had been wavering between intoxication partial and intoxication complete my dear friend said mr ben allen taking advantage of mr bob sawyer's temporary absence behind the counter whither he had retired to dispense some of the second hand leeches previously referred to my dear friend i am very miserable mr winkle professed his heartfelt regret to hear it and begged to know whether he could do anything to alleviate the sorrows of the suffering student nothing my dear boy nothing said ben you recollect arabella winkle my sister arabella a little girl winkle with black eyes when we were down at wardle's i don't know whether you happened to notice her a nice little girl winkle perhaps my features may recall her countenance to your recollection mr winkle required nothing to recall the charming arabella to his mind and it was rather fortunate he did not for the features of her brother benjamin would unquestionably have proved but an indifferent refresher to his memory he answered with as much calmness as he could assume that he perfectly remembered the young lady referred to and sincerely trusted she was in good health our friend bob is a delightful fellow winkle was the only reply of mr ben allen very said mr winkle not much relishing the close connection of the two names i designed 'em for each other they were made for each other sent into the world for each other born for each other winkle said mr ben allen setting down his glass with emphasis there's a special destiny in the matter my dear sir there's only five years' difference between 'em and both their birthdays are in august mr winkle was too anxious to hear what was to follow to express much wonderment at this extraordinary coincidence marvellous as it was so mr ben allen after a tear or two went on to say that notwithstanding all his esteem and respect and veneration for his friend arabella had unaccountably and undutifully evinced the most determined antipathy to his person and i think said mr ben allen in conclusion i think there's a prior attachment have you any idea who the object of it might be asked mr winkle with great trepidation mr ben allen seized the poker flourished it in a warlike manner above his head inflicted a savage blow on an imaginary skull and wound up by saying in a very expressive manner that he only wished he could guess that was all i'd show him what i thought of him said mr ben allen and round went the poker again more fiercely than before all this was of course very soothing to the feelings of mr winkle who remained silent for a few minutes but at length mustered up resolution to inquire whether miss allen was in kent no no said mr allen laying aside the poker and looking very cunning i didn't think wardle's exactly the place for a headstrong girl so as i am her natural protector and guardian our parents being dead i have brought her down into this part of the country to spend a few months at an old aunt's in a nice dull close place i think that will cure her my boy if it doesn't i'll take her abroad for a little while and see what that'll do oh the aunt's is in bristol is it faltered mr winkle no no not in bristol replied mr ben allen jerking his thumb over his right shoulder over that way down there but hush here's bob not a word my dear friend not a word short as this conversation was it roused in mr winkle the highest degree of excitement and anxiety the suspected prior attachment rankled in his heart could he be the object of it could it be for him that the fair arabella had looked scornfully on the sprightly bob sawyer or had he a successful rival he determined to see her cost what it might but here an insurmountable objection presented itself for whether the explanatory over that way and down there of mr ben allen meant three miles off or thirty or three hundred he could in no wise guess but he had no opportunity of pondering over his love just then for bob sawyer's return was the immediate precursor of the arrival of a meat pie from the baker's of which that gentleman insisted on his staying to partake the cloth was laid by an occasional charwoman who officiated in the capacity of mr bob sawyer's housekeeper and a third knife and fork having been borrowed from the mother of the boy in the grey livery for mr sawyer's domestic arrangements were as yet conducted on a limited scale they sat down to dinner the beer being served up as mr sawyer remarked in its native pewter after dinner mr bob sawyer ordered in the largest mortar in the shop and proceeded to brew a reeking jorum of rum punch therein stirring up and amalgamating the materials with a pestle in a very creditable and apothecary like manner mr sawyer being a bachelor had only one tumbler in the house which was assigned to mr winkle as a compliment to the visitor mr ben allen being accommodated with a funnel with a cork in the narrow end and bob sawyer contented himself with one of those wide lipped crystal vessels inscribed with a variety of cabalistic characters in which chemists are wont to measure out their liquid drugs in compounding prescriptions these preliminaries adjusted the punch was tasted and pronounced excellent and it having been arranged that bob sawyer and ben allen should be considered at liberty to fill twice to mr winkle's once they started fair with great satisfaction and good fellowship there was no singing because mr bob sawyer said it wouldn't look professional but to make amends for this deprivation there was so much talking and laughing that it might have been heard and very likely was at the end of the street which conversation materially lightened the hours and improved the mind of mr bob sawyer's boy who instead of devoting the evening to his ordinary occupation of writing his name on the counter and rubbing it out again peeped through the glass door and thus listened and looked on at the same time the mirth of mr bob sawyer was rapidly ripening into the furious mr ben allen was fast relapsing into the sentimental and the punch had well nigh disappeared altogether when the boy hastily running in announced that a young woman had just come over to say that sawyer late nockemorf was wanted directly a couple of streets off this broke up the party mr bob sawyer understanding the message after some twenty repetitions tied a wet cloth round his head to sober himself and having partially succeeded put on his green spectacles and issued forth resisting all entreaties to stay till he came back and finding it quite impossible to engage mr ben allen in any intelligible conversation on the subject nearest his heart or indeed on any other mr winkle took his departure and returned to the bush the anxiety of his mind and the numerous meditations which arabella had awakened prevented his share of the mortar of punch producing that effect upon him which it would have had under other circumstances so after taking a glass of soda water and brandy at the bar he turned into the coffee room dispirited rather than elevated by the occurrences of the evening sitting in the front of the fire with his back towards him was a tallish gentleman in a great coat the only other occupant of the room it was rather a cool evening for the season of the year and the gentleman drew his chair aside to afford the new comer a sight of the fire what were mr winkle's feelings when in doing so he disclosed to view the face and figure of the vindictive and sanguinary dowler mr winkle's first impulse was to give a violent pull at the nearest bell handle but that unfortunately happened to be immediately behind mr dowler's head he had made one step towards it before he checked himself as he did so mr dowler very hastily drew back mr winkle sir be calm don't strike me i won't bear it a blow never said mr dowler looking meeker than mr winkle had expected in a gentleman of his ferocity a blow sir stammered mr winkle a blow sir replied dowler compose your feelings sit down hear me sir said mr winkle trembling from head to foot before i consent to sit down beside or opposite you without the presence of a waiter i must be secured by some further understanding you used a threat against me last night sir a dreadful threat sir here mr winkle turned very pale indeed and stopped short i did said dowler with a countenance almost as white as mr winkle's circumstances were suspicious they have been explained i respect your bravery your feeling is upright conscious innocence there's my hand grasp it really sir said mr winkle hesitating whether to give his hand or not and almost fearing that it was demanded in order that he might be taken at an advantage really sir i i know what you mean interposed dowler you feel aggrieved very natural so should i i was strong i beg your pardon be friendly forgive me with this dowler fairly forced his hand upon mr winkle and shaking it with the utmost vehemence declared he was a fellow of extreme spirit and he had a higher opinion of him than ever now said dowler sit down relate it all how did you find me when did you follow be frank tell me it's quite accidental replied mr winkle greatly perplexed by the curious and unexpected nature of the interview quite glad of it said dowler i woke this morning i had forgotten my threat i laughed at the accident i felt friendly i said so to whom inquired mr winkle to mrs dowler 'you made a vow' said she 'i did' said i 'it was a rash one' said she 'it was' said i 'i'll apologise where is he' who inquired mr winkle you replied dowler i went down stairs you were not to be found pickwick looked gloomy shook his head hoped no violence would be committed i saw it all you felt yourself insulted you had gone for a friend perhaps possibly for pistols 'high spirit' said i 'i admire him' mr winkle coughed and beginning to see how the land lay assumed a look of importance i left a note for you resumed dowler i said i was sorry so i was pressing business called me here you were not satisfied you followed you required a verbal explanation you were right it's all over now my business is finished i go back to morrow join me as dowler progressed in his explanation mr winkle's countenance grew more and more dignified the mysterious nature of the commencement of their conversation was explained mr dowler had as great an objection to duelling as himself in short this blustering and awful personage was one of the most egregious cowards in existence and interpreting mr winkle's absence through the medium of his own fears had taken the same step as himself and prudently retired until all excitement of feeling should have subsided as the real state of the case dawned upon mr winkle's mind he looked very terrible and said he was perfectly satisfied but at the same time said so with an air that left mr dowler no alternative but to infer that if he had not been something most horrible and destructive must inevitably have occurred mr dowler appeared to be impressed with a becoming sense of mr winkle's magnanimity and condescension and the two belligerents parted for the night with many protestations of eternal friendship about half past twelve o'clock when mr winkle had been revelling some twenty minutes in the full luxury of his first sleep he was suddenly awakened by a loud knocking at his chamber door which being repeated with increased vehemence caused him to start up in bed and inquire who was there and what the matter was please sir here's a young man which says he must see you directly responded the voice of the chambermaid a young man exclaimed mr winkle no mistake about that 'ere sir replied another voice through the keyhole and if that wery same interestin' young creetur ain't let in vithout delay it's wery possible as his legs vill enter afore his countenance the young man gave a gentle kick at one of the lower panels of the door after he had given utterance to this hint as if to add force and point to the remark is that you sam inquired mr winkle springing out of bed quite unpossible to identify any gen'l'm'n vith any degree o' mental satisfaction vithout lookin' at him sir replied the voice dogmatically mr winkle not much doubting who the young man was unlocked the door which he had no sooner done than mr samuel weller entered with great precipitation and carefully re locking it on the inside deliberately put the key in his waistcoat pocket and after surveying mr winkle from head to foot said you're a wery humorous young gen'l'm'n you air sir what do you mean by this conduct sam inquired mr winkle indignantly get out sir this instant what do you mean sir what do i mean retorted sam come sir this is rayther too rich as the young lady said ven she remonstrated with the pastry cook arter he'd sold her a pork pie as had got nothin' but fat inside what do i mean well that ain't a bad un that ain't unlock that door and leave this room immediately sir said mr winkle i shall leave this here room sir just precisely at the wery same moment as you leaves it responded sam speaking in a forcible manner and seating himself with perfect gravity if i find it necessary to carry you away pick a back o' course i shall leave it the least bit o' time possible afore you but allow me to express a hope as you won't reduce me to extremities in saying vich i merely quote wot the nobleman said to the fractious pennywinkle ven he vouldn't come out of his shell by means of a pin and he conseqvently began to be afeared that he should be obliged to crack him in the parlour door at the end of this address which was unusually lengthy for him mr weller planted his hands on his knees and looked full in mr winkle's face with an expression of countenance that showed that he had not the remotest intention of being trifled with you're a amiably disposed young man sir i don't think resumed mr weller in a tone of moral reproof to go inwolving our precious governor in all sorts o' fanteegs ven he's made up his mind to go through everythink for principle you're far worse nor dodson sir and as for fogg i consider him a born angel to you mr weller having accompanied this last sentiment with an emphatic slap on each knee folded his arms with a look of great disgust and threw himself back in his chair as if awaiting the criminal's defence my good fellow said mr winkle extending his hand his teeth chattering all the time he spoke for he had been standing during the whole of mr weller's lecture in his night gear my good fellow i respect your attachment to my excellent friend and i am very sorry indeed to have added to his causes for disquiet there sam there well said sam rather sulkily but giving the proffered hand a respectful shake at the same time well so you ought to be and i am very glad to find you air for if i can help it i won't have him put upon by nobody and that's all about it certainly not sam said mr winkle there now go to bed sam and we'll talk further about this in the morning i'm wery sorry said sam but i can't go to bed not go to bed repeated mr winkle no said sam shaking his head can't be done you don't mean to say you're going back to night sam urged mr winkle greatly surprised not unless you particklerly wish it replied sam but mustn't leave this here room the governor's orders was peremptory nonsense sam said mr winkle i must stop here two or three days and more than that sam you must stop here too to assist me in gaining an interview with a young lady miss allen sam you remember her whom i must and will see before i leave bristol but in reply to each of these positions sam shook his head with great firmness and energetically replied it can't be done after a great deal of argument and representation on the part of mr winkle however and a full disclosure of what had passed in the interview with dowler sam began to waver and at length a compromise was effected of which the following were the main and principal conditions that sam should retire and leave mr winkle in the undisturbed possession of his apartment on the condition that he had permission to lock the door on the outside and carry off the key provided always that in the event of an alarm of fire or other dangerous contingency the door should be instantly unlocked that a letter should be written to mr pickwick early next morning and forwarded per dowler requesting his consent to sam and mr winkle's remaining at bristol for the purpose and with the object already assigned and begging an answer by the next coach if favourable the aforesaid parties to remain accordingly and if not to return to bath immediately on the receipt thereof and lastly that mr winkle should be understood as distinctly pledging himself not to resort to the window fireplace or other surreptitious mode of escape in the meanwhile these stipulations having been concluded sam locked the door and departed he had nearly got down stairs when he stopped and drew the key from his pocket i quite forgot about the knockin' down said sam half turning back the governor distinctly said it was to be done amazin' stupid o' me that 'ere never mind said sam brightening up it's easily done to morrow anyvays apparently much consoled by this reflection mr weller once more deposited the key in his pocket and descending the remainder of the stairs without any fresh visitations of conscience was soon in common with the other inmates of the house buried in profound repose chapter xi illustration mr samuel weller being entrusted with a mission of love proceeds to execute it with what success will hereinafter appear during the whole of the next day sam kept mr winkle steadily in sight fully determined not to take his eyes off him for one instant until he should receive express instructions from the fountain head however disagreeable sam's very close watch and great vigilance were to mr winkle he thought it better to bear with them than by any act of violent opposition to hazard being carried away by force which mr weller more than once strongly hinted was the line of conduct that a strict sense of duty prompted him to pursue there is little reason to doubt that sam would very speedily have quieted his scruples by bearing mr winkle back to bath bound hand and foot had not mr pickwick's prompt attention to the note which dowler had undertaken to deliver forestalled any such proceeding in short at eight o'clock in the evening mr pickwick himself walked into the coffee room of the bush tavern and told sam with a smile to his very great relief that he had done quite right and it was unnecessary for him to mount guard any longer i thought it better to come myself said mr pickwick addressing mr winkle as sam disencumbered him of his great coat and travelling shawl to ascertain before i gave my consent to sam's employment in this matter that you are quite in earnest and serious with respect to this young lady serious from my heart from my soul returned mr winkle with great energy remember said mr pickwick with beaming eyes we met her at our excellent and hospitable friend's winkle it would be an ill return to tamper lightly and without due consideration with this young lady's affections i'll not allow this sir i'll not allow it i have no such intention indeed exclaimed mr winkle warmly i have considered the matter well for a long time and i feel that my happiness is bound up in her that's wot we call tying it up in a small parcel sir interposed mr weller with an agreeable smile mr winkle looked somewhat stern at this interruption and mr pickwick angrily requested his attendant not to jest with one of the best feelings of our nature to which sam replied that he wouldn't if he was aware on it but there were so many on 'em that he hardly know'd which was the best ones ven he heer'd 'em mentioned mr winkle then recounted what had passed between himself and mr ben allen relative to arabella stated that his object was to gain an interview with the young lady and make a formal disclosure of his passion and declared his conviction founded on certain dark hints and mutterings of the aforesaid ben that wherever she was at present immured it was somewhere near the downs and this was his whole stock of knowledge or suspicion on the subject with this very slight clue to guide him it was determined that mr weller should start next morning on an expedition of discovery it was also arranged that mr pickwick and mr winkle who were less confident of their powers should parade the town meanwhile and accidentally drop in upon mr bob sawyer in the course of the day in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the young lady's whereabout accordingly next morning sam weller issued forth upon his quest in no way daunted by the very discouraging prospect before him and away he walked up one street and down another we were going to say up one hill and down another only it's all uphill at clifton without meeting with anything or anybody that tended to throw the faintest light on the matter in hand many were the colloquies into which sam entered with grooms who were airing horses on roads and nursemaids who were airing children in lanes but nothing could sam elicit from either the first mentioned or the last which bore the slightest reference to the object of his artfully prosecuted inquiries there were a great many young ladies in a great many houses the greater part whereof were ere shrewdly suspected by the male and female domestics to be deeply attached to somebody or perfectly ready to become so if opportunity offered but as none among these young ladies was miss arabella allen the information left sam at exactly the old point of wisdom at which he had stood before sam struggled across the downs against a good high wind wondering whether it was always necessary to hold your hat on with both hands in that part of the country and came to a shady by place about which were sprinkled several little villas of quiet and secluded appearance outside a stable door at the bottom of a long back lane without a thoroughfare a groom in undress was idling about apparently persuading himself that he was doing something with a spade and a wheelbarrow we may remark in this place that we have scarcely ever seen a groom near a stable in his lazy moments who has not been to a greater or less extent the victim of this singular delusion sam thought he might as well talk to this groom as to any one else especially as he was very tired with walking and there was a good large stone just opposite the wheelbarrow so he strolled down the lane and seating himself on the stone opened a conversation with the ease and freedom for which he was remarkable mornin' old friend said sam arternoon you mean replied the groom casting a surly look at sam you're wery right old friend said sam i do mean arternoon how are you why i don't find myself much the better for seeing you replied the ill tempered groom that's wery odd that is said sam for you look so uncommon cheerful and seem altogether so lively that it does vun's heart good to see you the surly groom looked surlier still at this but not sufficiently so to produce any effect upon sam who immediately inquired with a countenance of great anxiety whether his master's name was not walker no it ain't said the groom nor brown i s'pose said sam no it ain't nor vilson no nor that neither said the groom vell replied sam then i'm mistaken and he hasn't got the honour o' my acquaintance which i thought he had don't wait here out o' compliment to me said sam as the groom wheeled in the barrow and prepared to shut the gate ease afore ceremony old boy i'll excuse you i'd knock your head off for half a crown said the surly groom bolting one half of the gate couldn't afford to have it done on those terms rejoined sam it 'ud be worth a life's board vages at least to you and 'ud be cheap at that make my compliments indoors tell 'em not to vait dinner for me and say they needn't mind puttin' any by for it'll be cold afore i come in in reply to this the groom waxing very wroth muttered a desire to damage somebody's person but disappeared without carrying it into execution slamming the door angrily after him and wholly unheeding sam's affectionate request that he would leave him a lock of his hair before he went sam continued to sit on the large stone meditating upon what was best to be done and revolving in his mind a plan for knocking at all the doors within five miles of bristol taking them at a hundred and fifty or two hundred a day and endeavouring to find miss arabella by that expedient when accident all of a sudden threw in his way what he might have sat there for a twelvemonth and yet not found without it into the lane where he sat there opened three or four garden gates belonging to as many houses which though detached from each other were only separated by their gardens as these were large and long and well planted with trees the houses were not only at some distance off but the greater part of them were nearly concealed from view sam was sitting with his eyes fixed upon the dust heap outside the next gate to that by which the groom had disappeared profoundly turning over in his mind the difficulties of his present undertaking when the gate opened and a female servant came out into the lane to shake some bed side carpets sam was so very busy with his own thoughts that it is probable he would have taken no more notice of the young woman than just raising his head and remarking that she had a very neat and pretty figure if his feelings of gallantry had not been most strongly roused by observing that she had no one to help her and that the carpets seemed too heavy for her single strength mr weller was a gentleman of great gallantry in his own way and he no sooner remarked this circumstance then he hastily rose from the large stone and advanced towards her my dear said sam sliding up with an air of great respect you'll spile that wery pretty figure out o' all perportion if you shake them carpets by yourself let me help you the young lady who had been coyly affecting not to know that a gentleman was so near turned round as sam spoke no doubt indeed she said so afterwards to decline this offer from a perfect stranger when instead of speaking she started back and uttered a half suppressed scream sam was scarcely less staggered for in the countenance of the well shaped female servant he beheld the very features of his valentine the pretty housemaid from mr nupkins's vy mary my dear said sam lauk mr weller said mary how you do frighten one sam made no verbal answer to this complaint nor can we precisely say what reply he did make we merely know that after a short pause mary said lor do adun mr weller and that his hat had fallen off a few moments before from both of which tokens we should be disposed to infer that one kiss or more had passed between the parties illustration lor' do adun mr weller why how did you come here said mary when the conversation to which this interruption had been offered was resumed o' course i came to look arter you my darlin' replied mr weller for once permitting his passion to get the better of his veracity and how did you know i was here inquired mary who could have told you that i took another service at ipswich and that they afterwards moved all the way here who could have told you that mr weller ah to be sure said sam with a cunning look that's the pint who could ha' told me it wasn't mr muzzle was it inquired mary oh no replied sam with a solemn shake of the head it warn't him it must have been the cook said mary o' course it must said sam well i never heard the like of that exclaimed mary no more did i said sam but mary my dear here sam's manner grew extremely affectionate mary my dear i've got another affair in hand as is wery pressin' there's one o' my governor's friends mr winkle you remember him him in the green coat said mary oh yes i remember him well said sam he's in a horrid state o' love reg'larly comfoozled and done over with it lor interposed mary yes said sam but that's nothing if we could find out the young 'ooman and here sam with many digressions upon the personal beauty of mary and the unspeakable tortures he had experienced since he last saw her gave a faithful account of mr winkle's present predicament well said mary i never did o' course not said sam nobody never did nor never vill neither and here am i a walkin' about like the wandering jew a sportin' character you have perhaps heerd on mary my dear as wos alvays doin' a match agin' time and never vent to sleep looking arter this here miss arabella allen miss who said mary in great astonishment miss arabella allen said sam goodness gracious said mary pointing the garden door which the sulky groom had locked after him why it's that very house she's been living there these six weeks their upper housemaid which is lady's maid too told me all about it over the wash house palin's before the family was out of bed one mornin' wot the wery next door to you said sam the very next replied mary mr weller was so deeply overcome on receiving this intelligence that he found it absolutely necessary to cling to his fair informant for support and divers little love passages had passed between them before he was sufficiently collected to return to the subject vell said sam at length if this don't beat cock fightin' nothin' never vill as the lord mayor said ven the chief secretary o' state proposed his missis's health arter dinner that wery next house wy i've got a message to her as i've been a tryin' all day to deliver ah said mary but you can't deliver it now because she only walks in the garden in the evening and then only for a very little time she never goes out without the old lady sam ruminated for a few moments and finally hit upon the following plan of operations that he should return just at dusk the time at which arabella invariably took her walk and being admitted by mary into the garden of the house to which she belonged would contrive to scramble up the wall beneath the overhanging boughs of a large pear tree which would effectually screen him from observation would there deliver his message and arrange if possible an interview on behalf of mr winkle for the ensuing evening at the same hour having made this arrangement with great despatch he assisted mary in the long deferred occupation of shaking the carpets it is not half as innocent a thing as it looks that shaking little pieces of carpet at least there may be no great harm in the shaking but the folding is a very insidious process so long as the shaking lasts and the two parties are kept the carpet's length apart it is as innocent an amusement as can well be devised but when the folding begins and the distance between them get gradually lessened from one half its former length to a quarter and then to an eighth and then to a sixteenth and then to a thirty second if the carpet be long enough it becomes dangerous we do not know to a nicety how many pieces of carpet were folded in this instance but we can venture to state that as many pieces as there were so many times did sam kiss the pretty housemaid mr weller regaled himself with moderation at the nearest tavern until it was nearly dusk and then returned to the lane without the thoroughfare having been admitted into the garden by mary and having received from that lady sundry admonitions concerning the safety of his limbs and neck sam mounted into the pear tree to wait until arabella should come in sight he waited so long without this anxiously expected event occurring that he began to think it was not going to take place at all when he heard light footsteps upon the gravel and immediately afterwards beheld arabella walking pensively down the garden as soon as she came nearly below the tree sam began by way of gently indicating his presence to make sundry diabolical noises similar to those which would probably be natural to a person of middle age who had been afflicted with a combination of inflammatory sore throat croup and hooping cough from his earliest infancy upon this the young lady cast a hurried glance towards the spot from whence the dreadful sounds proceeded and her previous alarm being not at all diminished when she saw a man among the branches she would most certainly have decamped and alarmed the house had not fear fortunately deprived her of the power of moving and caused her to sink down on a garden seat which happened by good luck to be near at hand she's a goin' off soliloquised sam in great perplexity wot a thing it is as these here young creeturs will go a faintin' avay just ven they oughtn't to here young 'ooman miss sawbones mrs vinkle don't whether it was the magic of mr winkle's name or the coolness of the open air or some recollection of mr weller's voice that revived arabella matters not she raised her head and languidly inquired who's that and what do you want hush said sam swinging himself on to the wall and crouching there in as small a compass as he could reduce himself to only me miss only me mr pickwick's servant said arabella earnestly the wery same miss replied sam here's mr vinkle reg'larly sewed up vith desperation miss ah said arabella drawing nearer the wall ah indeed said sam ve thought ve should ha' been obliged to straight veskit him last night he's been a ravin' all day and he says if he can't see you afore to morrow night's over he vishes he may be somethin' unpleasanted if he don't drownd hisself oh no no mr weller said arabella clasping her hands that's wot he says miss replied sam he's a man of his word and it's my opinion he'll do it miss he's heerd all about you from the sawbones in barnacles from my brother said arabella having some faint recognition of sam's description i don't rightly know which is your brother miss replied sam is it the dirtiest vun o' the two yes yes mr weller returned arabella go on make haste pray well miss said sam he's heerd all about it from him and it's the gov'nor's opinion that if you don't see him wery quick the sawbones as we've been a speaking on 'ull get as much extra lead in his head as'll damage the dewelopment o' the orgins if they ever put it in spirits artervards oh what can i do to prevent these dreadful quarrels exclaimed arabella it's the suspicion of a priory 'tachment as is the cause of it all replied sam you'd better see him miss but how where cried arabella i dare not leave the house alone my brother is so unkind so unreasonable i know how strange my talking thus to you must appear mr weller but i am very very unhappy and here poor arabella wept so bitterly that sam grew chivalrous it may seem wery strange talkin' to me about these here affairs miss said sam with great vehemence but all i can say is that i'm not only ready but villin' to do anythin' as'll make matters agreeable and if chuckin' either o' them sawboneses out o' winder 'ull do it i'm the man as sam weller said his he tucked up his wristbands at the imminent hazard of falling off the wall in so doing to intimate his readiness to set to work immediately flattering as these professions of good feeling were arabella resolutely declined most unaccountably as sam thought to avail herself of them for some time she strenuously refused to grant mr winkle the interview sam had so pathetically requested but at length when the conversation threatened to be interrupted by the unwelcome arrival of a third party she hurriedly gave him to understand with many professions of gratitude that it was barely possible she might be in the garden an hour later next evening sam understood this perfectly well and arabella bestowing upon him one of her sweetest smiles tripped gracefully away leaving mr weller in a state of very great admiration of her charms both personal and mental having descended in safety from the wall and not forgotten to devote a few moments to his own particular business in the same department mr weller then made the best of his way back to the bush where his prolonged absence had occasioned much speculation and some alarm we must be careful said mr pickwick after listening attentively to sam's tale not for our own sakes but for that of the young lady we must be very cautious we said mr winkle with marked emphasis mr pickwick's momentary look of indignation at the tone of this remark subsided into his characteristic expression of benevolence as he replied we sir i shall accompany you you said mr winkle i replied mr pickwick mildly in affording you this interview the young lady has taken a natural perhaps but still a very imprudent step if i am present at the meeting a mutual friend who is old enough to be the father of both parties the voice of calumny can never be raised against her hereafter mr pickwick's eyes lightened with honest exultation at his own foresight as he spoke thus mr winkle was touched by this little trait of his delicate respect for the young protge of his friend and took his hand with a feeling of regard akin to veneration you shall go said mr winkle i will said mr pickwick sam have my great coat and shawl ready and order a conveyance to be at the door to morrow evening rather earlier than is absolutely necessary in order that we may be in good time mr weller touched his hat as an earnest of his obedience and withdrew to make all needful preparations for the expedition the coach was punctual to the time appointed and mr weller after duly installing mr pickwick and mr winkle inside took his seat on the box by the driver they alighted as had been agreed on about a quarter of a mile from the place of rendezvous and desiring the coachman to await their return proceeded the remaining distance on foot it was at this stage of the undertaking that mr pickwick with many smiles and various other indications of great self satisfaction produced from one of his coat pockets a dark lantern with which he had specially provided himself for the occasion and the great mechanical beauty of which he proceeded to explain to mr winkle as they walked along to the no small surprise of the few stragglers they met i should have been the better for something of this kind in my last garden expedition at night eh sam said mr pickwick looking good humouredly round at his follower who was trudging behind wery nice things if they're managed properly sir replied mr weller but when you don't want to be seen i think they're more useful arter the candle's gone out than ven it's alight mr pickwick appeared struck with sam's remarks for he put the lantern into his pocket again and they walked on in silence down here sir said sam let me lead the way this is the lane sir down the lane they went and dark enough it was mr pickwick brought out the lantern once or twice as they groped their way along and threw a very brilliant little tunnel of light before them about a foot in diameter it was very pretty to look at but seemed to have the effect of rendering surrounding objects rather darker than before at length they arrived at the large stone here sam recommended his master and mr winkle to seat themselves while he reconnoitred and ascertained whether mary was yet in waiting after an absence of five or ten minutes sam returned to say that the gate was opened and all quiet following him with stealthy tread mr pickwick and mr winkle soon found themselves in the garden here everybody said hush a good many times and that being done no one seemed to have any very distinct apprehension of what was to be done next is miss allen in the garden yet mary inquired mr winkle much agitated i don't know sir replied the pretty housemaid the best thing to be done sir will be for mr weller to give you a hoist up into the tree and perhaps mr pickwick will have the goodness to see that nobody comes up the lane while i watch at the other end of the garden goodness gracious what's that that 'ere blessed lantern 'ull be the death on us all exclaimed sam peevishly take care wot you're a doin' on sir you're a sendin' a blaze o' light right into the back parlour winder dear me said mr pickwick turning hastily aside i didn't mean to do that now it's in the next house sir remonstrated sam bless my heart exclaimed mr pickwick turning round again now it's in the stable and they'll think the place is afire said sam shut it up sir can't you it's the most extraordinary lantern i ever met with in all my life exclaimed mr pickwick greatly bewildered by the effects he had so unintentionally produced i never saw such a powerful reflector it'll be vun too powerful for us if you keep blazin' avay in that manner sir replied sam as mr pickwick after various unsuccessful efforts managed to close the slide there's the young lady's footsteps now mr vinkle sir up vith you stop stop said mr pickwick i must speak to her first help me up sam gently sir said sam planting his head against the wall and making a platform of his back step a top o' that 'ere flower pot sir now then up vith you i'm afraid i shall hurt you sam said mr pickwick never mind me sir replied sam lend him a hand mr vinkle sir steady sir steady that's the time o' day as sam spoke mr pickwick by exertions almost supernatural in a gentleman of his years and weight contrived to get upon sam's back and sam gently raising himself up and mr pickwick holding on fast by the top of the wall while mr winkle clasped him tight by the legs they contrived by these means to bring his spectacles just above the level of the coping my dear said mr pickwick looking over the wall and catching sight of arabella on the other side don't be frightened my dear it's only me oh pray go away mr pickwick said arabella tell them all to go away i am so dreadfully frightened dear dear mr pickwick don't stop there you'll fall down and kill yourself i know you will now pray don't alarm yourself my dear said mr pickwick soothingly there is not the least cause for fear i assure you stand firm sam said mr pickwick looking down all right sir replied mr weller don't be longer than you can conweniently help sir you're rayther heavy only another moment sam replied mr pickwick i merely wished you to know my dear that i should not have allowed my young friend to see you in this clandestine way if the situation in which you are placed had left him any alternative and lest the impropriety of this step should cause you any uneasiness my love it may be a satisfaction to you to know that i am present that's all my dear indeed mr pickwick i am very much obliged to you for your kindness and consideration replied arabella drying her tears with her handkerchief she would probably have said much more had not mr pickwick's head disappeared with great swiftness in consequence of a false step on sam's shoulder which brought him suddenly to the ground he was up again in an instant however and bidding mr winkle make haste and get the interview over ran out into the lane to keep watch with all the courage and ardour of youth mr winkle himself inspired by the occasion was on the wall in a moment merely pausing to request sam to be careful of his master i'll take care on him sir replied sam leave him to me where is he what's he doing sam inquired mr winkle bless his old gaiters rejoined sam looking out at the garden door he's a keepin' guard in the lane vith that 'ere dark lantern like a amiable guy fawkes i never see such a fine creetur in my days blessed if i don't think his heart must ha' been born five and twenty year arter his body at least mr winkle stayed not to hear the encomium upon his friend he had dropped from the wall thrown himself at arabella's feet and by this time was pleading the sincerity of his passion with an eloquence worthy even of mr pickwick himself while these things were going on in the open air an elderly gentleman of scientific attainments was seated in his library two or three houses off writing a philosophical treatise and ever and anon moistening his clay and his labours with a glass of claret from a venerable looking bottle which stood by his side in the agonies of composition the elderly gentleman looked sometimes at the carpet sometimes at the ceiling and sometimes at the wall and when neither carpet ceiling nor wall afforded the requisite degree of inspiration he looked out of the window in one of these pauses of invention the scientific gentleman was gazing abstractedly on the thick darkness outside when he was very much surprised by observing a most brilliant light glide through the air at a short distance above the ground and almost instantaneously vanish after a short time the phenomenon was repeated not once or twice but several times at last the scientific gentleman laying down his pen began to consider to what natural causes these appearances were to be assigned they were not meteors they were too low they were not glow worms they were too high they were not will o' the wisps they were not fire flies they were not fire works what could they be some extraordinary and wonderful phenomenon of nature which no philosopher had ever seen before something which it had been reserved for him alone to discover and which he should immortalise his name by chronicling for the benefit of posterity full of this idea the scientific gentleman seized his pen again and committed to paper sundry notes of these unparalleled appearances with the date day hour minute and precise second at which they were visible all of which were to form the data of a voluminous treatise of great research and deep learning which should astonish all the atmospherical sages that ever drew breath in any part of the civilised globe he threw himself back in his easy chair wrapped in contemplations of his future greatness the mysterious light appeared more brilliantly than before dancing to all appearances up and down the lane crossing from side to side and moving in an orbit as eccentric as comets themselves the scientific gentleman was a bachelor he had no wife to call in and astonish so he rang the bell for his servant pruffle said the scientific gentleman there is something very extraordinary in the air to night did you see that said the scientific gentleman pointing out of the window as the light again became visible yes i did sir what do you think of it pruffle think of it sir yes you have been bred up in this country what should you say was the cause of those lights now the scientific gentleman smilingly anticipated pruffle's reply that he could assign no cause for them at all pruffle meditated i should say it was thieves sir said pruffle at length you're a fool and may go down stairs said the scientific gentleman thank you sir said pruffle and down he went but the scientific gentleman could not rest under the idea of the ingenious treatise he had projected being lost to the world which must inevitably be the case if the speculation of the ingenious mr pruffle were not stifled in its birth he put on his hat and walked quickly down the garden determined to investigate the matter to the very bottom now shortly before the scientific gentleman walked out into the garden mr pickwick had run down the lane as fast as he could to convey a false alarm that somebody was coming that way occasionally drawing back the slide of the dark lantern to keep himself from the ditch the alarm was no sooner given than mr winkle scrambled back over the wall and arabella ran into the house the garden gate was shut and the three adventurers were making the best of their way down the lane when they were startled by the scientific old gentleman unlocking his garden gate hold hard whispered sam who was of course the first of the party show a light for just vun second sir mr pickwick did as he was desired and sam seeing a man's head peeping out very cautiously within half a yard of his own gave it a gentle tap with his clenched fist which knocked it with a hollow sound against the gate having performed this feat with great suddenness and dexterity mr weller caught mr pickwick up on his back and followed mr winkle down the lane at a pace which considering the burden he carried was perfectly astonishing have you got your vind back agin sir inquired sam when they had reached the end quite quite now replied mr pickwick then come along sir said sam setting his master on his feet again come between us sir not half a mile to run think you're vinnin' a cup sir now for it thus encouraged mr pickwick made the very best use of his legs it may be confidently stated that a pair of black gaiters never got over the ground in better style than did those of mr pickwick on this memorable occasion the coach was waiting the horses were fresh the roads were good and the driver was willing the whole party arrived in safety at the bush before mr pickwick had recovered his breath in with you at once sir said sam as he helped his master out don't stop a second in the street arter that 'ere exercise beg your pardon sir continued sam touching his hat as mr winkle descended hope there warn't a priory 'tachment sir mr winkle grasped his humble friend by the hand and whispered in his ear it's all right sam quite right upon which mr weller struck three distinct blows upon his nose in token of intelligence smiled winked and proceeded to put the steps up with a countenance expressive of lively satisfaction as to the scientific gentleman he demonstrated in a masterly treatise that these wonderful lights were the effect of electricity and clearly proved the same by detailing how a flash of fire danced before his eyes when he put his head out of the gate and how he received a shock which stunned him for a quarter of an hour afterwards which demonstration delighted all the scientific associations beyond measure and caused him to be considered a light of science ever afterwards chapter xii illustration introduces mr pickwick to a new and not uninteresting scene in the great drama of life the remainder of the period which mr pickwick had assigned as the duration of the stay at bath passed over without the occurrence of anything material trinity term commenced on the expiration of its first week mr pickwick and his friends returned to london and the former gentleman attended of course by sam straightway repaired to his old quarters at the george and vulture on the third morning after their arrival just as all the clocks in the city were striking nine individually and somewhere about nine hundred and ninety nine collectively sam was taking the air in george yard when a queer sort of fresh painted vehicle drove up out of which there jumped with great agility throwing the reins to a stout man who sat beside him a queer sort of gentleman who seemed made for the vehicle and the vehicle for him the vehicle was not exactly a gig neither was it a stanhope it was not what is currently denominated a dog cart neither was it a taxed cart not a chaise cart nor a guillotined cabriolet and yet it had something of the character of each and every of these machines it was painted a bright yellow with the shafts and wheels picked out in black and the driver sat in the orthodox sporting style on cushions piled about two feet above the rail the horse was a bay a well looking animal enough but with something of a flash and dog fighting air about him nevertheless which accorded both with the vehicle and his master the master himself was a man of about forty with black hair and carefully combed whiskers he was dressed in a particularly gorgeous manner with plenty of articles of jewellery about him all about three sizes larger than those which are usually worn by gentlemen and a rough great coat to crown the whole into one pocket of his great coat he thrust his left hand the moment he dismounted while from the other he drew forth with his right a very bright and glaring silk handkerchief with which he whisked a speck or two of dust from his boots and then crumpling it in his hand swaggered up the court it had not escaped sam's attention that when this person dismounted a shabby looking man in a brown great coat shorn of divers buttons who had been previously slinking about on the opposite side of the way crossed over and remained stationary close by having something more than a suspicion of the object of the gentleman's visit sam preceded him to the george and vulture and turning sharp round planted himself in the centre of the doorway now my fine fellow said the man in the rough coat in an imperious tone attempting at the same time to push his way past now sir wot's the matter replied sam returning the push with compound interest come none of this my man this won't do with me said the owner of the rough coat raising his voice and turning white here smouch well wot's amiss here growled the man in the brown coat who had been gradually sneaking up the court during this short dialogue only some insolence of this young man's said the principal giving sam another push come none o' this gammon growled smouch giving him another and a harder one this last push had the effect which it was intended by the experienced mr smouch to produce for while sam anxious to return the compliment was grinding that gentleman's body against the doorpost the principal crept past and made his way to the bar whither sam after bandying a few epithetical remarks with mr smouch followed at once good morning my dear said the principal addressing the young lady at the bar with botany bay ease and new south wales gentility which is mr pickwick's room my dear show him up said the barmaid to a waiter without deigning another look at the exquisite in reply to his inquiry the waiter led the way up stairs as he was desired and the man in the rough coat followed with sam behind him who in his progress up the staircase indulged in sundry gestures indicative of supreme contempt and defiance to the unspeakable gratification of the servants and other lookers on mr smouch who was troubled with a hoarse cough remained below and expectorated in the passage mr pickwick was fast asleep in bed when his early visitor followed by sam entered the room the noise they made in so doing awoke him shaving water sam said mr pickwick from within the curtains shave you directly mr pickwick said the visitor drawing one of them back from the bed's head i've got an execution against you at the suit of bardell here's the warrant common pleas here's my card i suppose you'll come over to my house giving mr pickwick a friendly tap on the shoulder the sheriff's officer for such he was threw his card on the counterpane and pulled a gold toothpick from his waistcoat pocket namby's the name said the sheriff's deputy as mr pickwick took his spectacles from under the pillow and put them on to read the card namby bell alley coleman street at this point sam weller who had had his eyes fixed hitherto on mr namby's shining beaver interfered are you a quaker said sam i'll let you know who i am before i've done with you replied the indignant officer i'll teach you manners my fine fellow one of these fine mornings thankee said sam i'll do the same to you take your hat off with this mr weller in the most dexterous manner knocked mr namby's hat to the other side of the room with such violence that he had very nearly caused him to swallow the gold toothpick into the bargain illustration take your hat off observe this mr pickwick said the disconcerted officer gasping for breath i've been assaulted in the execution of my dooty by your servant in your chamber i'm in bodily fear i call you to witness this don't witness nothin' sir interposed sam shut your eyes up tight sir i'd pitch him out o' winder only he couldn't fall far enough 'cause o' the leads outside sam said mr pickwick in an angry voice as the attendant made various demonstrations of hostilities if you say another word or offer the slightest interference with this person i discharge you that instant but sir said sam hold your tongue interposed mr pickwick take that hat up again but this sam flatly and positively refused to do and after he had been severely reprimanded by his master the officer being in a hurry condescended to pick it up himself venting a great variety of threats against sam meanwhile which that gentleman received with perfect composure merely observing that if mr namby would have the goodness to put his hat on again he would knock it into the latter end of next week mr namby perhaps thinking that such a process might be productive of inconvenience to himself declined to offer the temptation and soon after called up smouch having informed him that the capture was made and that he was to wait for the prisoner until he should have finished dressing namby then swaggered out and drove away smouch requesting mr pickwick in a surly manner to be as alive as he could for it was a busy time drew up a chair by the door and sat there until he had finished dressing sam was then despatched for a hackney coach and in it the triumvirate proceeded to coleman street it was fortunate the distance was short for mr smouch besides possessing no very enchanting conversational powers was rendered a decidedly unpleasant companion in a limited space by the physical weakness to which we have elsewhere adverted the coach having turned into a very narrow and dark street stopped before a house with iron bars to all the windows the door posts of which were graced by the name and title of namby officer to the sheriffs of london the inner gate having been opened by a gentleman who might have passed for a neglected twin brother of mr smouch and who was endowed with a large key for the purpose mr pickwick was shown into the coffee room this coffee room was a front parlour the principal features of which were fresh sand and stale tobacco smoke mr pickwick bowed to the three persons who were seated in it when he entered and having despatched sam for perker withdrew into an obscure corner and from thence looked with some curiosity upon his new companions one of these was a mere boy of nineteen or twenty who though it was yet barely ten o'clock was drinking gin and water and smoking a cigar amusements to which judging from his inflamed countenance he had devoted himself pretty constantly for the last year or two of his life opposite him engaged in stirring the fire with the toe of his right boot was a coarse vulgar young man of about thirty with a sallow face and harsh voice evidently possessed of that knowledge of the world and captivating freedom of manner which is to be acquired in public house parlours and at low billiard tables the third tenant of the apartment was a middle aged man in a very old suit of black who looked pale and haggard and paced up and down the room incessantly stopping now and then to look with great anxiety out of the window as if he expected somebody and then resuming his walk you'd better have the loan of my razor this morning mr ayresleigh said the man who was stirring the fire tipping the wink to his friend the boy thank you no i shan't want it i expect i shall be out in the course of an hour or so replied the other in a hurried manner then walking again up to the window and once more returning disappointed he sighed deeply and left the room upon which the other two burst into a loud laugh well i never saw such a game as that said the gentleman who had offered the razor whose name appeared to be price never mr price confirmed the assertion with an oath and then laughed again when of course the boy who thought his companion one of the most dashing fellows alive laughed also you'd hardly think would you now said price turning towards mr pickwick that that chap's been here a week yesterday and never once shaved himself yet because he feels so certain he's going out in half an hour's time that he thinks he may as well put it off till he gets home poor man said mr pickwick are his chances of getting out of his difficulties really so great chances be d d replied price he hasn't half the ghost of one i wouldn't give that for his chance of walking about the streets this time ten years with this mr price snapped his fingers contemptuously and rang the bell give me a sheet of paper crookey said mr price to the attendant who in dress and general appearance looked something between a bankrupt grazier and a drover in a state of insolvency and a glass of brandy and water crookey d'ye hear i'm going to write to my father and i must have a stimulant or i shan't be able to pitch it strong enough into the old boy at this facetious speech the young boy it is almost needless to say was fairly convulsed that's right said mr price never say die all fun ain't it prime said the young gentleman you've some spirit about you you have said price you've seen something of life i rather think i have replied the boy he had looked at it through the dirty panes of glass in a bar door mr pickwick feeling not a little disgusted with this dialogue as well as with the air and manner of the two beings by whom it had been carried on was about to inquire whether he could not be accommodated with a private sitting room when two or three strangers of genteel appearance entered at sight of whom the boy threw his cigar into the fire and whispering to mr price that they had come to make it all right for him joined them at a table in the further end of the room it would appear however that matters were not going to be made all right quite so speedily as the young gentleman anticipated for a very long conversation ensued of which mr pickwick could not avoid hearing certain fragments regarding dissolute conduct and repeated forgiveness at last there were very distinct allusions made by the oldest gentleman of the party to one whitecross street at which the young gentleman notwithstanding his primeness and his spirit and his knowledge of life into the bargain reclined his head upon the table and howled dismally very much satisfied with this sudden bringing down of the youth's valour and this effectual lowering of his tone mr pickwick rang the bell and was shown at his own request into a private room furnished with a carpet table chairs sideboard and sofa and ornamented with a looking glass and various old prints here he had the advantage of hearing mrs namby's performance on a square piano overhead while the breakfast was getting ready when it came mr perker came too aha my dear sir said the little man nailed at last eh come come i'm not sorry for it either because now you'll see the absurdity of this conduct i've noted down the amount of the taxed costs and damages for which the ca sa was issued and we had better settle at once and lose no time namby is come home by this time i dare say what say you my dear sir shall i draw a cheque or will you the little man rubbed his hands with affected cheerfulness as he said this but glancing at mr pickwick's countenance could not forbear at the same time casting a desponding look towards sam weller perker said mr pickwick let me hear no more of this i beg i see no advantage in staying here so i shall go to prison to night you can't go to whitecross street my dear sir said perker impossible there are sixty beds in a ward and the bolt's on sixteen hours out of the four and twenty i would rather go to some other place of confinement if i can said mr pickwick if not i must make the best i can of that you can go to the fleet my dear sir if you're determined to go somewhere said perker that'll do said mr pickwick i'll go there directly i have finished my breakfast stop stop my dear sir not the least occasion for being in such a violent hurry to get into a place that most other men are as eager to get out of said the good natured little attorney we must have a habeas corpus there'll be no judge at chambers till four o'clock this afternoon you must wait till then very good said mr pickwick with unmoved patience then we will have a chop here at two see about it sam and tell them to be punctual mr pickwick remaining firm despite all the remonstrances and arguments of perker the chops appeared and disappeared in due course he was then put into another hackney coach and carried off to chancery lane after waiting half an hour or so for mr namby who had a select dinner party and could on no account be disturbed before there were two judges in attendance at serjeant's inn one king's bench and one common pleas and a great deal of business appeared to be transacting before them if the number of lawyers' clerks who were hurrying in and out with bundles of papers afforded any test when they reached the low archway which forms the entrance to the inn perker was detained a few moments parleying with the coachman about the fare and the change and mr pickwick stepping to one side to be out of the way of the stream of people that were pouring in and out looked about him with some curiosity the people that attracted his attention most were three or four men of shabby genteel appearance who touched their hats to many of the attorneys who passed and seemed to have some business there the nature of which mr pickwick could not divine they were curious looking fellows one was a slim and rather lame man in rusty black and a white neckerchief another was a stout burly person dressed in the same apparel with a great reddish black cloth round his neck a third was a little weazen drunken looking body with a pimply face they were loitering about with their hands behind them and now and then with an anxious countenance whispered something in the ear of some of the gentlemen with papers as they hurried by mr pickwick remembered to have very often observed them lounging under the archway when he had been walking past and his curiosity was quite excited to know to what branch of the profession these dingy looking loungers could possibly belong he was about to propound the question to namby who kept close beside him sucking a large gold ring on his little finger when perker bustled up and observing that there was no time to lose led the way into the inn as mr pickwick followed the lame man stepped up to him and civilly touching his hat held out a written card which mr pickwick not wishing to hurt the man's feelings by refusing courteously accepted and deposited in his waistcoat pocket now said perker turning round before he entered one of the offices to see that his companions were close behind him in here my dear sir hallo what do you want this last question was addressed to the lame man who unobserved by mr pickwick made one of the party in reply to it the lame man touched his hat again with all imaginable politeness and motioned towards mr pickwick no no said perker with a smile we don't want you my dear friend we don't want you i beg your pardon sir said the lame man the gentleman took my card i hope you will employ me sir the gentleman nodded to me i'll be judged by the gentleman himself you nodded to me sir pooh pooh nonsense you didn't nod to anybody pickwick a mistake a mistake said perker the gentleman handed me his card replied mr pickwick producing it from his waistcoat pocket i accepted it as the gentleman seemed to wish it in fact i had some curiosity to look at it when i should be at leisure i the little attorney burst into a loud laugh and returning the card to the lame man informing him it was all a mistake whispered to mr pickwick as the man turned away in dudgeon that he was only a bail a what exclaimed mr pickwick a bail replied perker a bail yes my dear sir half a dozen of 'em here bail you to any amount and only charge half a crown curious trade isn't it said perker regaling himself with a pinch of snuff what am i to understand that these men earn a livelihood by waiting about here to perjure themselves before the judges of the land at the rate of half a crown a crime exclaimed mr pickwick quite aghast at the disclosure why i don't exactly know about perjury my dear sir replied the little gentleman harsh word my dear sir very harsh word indeed it's a legal fiction my dear sir nothing more saying which the attorney shrugged his shoulders smiled took a second pinch of snuff and led the way into the office of the judge's clerk this was a room of specially dirty appearance with a very low ceiling and old panelled walls and so badly lighted that although it was broad day outside great tallow candles were burning on the desks at one end was a door leading to the judge's private apartment round which were congregated a crowd of attorneys and managing clerks who were called in in the order in which their respective appointments stood upon the file every time this door was opened to let a party out the next party made a violent rush to get in and as in addition to the numerous dialogues which passed between the gentlemen who were waiting to see the judge a variety of personal squabbles ensued between the greater part of those who had seen him there was as much noise as could well be raised in an apartment of such confined dimensions nor were the conversations of these gentlemen the only sounds that broke upon the ear standing on a box behind a wooden bar at another end of the room was a clerk in spectacles who was taking the affidavits large batches of which were from time to time carried into the private room by another clerk for the judge's signature there were a large number of attorneys' clerks to be sworn and it being a moral impossibility to swear them all at once the struggles of these gentlemen to reach the clerk in spectacles were like those of a crowd to get in at the pit door of a theatre when gracious majesty honours it with its presence another functionary from time to time exercised his lungs in calling over the names of those who had been sworn for the purpose of restoring to them their affidavits after they had been signed by the judge which gave rise to a few more scuffles and all these things going on at the same time occasioned as much bustle as the most active and excitable person could desire to behold there were yet another class of persons those who were waiting to attend summonses their employers had taken out which it was optional to the attorney on the opposite side to attend or not and whose business it was from time to time to cry out the opposite attorney's name to make certain that he was not in attendance without their knowledge for example leaning against the wall close beside the seat mr pickwick had taken was an office lad of fourteen with a tenor voice near him a common law clerk with a bass one a clerk hurried in with a bundle of papers and stared about him sniggle and blink cried the tenor porkin and snob growled the bass stumpy and deacon said the new comer nobody answered the next man who came in was hailed by the whole three and he in his turn shouted for another firm and then somebody else roared in a loud voice for another and so forth all this time the man in the spectacles was hard at work swearing the clerks the oath being invariably administered without any effort at the punctuation and usually in the following terms take the book in your right hand this is your name and hand writing you swear that the contents of this your affidavit are true so help you god a shilling you must get change i haven't got it well sam said mr pickwick i suppose they are getting the habeas corpus ready yes said sam and i vish they'd bring out the have his carcase it's wery unpleasant keepin' us vaitin' here i'd ha' got half a dozen have his carcases ready pack'd up and all by this time what sort of cumbrous and unmanageable machine sam weller imagined a habeas corpus to be does not appear for perker at that moment walked up and took mr pickwick away the usual forms having been gone through the body of samuel pickwick was soon afterwards confided to the custody of the tipstaff to be by him taken to the warden of the fleet prison and there detained until the amount of the damages and costs in the action of bardell against pickwick was fully paid and satisfied and that said mr pickwick laughing will be a very long time sam call another hackney coach perker my dear friend good bye i shall go with you and see you safe there said perker indeed replied mr pickwick i would rather go without any other attendant than sam as soon as i get settled i will write and let you know and i shall expect you immediately until then good bye as mr pickwick said this he got into the coach which had by this time arrived followed by the tipstaff sam having stationed himself on the box it rolled away a most extraordinary man that said perker as he stopped to pull on his gloves what a bankrupt he'd make sir observed mr lowten who was standing near how he would bother the commissioners he'd set 'em at defiance if they talked of committing him sir the attorney did not appear very much delighted with his clerk's professional estimate of mr pickwick's character for he walked away without deigning any reply the hackney coach jolted along fleet street as hackney coaches usually do the horses went better the driver said when they had anything before them they must have gone at a most extraordinary pace when there was nothing and so the vehicle kept behind a cart when the cart stopped it stopped and when the cart went on again it did the same mr pickwick sat opposite the tipstaff and the tipstaff sat with his hat between his knees whistling a tune and looking out of the coach window time performs wonders by the powerful old gentleman's aid even a hackney coach gets over half a mile of ground they stopped at length and mr pickwick alighted at the gate of the fleet the tipstaff looking over his shoulder to see that his charge was following close at his heels preceded mr pickwick into the prison turning to the left after they had entered they passed through an open door into a lobby from which a heavy gate opposite to that by which they had entered and which was guarded by a stout turnkey with a key in his hand led at once into the interior of the prison here they stopped while the tipstaff delivered his papers and here mr pickwick was apprised that he would remain until he had undergone the ceremony known to the initiated as sitting for your portrait sitting for my portrait said mr pickwick having your likeness taken sir replied the stout turnkey we're capital hands at likenesses here take 'em in no time and always exact walk in sir and make yourself at home mr pickwick complied with the invitation and sat himself down and mr weller who stationed himself at the back of the chair whispered that the sitting was merely another term for undergoing an inspection by the different turnkeys in order that they might know prisoners from visitors well sam said mr pickwick then i wish the artists would come this is rather a public place they von't be long sir i des say replied sam there's a dutch clock sir so i see observed mr pickwick and a bird cage sir said sam veels vithin veels a prison in a prison ain't it sir as mr weller made this philosophical remark mr pickwick was aware that the sitting had commenced the stout turnkey having been relieved from the lock sat down and looked at him carelessly from time to time while a long thin man who had relieved him thrust his hands beneath his coat tails and planting himself opposite took a good long view of him a third rather surly looking gentleman who had apparently been disturbed at his tea for he was disposing of the last remnant of a crust and butter when he came in stationed himself close to mr pickwick and resting his hands on his hips inspected him narrowly while two others mixed with the group and studied his features with most intent and thoughtful faces mr pickwick winced a good deal under the operation and appeared to sit very uneasily in his chair but he made no remark to anybody while it was being performed not even to sam who reclined upon the back of the chair reflecting partly on the situation of his master and partly on the great satisfaction it would have afforded him to make a fierce assault upon all the turnkeys there assembled one after the other if it were lawful and peaceable to do so at length the likeness was completed and mr pickwick was informed that he might now proceed into the prison where am i to sleep to night inquired mr pickwick why i don't rightly know about to night replied the stout turnkey you'll be chummed on somebody to morrow and then you'll be all snug and comfortable the first night's generally rather unsettled but you'll be set all squares to morrow after some discussion it was discovered that one of the turnkeys had a bed to let which mr pickwick could have for that night he gladly agreed to hire it if you'll come with me i'll show it you at once said the man it ain't a large 'un but it's an out and outer to sleep in this way sir they passed through the inner gate and descended a short flight of steps the key was turned after them and mr pickwick found himself for the first time in his life within the walls of a debtor's prison chapter xiii illustration what befell mr pickwick when he got into the fleet what prisoners he saw there and how he passed the night mr tom roker the gentleman who had accompanied mr pickwick into the prison turned sharp round to the right when he got to the bottom of the little flight of steps and led the way through an iron gate which stood open and up another short flight of steps into a long narrow gallery dirty and low paved with stone and very dimly lighted by a window at each remote end this said the gentleman thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking carelessly over his shoulder to mr pickwick this here is the hall flight oh replied mr pickwick looking down a dark and filthy staircase which appeared to lead to a range of damp and gloomy stone vaults beneath the ground and those i suppose are the little cellars where the prisoners keep their small quantities of coals unpleasant places to have to go down to but very convenient i dare say yes i shouldn't wonder if they was convenient replied the gentleman seeing that a few people live there pretty snug that's the fair that is my friend said mr pickwick you don't really mean to say that human beings live down in those wretched dungeons don't i replied mr roker with indignant astonishment why shouldn't i live live down there exclaimed mr pickwick live down there yes and die down there too wery often replied mr roker and what of that who's got to say anything agin it live down there yes and a wery good place it is to live in ain't it as roker turned somewhat fiercely upon mr pickwick in saying this and moreover muttered in an excited fashion certain unpleasant invocations concerning his own eyes limbs and circulating fluids the latter gentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the discourse no further mr roker then proceeded to mount another staircase as dirty as that which led to the place which had just been the subject of discussion in which ascent he was closely followed by mr pickwick and sam there said mr roker pausing for breath when they reached another gallery of the same dimensions as the one below this is the coffee room flight the one above's the third and the one above that's the top and the room where you're a going to sleep to night is the warden's room and it's this way come on having said all this in a breath mr roker mounted another flight of stairs with mr pickwick and sam weller following at his heels these staircases received light from sundry windows placed at some little distance above the floor and looking into a gravelled area bounded by a high brick wall with iron chevaux de frise at the top this area it appeared from mr roker's statement was the racket ground and it further appeared on the testimony of the same gentleman that there was a smaller area in that portion of the prison which was nearest farringdon street denominated and called the painted ground from the fact of its walls having once displayed the semblances of various men of war in full sail and other artistical effects achieved in bygone times by some imprisoned draughtsman in his leisure hours having communicated this piece of information apparently more for the purpose of discharging his bosom of an important fact than with any specific view of enlightening mr pickwick the guide having at length reached another gallery led the way into a small passage at the extreme end opened a door and disclosed an apartment of an appearance by no means inviting containing eight or nine iron bedsteads there said mr roker holding the door open and looking triumphantly round at mr pickwick there's a room mr pickwick's face however betokened such a very trifling portion of satisfaction at the appearance of his lodging that mr roker looked for a reciprocity of feeling into the countenance of samuel weller who until now had observed a dignified silence there's a room young man observed mr roker i see it replied sam with a placid nod of the head you wouldn't think to find such a room as this in the farringdon hotel would you said mr roker with a complacent smile to this mr weller replied with an easy and unstudied closing of one eye which might be considered to mean either that he would have thought it or that he would not have thought it or that he had never thought anything at all about it as the observer's imagination suggested having executed this feat and re opened his eye mr weller proceeded to inquire which was the individual bedstead that mr roker had so flatteringly described as an out and outer to sleep in that's it replied mr roker pointing to a very rusty one in a corner it would make any one go to sleep that bedstead would whether they wanted to or not i should think said sam eyeing the piece of furniture in question with a look of excessive disgust i should think poppies was nothing to it nothing at all said mr roker and i s'pose said sam with a sidelong glance at his master as if to see whether there were any symptoms of his determination being shaken by what passed i s'pose the other gen'l'm'n as sleeps here are gen'l'm'n nothing but it said mr roker one of 'em takes his twelve pints of ale a day and never leaves off smoking even at his meals he must be a first rater said sam a replied mr roker nothing daunted even by this intelligence mr pickwick smilingly announced his determination to test the powers of the narcotic bedstead for that night and mr roker after informing him that he could retire to rest at whatever hour he thought proper without any further notice or formality walked off leaving him standing with sam in the gallery it was getting dark that is to say a few gas jets were kindled in this place which was never light by way of compliment to the evening which had set in outside as it was rather warm some of the tenants of the numerous little rooms which opened into the gallery on either hand had set their doors ajar mr pickwick peeped into them as he passed along with great curiosity and interest here four or five great hulking fellows just visible through a cloud of tobacco smoke were engaged in noisy and riotous conversation over half emptied pots of beer or playing at all fours with a very greasy pack of cards in the adjoining room some solitary tenant might be seen poring by the light of a feeble tallow candle over a bundle of soiled and tattered papers yellow with dust and dropping to pieces from age writing for the hundredth time some lengthened statement of his grievances for the perusal of some great man whose eyes it would never reach or whose heart it would never touch in a third a man with his wife and a whole crowd of children might be seen making up a scanty bed on the ground or upon a few chairs for the younger ones to pass the night in and in a fourth and a fifth and a sixth and a seventh the noise and the beer and the tobacco smoke and the cards all came over again in greater force than before in the galleries themselves and more especially on the staircases there lingered a great number of people who came there some because their rooms were empty and lonesome others because their rooms were full and hot the greater part because they were restless and uncomfortable and not possessed of the secret of exactly knowing what to do with themselves there were many classes of people here from the labouring man in his fustian jacket to the broken down spendthrift in his shawl dressing gown most appropriately out at elbows but there was the same air about them all a listless jail bird careless swagger a vagabondish who's afraid sort of bearing which is wholly indescribable in words but which any man can understand in one moment if he wish by setting foot in the nearest debtor's prison and looking at the very first group of people he sees there with the same interest as mr pickwick did it strikes me sam said mr pickwick leaning over the iron rail at the stair head it strikes me sam that imprisonment for debt is scarcely any punishment at all think not sir inquired mr weller you see how these fellows drink and smoke and roar replied mr pickwick it's quite impossible that they can mind it much ah that's just the wery thing sir rejoined sam they don't mind it it's a regular holiday to them all porter and skittles it's the t'other vuns as gets done over vith this sort o' thing them down hearted fellers as can't svig avay at the beer nor play at skittles neither them as vould pay if they could and gets low by being boxed up i'll tell you wot it is sir them as is alvays a idlin' in public houses it don't damage at all and them as is alvays a workin' ven they can it damages too much 'it's unekal' as my father used to say ven his grog worn't made half and half it's unekal and that's the fault on it i think you're right sam said mr pickwick after a few moments' reflection quite right p'raps now and then there's some honest people as likes it observed mr weller in a ruminative tone but i never heerd o' one as i can call to mind 'cept the little dirty faced man in the brown coat and that wos force of habit and who was he inquired mr pickwick vy that's just the wery point as nobody never know'd replied sam but what did he do vy he did wot many men as has been much better know'd has done in their time sir replied sam he run a match agin the constable and vun it in other words i suppose said mr pickwick he got into debt just that sir replied sam and in course o' time he come here in consekens it warn't much execution for nine pound nothin' multiplied by five for costs but hows'ever here he stopped for seventeen year if he got any wrinkles in his face they wos stopped up vith the dirt for both the dirty face and the brown coat wos just the same at the end o' that time as they wos at the beginnin' he wos a wery peaceful inoffendin' little creetur and wos alvays a bustlin' about for somebody or playin' rackets and never vinnin' till at last the turnkeys they got quite fond on him and he wos in the lodge ev'ry night a chattering vith 'em and tellin' stories and all that 'ere vun night he wos in there as usual along vith a wery old friend of his as wos on the lock ven he says all of a sudden 'i ain't seen the market outside bill' he says fleet market wos there at that time 'i ain't seen the market outside bill' he says 'for seventeen year' 'i know you ain't' says the turnkey smoking his pipe 'i should like to see it for a minit bill' he says 'wery probable' says the turnkey smoking his pipe wery fierce and making believe he warn't up to what the little man wanted 'bill' says the little man more abrupt than afore 'i've got the fancy in my head let me see the public streets once more afore i die and if i ain't struck with apoplexy i'll be back in five minits by the clock' 'and wot 'ud become o' me if you wos struck with apoplexy' said the turnkey 'vy' says the little creetur 'whoever found me 'ud bring me home for i've got my card in my pocket bill' he says 'no coffee room flight' and that wos true sure enough for ven he wanted to make the acquaintance of any new comer he used to pull out a little limp card vith them words on it and nothin' else in consideration of vich he wos alvays called number tventy the turnkey takes a fixed look at him and at last he says in a solemn manner 'tventy' he says 'i'll trust you you won't get your old friend into trouble' 'no my boy i hope i've somethin' better behind here' says the little man and as he said it he hit his little veskit wery hard and then a tear started out o' each eye which wos wery extraordinary for it was supposed as water never touched his face he shook the turnkey by the hand out he vent and never came back again said mr pickwick wrong for vunce sir replied mr weller for back he come two minits afore the time a bilin' with rage sayin' how he'd been nearly run over by a hackney coach that he warn't used to it and he wos blowed if he wouldn't write to the lord mayor they got him pacified at last and for five years arter that he never even so much as peeped out o' the lodge gate at the expiration of that time he died i suppose said mr pickwick no he didn't sir replied sam he got a curiosity to go and taste the beer at a new public house over the way and it wos such a wery nice parlour that he took it into his head to go there every night vich he did for a long time always comin' back reg'lar about a quarter of an hour afore the gate shut vich wos all wery snug and comfortable at last he began to get so precious jolly that he used to forget how the time vent or care nothin' at all about it and he vent on gettin' later and later till vun night his old friend wos just a shuttin' the gate had turned the key in fact ven he come up 'hold hard bill' he says 'wot ain't you come home yet tventy' says the turnkey 'i thought you wos in long ago' 'no i wasn't' says the little man vith a smile 'well then i'll tell you wot it is my friend' says the turnkey openin' the gate wery slow and sulky 'it's my 'pinion as you've got into bad company o' late which i'm wery sorry to see now i don't wish to do nothing harsh' he says 'but if you can't confine yourself to steady circles and find your vay back at reg'lar hours as sure as you're a standin' there i'll shut you out altogether' the little man was seized vith a wiolent fit o' tremblin' and never vent outside the prison walls artervards as sam concluded mr pickwick slowly retraced his steps down stairs after a few thoughtful turns in the painted ground which as it was now dark was nearly deserted he intimated to mr weller that he thought it high time for him to withdraw for the night requesting him to seek a bed in some adjacent public house and return early in the morning to make arrangements for the removal of his master's wardrobe from the george and vulture this request mr samuel weller prepared to obey with as good a grace as he could assume but with a very considerable show of reluctance nevertheless he even went so far as to essay sundry ineffectual hints regarding the expediency of stretching himself on the gravel for that night but finding mr pickwick obstinately deaf to any such suggestions finally withdrew there is no disguising the fact that mr pickwick felt very low spirited and uncomfortable not for lack of society for the prison was very full and a bottle of wine would at once have purchased the utmost good fellowship of a few choice spirits without any more formal ceremony of introduction but he was alone in the coarse vulgar crowd and felt the depression of spirit and sinking of heart naturally consequent on the reflection that he was cooped and caged up without a prospect of liberation as to the idea of releasing himself by ministering to the sharpness of dodson and fogg it never for an instant entered his thoughts in this frame of mind he turned again into the coffee room gallery and walked slowly to and fro the place was intolerably dirty and the smell of tobacco smoke perfectly suffocating there was a perpetual slamming and banging of doors as the people went in and out and the noise of their voices and footsteps echoed and re echoed through the passages constantly a young woman with a child in her arms who seemed scarcely able to crawl from emaciation and misery was walking up and down the passage in conversation with her husband who had no other place to see her in as they passed mr pickwick he could hear the female sob and once she burst into such a passion of grief that she was compelled to lean against the wall for support while the man took the child in his arms and tried to soothe her mr pickwick's heart was really too full to bear it and he went up stairs to bed now although the warden's room was a very uncomfortable one being in every point of decoration and convenience several hundred degrees inferior to the common infirmary of a county gaol it had at present the merit of being wholly deserted save by mr pickwick himself so he sat down at the foot of his little iron bedstead and began to wonder how much a year the warden made out of the dirty room having satisfied himself by mathematical calculation that the apartment was about equal in annual value to the freehold of a small street in the suburbs of london he took to wondering what possible temptation could have induced a dingy looking fly that was crawling over his pantaloons to come into a close prison when he had the choice of so many airy situations a course of meditation which led him to the irresistible conclusion that the insect was mad after settling this point he began to be conscious that he was getting sleepy whereupon he took his nightcap out of the pocket in which he had had the precaution to stow it in the morning and leisurely undressing himself got into bed and fell asleep bravo heel over toe cut and shuffle pay away at it zephyr i'm smothered if the opera house isn't your proper hemisphere keep it up hooray these expressions delivered in a most boisterous tone and accompanied with loud peals of laughter roused mr pickwick from one of those sound slumbers which lasting in reality some half hour seem to the sleeper to have been protracted for three weeks or a month the voice had no sooner ceased than the room was shaken with such violence that the windows rattled in their frames and the bedsteads trembled again mr pickwick started up and remained for some minutes fixed in mute astonishment at the scene before him on the floor of the room a man in a broad skirted green coat with corduroy knee smalls and grey cotton stockings was performing the most popular steps of a hornpipe with a slang and burlesque caricature of grace and lightness which combined with the very appropriate character of his costume was inexpressibly absurd another man evidently very drunk who had probably been tumbled into bed by his companions was sitting up between the sheets warbling as much as he could recollect of a comic song with the most intensely sentimental feeling and expression while a third seated on one of the bedsteads was applauding both performers with the air of a profound connoisseur and encouraging them by such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused mr pickwick from his sleep this last man was an admirable specimen of a class of gentry which never can be seen in full perfection but in such places they may be met with in an imperfect state occasionally about stable yards and public houses but they never attain their full bloom except in these hot beds which would almost seem to be considerately provided by the legislature for the sole purpose of rearing them he was a tall fellow with an olive complexion long dark hair and very thick bushy whiskers meeting under his chin he wore no neckerchief as he had been playing rackets all day and his open shirt collar displayed their full luxuriance on his head he wore one of the common eighteenpenny french skull caps with a gaudy tassel dangling therefrom very happily in keeping with a common fustian coat his legs which being long were afflicted with weakness graced a pair of oxford mixture trousers made to show the full symmetry of those limbs being somewhat negligently braced however and moreover but imperfectly buttoned they fell in a series of not the most graceful folds over a pair of shoes sufficiently down at the heel to display a pair of very soiled white stockings there was a rakish vagabond smartness and a kind of boastful rascality about the whole man that was worth a mine of gold this figure was the first to perceive that mr pickwick was looking on upon which he winked to the zephyr and entreated him with mock gravity not to wake the gentleman why bless the gentleman's honest heart and soul said the zephyr turning round and affecting the extremity of surprise the gentleman is awake hem shakespeare how do you do sir how is mary and sarah sir and the dear old lady at home sir will you have the kindness to put my compliments into the first little parcel you're sending that way sir and say that i would have sent 'em before only i was afraid they might be broken in the waggon sir don't overwhelm the gentleman with ordinary civilities when you see he's anxious to have something to drink said the gentleman with the whiskers with a jocose air why don't you ask the gentleman what he'll take dear me i quite forgot replied the other what will you take sir will you take port wine sir or sherry wine sir i can recommend the ale sir or perhaps you'd like to taste the porter sir allow me to have the felicity of hanging up your nightcap sir with this the speaker snatched that article of dress from mr pickwick's head and fixed it in a twinkling on that of the drunken man who firmly impressed with the belief that he was delighting a numerous assembly continued to hammer away at the comic song in the most melancholy strains imaginable taking a man's nightcap from his brow by violent means and adjusting it on the head of an unknown gentleman of dirty exterior however ingenious a witticism in itself is unquestionably one of those which come under the denomination of practical jokes viewing the matter precisely in this light mr pickwick without the slightest intimation of his purpose sprang vigorously out of bed struck the zephyr so smart a blow in the chest as to deprive him of a considerable portion of the commodity which sometimes bears his name and then recapturing his nightcap boldly placed himself in an attitude of defence now said mr pickwick gasping no less from excitement than from the expenditure of so much energy come on both of you both of you with this liberal invitation the worthy gentleman communicated a revolving motion to his clenched fists by way of appalling his antagonists with a display of science illustration come on both of you it might have been mr pickwick's very unexpected gallantry or it might have been the complicated manner in which he had got himself out of bed and fallen all in a mass upon the hornpipe man that touched his adversaries touched they were for instead of then and there making an attempt to commit manslaughter as mr pickwick implicitly believed they would have done they paused stared at each other a short time and finally laughed outright well you're a trump and i like you all the better for it said the zephyr now jump into bed again or you'll catch the rheumatics no malice i hope said the man extending a hand the size of the yellow clump of fingers which sometimes swings over a glover's door certainly not said mr pickwick with great alacrity for now that the excitement was over he began to feel rather cool about the legs allow me the honour said the gentleman with the whiskers presenting his dexter hand and aspirating the h with much pleasure sir said mr pickwick and having executed a very long and solemn shake he got into bed again my name is smangle sir said the man with the whiskers oh said mr pickwick mine is mivins said the man in the stockings i am delighted to hear it sir said mr pickwick hem coughed mr smangle did you speak sir said mr pickwick no i did not sir said mr smangle i thought you did sir said mr pickwick all this was very genteel and pleasant and to make matters still more comfortable mr smangle assured mr pickwick a great many times that he entertained a very high respect for the feelings of a gentleman which sentiment indeed did him infinite credit as he could be in no wise supposed to understand them are you going through the court sir inquired mr smangle through the what said mr pickwick through the court portugal street the court for the relief of you know oh no replied mr pickwick no i am not going out perhaps suggested mivins i fear not replied mr pickwick i refuse to pay some damages and am here in consequence ah said mr smangle paper has been my ruin a stationer i presume sir said mr pickwick innocently stationer no no confound and curse me not so low as that no trade when i say paper i mean bills oh you use the word in that sense i see said mr pickwick damme a gentleman must expect reverses said smangle what of that here am i in the fleet prison well good what then i'm none the worse for that am i not a bit replied mr mivins and he was quite right for so far from mr smangle being any the worse for it he was something the better inasmuch as to qualify himself for the place he had obtained gratuitous possession of certain articles of jewellery which long before that had found their way to the pawnbroker's well but come said mr smangle this is dry work let's rinse our mouths with a drop of burnt sherry the last comer shall stand it mivins shall fetch it and i'll help to drink it that's a fair and gentlemanlike division of labour anyhow curse me unwilling to hazard another quarrel mr pickwick gladly assented to the proposition and consigned the money to mr mivins who as it was nearly eleven o'clock lost no time in repairing to the coffee room on his errand i say whispered smangle the moment his friend had left the room what did you give him half a sovereign said mr pickwick he's a devilish pleasant gentlemanly dog said mr smangle infernal pleasant i don't know anybody more so but here mr smangle stopped short and shook his head dubiously you don't think there is any probability of his appropriating the money to his own use said mr pickwick oh no mind i don't say that i expressly say that he's a devilish gentlemanly fellow said mr smangle but i think perhaps if somebody went down just to see that he didn't dip his beak into the jug by accident or make some confounded mistake in losing the money as he came up stairs it would be as well here you sir just run down stairs and look after that gentleman will you this request was addressed to a little timid looking nervous man whose appearance bespoke great poverty and who had been crouching on his bedstead all this while apparently stupefied by the novelty of his situation you know where the coffee room is said smangle just run down and tell that gentleman you've come to help him up with the jug or stop i'll tell you what i'll tell you how we'll do him said smangle with a cunning look how said mr pickwick send down word that he's to spend the change in cigars capital thought run and tell him that d'ye hear they shan't be wasted continued smangle turning to mr pickwick i'll smoke 'em this manoeuvring was so exceedingly ingenious and withal performed with such immovable composure and coolness that mr pickwick would have had no wish to disturb it even if he had had the power in a short time mr mivins returned bearing the sherry which mr smangle dispensed in two little cracked mugs considerately remarking with reference to himself that a gentleman must not be particular under such circumstances and that for his part he was not too proud to drink out of the jug in which to show his sincerity he forthwith pledged the company in a draught which half emptied it an excellent understanding having been by these means promoted mr smangle proceeded to entertain his hearers with a relation of divers romantic adventures in which he had been from time to time engaged involving various interesting anecdotes of a thorough bred horse and a magnificent jewess both of surpassing beauty and much coveted by the nobility and gentry of these kingdoms long before these elegant extracts from the biography of a gentleman were concluded mr mivins had betaken himself to bed and had set in snoring for the night leaving the timid stranger and mr pickwick to the full benefit of mr smangle's experiences nor were the two last named gentlemen as much edified as they might have been by the moving passages narrated mr pickwick had been in a state of slumber for some time when he had a faint perception of the drunken man bursting out afresh with the comic song and receiving from mr smangle a gentle intimation through the medium of the water jug that his audience were not musically disposed mr pickwick then once again dropped off to sleep with a confused consciousness that mr smangle was still engaged in relating a long story the chief point of which appeared to be that on some occasion particularly stated and set forth he had done a bill and a gentleman at the same time chapter xiv illustration illustrative like the preceding one of the old proverb that adversity brings a man acquainted with strange bed fellows likewise containing mr pickwick's extraordinary and startling announcement to mr samuel weller when mr pickwick opened his eyes next morning the first object upon which they rested was samuel weller seated upon a small black portmanteau intently regarding apparently in a condition of profound abstraction the stately figure of the dashing mr smangle while mr smangle himself who was already partially dressed was seated on his bedstead occupied in the desperately hopeless attempt of staring mr weller out of countenance we say desperately hopeless because sam with a comprehensive gaze which took in mr smangle's cap feet head face legs and whiskers all at the same time continued to look steadily on with every demonstration of lively satisfaction but with no more regard to mr smangle's personal sentiments on the subject than he would have displayed had he been inspecting a wooden statue or a straw embowelled guy fawkes well will you know me again said mr smangle with a frown i'd svear to you anyveres sir replied sam cheerfully don't be impertinent to a gentleman sir said mr smangle not on no account replied sam if you'll tell me ven he vakes i'll be upon the wery best extra super behaviour this observation having a remote tendency to imply that mr smangle was no gentleman kindled his ire mivins said mr smangle with a passionate air what's the office replied that gentleman from his couch who the devil is this fellow 'gad said mr mivins looking lazily out from under the bed clothes i ought to ask you that hasn't he any business here no replied mr smangle then knock him down stairs and tell him not to presume to get up till i come and kick him rejoined mr mivins with this prompt advice that excellent gentleman again betook himself to slumber the conversation exhibiting these unequivocal symptoms of verging on the personal mr pickwick deemed it a fit point at which to interpose sam said mr pickwick sir rejoined that gentleman has anything new occurred since last night nothin' partickler sir replied sam glancing at mr smangle's whiskers the late prewailance of a close and confined atmosphere has been rayther favourable to the growth of veeds of an alarmin' and sangvinary natur' but vith that 'ere exception things is quiet enough i shall get up said mr pickwick give me some clean things whatever hostile intentions mr smangle might have entertained his thoughts were speedily diverted by the unpacking of the portmanteau the contents of which appeared to impress him at once with a most favourable opinion not only of mr pickwick but of sam also who he took an early opportunity of declaring in a tone of voice loud enough for that eccentric personage to overhear was a regular thorough bred original and consequently the very man after his own heart as to mr pickwick the affection he conceived for him knew no limits now is there anything i can do for you my dear sir said smangle nothing that i am aware of i am obliged to you replied mr pickwick no linen that you want sent to the washerwoman's i know a delightful washerwoman outside that comes for my things twice a week and by jove how devilish lucky this is the day she calls shall i put any of those little things up with mine don't say anything about the trouble confound and curse it if one gentleman under a cloud is not to put himself a little out of the way to assist another gentleman in the same condition what's human nature thus spake mr smangle edging himself meanwhile as near as possible to the portmanteau and beaming forth looks of the most fervent and disinterested friendship there's nothing you want to give out for the man to brush my dear creature is there resumed smangle nothin' whatever my fine feller rejoined sam taking the reply into his own mouth p'raps if vun of us wos to brush without troubling the man it 'ud be more agreeable for all parties as the schoolmaster said wen the young gentleman objected to being flogged by the butler and there's nothing that i can send in my little box to the washerwoman's is there said smangle turning from sam to mr pickwick with an air of some discomfiture nothin' whatever sir retorted sam i'm afeerd the little box must be chock full o' your own as it is this speech was accompanied with such a very expressive look at that particular portion of mr smangle's attire by the appearance of which the skill of laundresses in getting up gentlemen's linen is generally tested that he was fain to turn upon his heel and for the present at any rate to give up all design on mr pickwick's purse and wardrobe he accordingly retired in dudgeon to the racket ground where he made a light and wholesome breakfast on a couple of the cigars which had been purchased on the previous night mr mivins who was no smoker and whose account for small articles of chandlery had also reached down to the bottom of the slate and been carried over to the other side remained in bed and in his own words took it out in sleep after breakfasting in a small closet attached to the coffee room which bore the imposing title of the snuggery the temporary inmate of which in consideration of a small additional charge had the unspeakable advantage of overhearing all the conversation in the coffee room aforesaid and after despatching mr weller on some necessary errands mr pickwick repaired to the lodge to consult mr roker concerning his future accommodation accommodation eh said that gentleman consulting a large book plenty of that mr pickvick your chummage ticket will be on twenty seven in the third oh said mr pickwick my what did you say your chummage ticket replied mr roker you're up to that not quite replied mr pickwick with a smile why said mr roker it's as plain as salisbury you'll have a chummage ticket upon twenty seven in the third and them as is in the room will be your chums are there many of them inquired mr pickwick dubiously three replied mr roker mr pickwick coughed one of 'em's a parson said mr roker filling up a little piece of paper as he spoke another's a butcher eh exclaimed mr pickwick a butcher repeated mr roker giving the nib of his pen a tap on the desk to cure it of a disinclination to mark what a thorough paced goer he used to be sure ly you remember tom martin neddy said roker appealing to another man in the lodge who was paring the mud off his shoes with a five and twenty bladed pocket knife i should think so replied the party addressed with a strong emphasis on the personal pronoun bless my dear eyes said mr roker shaking his head slowly from side to side and gazing abstractedly out of the grated windows before him as if he were fondly recalling some peaceful scene of his early youth it seems but yesterday that he whopped the coal heaver down fox under the hill by the wharf there i think i can see him now a coming up the strand between the two street keepers a little sobered by the bruising with a patch o' winegar and brown paper over his right eyelid and that 'ere lovely bulldog as pinned the little boy arterwards a following at his heels what a rum thing time is ain't it neddy the gentleman to whom these observations were addressed who appeared of a taciturn and thoughtful cast merely echoed the inquiry mr roker shaking off the poetical and gloomy train of thought into which he had been betrayed descended to the common business of life and resumed his pen do you know what the third gentleman is inquired mr pickwick not very much gratified by this description of his future associates what is that simpson neddy said mr roker turning to his companion what simpson said neddy why him in twenty seven in the third that this gentleman's going to be chummed on oh him replied neddy he's nothing exactly he was a horse chaunter he's a leg now ah so i thought rejoined mr roker closing the book and placing the small piece of paper in mr pickwick's hands that's the ticket sir very much perplexed by this summary disposition of his person mr pickwick walked back into the prison revolving in his mind what he had better do convinced however that before he took any other steps it would be advisable to see and hold personal converse with the three gentlemen with whom it was proposed to quarter him he made the best of his way to the third flight after groping about in the gallery for some time attempting in the dim light to decipher the numbers on the different doors he at length appealed to a potboy who happened to be pursuing his morning occupation of gleaning for pewter which is twenty seven my good fellow said mr pickwick five doors further on replied the potboy there's the likeness of a man being hung and smoking a pipe the while chalked outside the door guided by this direction mr pickwick proceeded slowly along the gallery until he encountered the portrait of a gentleman above described upon whose countenance he tapped with the knuckle of his fore finger gently at first and then audibly after repeating this process several times without effect he ventured to open the door and peep in there was only one man in the room and he was leaning out of window as far as he could without overbalancing himself endeavouring with great perseverance to spit upon the crown of the hat of a personal friend on the parade below as neither speaking coughing sneezing knocking nor any other ordinary mode of attracting attention made this person aware of the presence of a visitor mr pickwick after some delay stepped up to the window and pulled him gently by the coat tail the individual brought in his head and shoulders with great swiftness and surveying mr pickwick from head to foot demanded in a surly tone what the something beginning with a capital h he wanted i believe said mr pickwick consulting his ticket i believe this is twenty seven in the third well replied the gentleman i have come here in consequence of receiving this bit paper rejoined mr pickwick hand it over said the gentleman mr pickwick complied i think roker might have chummed you somewhere else said mr simpson for it was the leg after a very discontented sort of a pause mr pickwick thought so also but under all the circumstances he considered it a matter of sound policy to be silent mr simpson mused for a few moments after this and then thrusting his head out of the window gave a shrill whistle and pronounced some word aloud several times what the word was mr pickwick could not distinguish but he rather inferred that it must be some nickname which distinguished mr martin from the fact of a great number of gentlemen on the ground below immediately proceeding to cry butcher in imitation of the tone in which that useful class of society are wont diurnally to make their presence known at area railings subsequent occurrences confirmed the accuracy of mr pickwick's impression for in a few seconds a gentleman prematurely broad for his years clothed in a professional blue jean frock and top boots with circular toes entered the room nearly out of breath closely followed by another gentleman in very shabby black and a sealskin cap the latter gentleman who fastened his coat all the way up to his chin by means of a pin and a button alternately had a very coarse red face and looked like a drunken chaplain which indeed he was these two gentlemen having by turns perused mr pickwick's billet the one expressed his opinion that it was a rig and the other his conviction that it was a go having recorded their feelings in these very intelligible terms they looked at mr pickwick and each other in awkward silence it's an aggravating thing just as we got the beds so snug said the chaplain looking at three dirty mattresses each rolled up in a blanket which occupied one corner of the room during the day and formed a kind of slab on which were placed an old cracked basin ewer and soap dish of common yellow earthenware with a blue flower very aggravating mr martin expressed the same opinion in rather stronger terms mr simpson after having let a variety of expletive adjectives loose upon society without any substantive to accompany them tucked up his sleeves and began to wash the greens for dinner while this was going on mr pickwick had been eyeing the room which was filthily dirty and smelt intolerably close there was no vestige of either carpet curtain or blind there was not even a closet in it unquestionably there were but few things to put away if there had been one but however few in number or small in individual amount still remnants of loaves and pieces of cheese and damp towels and scrags of meat and articles of wearing apparel and mutilated crockery and bellows without nozzles and toasting forks without prongs do present somewhat of an uncomfortable appearance when they are scattered about the floor of a small apartment which is the common sitting and sleeping room of three idle men i suppose this can be managed somehow said the butcher after a pretty long silence what will you take to go out i beg your pardon replied mr pickwick what did you say i hardly understand you what will you take to be paid out said the butcher the regular chummage is two and six will you take three bob and a bender suggested the clerical gentleman well i don't mind that it's only twopence a piece more said mr martin what do you say now we'll pay you out for three and sixpence a week come and stand a gallon of beer down chimed in mr simpson there and drink it on the spot said the chaplain now i really am so wholly ignorant of the rules of this place returned mr pickwick that i do not yet comprehend you can i live anywhere else i thought i could not at this inquiry mr martin looked with a countenance of excessive surprise at his two friends and then each gentleman pointed with his right thumb over his left shoulder this action imperfectly described in words by the very feeble term of over the left when performed by any number of ladies or gentlemen who are accustomed to act in unison has a very graceful and airy effect its expression is one of light and playful sarcasm can you repeated mr martin with a smile of pity well if i knew as little of life as that i'd eat my hat and swallow the buckle whole said the clerical gentleman so would i added the sporting one solemnly after this introductory preface the three chums informed mr pickwick in a breath that money was in the fleet just what money was out of it that it would instantly procure him almost anything he desired and that supposing he had it and had no objection to spend it if he only signified his wish to have a room to himself he might take possession of one furnished and fitted to boot in half an hour's time with this the parties separated very much to their common satisfaction mr pickwick once more retracing his steps to the lodge and the three companions adjourned to the coffee room there to spend the five shillings which the clerical gentleman had with admirable prudence and foresight borrowed of him for the purpose i knowed it said mr roker with a chuckle when mr pickwick stated the object with which he had returned didn't i say so neddy the philosophical owner of the universal penknife growled an affirmative i knowed you'd want a room for yourself bless you said mr roker let me see you'll want some furniture you'll hire that of me i suppose that's the reg'lar thing with great pleasure replied mr pickwick there's a capital room up in the coffee room flight that belongs to a chancery prisoner said mr roker it'll stand you in a pound a week i suppose you don't mind that not at all said mr pickwick just step there with me said roker taking up his hat with great alacrity the matter's settled in five minutes lord why didn't you say at first that you was willing to come down handsome the matter was soon arranged as the turnkey had foretold the chancery prisoner had been there long enough to have lost friends fortune home and happiness and to have acquired the right of having a room to himself as he laboured however under the inconvenience of often wanting a morsel of bread he eagerly listened to mr pickwick's proposal to rent the apartment and readily covenanted and agreed to yield him up the sole and undisturbed possession thereof in consideration of the weekly payment of twenty shillings from which fund he furthermore contracted to pay out any person or persons that might be chummed upon it as they struck the bargain mr pickwick surveyed him with a painful interest he was a tall gaunt cadaverous man in an old great coat and slippers with sunken cheeks and a restless eager eye his lips were bloodless and his bones sharp and thin god help him the iron teeth of confinement and privation had been slowly filing him down for twenty years and where will you live meanwhile sir said mr pickwick as he laid the amount of the first week's rent in advance on the tottering table the man gathered up the money with a trembling hand and replied that he didn't know yet he must go and see where he could move his bed to i am afraid sir said mr pickwick laying his hand gently and compassionately on his arm i am afraid you will have to live in some noisy crowded place now pray consider this room your own when you want quiet or when any of your friends come to see you friends interposed the man in a voice which rattled in his throat if i lay dead at the bottom of the deepest mine in the world tight screwed down and soldered in my coffin rotting in the dark and filthy ditch that drags its slime along beneath the foundations of this prison i could not be more forgotten or unheeded than i am here i am a dead man dead to society without the pity they bestow on those whose souls have passed to judgment friends to see me my god i have sunk from the prime of life into old age in this place and there is not one to raise his hand above my bed when i lie dead upon it and say 'it is a blessing he is gone' the excitement which had cast an unwonted light over the man's face while he spoke subsided as he concluded and pressing his withered hands together in a hasty and disordered manner he shuffled from the room rides rather rusty said mr roker with a smile ah they're like the elephants they feel it now and then and it makes 'em wild having made this deeply sympathising remark mr roker entered upon his arrangements with such expedition that in a short time the room was furnished with a carpet six chairs a table a sofa bedstead a tea kettle and various small articles on hire at the very reasonable rate of seven and twenty shillings and sixpence per week now is there anything more we can do for you inquired mr roker looking round with great satisfaction and gaily chinking the first week's hire in his closed fist why yes said mr pickwick who had been musing deeply for some time are there any people here who run on errands and so forth outside do you mean inquired mr roker yes i mean who are able to go outside not prisoners yes there is said roker there's an unfortunate devil who has got a friend on the poor side that's glad to do anything of that sort he's been running odd jobs and that for the last two months shall i send him if you please rejoined mr pickwick stay no the poor side you say i should like to see it i'll go to him myself the poor side of a debtor's prison is as its name imports that in which the most miserable and abject class of debtors are confined a prisoner having declared upon the poor side pays neither rent nor chummage his fees upon entering and leaving the gaol are reduced in amount and he becomes entitled to a share of some small quantities of food to provide which a few charitable persons have from time to time left trifling legacies in their wills most of our readers will remember that until within a very few years past there was a kind of iron cage in the wall of the fleet prison within which was posted some man of hungry looks who from time to time rattled a money box and exclaimed in a mournful voice pray remember the poor debtors pray remember the poor debtors the receipts of this box when there were any were divided among the poor prisoners and the men on the poor side relieved each other in this degrading office although this custom has been abolished and the cage is now boarded up the miserable and destitute condition of these unhappy persons remains the same we no longer suffer them to appeal at the prison gates to the charity and compassion of the passers by but we still leave unblotted in the leaves of our statute book for the reverence and admiration of succeeding ages that just and wholesome law which declares that the sturdy felon shall be fed and clothed and that the penniless debtor shall be left to die of starvation and nakedness this is no fiction not a week passes over our heads but in every one of our prisons for debt some of these men must inevitably expire in the slow agonies of want if they were not relieved by their fellow prisoners turning these things in his mind as he mounted the narrow staircase at the foot of which roker had left him mr pickwick gradually worked himself to the boiling over point and so excited was he with his reflections on this subject that he had burst into the room to which he had been directed before he had any distinct recollection either of the place in which he was or of the object of his visit the general aspect of the room recalled him to himself at once but he had no sooner cast his eyes on the figure of a man who was brooding over the dusty fire than letting his hat fall on the floor he stood perfectly fixed and immovable with astonishment yes in tattered garments and without a coat his common calico shirt yellow and in rags his hair hanging over his face his features changed with suffering and pinched with famine there sat mr alfred jingle his head resting on his hand his eyes fixed upon the fire and his whole appearance denoting misery and dejection near him leaning listlessly against the wall stood a strong built countryman flicking with a worn out hunting whip the top boot that adorned his right foot his left being for he dressed by easy stages thrust into an old slipper horses dogs and drink had brought him there pell mell there was a rusty spur on the solitary boot which he occasionally jerked into the empty air at the same time giving the boot a smart blow and muttering some of the sounds by which a sportsman encourages his horse he was riding in imagination some desperate steeplechase at that moment poor wretch he never rode a match on the swiftest animal in his costly stud with half the speed at which he had torn along the course that ended in the fleet on the opposite side of the room an old man was seated on a small wooden box with his eyes riveted on the floor and his face settled into an expression of the deepest and most hopeless despair a young girl his little granddaughter was hanging about him endeavouring with a thousand childish devices to engage his attention but the old man neither saw nor heard her the voice that had been music to him and the eyes that had been light fell coldly on his senses his limbs were shaking with disease and the palsy had fastened on his mind there were two or three other men in the room congregated in a little knot and noisily talking among themselves there was a lean and haggard woman too a prisoner's wife who was watering with great solicitude the wretched stump of a dried up withered plant which it was plain to see could never send forth a green leaf again too true an emblem perhaps of the office she had come there to discharge such were the objects which presented themselves to mr pickwick's view as he looked round him in amazement the noise of some one stumbling hastily into the room roused him turning his eyes towards the door they encountered the new comer and in him through his rags and dirt he recognised the familiar features of mr job trotter mr pickwick exclaimed job aloud eh said jingle starting from his seat mr so it is queer place strange thing serves me right very mr jingle thrust his hands into the place where his trousers pockets used to be and dropping his chin upon his breast sank back into his chair mr pickwick was affected the two men looked so very miserable the sharp involuntary glance jingle had cast at a small piece of raw loin of mutton which job had brought in with him said more of their reduced state than two hours' explanation could have done mr pickwick looked mildly at jingle and said i should like to speak to you in private will you step out for an instant certainly said jingle rising hastily can't step far no danger of over walking yourself here spike park grounds pretty romantic but not extensive open for public inspection family always in town housekeeper desperately careful very you have forgotten your coat said mr pickwick as they walked out to the staircase and closed the door after them eh said jingle spout dear relation uncle tom couldn't help it must eat you know wants of nature and all that what do you mean gone my dear sir last coat can't help it lived on a pair of boots whole fortnight silk umbrella ivory handle week fact honour ask job knows it lived for three weeks upon a pair of boots and a silk umbrella with an ivory handle exclaimed mr pickwick who had only heard of such things in shipwrecks or read of them in constable's miscellany true said jingle nodding his head pawnbroker's shop duplicates here small sums mere nothing all rascals oh said mr pickwick much relieved by this explanation i understand you you have pawned your wardrobe everything job's too all shirts gone never mind saves washing nothing soon lie in bed starve die inquest little bone house poor prisoner common necessaries hush it up gentlemen of the jury warden's tradesmen keep it snug natural death coroner's order workhouse funeral serve him right all over drop the curtain jingle delivered this singular summary of his prospects in life with his accustomed volubility and with various twitches of the countenance to counterfeit smiles mr pickwick easily perceived that his recklessness was assumed and looking him full but not unkindly in the face saw that his eyes were moist with tears good fellow said jingle pressing his hand and turning his head away ungrateful dog boyish to cry can't help it bad fever weak ill hungry deserved it all but suffered much very wholly unable to keep up appearances any longer and perhaps rendered worse by the effort he had made the dejected stroller sat down on the stairs and covering his face with his hands sobbed like a child come come said mr pickwick with considerable emotion we'll see what can be done when i know all about the matter here job where is that fellow here sir replied job presenting himself on the staircase we have described him by the bye as having deeply sunken eyes in the best of times in his present state of want and distress he looked as if those features had gone out of town altogether here sir cried job come here sir said mr pickwick trying to look stern with four large tears running down his waistcoat take that sir take what in the ordinary acceptation of such language it should have been a blow as the world runs it ought to have been a sound hearty cuff for mr pickwick had been duped deceived and wronged by the destitute outcast who was now wholly in his power must we tell the truth it was something from mr pickwick's waistcoat pocket which chinked as it was given into job's hand and the giving of which somehow or other imparted a sparkle to the eye and a swelling to the heart of our excellent old friend as he hurried away sam had returned when mr pickwick reached his own room and was inspecting the arrangements that had been made for his comfort with a kind of grim satisfaction which was very pleasant to look upon having a decided objection to his master's being there at all mr weller appeared to consider it a high moral duty not to appear too much pleased with anything that was done said suggested or proposed well sam said mr pickwick well sir replied mr weller pretty comfortable now eh sam pretty vell sir responded sam looking round him in a disparaging manner have you seen mr tupman and our other friends yes i have seen 'em sir and they're a comin' to morrow and wos wery much surprised to hear they warn't to come to day replied sam you have brought the things i wanted mr weller in reply pointed to various packages which he had arranged as neatly as he could in a corner of the room very well sam said mr pickwick after a little hesitation listen to what i am going to say sam cert'nly sir rejoined mr weller fire away sir i have felt from the first sam said mr pickwick with much solemnity that this is not the place to bring a young man to nor an old 'un neither sir observed mr weller you're quite right sam said mr pickwick but old men may come here through their own heedlessness and unsuspicion and young men may be brought here by the selfishness of those they serve it is better for those young men in every point of view that they should not remain here do you understand me sam vy no sir i do not replied mr weller doggedly try sam said mr pickwick vell sir rejoined sam after a short pause i think i see your drift and if i do see your drift it's my 'pinion that you're a comin' it a great deal too strong as the mail coachman said to the snow storm ven it overtook him i see you comprehend me sam said mr pickwick independently of my wish that you should not be idling about a place like this for years to come i feel that for a debtor in the fleet to be attended by his man servant is a monstrous absurdity sam said mr pickwick for a time you must leave me oh for a time eh sir rejoined mr weller rather sarcastically yes for the time that i remain here said mr pickwick your wages i shall continue to pay any one of my three friends will be happy to take you were it only out of respect to me and if i ever do leave this place sam added mr pickwick with assumed cheerfulness if i do i pledge you my word that you shall return to me instantly now i'll tell you wot it is sir said mr weller in a grave and solemn voice this here sort o' thing won't do at all so don't let's hear no more about it i am serious and resolved sam said mr pickwick you air air you sir inquired mr weller firmly wery good sir then so am i thus speaking mr weller fixed his hat on his head with great precision and abruptly left the room sam cried mr pickwick calling after him sam here but the long gallery ceased to re echo the sound of footsteps sam weller was gone chapter xv illustration showing how mr samuel weller got into difficulties in a lofty room ill lighted and worse ventilated situated in portugal street lincoln's inn fields there sit nearly the whole year round one two three or four gentlemen in wigs as the case may be with little writing desks before them constructed after the fashion of those used by the judges of the land barring the french polish there is a box of barristers on their right hand there is an enclosure of insolvent debtors on their left and there is an inclined plane of most especially dirty faces in their front these gentlemen are the commissioners of the insolvent court and the place in which they sit is the insolvent court itself it is and has been time out of mind the remarkable fate of this court to be somehow or other held and understood by the general consent of all the destitute shabby genteel people in london as their common resort and place of refuge daily it is always full the steams of beer and spirits perpetually ascend to the ceiling and being condensed by the heat roll down the walls like rain there are more old suits of clothes in it at one time than will be offered for sale in all houndsditch in a twelvemonth more unwashed skins and grizzly beards than all the pumps and shaving shops between tyburn and whitechapel could render decent between sunrise and sunset it must not be supposed that any of these people have the least shadow of business in or the remotest connection with the place they so indefatigably attend if they had it would be no matter of surprise and the singularity of the thing would cease some of them sleep during the greater part of the sitting others carry small portable dinners wrapped in pocket handkerchiefs or sticking out of their worn out pockets and munch and listen with equal relish but no one among them was ever known to have the slightest personal interest in any case that was ever brought forward whatever they do there they sit from the first moment to the last when it is heavy rainy weather they all come in wet through and at such times the vapours of the court are like those of a fungus pit a casual visitor might suppose this place to be a temple dedicated to the genius of seediness there is not a messenger or process server attached to it who wears a coat that was made for him not a tolerably fresh or wholesome looking man in the whole establishment except a little white headed apple faced tipstaff and even he like an ill conditioned cherry preserved in brandy seems to have artificially dried and withered up into a state of preservation to which he can lay no natural claim the very barristers' wigs are ill powdered and their curls lack crispness but the attorneys who sit at a large bare table below the commissioners are after all the greatest curiosities the professional establishment of the more opulent of these gentlemen consists of a blue bag and a boy generally a youth of the jewish persuasion they have no fixed offices their legal business being transacted in the parlours of public houses or the yards of prisons whither they repair in crowds and canvass for customers after the manner of omnibus cads they are of a greasy and mildewed appearance and if they can be said to have any vices at all perhaps drinking and cheating are the most conspicuous among them their residences are usually on the outskirts of the rules chiefly lying within a circle of one mile from the obelisk in st george's fields their looks are not prepossessing and their manners are peculiar mr solomon pell one of this learned body was a fat flabby pale man in a surtout which looked green one minute and brown the next with a velvet collar of the same chameleon tints his forehead was narrow his face wide his head large and his nose all on one side as if nature indignant with the propensities she observed in him at his birth had given it an angry tweak which it had never recovered being short necked and asthmatic however he respired principally through this feature so perhaps what it wanted in ornament it made up in usefulness i'm sure to bring him through it said mr pell are you though replied the person to whom the assurance was pledged certain sure replied pell but if he'd gone to any irregular practitioner mind you i wouldn't have answered for the consequences ah said the other with open mouth no that i wouldn't said mr pell and he pursed up his lips frowned and shook his head mysteriously now the place where this discourse occurred was the public house just opposite to the insolvent court and the person with whom it was held was no other than the elder mr weller who had come there to comfort and console a friend whose petition to be discharged under the act was to be that day heard and whose attorney he was at that moment consulting and vere is george inquired the old gentleman mr pell jerked his head in the direction of a back parlour whither mr weller at once repairing was immediately greeted in the warmest and most flattering manner by some half dozen of his professional brethren in token of their gratification at his arrival the insolvent gentleman who had contracted a speculative but imprudent passion for horsing long stages which had led to his present embarrassments looked extremely well and was soothing the excitement of his feelings with shrimps and porter the salutation between mr weller and his friends was strictly confined to the freemasonry of the craft consisting of a jerking round of the right wrist and a tossing of the little finger into the air at the same time we once knew two famous coachmen they are dead now poor fellows who were twins and between whom an unaffected and devoted attachment existed they passed each other on the dover road every day for twenty four years never exchanging any other greeting than this and yet when one died the other pined away and soon afterwards followed him vell george said mr weller senior taking off his upper coat and seating himself with his accustomed gravity how is it all right behind and full inside all right old feller replied the embarrassed gentleman is the grey mare made over to anybody inquired mr weller anxiously george nodded in the affirmative vell that's all right said mr weller coach taken care on also con signed in a safe quarter replied george wringing the heads off half a dozen shrimps and swallowing them without any more ado wery good wery good said mr weller alvays see to the drag ven you go down hill is the vay bill all clear and straight for'erd the schedule sir said pell guessing at mr weller's meaning the schedule is as plain and satisfactory as pen and ink can make it mr weller nodded in a manner which bespoke his inward approval of these arrangements and then turning to mr pell said pointing to his friend george ven do you take his cloths off why replied mr pell he stands third on the opposed list and i should think it would be his turn in about half an hour i told my clerk to come over and tell us when there was a chance mr weller surveyed the attorney from head to foot with great admiration and said emphatically and what'll you take sir why really replied mr pell you're very upon my word and honour i'm not in the habit of it's so very early in the morning that actually i am almost well you may bring me three penn'orth of rum my dear the officiating damsel who had anticipated the order before it was given set the glass of spirits before pell and retired gentlemen said mr pell looking round upon the company success to your friend i don't like to boast gentlemen it's not my way but i can't help saying that if your friend hadn't been fortunate enough to fall into the hands that but i won't say what i was going to say gentlemen my service to you having emptied the glass in a twinkling mr pell smacked his lips and looked complacently round on the assembled coachmen who evidently regarded him as a species of divinity let me see said the legal authority what was i a saying gentlemen i think you was remarkin' as you wouldn't have no objection to another o' the same sir said mr weller with grave facetiousness ha ha laughed mr pell not bad not bad a professional man too at this time of the morning it would be rather too good a well i don't know my dear you may do that again if you please hem this last sound was a solemn and dignified cough in which mr pell observing an indecent tendency to mirth in some of his auditors considered it due to himself to indulge the late lord chancellor gentlemen was very fond of me said mr pell and wery creditable in him too interposed mr weller hear hear assented mr pell's client why shouldn't he be ah why indeed said a very red faced man who had said nothing yet and who looked extremely unlikely to say anything more why shouldn't he a murmur of assent ran through the company i remember gentlemen said pell dining with him on one occasion there was only us two but everything as splendid as if twenty people had been expected the great seal on a dumb waiter at his right hand and a man in a bag wig and suit of armour guarding the mace with a drawn sword and silk stockings which is perpetually done gentlemen night and day when he said 'pell' he said 'no false delicacy pell you're a man of talent you can get anybody through the insolvent court pell and your country should be proud of you' those were his very words 'my lord' i said 'you flatter me' 'pell' he said 'if i do i'm damned' did he say that inquired mr weller he did replied pell vell then said mr weller i say parliament ought to ha' took it up and if he'd been a poor man they would ha' done it but my dear friend argued mr pell it was in confidence in what said mr weller in confidence oh wery good replied mr weller after a little reflection if he damned his self in confidence o' course that was another thing of course it was said mr pell the distinction's obvious you will perceive alters the case entirely said mr weller go on sir no i will not go on sir said mr pell in a low and serious tone you have reminded me sir that this conversation was private private and confidential gentlemen gentlemen i am a professional man it may be that i am a good deal looked up to in my profession it may be that i am not most people know i say nothing observations have already been made in this room injurious to the reputation of my noble friend you will excuse me gentlemen i was imprudent i feel that i have no right to mention this matter without his concurrence thank you sir thank you thus delivering himself mr pell thrust his hands into his pockets and frowning grimly around rattled three halfpence with terrible determination this virtuous resolution had scarcely been formed when the boy and the blue bag who were inseparable companions rushed violently into the room and said at least the boy did for the blue bag took no part in the announcement that the case was coming on directly the intelligence was no sooner received than the whole party hurried across the street and began to fight their way into court a preparatory ceremony which has been calculated to occupy in ordinary cases from twenty five minutes to thirty mr weller being stout cast himself at once into the crowd with the desperate hope of ultimately turning up in some place which would suit him his success was not quite equal to his expectations for having neglected to take his hat off it was knocked over his eyes by some unseen person upon whose toes he had alighted with considerable force apparently this individual regretted his impetuosity immediately afterwards for muttering an indistinct exclamation of surprise he dragged the old man out into the hall and after a violent struggle released his head and face illustration after a violent struggle released his head and face samivel exclaimed mr weller when he was thus enabled to behold his rescuer sam nodded you're a dutiful and affectionate little boy you are ain't you said mr weller to come a bonnetin' your father in his old age how should i know who you wos responded the son do you s'pose i wos to tell you by the weight o' your foot vell that's wery true sammy replied mr weller mollified at once but wot are you a doin' on here your gov'ner can't do no good here sammy they won't pass that werdick they won't pass it sammy and mr weller shook his head with legal solemnity wot a perwerse old file it is exclaimed sam alvays a goin' on about werdicks and alleybis and that who said anything about the werdick mr weller made no reply but once more shook his head most learnedly leave off rattlin' that 'ere nob o' yourn if you don't want it to come off the springs altogether said sam impatiently and behave reasonable i vent all the vay down to the markis o' granby arter you last night did you see the marchioness o' granby sammy inquired mr weller with a sigh yes i did replied sam how wos the dear creetur a lookin' wery queer said sam i think she's a injurin' herself gradivally vith too much o' that 'ere pine apple rum and other strong medicines o' the same natur you don't mean that sammy said the senior earnestly i do indeed replied the junior mr weller seized his son's hand clasped it and let it fall there was an expression on his countenance in doing so not of dismay or apprehension but partaking more of the sweet and gentle character of hope a gleam of resignation and even of cheerfulness passed over his face too as he slowly said i ain't quite certain sammy i wouldn't like to say i wos altogether positive in case of any subsekent disappintment but i rayther think my boy i rayther think that the shepherd's got the liver complaint does he look bad inquired sam he's uncommon pale replied his father 'cept about the nose which is redder than ever his appetite is wery so so but he imbibes wunderful some thoughts of the rum appeared to obtrude themselves on mr weller's mind as he said this for he looked gloomy and thoughtful but he very shortly recovered as was testified by a perfect alphabet of winks in which he was only wont to indulge when particularly pleased vell now said sam about my affair just open them ears o' yourn and don't say nothin' till i've done with this brief preface sam related as succinctly as he could the last memorable conversation he had had with mr pickwick stop there by himself poor creetur exclaimed the elder mr weller without nobody to take his part it can't be done samivel it can't be done o' course it can't asserted sam i know'd that afore i came wy they'll eat him up alive sammy exclaimed mr weller sam nodded his concurrence in the opinion he goes in rayther raw sammy said mr weller metaphorically and he'll come out done so ex ceedin' brown that his most familiar friends won't know him roast pigeon's nothin' to it sammy again sam weller nodded it oughtn't to be samivel said mr weller gravely it mustn't be said sam cert'nly not said mr weller vell now said sam you've been a prophesyin' away wery fine like a red faced nixon as the sixpenny books gives picters on who wos he sammy inquired mr weller never mind who he was retorted sam he warn't a coachman that's enough for you i know'd a ostler o' that name said mr weller musing it warn't him said sam this here gen'l'm'n was a prophet wot's a prophet inquired mr weller looking sternly on his son wy a man as tells what's a goin' to happen replied sam i wish i'd know'd him sammy said mr weller p'raps he might ha' throw'd a small light on that 'ere liver complaint as we wos a speakin' on just now hows'ever if he's dead and ain't left the bisness to nobody there's an end on it go on sammy said mr weller with a sigh well said sam you've been a prophesyin' avay about wot'll happen to the gov'nor if he's left alone don't you see any vay o' takin' care on him no i don't sammy said mr weller with a reflective visage no vay at all inquired sam no vay said mr weller unless and a gleam of intelligence lighted up his countenance as he sunk his voice to a whisper and applied his mouth to the ear of his offspring unless it is getting him out in a turn up bedstead unbeknown to the turnkeys sammy or dressin' him up like a old 'ooman vith a green wail sam weller received both of these suggestions with unexpected contempt and again propounded his question no said the old gentleman if he von't let you stop there i see no vay at all it's no thoroughfare sammy no thoroughfare well then i'll tell you wot it is said sam i'll trouble you for the loan of five and twenty pound what good 'ull that do inquired mr weller never mind replied sam p'raps you may ask for it five minits artervards p'raps i may say i von't pay and cut up rough you von't think o' arrestin' your own son for the money and sendin' him off to the fleet will you you unnat'ral wagabone at this reply of sam's the father and son exchanged a complete code of telegraphic nods and gestures after which the elder mr weller sat himself down on a stone step and laughed till he was purple wot a old image it is exclaimed sam indignant at this loss of time what are you a settin' down there for conwertin' your face into a street door knocker ven there's so much to be done where's the money in the boot sammy in the boot replied mr weller composing his features hold my hat sammy having divested himself of this incumbrance mr weller gave his body a sudden wrench to one side and by a dexterous twist contrived to get his right hand into a most capacious pocket from whence after a great deal of panting and exertion he extricated a pocket book of the large octavo size fastened by a huge leathern strap from this ledger he drew forth a couple of whip lashes three or four buckles a little sample bag of corn and finally a small roll of very dirty bank notes from which he selected the required amount which he handed over to sam and now sammy said the old gentleman when the whip lashes and the buckles and the samples had been all put back and the book once more deposited at the bottom of the same pocket now sammy i know a gen'l'm'n here as'll do the rest o' the bisness for us in no time a limb o' the law sammy as has got brains like the frogs dispersed all over his body and reachin' to the wery tips of his fingers a friend of the lord chancellorship's sammy who'd only have to tell him what he wanted and he'd lock you up for life if that wos all i say said sam none o' that none o' wot inquired mr weller wy none o' them unconstitootional ways o' doing it retorted sam the have his carcase next to the perpetual motion is vun of the blessedest things as wos ever made i've read that 'ere in the newspapers wery of'en well wot's that got to do vith it inquired mr weller just this here said sam that i'll patronise the inwention and go in that vay no visperin's to the chancellorship i don't like the notion it mayn't be altogether safe vith reference to gettin' out agin deferring to his son's feeling upon this point mr weller at once sought the erudite solomon pell and acquainted him with his desire to issue a writ instantly for the sum of twenty five pounds and costs of process to be executed without delay upon the body of one samuel weller the charges thereby incurred to be paid in advance to solomon pell the attorney was in high glee for the embarrassed coach horser was ordered to be discharged forthwith he highly approved of sam's attachment to his master declared that it strongly reminded him of his own feelings of devotion to his friend the chancellor and at once led the elder mr weller down to the temple to swear the affidavit of debt which the boy with the assistance of the blue bag had drawn up on the spot meanwhile sam having been formally introduced to the white washed gentleman and his friends as the offspring of mr weller of the belle savage was treated with marked distinction and invited to regale himself with them in honour of the occasion an invitation which he was by no means backward in accepting the mirth of gentlemen of this class is of a grave and quiet character usually but the present instance was one of peculiar festivity and they relaxed in proportion after some rather tumultuous toasting of the chief commissioner and mr solomon pell who had that day displayed such transcendent abilities a mottled faced gentleman in a blue shawl proposed that somebody should sing a song the obvious suggestion was that the mottled faced gentleman being anxious for a song should sing it himself but this the mottled faced gentleman sturdily and somewhat offensively declined to do upon which as is not unusual in such cases a rather angry colloquy ensued gentlemen said the coach horser rather than disturb the harmony of this delightful occasion perhaps mr samuel weller will oblige the company raly gentlemen said sam i'm not wery much in the habit o' singin' without the instrument but anythin' for a quiet life as the man said when he took the sitivation at the light house with this prelude mr samuel weller burst at once into the following wild and beautiful legend which under the impression that it is not generally known we take the liberty of quoting we would beg to call particular attention to the monosyllable at the end of the second and fourth lines which not only enables the singer to take breath at those points but greatly assists the metre romance i bold turpin vunce on hounslow heath his bold mare bess bestrode er ven there he see'd the bishop's coach a coming along the road er so he gallops close to the 'orses' legs and he claps his head vithin and the bishop says sure as eggs is eggs this here's the bold turpin chorus and the bishop says sure as eggs is eggs this here's the bold turpin ii says turpin you shall eat your words with a sarse of leaden bul let so he puts a pistol to his mouth and he fires it down his gullet the coachman he not likin' the job set off at a full gal lop but dick put a couple of balls in his nob and perwailed on him to stop chorus sarcastically but dick put a couple of balls in his nob and perwailed on him to stop i maintain that that 'ere song's personal to the cloth said the mottled faced gentleman interrupting it at this point i demand the name o' that coachman nobody know'd replied sam he hadn't got his card in his pocket i object to the introduction o' politics said the mottled faced gentleman i submit that in the present company that 'ere song's political and wot's much the same that it ain't true i say that that coachman did not run away but that he died game game as pheasants and i won't hear nothin' said to the contrairey as the mottled faced gentleman spoke with great energy and determination and as the opinions of the company seemed divided on the subject it threatened to give rise to fresh altercation when mr weller and mr pell most opportunely arrived all right sammy said mr weller the officer will be here at four o'clock said mr pell i suppose you won't run away meanwhile eh ha ha p'raps my cruel pa 'ull relent afore then replied sam with a broad grin not i said the elder mr weller do said sam not on no account replied the inexorable creditor i'll give bills for the amount at sixpence a month said sam i won't take 'em said mr weller ha ha ha very good very good said mr solomon pell who was making out his little bill of costs a very amusing incident indeed benjamin copy that and mr pell smiled again as he called mr weller's attention to the amount thank you thank you said the professional gentleman taking up another of the greasy notes as mr weller took it from the pocket book three ten and one ten is five much obliged to you mr weller your son is a most deserving young man very much so indeed sir it's a very pleasant trait in a young man's character very much so added mr pell smiling smoothly round as he buttoned up the money wot a game it is said the elder mr weller with a chuckle a reg'lar prodigy son prodigal prodigal son sir suggested mr pell mildly never mind sir said mr weller with dignity i know wot's o'clock sir ven i don't i'll ask you sir by the time the officer arrived sam had made himself so extremely popular that the congregated gentlemen determined to see him to prison in a body so off they set the plaintiff and defendant walking arm in arm the officer in front and eight stout coachmen bringing up the rear at serjeant's inn coffee house the whole party halted to refresh and the legal arrangements being completed the procession moved on again some little commotion was occasioned in fleet street by the pleasantry of the eight gentlemen in the flank who persevered in walking four abreast it was also found necessary to leave the mottled faced gentleman behind to fight a ticket porter it being arranged that his friends should call for him as they came back nothing but these little incidents occurred on the way when they reached the gate of the fleet the cavalcade taking the time from the plaintiff gave three tremendous cheers for the defendant and after having shaken hands all round left him illustration the cavalcade gave three tremendous cheers sam having been formally delivered into the warden's custody to the intense astonishment of roker and to the evident emotion of even the phlegmatic neddy passed at once into the prison walked straight to his master's room and knocked at the door come in said mr pickwick sam appeared pulled off his hat and smiled ah sam my good lad said mr pickwick evidently delighted to see his humble friend again i had no intention of hurting your feelings yesterday my faithful fellow by what i said put down your hat sam and let me explain my meaning a little more at length won't presently do sir inquired sam certainly said mr pickwick but why not now i'd rayther not now sir rejoined sam why inquired mr pickwick 'cause said sam hesitating because of what inquired mr pickwick alarmed at his follower's manner speak out sam 'cause rejoined sam 'cause i've got a little bisness as i want to do what business inquired mr pickwick surprised at sam's confused manner nothin' partickler sir replied sam oh if it's nothing particular said mr pickwick with a smile you can speak with me first i think i'd better see arter it at once said sam still hesitating mr pickwick looked amazed but said nothing the fact is said sam stopping short well said mr pickwick speak out sam why the fact is said sam with a desperate effort p'raps i'd better see arter my bed afore i do anythin' else your bed exclaimed mr pickwick in astonishment yes my bed sir replied sam i'm a pris'ner i was arrested this here wery arternoon for debt you arrested for debt exclaimed mr pickwick sinking into a chair yes for debt sir replied sam and the man as puts me in 'ull never let me out till you go yourself bless my heart and soul ejaculated mr pickwick what do you mean wot i say sir rejoined sam if it's forty year to come i shall be a prisoner and i'm very glad on it and if it had been newgate it would ha' been just the same now the murder's out and damme there's an end on it with these words which he repeated with great emphasis and violence sam weller dashed his hat upon the ground in a most unusual state of excitement and then folding his arms looked firmly and fixedly in his master's face chapter xvi illustration treats of divers little matters which occurred in the fleet and of mr winkle's mysterious behaviour and shows how the poor chancery prisoner obtained his release at last mr pickwick felt a great deal too much touched by the warmth of sam's attachment to be able to exhibit any manifestation of anger or displeasure at the precipitate course he had adopted in voluntarily consigning himself to a debtor's prison for an indefinite period the only point on which he persevered in demanding any explanation was the name of sam's detaining creditor but this mr weller as perseveringly withheld it ain't o' no use sir said sam again and again he's a ma licious bad disposed vorldly minded spiteful windictive creetur with a hard heart as there ain't no soft'nin' as the wirtuous clergyman remarked of the old gen'l'm'n with the dropsy ven he said that upon the whole he thought he'd rayther leave his property to his vife than build a chapel vith it but consider sam mr pickwick remonstrated the sum is so small that it can very easily be paid and having made up my mind that you shall stop with me you should recollect how much more useful you would be if you could go outside the walls wery much obliged to you sir replied mr weller gravely but i'd rayther not rather not do what sam wy i'd rayther not let myself down to ask a favour o' this here unremorseful enemy but it is no favour asking him to take his money sam reasoned mr pickwick beg your pardon sir rejoined sam but it 'ud be a wery great favour to pay it and he don't deserve none that's where it is sir here mr pickwick rubbing his nose with an air of some vexation mr weller thought it prudent to change the theme of the discourse i takes my determination on principle sir remarked sam and you takes yours on the same ground vich puts me in mind o' the man as killed his self on principle vich o' course you've heerd on sir mr weller paused when he arrived at this point and cast a comical look at his master out of the corners of his eyes there is no 'of course' in the case sam said mr pickwick gradually breaking into a smile in spite of the uneasiness which sam's obstinacy had given him the fame of the gentleman in question never reached my ears no sir exclaimed mr weller you astonish me sir he wos a clerk in a gov'ment office sir was he said mr pickwick yes he wos sir rejoined mr weller and a wery pleasant gen'l'm'n too one o' the precise and tidy sort as puts their feet in little india rubber fire buckets ven it's vet weather and never has no other bosom friends but hare skins he saved up his money on principle wore a clean shirt ev'ry day on principle never spoke to none of his relations on principle 'fear they shou'd want to borrow money of him and wos altogether in fact an uncommon agreeable character he had his hair cut on principle vunce a fortnight and contracted for his clothes on the economic principle three suits a year and send back the old uns being a wery reg'lar gen'l'm'n he din'd ev'ry day at the same place were it wos one and nine to cut off the joint and a wery good one and nine's worth he used to cut as the landlord often said with the tears a tricklin' down his face let alone the way he used to poke the fire in the vinter time which wos a dead loss o' fourpence ha'penny a day to say nothin' at all o' the aggrawation o' seein' him do it so uncommon grand with it too 'post arter the next gen'l'm'n' he sings out ev'ry day ven he comes in 'see arter the times thomas let me look at the mornin' herald wen it's out o' hand don't forget to bespeak the chronicle and just bring the 'tizer vill you' and then he'd set vith his eyes fixed on the clock and rush out just a quarter of a minit afore the time to waylay the boy as wos a comin' in with the evenin' paper vich he'd read with such intense interest and persewerance as worked the other customers up to the wery confines o' desperation and insanity 'specially one i rascible old gen'l'm'n as the vaiter wos always obliged to keep a sharp eye on at sich times 'fear he should be tempted to commit some rash act with the carving knife vell sir here he'd stop occupyin' the best place for three hours and never takin' nothin' arter his dinner but sleep and then he'd go away to a coffee house a few streets off and have a small pot of coffee and four crumpets arter wich he'd walk home to kensington and go to bed one night he wos took very ill sends for a doctor doctor comes in a green fly with a kind o' robinson crusoe set o' steps as he could let down ven he got out and pull up arter him ven he got in to perwent the necessity o' the coachman's gettin' down and thereby undeceivin' the public by lettin' em see that it wos only a livery coat as he'd got on and not the trousers to match 'wot's the matter' said the doctor 'wery ill' says the patient 'wot have you been a eatin' on' says the doctor 'roast weal' says the patient 'wot's the last thing you dewoured' says the doctor 'crumpets' says the patient 'that's it' says the doctor 'i'll send you a box of pills directly and don't you never take no more of 'em' he says 'no more o' wot' says the patient 'pills' 'no crumpets' says the doctor 'wy' says the patient starting up in bed 'i've eat four crumpets ev'ry night for fifteen year on principle' 'well then you'd better leave 'em off on principle' says the doctor 'crumpets is wholesome sir' says the patient 'crumpets is not wholesome sir' says the doctor wery fierce 'but they're so cheap' says the patient comin' down a little 'and so wery fillin' at the price' 'they'd be dear to you at any price dear if you wos paid to eat 'em' says the doctor 'four crumpets a night' he says 'vill do your business in six months' the patient looks him full in the face and turns it over in his mind for a long time and at last he says 'are you sure o' that 'ere sir' 'i'll stake my professional reputation on it' says the doctor 'how many crumpets at a sittin' do you think 'ud kill me off at once' says the patient 'i don't know' says the doctor 'do you think half a crown's vurth 'ud do it' says the patient 'i think it might' says the doctor 'three shillin's vurth 'ud be sure to do it i s'pose' says the patient 'certainly' says the doctor 'wery good' says the patient 'good night' next mornin' he gets up has a fire lit orders in three shillin's vurth o' crumpets toasts 'em all eats' em all and blows his brains out what did he do that for inquired mr pickwick abruptly for he was considerably startled by this tragical termination of the narrative wot did he do it for sir reiterated sam vy in support of his great principle that crumpets wos wholesome and to show that he wouldn't be put out of his way for nobody with such like shiftings and changings of the discourse did mr weller meet his master's questioning on the night of his taking up his residence in the fleet finding all gentle remonstrance useless mr pickwick at length yielded a reluctant consent to his taking lodgings by the week of a bald headed cobbler who rented a small slip room in one of the upper galleries to this humble apartment mr weller moved a mattress and bedding which he hired of mr roker and by the time he lay down upon it at night was as much at home as if he had been bred in the prison and his whole family had vegetated therein for three generations do you always smoke arter you goes to bed old cock inquired mr weller of his landlord when they had both retired for the night yes i does young bantam replied the cobbler will you allow me to in quire vy you make up your bed under that 'ere deal table said sam 'cause i was always used to a four poster afore i came here and i find the legs of the table answer just as well replied the cobbler you're a character sir said sam i haven't got anything of the kind belonging to me rejoined the cobbler shaking his head and if you want to meet with a good one i'm afraid you'll find some difficulty in suiting yourself at this register office the above short dialogue took place as mr weller lay extended on his mattress at one end of the room and the cobbler on his at the other the apartment being illumined by the light of a rush candle and the cobbler's pipe which was glowing below the table like a red hot coal the conversation brief as it was predisposed mr weller strongly in his landlord's favour and raising himself on his elbow he took a more lengthened survey of his appearance than he had yet had either time or inclination to make he was a sallow man all cobblers are and had a strong bristly beard all cobblers have his face was a queer good tempered crooked featured piece of workmanship ornamented with a couple of eyes that must have worn a very joyous expression at one time for they sparkled yet the man was sixty by years and heaven knows how old by imprisonment so that his having any look approaching to mirth or contentment was singular enough he was a little man and being half doubled up as he lay in bed looked about as long as he ought to have been without his legs he had a great red pipe in his mouth and was smoking and staring at the rushlight in a state of enviable placidity have you been here long inquired sam breaking the silence which had lasted for some time twelve year replied the cobbler biting the end of his pipe as he spoke contempt inquired sam the cobbler nodded well then said sam with some sternness wot do you persewere in bein' obstinit for vastin' your precious life away in this here magnified pound vy don't you give in and tell the chancellorship that you're wery sorry for makin' his court contemptible and you won't do so no more the cobbler put his pipe in the corner of his mouth while he smiled and then brought it back to its old place again but said nothing vy don't you said sam urging his question strenuously ah said the cobbler you don't quite understand these matters what do you suppose ruined me now vy said sam trimming the rushlight i s'pose the beginnin' wos that you got into debt eh never owed a farden said the cobbler try again well perhaps said sam you bought houses vich is delicate english for goin' mad or took to buildin' which is a medical term for bein' incurable the cobbler shook his had and said try again you didn't go to law i hope said sam suspiciously never in my life replied the cobbler the fact is i was ruined by having money left me come come said sam that von't do i wish some rich enemy 'ud try to vork my destruction in that 'ere vay i'd let him oh i dare say you don't believe it said the cobbler quietly smoking his pipe i wouldn't if i was you but it's true for all that how wos it inquired sam half induced to believe the fact already by the look the cobbler gave him just this replied the cobbler an old gentleman that i worked for down in the country and a humble relation of whose i married she's dead god bless her and thank him for it was seized with a fit and went off where inquired sam who was growing sleepy after the numerous events of the day how should i know where he went said the cobbler speaking through his nose in an intense enjoyment of his pipe he went off dead oh that indeed said sam well well said the cobbler he left five thousand pound behind him and wery gen teel in him so to do said sam one of which continued the cobbler he left to me 'cause i'd married his relation you see wery good murmured sam and being surrounded by a great number of nieces and nevys as was always a quarrelling and fighting among themselves for the property he makes me his executor and leaves the rest to me in trust to divide it among 'em as the will prowided wot do you mean by leavin' it on trust inquired sam waking up a little if it ain't ready money where's the use on it it's a law term that's all said the cobbler i don't think that said sam shaking his head there's wery little trust at that shop hows'ever go on well said the cobbler when i was going to take out a probate of the will the nieces and nevys who was desperately disappointed at not getting all the money enters a caveat against it what's that inquired sam a legal instrument which is as much as to say it's no go replied the cobbler i see said sam a sort of brother in law o' the have his carcase well but continued the cobbler finding that they couldn't agree among themselves and consequently couldn't get up a case against the will they withdrew the caveat and i paid all the legacies i'd hardly done it when one nevy brings an action to set the will aside the case comes on some months afterwards afore a deaf old gentleman in a back room somewhere down by st paul's churchyard and arter four counsels had taken a day apiece to bother him regularly he takes a week or two to consider and read the evidence in six vollums and then gives his judgment that how the testator was not quite right in his head and i must pay all the money back again and all the costs i appealed the case came on before three or four very sleepy gentlemen who had heard it all before in the other court where they're lawyers without work the only difference being that there they're called doctors and in the other places delegates if you understand that and they very dutifully confirmed the decision of the old gentleman below after that we went into chancery where we are still and where i shall always be my lawyers have had all my thousand pound long ago and what between the estate as they call it and the costs i'm here for ten thousand and shall stop here till i die mending shoes some gentlemen have talked of bringing it before parliament and i dare say would have done it only they hadn't time to come to me and i hadn't power to go to them and they got tired of my long letters and dropped the business and this is god's truth without one word of suppression or exaggeration as fifty people both in this place and out of it very well know the cobbler paused to ascertain what effect his story had produced on sam but finding that he had dropped asleep knocked the ashes out of his pipe sighed put it down drew the bedclothes over his head and went to sleep too mr pickwick was sitting at breakfast alone next morning sam being busily engaged in the cobbler's room polishing his master's shoes and brushing the black gaiters when there came a knock at the door which before mr pickwick could cry come in was followed by the appearance of a head of hair and a cotton velvet cap both of which articles of dress he had no difficulty in recognising as the personal property of mr smangle how are you said that worthy accompanying the inquiry with a score or two of nods i say do you expect anybody this morning three men devilish gentlemanly fellows have been asking after you down stairs and knocking at every door on the hall flight for which they've been most infernally blown up by the collegians that had the trouble of opening 'em dear me how very foolish of them said mr pickwick rising yes i have no doubt they are some friends whom i rather expected to see yesterday friends of yours exclaimed smangle seizing mr pickwick by the hand say no more curse me they're friends of mine from this minute and friends of mivins's too infernal pleasant gentlemanly dog mivins isn't he said smangle with great feeling i know so little of the gentleman said mr pickwick hesitating that i i know you do interposed smangle clasping mr pickwick by the shoulder you shall know him better you'll be delighted with him that man sir said smangle with a solemn countenance has comic powers that would do honour to drury lane theatre has he indeed said mr pickwick ah by jove he has replied smangle hear him come the four cats in the wheelbarrow four distinct cats sir i pledge you my honour now you know that's infernal clever damme you can't help liking a man when you see these traits about him he's only one fault that little failing i mentioned to you you know as mr smangle shook his head in a confidential and sympathising manner at this juncture mr pickwick felt that he was expected to say something so he said ah and looked restlessly at the door ah echoed mr smangle with a long drawn sigh he's delightful company that man is sir i don't know better company anywhere but he has that one drawback if the ghost of his grandfather sir was to rise before him this minute he'd ask him for the loan of his acceptance on an eighteenpenny stamp dear me exclaimed mr pickwick yes added mr smangle and if he'd the power of raising him again he would in two months and three days from this time to renew the bill those are very remarkable traits said mr pickwick but i'm afraid that while we are talking here my friends may be in a state of great perplexity at not finding me i'll show 'em the way said smangle making for the door good day i won't disturb you while they're here you know by the bye as mr smangle pronounced the last three words he stopped suddenly re closed the door which he had opened and walking softly back to mr pickwick stepped close up to him on tip toe and said in a very soft whisper you couldn't make it convenient to lend me half a crown till the latter end of next week could you mr pickwick could scarcely forbear smiling but managing to preserve his gravity he drew forth the coin and placed it in mr smangle's palm upon which that gentleman with many nods and winks implying profound mystery disappeared in quest of the three strangers with whom he presently returned and having coughed thrice and nodded as many times as an assurance to mr pickwick that he would not forget to pay he shook hands all round in an engaging manner and at length took himself off my dear friends said mr pickwick shaking hands alternately with mr tupman mr winkle and mr snodgrass who were the three visitors in question i am delighted to see you the triumvirate were much affected mr tupman shook his head deploringly mr snodgrass drew forth his handkerchief with undisguised emotion and mr winkle retired to the window and sniffed aloud mornin' gen'l'm'n said sam entering at the moment with the shoes and gaiters avay with melincholly as the little boy said ven his school missis died velcome to the college gen'l'm'n this foolish fellow said mr pickwick tapping sam on the head as he knelt down to button up his master's gaiters this foolish fellow has got himself arrested in order to be near me what exclaimed the three friends yes gen'l'm'n said sam i'm a stand steady sir if you please i'm a pris'ner gen'l'm'n con fined as the lady said a prisoner exclaimed mr winkle with unaccountable vehemence hallo sir responded sam looking up wot's the matter sir i had hoped sam that nothing nothing said mr winkle precipitately there was something so very abrupt and unsettled in mr winkle's manner that mr pickwick involuntarily looked at his two friends for an explanation we don't know said mr tupman answering this mute appeal aloud he has been much excited for two days past and his whole demeanour very unlike what it usually is we feared there must be something the matter but he resolutely denies it no no said mr winkle colouring beneath mr pickwick's gaze there is really nothing i assure you there is nothing my dear sir it will be necessary for me to leave town for a short time on private business and i had hoped to have prevailed upon you to allow sam to accompany me mr pickwick looked more astonished than before i think faltered mr winkle that sam would have had no objection to do so but of course his being a prisoner here renders it impossible so i must go alone as mr winkle said these words mr pickwick felt with some astonishment that sam's fingers were trembling at the gaiters as if he were rather surprised or startled sam looked up at mr winkle too when he had finished speaking and though the glance they exchanged was instantaneous they seemed to understand each other do you know anything of this sam said mr pickwick sharply no i don't sir replied mr weller beginning to button with extraordinary assiduity are you sure sam said mr pickwick vy sir responded mr weller i'm sure so far that i've never heerd anythin' on the subject afore this moment if i makes any guess about it added sam looking at mr winkle i haven't got any right to say what it is 'fear it should be a wrong 'un i have no right to make any further inquiry into the private affairs of a friend however intimate a friend said mr pickwick after a short silence at present let me merely say that i do not understand this at all there we have had quite enough of the subject thus expressing himself mr pickwick led the conversation to different topics and mr winkle gradually appeared more at ease though still very far from being completely so they had all so much to converse about that the morning very quickly passed away and when at three o'clock mr weller produced upon the little dining table a roast leg of mutton and an enormous meat pie with sundry dishes of vegetables and pots of porter which stood upon the chairs or the sofa bedstead or where they could everybody felt disposed to do justice to the meal notwithstanding that the meat had been purchased and dressed and the pie made and baked at the prison cookery hard by to these succeeded a bottle or two of very good wine for which a messenger was despatched by mr pickwick to the horn coffee house in doctors' commons the bottle or two indeed might be more properly described as a bottle or six for by the time it was drunk and tea over the bell began to ring for strangers to withdraw but if mr winkle's behaviour had been unaccountable in the morning it became perfectly unearthly and solemn when under the influence of his feelings and his share of the bottle or six he prepared to take leave of his friend he lingered behind until mr tupman and mr snodgrass had disappeared and then fervently clenched mr pickwick's hand with an expression of face in which deep and mighty resolve was fearfully blended with the very concentrated essence of gloom good night my dear sir said mr winkle between his set teeth bless you my dear fellow replied the warm hearted mr pickwick as he returned the pressure of his young friend's hand now then cried mr tupman from the gallery yes yes directly replied mr winkle good night good night said mr pickwick there was another good night and another and half a dozen more after that and still mr winkle had fast hold of his friend's hand and was looking into his face with the same strange expression is anything the matter said mr pickwick at last when his arm was quite sore with shaking nothing said mr winkle well then good night said mr pickwick attempting to disengage his hand my friend my benefactor my honoured companion murmured mr winkle catching at his wrist do not judge me harshly do not when you hear that driven to extremity by hopeless obstacles i now then said mr tupman reappearing at the door are you coming or are we to be locked in yes yes i am ready replied mr winkle and with a violent effort he tore himself away as mr pickwick was gazing down the passage after them in silent astonishment sam weller appeared at the stair head and whispered for one moment in mr winkle's ear oh certainly depend upon me said that gentleman aloud thankee sir you won't forget sir said sam of course not replied mr winkle wish you luck sir said sam touching his hat i should very much liked to ha' joined you sir but the gov'nor o' course is pairamount it is very much to your credit that you remain here said mr winkle with these words they disappeared down stairs very extraordinary said mr pickwick going back into his room and seating himself at the table in a musing attitude what can that young man be going to do he had sat ruminating about the matter for some time when the voice of roker the turnkey demanded whether he might come in by all means said mr pickwick i've brought you a softer pillow sir said roker instead of the temporary one you had last night thank you said mr pickwick will you take a glass of wine you're wery good sir replied mr roker accepting the proffered glass yours sir thank you said mr pickwick i'm sorry to say that your landlord's every bad to night sir said roker setting down the glass and inspecting the lining of his hat preparatory to putting it on again what the chancery prisoner exclaimed mr pickwick he won't be a chancery prisoner wery long sir replied roker turning his hat round so as to get the maker's name right side upwards as he looked into it you make my blood run cold said mr pickwick what do you mean he's been consumptive for a long time past said mr roker and he's taken wery bad in the breath to night the doctor said six months ago that nothing but change of air could save him great heaven exclaimed mr pickwick has this man been slowly murdered by the law for six months i don't know about that replied roker weighing the hat by the brims in both hands i suppose he'd have been took the same wherever he was he went into the infirmary this morning the doctor says his strength is to be kept up as much as possible and the warden's sent him wine and broth and that from his own house it's not the warden's fault you know sir of course not replied mr pickwick hastily i'm afraid however said roker shaking his head that it's all up with him i offered neddy two sixpenn'orths to one upon it just now but he wouldn't take it and quite right thankee sir good night sir stay said mr pickwick earnestly where is this infirmary just over where you slept sir replied roker i'll show you if you like to come mr pickwick snatched up his hat without speaking and followed at once the turnkey led the way in silence and gently raising the latch of the room door motioned mr pickwick to enter it was a large bare desolate room with a number of stump bedsteads made of iron on one of which lay stretched the shadow of a man wan pale and ghastly his breathing was hard and thick and he moaned painfully as it came and went at the bedside sat a short old man in a cobbler's apron who by the aid of a pair of horn spectacles was reading from the bible aloud it was the fortunate legatee the sick man laid his hand upon his attendant's arm and motioned him to stop he closed the book and laid it on the bed open the window said the sick man he did so the noise of carriages and carts the rattle of wheels the cries of men and boys all the busy sounds of a mighty multitude instinct with life and occupation blended into one deep murmur floated into the room above the hoarse loud hum arose from time to time a boisterous laugh or a scrap of some jingling song shouted forth by one of the giddy crowd would strike upon the ear for an instant and then be lost amidst the roar of voices and the tramp of footsteps the breaking of the billows of the restless sea of life that rolled heavily on without melancholy sounds to a quiet listener at any time how melancholy to the watcher by the bed of death there is no air here said the sick man faintly the place pollutes it it was fresh round about when i walked there years ago but it grows hot and heavy in passing these walls i cannot breathe it we have breathed it together for a long time said the old man come come there was a short silence during which the two spectators approached the bed the sick man drew a hand of his old fellow prisoner towards him and pressing it affectionately between both his own retained it in his grasp i hope he gasped after a while so faintly that they bent their ears close over the bed to catch the half formed sounds his pale lips gave vent to i hope my merciful judge will bear in mind my heavy punishment on earth twenty years my friend twenty years in this hideous grave my heart broke when my child died and i could not even kiss him in his little coffin my loneliness since then in all this noise and riot has been very dreadful may god forgive me he has seen my solitary lingering death he folded his hands and murmuring something more they could not hear fell into a sleep only a sleep at first for they saw him smile they whispered together for a little time and the turnkey stooping over the pillow drew hastily back he has got his discharge by g said the man he had but he had grown so like death in life that they knew not when he died chapter xvii illustration descriptive of an affecting interview between mr samuel weller and a family party mr pickwick makes a tour of the diminutive world he inhabits and resolves to mix with it in future as little as possible a few mornings after his incarceration mr samuel weller having arranged his master's room with all possible care and seen him comfortably seated over his books and papers withdrew to employ himself for an hour or two to come as he best could it was a fine morning and it occurred to sam that a pint of porter in the open air would lighten his next quarter of an hour or so as well as any little amusement in which he could indulge having arrived at this conclusion he betook himself to the tap having purchased the beer and obtained moreover the day but one before yesterday's paper he repaired to the skittle ground and seating himself on a bench proceeded to enjoy himself in a very sedate and methodical manner first of all he took a refreshing draught of the beer and then he looked up at the window and bestowed a platonic wink on a young lady who was peeling potatoes thereat then he opened the paper and folded it so as to get the police reports outwards and this being a vexatious and difficult thing to do when there is any wind stirring he took another draught of the beer when he had accomplished it then he read two lines of the paper and stopped short to look at a couple of men who were finishing a game of rackets which being concluded he cried out wery good in an approving manner and looked round upon the spectators to ascertain whether their sentiments coincided with his own this involved the necessity of looking up at the windows also and as the young lady was still there it was an act of common politeness to wink again and to drink to her good health in dumb show in another draught of the beer which sam did and having frowned hideously upon a small boy who had noted this latter proceeding with open eyes he threw one leg over the other and holding the newspaper in both hands began to read in real earnest he had hardly composed himself into the needful state of abstraction when he thought he heard his own name proclaimed in some distant passage nor was he mistaken for it quickly passed from mouth to mouth and in a few seconds the air teemed with shouts of weller here roared sam in a stentorian voice wot's the matter who wants him has an express come to say that his country house is afire somebody wants you in the hall said a man who was standing by just mind that 'ere paper and the pot old feller will you said sam i'm a comin' blessed if they was a callin' me to the bar they couldn't make more noise about it accompanying these words with a gentle rap on the head of the young gentleman before noticed who unconscious of his close vicinity to the person in request was screaming weller with all his might sam hastened across the ground and ran up the steps into the hall here the first object that met his eyes was his beloved father sitting on a bottom stair with his hat in his hand shouting out weller in his very loudest tone at half minute intervals wot are you a roarin' at said sam impetuously when the old gentleman had discharged himself of another shout makin' yourself so precious hot that you looks like a aggrawated glass blower wot's the matter aha replied the old gentleman i began to be afeerd that you'd gone for a walk round the regency park sammy come said sam none o' them taunts agin the wictim o' avarice and come off that 'ere step wot are you a settin' down there for i don't live there i've got such a game for you sammy said the elder mr weller rising stop a minit said sam you're all vite behind that's right sammy rub it off said mr weller as his son dusted him it might look personal here if a man walked about with whitevash on his clothes eh sammy as mr weller exhibited in this place unequivocal symptoms of an approaching fit of chuckling sam interposed to stop it keep quiet do said sam there never vos such a old picter card born what are you bustin' vith now sammy said mr weller wiping his forehead i'm afeerd that vun o' these days i shall laugh myself into a appleplexy my boy vell then wot do you do it for said sam now wot have you got to say who do you think's come here with me samivel said mr weller drawing back a pace or two pursing up his mouth and extending his eyebrows pell said sam mr weller shook his head and his red cheek expanded with the laughter that was endeavouring to find a vent mottled faced man p'r'aps suggested sam again mr weller shook his head who then asked sam your mother in law said mr weller and it was lucky he did say it or his cheeks must inevitably have cracked from their most unnatural distension your mother in law sammy said mr weller and the red nosed man my boy and the red nosed man ho ho ho with this mr weller launched into convulsions of laughter while sam regarded him with a broad grin gradually overspreading his whole countenance they've come to have a little serious talk with you samivel said mr weller wiping his eyes don't let out nothin' about the unnat'ral creditor sammy wot don't they know who it is inquired sam not a bit on it replied his father vere are they said sam reciprocating all the old gentleman's grins in the snuggery rejoined mr weller catch the red nosed man a goin' anyvere but vere the liquors is not he samivel not he ve'd a wery pleasant ride along the road from the markis this mornin' sammy said mr weller when he felt himself equal to the task of speaking in an articulate manner i drove the old piebald in that 'ere little shay cart as belonged to your mother in law's first wenter into vich a harm cheer wos lifted for the shepherd and i'm blest said mr weller with a look of deep scorn i'm blest if they didn't bring a portable flight o' steps out into the road a front o' our door for him to get up by illustration i drove the old piebald you don't mean that said sam i do mean that sammy replied his father and i vish you could ha' seen how tight he held on by the sides wen he did get up as if he wos afeerd o' being precipitayted down full six foot and dashed into a million o' hatoms he tumbled in at last however and avay ve vent and i rayther think i say i rayther think samivel that he found his self a little jolted ven ve turned the corners wot i s'pose you happened to drive up agin a post or two said sam i'm afeerd replied mr weller in a rapture of winks i'm afeerd i took vun or two on 'em sammy he wos a flyin' out o' the harm cheer all the way here the old gentleman shook his head from side to side and was seized with a hoarse internal rumbling accompanied with a violent swelling of the countenance and a sudden increase in the breadth of all his features symptoms which alarmed his son not a little don't be frightened sammy don't be frightened said the old gentleman when by dint of much struggling and various convulsive stamps upon the ground he had recovered his voice it's only a kind o' quiet laugh as i'm a tryin' to come sammy well if that's wot it is said sam you'd better not try to come it agin you'll find it rayther a dangerous inwention don't you like it sammy inquired the old gentleman not at all replied sam well said mr weller with the tears still running down his cheeks it 'ud ha' been a wery great accommodation to me if i could ha' done it and 'ud ha' saved a good many vords atween your mother in law and me sometimes but i am afeerd you're right sammy it's too much in the appleplexy line a deal too much samivel this conversation brought them to the door of the snuggery into which sam pausing for an instant to look over his shoulder and cast a sly leer at his respected progenitor who was still giggling behind at once led the way mother in law said sam politely saluting the lady wery much obliged to you for this here wisit shepherd how air you oh samuel said mrs weller this is dreadful not a bit of it mum replied sam is it shepherd mr stiggins raised his hands and turned up his eyes till the whites or rather the yellows were alone visible but made no reply in words is this here gen'l'm'n troubled vith any painful complaint said sam looking to his mother in law for explanation the good man is grieved to see you here samuel replied mrs weller oh that's it is it said sam i was afeerd from his manner that he might a' forgotten to take pepper with that 'ere last cowcumber he eat set down sir ve make no extra charge for the settin' down as the king remarked ven he blowed up his ministers young man said mr stiggins ostentatiously i fear you are not softened by imprisonment beg your pardon sir replied sam wot wos you graciously pleased to hobserve i apprehend young man that your nature is no softer for this chastening said mr stiggins in a loud voice sir replied sam you're wery kind to say so i hope my natur is not a soft vun sir wery much obliged to you for your good opinion sir at this point of the conversation a sound indecorously approaching to a laugh was heard to proceed from the chair in which the elder mr weller was seated upon which mrs weller on a hasty consideration of all the circumstances of the case considered it her bounden duty to become gradually hysterical weller said mrs w the old gentleman was seated in a corner weller come forth wery much obleeged to you my dear replied mr weller but i'm quite comfortable vere i am upon this mrs weller burst into tears wot's gone wrong mum said sam oh samuel replied mrs weller your father makes me wretched will nothing do him good do you hear this here said sam lady wants to know vether nothin' 'ull do you good wery much indebted to mrs weller for her po lite inquiries sammy replied the old gentleman i think a pipe vould benefit me a good deal could i be accommodated sammy here mrs weller let fall some more tears and mr stiggins groaned hallo here's this unfort'nate gen'l'm'n took ill agin said sam looking round vere do you feel it now sir in the same place young man rejoined mr stiggins in the same place vere may that be sir inquired sam with great outward simplicity in the buzzim young man replied mr stiggins placing his umbrella on his waistcoat at this affecting reply mrs weller being wholly unable to suppress her feelings sobbed aloud and stated her conviction that the red nosed man was a saint whereupon mr weller senior ventured to suggest in an undertone that he must be the representative of the united parishes of st simon without and st walker within i'm afeerd mum said sam that this here gen'l'm'n with the twist in his countenance feels rayther thirsty with the melancholy spectacle afore him is it the case mum the worthy lady looked at mr stiggins for a reply that gentleman with many rollings of the eye clenched his throat with his right hand and mimicked the act of swallowing to intimate that he was athirst i am afraid samuel that his feelings have made him so indeed said mrs weller mournfully wot's your usual tap sir replied sam oh my dear young friend replied mr stiggins all taps is vanities too true too true indeed said mrs weller murmuring a groan and shaking her head assentingly well said sam i des say they may be sir but which is your partickler wanity vich wanity do you like the flavour on best sir oh my dear young friend replied mr stiggins i despise them all if said mr stiggins if there is any one of them less odious than another it is the liquor called rum warm my dear young friend with three lumps of sugar to the tumbler wery sorry to say sir said sam that they don't allow that partickler wanity to be sold in this here establishment oh the hardness of heart of these inveterate men ejaculated mr stiggins oh the accursed cruelty of these inhuman persecutors with these words mr stiggins again cast up his eyes and rapped his breast with his umbrella and it is but justice to the reverend gentleman to say that his indignation appeared very real and unfeigned indeed after mrs weller and the red nosed gentleman had commented on this inhuman usage in a very forcible manner and had vented a variety of pious and holy execrations against its authors the latter recommended a bottle of port wine warmed with a little water spice and sugar as being grateful to the stomach and savouring less of vanity than many other compounds it was accordingly ordered to be prepared pending its preparation the red nosed man and mrs weller looked at the elder w and groaned well sammy said that gentleman i hope you'll find your spirits rose by this here lively wisit wery cheerful and improvin' conwersation ain't it sammy you're a reprobate replied sam and i desire you won't address no more o' them ungraceful remarks to me so far from being edified by this very proper reply the elder mr weller at once relapsed into a broad grin and this inexorable conduct causing the lady and mr stiggins to close their eyes and rock themselves to and fro on their chairs in a troubled manner he furthermore indulged in several acts of pantomime indicative of a desire to pummel and wring the nose of the aforesaid stiggins the performance of which appeared to afford him great mental relief the old gentleman very narrowly escaped detection in one instance mr stiggins happening to give a start on the arrival of the negus brought his head in smart contact with the clenched fist with which mr weller had been describing imaginary fireworks in the air within two inches of his ear for some minutes wot are you a reachin' out your hand for the tumbler in that 'ere sawage way for said sam with great promptitude don't you see you've hit the gen'l'm'n i didn't go to do it sammy said mr weller in some degree abashed by the very unexpected occurrence of the incident try an in'ard application sir said sam as the red nosed gentleman rubbed his head with a rueful visage wot do you think o' that for a go o' wanity warm sir mr stiggins made no verbal answer but his manner was expressive he tasted the contents of the glass which sam had placed in his hand put his umbrella on the floor and tasted it again passing his hand placidly across his stomach twice or thrice he then drank the whole at a breath and smacking his lips held out the tumbler for more nor was mrs weller behind hand in doing justice to the composition the good lady began by protesting that she couldn't touch a drop then took a small drop then a large drop then a great many drops and her feelings being of the nature of those substances which are powerfully affected by the application of strong waters she dropped a tear with every drop of negus and so got on melting the feelings down until at length she had arrived at a very pathetic and decent pitch of misery the elder mr weller observed these signs and tokens with many manifestations of disgust and when after a second jug of the same mr stiggins began to sigh in a dismal manner he plainly evinced his disapprobation of the whole proceedings by sundry incoherent ramblings of speech among which frequent angry repetitions of the word gammon were alone distinguishable to the ear i'll tell you wot it is samivel my boy whispered the old gentleman into his son's ear after a long and steadfast contemplation of his lady and mr stiggins i think there must be somethin' wrong in your mother in law's inside as vell as in that o' the red nosed man wot do you mean said sam i mean this here sammy replied the old gentleman that wot they drink don't seem no nourishment to 'em it all turns to warm water and comes a pourin' out o' their eyes 'pend upon it sammy it's a constitootional infirmity mr weller delivered this scientific opinion with many confirmatory frowns and nods which mrs weller remarking and concluding that they bore some disparaging reference either to herself or to mr stiggins or to both was on the point of becoming infinitely worse when mr stiggins getting on his legs as well as he could proceeded to deliver an edifying discourse for the benefit of the company but more especially of mr samuel whom he adjured in moving terms to be upon his guard in that sink of iniquity into which he was cast to abstain from all hypocrisy and pride of heart and to take in all things exact pattern and copy by him stiggins in which case he might calculate on arriving sooner or later at the comfortable conclusion that like him he was a most estimable and blameless character and that all his acquaintance and friends were hopelessly abandoned and profligate wretches which consideration he said could not but afford him the liveliest satisfaction he furthermore conjured him to avoid above all things the vice of intoxication which he likened unto the filthy habits of swine and to those poisonous and baleful drugs which being chewed in the mouth are said to filch away the memory at this point of his discourse the reverend and red nosed gentleman became singularly incoherent and staggering to and fro in the excitement of his eloquence was fain to catch at the back of a chair to preserve his perpendicular mr stiggins did not desire his hearers to be upon their guard against those false prophets and wretched mockers of religion who without sense to expound its first doctrines or hearts to feel its first principles are more dangerous members of society than the common criminal imposing as they necessarily do upon the weakest and worst informed casting scorn and contempt on what should be held most sacred and bringing into partial disrepute large bodies of virtuous and well conducted persons of many excellent sects and persuasions but as he leant over the back of the chair for a considerable time and closing one eye winked a good deal with the other it is presumed that he thought all this but kept it to himself during the delivery of the oration mrs weller sobbed and wept at the end of the paragraphs while sam sitting cross legged on a chair and resting his arms on the top rail regarded the speaker with great suavity and blandness of demeanour occasionally bestowing a look of recognition on the old gentleman who was delighted at the beginning and went to sleep about half way brayvo wery pretty said sam when the red nosed man having finished pulled his worn gloves on thereby thrusting his fingers through the broken tops till the knuckles were disclosed to view wery pretty i hope it may do you good samuel said mrs weller solemnly i think it vill mum replied sam i wish i could hope that it would do your father good said mrs weller thankee my dear said mr weller senior how do you find yourself arter it my love scoffer exclaimed mrs weller benighted man said the reverend mr stiggins if i don't get no better light than that 'ere moonshine o' yourn my worthy creetur said the elder mr weller it's wery likely as i shall continey to be a night coach till i'm took off the road altogether now mrs we if the piebald stands at livery much longer he'll stand at nothing as we go back and p'r'aps that 'ere harm cheer 'ull be tipped over into some hedge or another with the shepherd in it at this supposition the reverend mr stiggins in evident consternation gathered up his hat and umbrella and proposed an immediate departure to which mrs weller assented sam walked with them to the lodge gate and took a dutiful leave a do samivel said the old gentleman wot's a do inquired sammy well good bye then said the old gentleman oh that's wot you're a aimin' at is it said sam good bye sammy whispered mr weller looking cautiously round my duty to your gov'ner and tell him if he thinks better o' this here bis'ness to commoonicate vith me me and a cab'net maker has devised a plan for gettin' him out a pianner samivel a pianner said mr weller striking his son on the chest with the back of his hand and falling back a step or two wot do you mean said sam a pianner forty samivel rejoined mr weller in a still more mysterious manner as we can have on hire vun as von't play sammy and wot 'ud be the good o' that said sam let him send to my friend the cab'net maker to fetch it back sammy replied mr weller are you avake now no rejoined sam there ain't no vurks in it whispered his father it 'ull hold him easy vith his hat and shoes on and breathe through the legs vich his holler have a passage ready taken for 'merriker the 'merrikin gov'ment will never give him up ven they find as he's got money to spend sammy let the gov'ner stop there till mrs bardell's dead or mr dodson and fogg's hung which last ewent i think is the most likely to happen first sammy and then let him come back and write a book about the 'merrikins as'll pay all his expenses and more if he blows 'em up enough mr weller delivered this hurried abstract of his plot with great vehemence of whisper then as if fearful of weakening the effect of the tremendous communication by any further dialogue he gave the coachman's salute and vanished sam had scarcely recovered his usual composure of countenance which had been greatly disturbed by the secret communication of his respected relative when mr pickwick accosted him sam said that gentleman sir replied mr weller i am going for a walk round the prison and i wish you to attend me i see a prisoner we know coming this way sam said mr pickwick smiling wich sir inquired mr weller the gen'l'm'n vith the head o' hair or the interestin' captive in the stockin's neither rejoined mr pickwick he is an older friend of yours sam o' mine sir exclaimed mr weller you recollect the gentleman very well i dare say sam replied mr pickwick or else you are more unmindful of your old acquaintances than i think you are hush not a word sam not a syllable here he is as mr pickwick spoke jingle walked up he looked less miserable than before being clad in a half worn suit of clothes which with mr pickwick's assistance had been released from the pawnbroker's he wore clean linen too and had had his hair cut he was very pale and thin however and as he crept slowly up leaning on a stick it was easy to see that he had suffered severely from illness and want and was still very weak he took off his hat as mr pickwick saluted him and seemed much humbled and abashed at sight of sam weller following close at his heels came mr job trotter in the catalogue of whose vices want of faith and attachment to his companion could at all events find no place he was still ragged and squalid but his face was not quite so hollow as on his first meeting with mr pickwick a few days before as he took off his hat to our benevolent old friend he murmured some broken expressions of gratitude and muttered something about having been saved from starving well well said mr pickwick impatiently interrupting him you can follow with sam i want to speak to you mr jingle can you walk without his arm certainly sir all ready not too fast legs shaky head queer round and round earthquaky sort of feeling very here give me your arm said mr pickwick no no replied jingle won't indeed rather not nonsense said mr pickwick lean upon me i desire sir seeing that he was confused and agitated and uncertain what to do mr pickwick cut the matter short by drawing the invalided stroller's arm through his and leading him away without saying another word about it during the whole of this time the countenance of mr samuel weller had exhibited an expression of the most overwhelming and absorbing astonishment that the imagination can portray after looking from job to jingle and from jingle to job in profound silence he softly ejaculated the words well i am damn'd which he repeated at least a score of times after which exertion he appeared wholly bereft of speech and again cast his eyes first upon the one and then upon the other in mute perplexity and bewilderment now sam said mr pickwick looking back i'm a comin' sir replied mr weller mechanically following his master and still he lifted not his eyes from mr job trotter who walked at his side in silence job kept his eyes fixed on the ground for some time sam with his glued to job's countenance ran up against the people who were walking about and fell over little children and stumbled against steps and railings without appearing at all sensible of it until job looking stealthily up said how do you do mr weller it is him exclaimed sam and having established job's identity beyond all doubt he smote his leg and vented his feelings in a long shrill whistle things has altered with me sir said job i should think they had exclaimed mr weller surveying his companion's rags with undisguised wonder this is rayther a change for the worse mr trotter as the gen'l'm'n said wen he got two doubtful shillin's and sixpenn'orth o' pocket pieces for a good half crown it is indeed replied job shaking his head there is no deception now mr weller tears said job with a look of momentary slyness tears are not the only proofs of distress nor the best ones no they ain't replied sam expressively they may be put on mr weller said job i know they may said sam some people indeed has 'em always ready laid on and can pull out the plug wenever they likes yes replied job but these sort of things are not so easily counterfeited mr weller and it is a more painful process to get them up as he spoke he pointed to his sallow sunken cheeks and drawing up his coat sleeves disclosed an arm which looked as if the bone could be broken at a touch so sharp and brittle did it appear beneath its thin covering of flesh wot have you been a doin' to yourself said sam recoiling nothing replied job nothin' echoed sam i have been doin' nothing for many weeks past said job and eating and drinking almost as little sam took one comprehensive glance at mr trotter's thin face and wretched apparel and then seizing him by the arm commenced dragging him away with great violence where are you going mr weller said job vainly struggling in the powerful grasp of his old enemy come on said sam come on he deigned no further explanation until they reached the tap and then called for a pot of porter which was speedily produced now said sam drink that up ev'ry drop on it and then turn the pot upside down to let me see as you've took the med'cine but my dear mr weller remonstrated job down vith it said sam peremptorily thus admonished mr trotter raised the pot to his lips and by gentle and almost imperceptible degrees tilted it into the air he paused once and only once to draw a long breath but without raising his face from the vessel which in a few moments thereafter he held out at arm's length bottom upward nothing fell upon the ground but a few particles of froth which slowly detached themselves from the rim and trickled lazily down well done said sam how do you find yourself arter it better sir i think i am better responded job o' course you air said sam argumentatively it's like puttin' gas in a balloon i can see with the naked eye that you gets stouter under the operation wot do you say to another o' the same di mensions i would rather not i am much obliged to you sir replied job much rather not vell then wot do you say to some wittles inquired sam thanks to your worthy governor sir said mr trotter we have half a leg of mutton baked at a quarter before three with the potatoes under it to save boiling wot has he been a purwidin' for you asked sam emphatically he has sir replied job more than that mr weller my master being very ill he got us a room we were in a kennel before and paid for it sir and come to look at us at night when nobody should know mr weller said job with real tears in his eyes for once i could serve that gentleman till i fell down dead at his feet i say said sam i'll trouble you my friend none o' that job trotter looked amazed none o' that i say young feller repeated sam firmly no man serves him but me and now we're upon it i'll let you into another secret besides that said sam as he paid for the beer i never heerd mind you nor read of it in story books nor see in picters any angel in tights and gaiters not even in spectacles as i remember though that may ha' been done for anythin' i know to the contrairey but mark my vords job trotter he's a reg'lar thorough bred angel for all that and let me see the man as wenturs to tell me he knows a better vun with this defiance mr weller buttoned up his change in a side pocket and with many confirmatory nods and gestures by the way proceeded in search of the subject of discourse they found mr pickwick in company with jingle talking very earnestly and not bestowing a look on the groups who were congregated on the racket ground they were very motley groups too and worth the looking at if it were only in idle curiosity well said mr pickwick as sam and his companion drew nigh you will see how your health becomes and think about it meanwhile make the statement out for me when you feel yourself equal to the task and i will discuss the subject with you when i have considered it now go to your room you are tired and not strong enough to be out long mr alfred jingle without one spark of his old animation with nothing even of the dismal gaiety which he had assumed when mr pickwick first stumbled on him in his misery bowed low without speaking and motioning to job not to follow him just yet crept slowly away curious scene this is it not sam said mr pickwick looking good humouredly round wery much so sir replied sam wonders 'ull never cease added sam speaking to himself i'm wery much mistaken if that 'ere jingle worn't a doin' somethin' in the water cart way the area formed by the wall in that part of the fleet in which mr pickwick stood was just wide enough to make a good racket court one side being formed of course by the wall itself and the other by that portion of the prison which looked or rather would have looked but for the wall towards st paul's cathedral sauntering or sitting about in every possible attitude of listless idleness were a great number of debtors the major part of whom were waiting in prison until their day of going up before the insolvent court should arrive while others had been remanded for various terms which they were idling away as they best could some were shabby some were smart many dirty a few clean but there they all lounged and loitered and slunk about with as little spirit or purpose as the beasts in a menagerie lolling from the windows which commanded a view of this promenade were a number of persons some in noisy conversation with their acquaintance below others playing at ball with some adventurous throwers outside others looking on at the racket players or watching the boys as they cried the game dirty slipshod women passed and re passed on their way to the cooking house in one corner of the yard children screamed and fought and played together in another the tumbling of the skittles and the shouts of the players mingled perpetually with these and a hundred other sounds and all was noise and tumult save in a little miserable shed a few yards off where lay all quiet and ghastly the body of the chancery prisoner who had died the night before awaiting the mockery of an inquest the body it is the lawyer's term for the restless whirling mass of cares and anxieties affections hopes and griefs that make up the living man the law had his body and there it lay clothed in grave clothes an awful witness to its tender mercy would you like to see a whistling shop sir inquired job trotter what do you mean was mr pickwick's counter inquiry a vistlin' shop sir interposed mr weller what is that sam a bird fancier's inquired mr pickwick bless your heart no sir replied job a whistling shop sir is where they sell spirits mr job trotter briefly explained here that all persons being prohibited under heavy penalties from conveying spirits into debtors' prisons and such commodities being highly prized by the ladies and gentlemen confined therein it had occurred to some speculative turnkey to connive for certain lucrative considerations at two or three prisoners retailing the favourite article of gin for their own profit and advantage this plan you see sir has been gradually introduced into all the prisons for debt said mr trotter and it has this wery great advantage said sam that the turnkeys takes wery good care to seize hold o' ev'rybody but them as pays 'em that attempts the willainy and ven it gets in the papers they're applauded for their wigilance so it cuts two ways frightens other people from the trade and elewates their own characters exactly so mr weller observed job well but are these rooms never searched to ascertain whether any spirits are concealed in them said mr pickwick cert'nly they are sir replied sam but the turnkeys knows beforehand and gives the word to the wistlers and you may whistle for it ven you go to look by this time job had tapped at a door which was opened by a gentleman with an uncombed head who bolted it after them when they had walked in and grinned upon which job grinned and sam also whereupon mr pickwick thinking it might be expected of him kept on smiling to the end of the interview the gentleman with the uncombed head appeared quite satisfied with this mute announcement of their business and producing a flat stone bottle which might hold about a couple of quarts from beneath his bedstead filled out three glasses of gin which job trotter and sam disposed of in a most workmanlike manner any more said the whistling gentleman no more replied job trotter mr pickwick paid the door was unbolted and out they came the uncombed gentleman bestowing a friendly nod upon mr roker who happened to be passing at the moment from this spot mr pickwick wandered along all the galleries up and down all the staircases and once again round the whole area of the yard the great body of the prison population appeared to be mivins and smangle and the parson and the butcher and the leg over and over and over again there were the same squalor the same turmoil and noise the same general characteristics in every corner in the best and the worst alike the whole place seemed restless and troubled and the people were crowding and flitting to and fro like the shadows in an uneasy dream i have seen enough said mr pickwick as he threw himself into a chair in his little compartment my head aches with these scenes and my heart too henceforth i will be a prisoner in my own room and mr pickwick steadfastly adhered to this determination for three long months he remained shut up all day only stealing out at night to breathe the air when the greater part of his fellow prisoners were in bed or carousing in their rooms his health was beginning to suffer from the closeness of the confinement but neither the often repeated entreaties of perker and his friends nor the still more frequently repeated warnings and admonitions of mr samuel weller could induce him to alter one jot of his inflexible resolution chapter xviii illustration records a touching act of delicate feeling not unmixed with pleasantry achieved and performed by messrs dodson and fogg it was within a week of the close of the month of july that a hackney cabriolet number unrecorded was seen to proceed at a rapid pace up goswell street three people were squeezed into it besides the driver who sat in his own particular little dickey at the side over the apron were hung two shawls belonging to two small vixenish looking ladies under the apron between whom compressed into a very small compass was stowed away a gentleman of heavy and subdued demeanour who whenever he ventured to make an observation was snapped up short by one of the vixenish ladies before mentioned lastly the two vixenish ladies and the heavy gentleman were giving the driver contradictory directions all tending to the one point that he should stop at mrs bardell's door which the heavy gentleman in direct opposition to and defiance of the vixenish ladies contended was a green door and not a yellow one stop at the house with the green door driver said the heavy gentleman oh you perwerse creetur exclaimed one of the vixenish ladies drive to the 'ouse with the yellow door cabmin upon this the cabman who in a sudden effort to pull up at the house with the green door had pulled the horse up so high that he nearly pulled him backward into the cabriolet let the animal's fore legs down to the ground again and paused now vere am i to pull up inquired the driver settle it among yourselves all i ask is vere here the contest was renewed with increased violence and the horse being troubled with a fly on his nose the cabman humanely employed his leisure in lashing him about on the head on the counter irritation principle most wotes carries the day said one of the vixenish ladies at length the 'ouse with the yellow door cabmin but after the cabriolet had dashed up in splendid style to the house with the yellow door making as one of the vixenish ladies triumphantly said acterrally more noise than if one had come in one's own carriage and after the driver had dismounted to assist the ladies in getting out the small round head of master thomas bardell was thrust out of the one pair window of a house with a red door a few numbers off aggrawatin' thing said the vixenish lady last mentioned darting a withering glance at the heavy gentleman my dear it's not my fault said the gentleman don't talk to me you creetur don't retorted the lady the house with the red door cabmin oh if ever a woman was troubled with a ruffinly creetur that takes a pride and pleasure in disgracing his wife on every possible occasion afore strangers i am that woman you ought to be ashamed of yourself raddle said the other little woman who was no other than mrs cluppins what have i been a doing of asked mr raddle don't talk to me don't you brute for fear i should be perwoked to forgit my sect and strike you said mrs raddle while this dialogue was going on the driver was most ignominiously leading the horse by the bridle up to the house with the red door which master bardell had already opened here was a mean and low way of arriving at a friend's house no dashing up with all the fire and fury of the animal no jumping down of the driver no loud knocking at the door no opening of the apron with a crash at the very last moment for fear of the ladies sitting in a draught and then the man handing the shawls out afterwards as if he were a private coachman the whole edge of the thing had been taken off it was flatter than walking well tommy said mrs cluppins how's your poor dear mother oh she's very well replied master bardell she's in the front parlour all ready i'm ready too i am here master bardell put his hands in his pockets and jumped off and on the bottom step of the door is anybody else a goin' tommy said mrs cluppins arranging her pelerine mrs sanders is going she is replied tommy i'm going too i am drat the boy said little mrs cluppins he thinks of nobody but himself here tommy dear well said master bardell who else is a goin' lovey said mrs cluppins in an insinuating manner oh mrs rogers is a goin' replied master bardell opening his eyes very wide as he delivered the intelligence what the lady as has taken the lodgings ejaculated mrs cluppins master bardell put his hands deeper down into his pockets and nodded exactly thirty five times to imply that it was the lady lodger and no other bless us said mrs cluppins it's quite a party ah if you knew what was in the cupboard you'd say so replied master bardell what is there tommy said mrs cluppins coaxingly you'll tell me tommy i know no i won't replied master bardell shaking his head and applying himself to the bottom step again drat the child muttered mrs cluppins what a prowokin' little wretch it is come tommy tell your dear cluppy mother said i wasn't to rejoined master bardell i'm a goin' to have some i am cheered by this prospect the precocious boy applied himself to his infantile treadmill with increased vigour the above examination of a child of tender years took place while mr and mrs raddle and the cab driver were having an altercation concerning the fare which terminating at this point in favour of the cabman mrs raddle came up tottering lauk mary ann what's the matter said mrs cluppins it's put me all over in such a tremble betsy replied mrs raddle raddle ain't like a man he leaves everythink to me this was scarcely fair upon the unfortunate mr raddle who had been thrust aside by his good lady in the commencement of the dispute and peremptorily commanded to hold his tongue he had no opportunity of defending himself however for mrs raddle gave unequivocal signs of fainting which being perceived from the parlour window mrs bardell mrs sanders the lodger and the lodger's servant darted precipitately out and conveyed her into the house all talking at the same time and giving utterance to various expressions of pity and condolence as if she were one of the most suffering mortals on earth being conveyed into the front parlour she was there deposited on a sofa and the lady from the first floor running up to the first floor returned with a bottle of sal volatile which holding mrs raddle tight round the neck she applied in all womanly kindness and pity to her nose until that lady with many plunges and struggles was fain to declare herself decidedly better ah poor thing said mrs rogers i know what her feelin's is too well ah poor thing so do i said mrs sanders and then all the ladies moaned in unison and said they knew what it was and they pitied her from their hearts they did even the lodger's little servant who was thirteen years old and three feet high murmured her sympathy but what's been the matter said mrs bardell ah what has decomposed you ma'am inquired mrs rogers i have been a good deal flurried replied mrs raddle in a reproachful manner thereupon the ladies cast indignant looks at mr raddle why the fact is said that unhappy gentleman stepping forward when we alighted at this door a dispute arose with the driver of the cabrioily a loud scream from his wife at the mention of this word rendered all further explanation inaudible you'd better leave us to bring her round raddle said mrs cluppins she'll never get better as long as you're here all the ladies concurred in this opinion so mr raddle was pushed out of the room and requested to give himself an airing in the back yard which he did for about a quarter of an hour when mrs bardell announced to him with a solemn face that he might come in now but that he must be very careful how he behaved towards his wife she knew he didn't mean to be unkind but mary ann was very far from strong and if he didn't take care he might lose her when he least expected it which would be a very dreadful reflection for him afterwards and so on all this mr raddle heard with great submission and presently returned to the parlour in a most lamb like manner why mrs roger ma'am said mrs bardell you've never been introduced i declare mr raddle ma'am mrs cluppins ma'am mrs raddle ma'am which is mrs cluppins's sister suggested mrs sanders oh indeed said mrs rogers graciously for she was the lodger and her servant was in waiting so she was more gracious than intimate in right of her position oh indeed mrs raddle smiled sweetly mr raddle bowed and mrs cluppins said she was sure she was very happy to have a opportunity of being known to a lady which she had heerd so much in favour of as mrs rogers a compliment which the last named lady acknowledged with graceful condescension well mr raddle said mrs bardell i'm sure you ought to feel very much honoured at you and tommy being the only gentlemen to escort so many ladies all the way to the spaniards at hampstead don't you think he ought mrs rogers ma'am oh certainly ma'am said mrs rogers after whom all the other ladies responded oh certainly of course i feel it ma'am said mr raddle rubbing his hands and evincing a slight tendency to brighten up a little indeed to tell you the truth i said as we was a coming along in the cabrioily at the recapitulation of the word which awakened so many painful recollections mrs raddle applied her handkerchief to her eyes again and uttered a half suppressed scream so mrs bardell frowned upon mr raddle to intimate that he had better not say anything more and desired mrs rogers's servant with an air to put on the wine this was the signal for displaying the hidden treasures of the closet which comprised sundry plates of oranges and biscuits and a bottle of old crusted port that at one and nine with another of the celebrated east india sherry at fourteen pence which were all produced in honour of the lodger and afforded unlimited satisfaction to everybody after great consternation had been excited in the mind of mrs cluppins by an attempt on the part of tommy to recount how he had been cross examined regarding the cupboard then in action which was fortunately nipped in the bud by his imbibing half a glass of the old crusted the wrong way and thereby endangering his life for some seconds the party walked forth in quest of a hampstead stage this was soon found and in a couple of hours they all arrived safely in the spaniards' tea gardens where the luckless mr raddle's very first act nearly occasioned his good lady a relapse it being neither more nor less than to order tea for seven whereas as the ladies one and all remarked what could have been easier than for tommy to have drank out of anybody's cup or everybody's if that was all when the waiter wasn't looking which would have saved one head of tea and the tea just as good however there was no help for it and the tea tray came with seven cups and saucers and bread and butter on the same scale mrs bardell was unanimously voted into the chair and mrs rogers being stationed on her right hand and mrs raddle on her left the meal proceeded with great merriment and success how sweet the country is to be sure sighed mrs rogers i almost wish i lived in it always oh you wouldn't like that ma'am replied mrs bardell rather hastily for it was not at all advisable with reference to the lodgings to encourage such notions you wouldn't like it ma'am oh i should think you was a deal too lively and sought after to be content with the country ma'am said little mrs cluppins perhaps i am ma'am perhaps i am sighed the first floor lodger for lone people as have got nobody to care for them or take care of them or as have been hurt in their mind or that kind of thing observed mr raddle plucking up a little cheerfulness and looking round the country is all very well the country for a wounded spirit they say now of all the things in the world that the unfortunate man could have said any would have been preferable to this of course mrs bardell burst into tears and requested to be led from the table instantly upon which the affectionate child began to cry too most dismally would anybody believe ma'am exclaimed mrs raddle turning fiercely to the first floor lodger that a woman could be married to such a unmanly creetur which can tamper with a woman's feelings as he does every hour in the day ma'am my dear remonstrated mr raddle i didn't mean anything my dear you didn't mean repeated mrs raddle with great scorn and contempt go away i can't bear the sight on you you brute you must not flurry yourself mary ann interposed mrs cluppins you really must consider yourself my dear which you never do now go away raddle there's a good soul or you'll only aggravate her you had better take your tea by yourself sir indeed said mrs rogers again applying the smelling bottle mrs sanders who according to custom was very busy with the bread and butter expressed the same opinion and mr raddle quietly retired after this there was a great hoisting up of master bardell who was rather a large size for hugging into his mother's arms in which operation he got his boots in the tea board and occasioned some confusion among the cups and saucers but that description of fainting fits which is contagious among ladies seldom lasts long so when he had been well kissed and a little cried over mrs bardell recovered set him down again wondered how she could have been so foolish and poured out some more tea it was at this moment that the sound of approaching wheels was heard and that the ladies looking up saw a hackney coach stop at the garden gate more company said mrs sanders it's a gentleman said mrs raddle well if it ain't mr jackson the young man from dodson and fogg's cried mrs bardell why gracious surely mr pickwick can't have paid the damages or hoffered marriage said mrs cluppins dear me how slow the gentleman is exclaimed mrs rogers why doesn't he make haste illustration a shabby man in black leggings as the lady spoke these words mr jackson turned from the coach where he had been addressing some observations to a shabby man in black leggings who had just emerged from the vehicle with a thick ash stick in his hand and made his way to the place where the ladies were seated winding his hair round the brim of his hat as he came along is anything the matter has anything taken place mr jackson said mrs bardell eagerly nothing whatever ma'am replied mr jackson how de do ladies i have to ask pardon ladies for intruding but the law ladies the law with this apology mr jackson smiled made a comprehensive bow and gave his hair another wind mrs rogers whispered mrs raddle that he was really an elegant young man i called in goswell street resumed jackson and hearing that you were here from the slavey took a coach and came on our people want you down in the city directly mrs bardell lor ejaculated that lady starting at the sudden nature of the communication yes said jackson biting his lips it's very important and pressing business which can't be postponed on any account indeed dodson expressly said so to me and so did fogg i've kept the coach on purpose for you to go back in how very strange exclaimed mrs bardell the ladies agreed that it was very strange but were unanimously of opinion that it must be very important or dodson and fogg would never have sent and further that the business being urgent she ought to repair to dodson and fogg's without any delay there was a certain degree of pride and importance about being wanted by one's lawyers in such a monstrous hurry that was by no means displeasing to mrs bardell especially as it might be reasonably supposed to enhance her consequence in the eyes of the first floor lodger she simpered a little affected extreme vexation and hesitation and at last arrived at the conclusion that she supposed she must go but won't you refresh yourself after your walk mr jackson said mrs bardell persuasively why really there ain't much time to lose replied jackson and i've got a friend here he continued looking towards the man with the ash stick oh ask your friend to come here sir said mrs bardell pray ask your friend here sir why thankee i'd rather not said mr jackson with some embarrassment of manner he's not much used to ladies' society and it makes him bashful if you'll order the waiter to deliver him anything short he won't drink it off at once won't he only try him mr jackson's fingers wandered playfully round his nose at this portion of his discourse to warn his hearers that he was speaking ironically the waiter was at once despatched to the bashful gentleman and the bashful gentleman took something mr jackson also took something and the ladies took something for hospitality's sake mr jackson then said he was afraid it was time to go upon which mrs sanders mrs cluppins and tommy who it was arranged should accompany mrs bardell leaving the others to mr raddle's protection got into the coach isaac said jackson as mrs bardell prepared to get in looking up at the man with the ash stick who was seated on the box smoking a cigar well this is mrs bardell oh i knowed that long ago said the man mrs bardell got in mr jackson got in after her and away they drove mrs bardell could not help ruminating on what mr jackson's friend had said shrewd creatures those lawyers lord bless us how they find people out sad thing about these costs of our people's ain't it said jackson when mrs cluppins and mrs sanders had fallen asleep your bill of costs i mean i'm very sorry they can't get them replied mrs bardell but if you law gentlemen do these things on speculation why you must get a loss now and then you know you gave them a cognovit for the amount of your costs after the trial i'm told said jackson yes just as a matter of form replied mrs bardell certainly replied jackson drily quite a matter of form quite on they drove and mrs bardell fell asleep she was awakened after some time by the stopping of the coach bless us said the lady are we at freeman's court we're not going quite so far replied jackson have the goodness to step out mrs bardell not yet thoroughly awake complied it was a curious place a large wall with a gate in the middle and a gaslight burning inside now ladies cried the man with the ash stick looking into the coach and shaking mrs sanders to wake her come rousing her friend mrs sanders alighted mrs bardell leaning on jackson's arm and leading tommy by the hand had already entered the porch they followed the room they turned into was even more odd looking than the porch such a number of men standing about and they stared so what place is this inquired mrs bardell pausing only one of our public offices replied jackson hurrying her through a door and looking round to see that the other women were following look sharp isaac safe and sound replied the man with the ash stick the door swung heavily after them and they descended a small flight of steps here we are at last all right and tight mrs bardell said jackson looking exultingly around what do you mean said mrs bardell with a palpitating heart just this replied jackson drawing her a little on one side don't be frightened mrs bardell there never was a more delicate man than dodson ma'am or a more humane man than fogg it was their duty in the way of business to take you in execution for them costs but they were anxious to spare your feelings as much as they could what a comfort it must be to you to think how it's been done this is the fleet ma'am wish you good night mrs bardell good night tommy as jackson hurried away in company with the man with the ash stick another man with a key in his hand who had been looking on led the bewildered female to a second short flight of steps leading to the doorway mrs bardell screamed violently tommy roared mrs cluppins shrunk within herself and mrs sanders made off without more ado for there stood the injured mr pickwick taking his nightly allowance of air and beside him leant samuel weller who seeing mrs bardell took his hat off with mock reverence while his master turned indignantly on his heel don't bother the woman said the turnkey to weller she's just come in a pris'ner said sam quickly replacing his hat who's the plaintives what for speak up old feller dodson and fogg replied the man execution on cognovit for costs here job job shouted sam dashing into the passage run to mr perker's job i want him directly i see some good in this here's a game hooray vere's the gov'nor but there was no reply to these inquiries for job had started furiously off the instant he received his commission and mrs bardell had fainted in real downright earnest chapter xix illustration is chiefly devoted to matters of business and the temporal advantage of dodson and fogg mr winkle reappears under extraordinary circumstances mr pickwick's benevolence proves stranger than his obstinacy job trotter abating nothing of his speed ran up holborn sometimes in the middle of the road sometimes on the pavement sometimes in the gutter as the chances of getting along varied with the press of men women children and coaches in each division of the thoroughfare regardless of all obstacles he stopped not for an instant until he reached the gate of gray's inn notwithstanding all the expedition he had used however the gate had been closed a good half hour when he reached it and by the time he had discovered mr perker's laundress who lived with a married daughter who had bestowed her hand upon a non resident waiter who occupied the one pair of some number in some street closely adjoining to some brewery somewhere behind gray's inn lane it was within fifteen minutes of closing the prison for the night mr lowten had still to be ferreted out from the back parlour of the magpie and stump and job had scarcely accomplished this object and communicated sam weller's message when the clock struck ten there said lowten it's too late now you can't get in to night you've got the key of the street my friend never mind me replied job i can sleep anywhere but won't it be better to see mr perker to night so that we may be there the first thing in the morning why responded lowten after a little consideration if it was in anybody else's case perker wouldn't be best pleased at my going up to his house but as it's mr pickwick's i think i may venture to take a cab and charge it to the office deciding on this line of conduct mr lowten took up his hat and begging the assembled company to appoint a deputy chairman during his temporary absence led the way to the nearest coachstand summoning the cab of most promising appearance he directed the driver to repair to montague place russell square mr perker had had a dinner party that day as was testified by the appearance of lights in the drawing room windows the sound of an improved grand piano and an improvable cabinet voice issuing therefrom and a rather overpowering smell of meat which pervaded the steps and entry in fact a couple of very good country agencies happening to come up to town at the same time an agreeable little party had been got together to meet them comprising mr snicks the life office secretary mr prosee the eminent counsel three solicitors one commissioner of bankrupts a special pleader from the temple a small eyed peremptory young gentleman his pupil who had written a lively book about the law of demises with a vast quantity of marginal notes and references and several other eminent and distinguished personages from this society little mr perker detached himself on his clerk being announced in a whisper and repairing to the dining room there found mr lowten and job trotter looking very dim and shadowy by the light of a kitchen candle which the gentleman who condescended to appear in plush shorts and cottons for a quarterly stipend had with a becoming contempt for the clerk and all things appertaining to the office placed upon the table now lowten said little mr perker shutting the door what's the matter no important letter come in a parcel is there no sir replied lowten this is a messenger from mr pickwick sir from pickwick eh said the little man turning quickly to job well what is it dodson and fogg have taken mrs bardell in execution for her costs sir said job no exclaimed perker putting his hands in his pockets and reclining against the sideboard yes said job it seems they got a cognovit out of her for the amount of 'em directly after the trial by jove said perker taking both hands out of his pockets and striking the knuckles of his right against the palm of his left emphatically those are the cleverest scamps i ever had anything to do with the sharpest practitioners i ever knew sir observed lowten sharp echoed perker there's no knowing where to have them very true sir there is not replied lowten and then both master and man pondered for a few seconds with animated countenances as if they were reflecting upon one of the most beautiful and ingenious discoveries that the intellect of man had ever made when they had in some measure recovered from their trance of admiration job trotter discharged himself of the rest of his commission perker nodded his head thoughtfully and pulled out his watch at ten precisely i will be there said the little man sam is quite right tell him so will you take a glass of wine lowten no thank you sir you mean yes i think said the little man turning to the sideboard for a decanter and glasses as lowten did mean yes he said no more on the subject but inquired of job in an audible whisper whether the portrait of perker which hung opposite the fireplace wasn't a wonderful likeness to which job of course replied that it was the wine being by this time poured out lowten drank to mrs perker and the children and job to perker the gentleman in the plush shorts and cottons considering it no part of his duty to show the people from the office out consistently declined to answer the bell and they showed themselves out the attorney betook himself to his drawing room the clerk to the magpie and stump and job to covent garden market to spend the night in a vegetable basket punctually at the appointed hour next morning the good humoured little attorney tapped at mr pickwick's door which was opened with great alacrity by sam weller mr perker sir said sam announcing the visitor to mr pickwick who was sitting at the window in a thoughtful attitude wery glad you've looked in accidentally sir i rather think the gov'ner wants to have a word and a half with you sir perker bestowed a look of intelligence on sam intimating that he understood he was not to say he had been sent for and beckoning him to approach whispered briefly in his ear you don't mean that 'ere sir said sam starting back in excessive surprise perker nodded and smiled mr samuel weller looked at the little lawyer then at mr pickwick then at the ceiling then at perker again grinned laughed outright and finally catching up his hat from the carpet without further explanation disappeared what does this mean inquired mr pickwick looking at perker with astonishment what has put sam into this most extraordinary state oh nothing nothing replied perker come my dear sir draw up your chair to the table i have a good deal to say to you what papers are those inquired mr pickwick as the little man deposited on the table a small bundle of documents tied with red tape the papers in bardell and pickwick replied perker undoing the knot with his teeth mr pickwick grated the legs of his chair against the ground and throwing himself into it folded his hands and looked sternly if mr pickwick ever could look sternly at his legal friend you don't like to hear the name of the cause said the little man still busying himself with the knot no i do not indeed replied mr pickwick sorry for that resumed perker because it will form the subject of our conversation i would rather that the subject should be never mentioned between us perker interposed mr pickwick hastily pooh pooh my dear sir said the little man untying the bundle and glancing eagerly at mr pickwick out of the corners of his eyes it must be mentioned i have come on purpose now are you ready to hear what i have to say my dear sir no hurry if you are not i can wait i have this morning's paper here your time shall be mine there hereupon the little man threw one leg over the other and made a show of beginning to read with great composure and application well well said mr pickwick with a sigh but softening into a smile at the same time say what you have to say it's the old story i suppose with a difference my dear sir with a difference rejoined perker deliberately folding up the paper and putting it into his pocket again mrs bardell the plaintiff in the action is within these walls sir i know it was mr pickwick's reply very good retorted perker and you know how she comes here i suppose i mean on what grounds and at whose suit yes at least i have heard sam's account of the matter said mr pickwick with affected carelessness sam's account of the matter replied mr perker is i will venture to say a perfectly correct one well now my dear sir the first question i have to ask is whether this woman is to remain here to remain here echoed mr pickwick to remain here my dear sir rejoined perker leaning back in his chair and looking steadily at his client how can you ask me said that gentleman it rests with dodson and fogg you know that very well i know nothing of the kind retorted perker firmly it does not rest with dodson and fogg you know the men my dear sir as well as i do it rest solely wholly and entirely with you with me ejaculated mr pickwick rising nervously from his chair and reseating himself directly afterwards the little man gave a double knock on the lid of his snuff box opened it took a great pinch shut it up again and repeated the words with you i say my dear sir resumed the little man who seemed to gather confidence from the snuff i say that her speedy liberation or perpetual imprisonment rests with you and with you alone hear me out my dear sir if you please and do not be so very energetic for it will only put you into a perspiration and do no good whatever i say continued perker checking off each position on a different finger as he laid it down i say that nobody but you can rescue her from this den of wretchedness and that you can only do that by paying the costs of this suit both of plaintiff and defendant into the hands of these freeman's court sharks now pray be quiet my dear sir mr pickwick whose face had been undergoing most surprising changes during this speech and who was evidently on the verge of a strong burst of indignation calmed his wrath as well as he could perker strengthening his argumentative powers with another pinch of snuff proceeded i have seen the woman this morning by paying the costs you can obtain a full release and discharge from the damages and further this i know is a far greater object of consideration with you my dear sir a voluntary statement under her hand in the form of a letter to me that this business was from the very first fomented and encouraged and brought about by these men dodson and fogg that she deeply regrets ever having been the instrument of annoyance or injury to you and that she entreats me to intercede with you and implore your pardon if i pay her costs for her said mr pickwick indignantly a valuable document indeed no 'if' in the case my dear sir said perker triumphantly there is the very letter i speak of brought to my office by another woman at nine o'clock this morning before i had set foot in this place or held any communication with mrs bardell upon my honour selecting the letter from the bundle the little lawyer laid it at mr pickwick's elbow and took snuff for two consecutive minutes without winking is this all you have to say to me inquired mr pickwick mildly not quite replied perker i cannot undertake to say at this moment whether the wording of the cognovit the nature of the ostensible consideration and the proof we can get together about the whole conduct of the suit will be sufficient to justify an indictment for conspiracy i fear not my dear sir they are too clever for that i doubt i do mean to say however that the whole facts taken together will be sufficient to justify you in the minds of all reasonable men and now my dear sir i put it to you this one hundred and fifty pounds or whatever it may be take it in round numbers is nothing to you a jury has decided against you well their verdict is wrong but still they decided as they thought right and it is against you you have now an opportunity on easy terms of placing yourself in a much higher position than you ever could by remaining here which would only be imputed by people who didn't know you to sheer dogged wrongheaded brutal obstinacy nothing else my dear sir believe me can you hesitate to avail yourself of it when it restores you to your friends your old pursuits your health and amusements when it liberates your faithful and attached servant whom you otherwise doom to imprisonment for the whole of your life and above all when it enables you to take the very magnanimous revenge which i know my dear sir is one after your own heart of releasing this woman from a scene of misery and debauchery to which no man should ever be consigned if i had my will but the infliction of which on any woman is even more frightful and barbarous now i ask you my dear sir not only as your legal adviser but as your very true friend will you let slip the occasion of attaining all these objects and doing all this good for the paltry consideration of a few pounds finding their way into the pockets of a couple of rascals to whom it makes no manner of difference except that the more they gain the more they'll seek and so the sooner be led into some piece of knavery that must end in a crash i have put these considerations to you my dear sir very feebly and imperfectly but i ask you to think of them turn them over in your mind as long as you please i wait here most patiently for your answer before mr pickwick could reply before mr perker had taken one twentieth part of the snuff with which so unusually long an address imperatively required to be followed up there was a low murmuring of voices outside and then a hesitating knock at the door dear dear exclaimed mr pickwick who had been evidently roused by his friend's appeal what an annoyance that door is who is that me sir replied sam weller putting in his head i can't speak to you just now sam said mr pickwick i am engaged at this moment sam beg your pardon sir rejoined mr weller but here's a lady here sir as says she's somethin' wery partickler to disclose i can't see any lady replied mr pickwick whose mind was filled with visions of mrs bardell i vouldn't make too sure o' that sir urged mr weller shaking his head if you know'd who was near sir i rayther think you'd change your note as the hawk remarked to himself with a cheerful laugh ven he heard the robin redbreast a singin' round the corner who is it inquired mr pickwick will you see her sir asked mr weller holding the door in his hand as if he had some curious live animal on the other side i suppose i must said mr pickwick looking at perker well then all in to begin cried sam sound the gong draw up the curtain and enter the two con spiraytors as sam weller spoke he threw the door open and there rushed tumultuously into the room mr nathaniel winkle leading after him by the hand the identical young lady who at dingley dell had worn the boots with the fur round the tops and who now a very pleasing compound of blushes and confusion and lilac silk and a smart bonnet and a rich lace veil looked prettier than ever miss arabella allen exclaimed mr pickwick rising from his chair no replied mr winkle dropping on his knees mrs winkle pardon my dear friend pardon mr pickwick could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses and perhaps would not have done so but for the corroborative testimony afforded by the smiling countenance of perker and the bodily presence in the background of sam and the pretty housemaid who appeared to contemplate the proceedings with the liveliest satisfaction oh mr pickwick said arabella in a low voice as if alarmed at the silence can you forgive my imprudence mr pickwick returned no verbal response to this appeal but he took off his spectacles in great haste and seizing both the young lady's hands in his kissed her a great number of times perhaps a greater number than was absolutely necessary and then still retaining one of her hands told mr winkle he was an audacious young dog and bade him get up this mr winkle who had been for some seconds scratching his nose with the brim of his hat in a penitent manner did whereupon mr pickwick slapped him on the back several times and then shook hands heartily with perker who not to be behind hand in the compliments of the occasion saluted both the bride and the pretty housemaid with right good will and having wrung mr winkle's hand most cordially wound up his demonstrations of joy by taking snuff enough to set any half dozen men with ordinarily constructed noses a sneezing for life why my dear girl said mr pickwick how has all this come about come sit down and let me hear all how well she looks doesn't she perker added mr pickwick surveying arabella's face with a look of as much pride and exultation as if she had been his daughter delightful my dear sir replied the little man if i were not a married man myself i should be disposed to envy you you dog thus expressing himself the little lawyer gave mr winkle a poke in the chest which that gentleman reciprocated after which they both laughed very loudly but not so loudly as mr samuel weller who had just relieved his feelings by kissing the pretty housemaid under cover of the cupboard door i can never be grateful enough to you sam i am sure said arabella with the sweetest smile imaginable i shall not forget your exertions in the garden at clifton don't say nothin' wotever about it ma'am replied sam i only assisted natur' ma'am as the doctor said to the boy's mother arter he'd bled him to death mary my dear sit down said mr pickwick cutting short these compliments now then how long have you been married eh arabella looked bashfully at her lord and master who replied only three days only three days eh said mr pickwick why what have you been doing these three months ah to be sure interposed perker come account for this idleness you see pickwick's only astonishment is that it wasn't all over months ago why the fact is replied mr winkle looking at his blushing young wife that i could not persuade bella to run away for a long time and when i had persuaded her it was a long time more before we could find an opportunity mary had to give a month's warning too before she could leave her place next door and we couldn't possibly have done it without her assistance upon my word exclaimed mr pickwick who by this time had resumed his spectacles and was looking from arabella to winkle and from winkle to arabella with as much delight depicted in his countenance as warm heartedness and kindly feeling can communicate to the human face upon my word you seem to have been very systematic in your proceedings and is your brother acquainted with all this my dear oh no no replied arabella changing colour dear mr pickwick he must only know it from you from your lips alone he is so violent so prejudiced and has been so so anxious in behalf of his friend mr sawyer added arabella looking down that i fear the consequences dreadfully ah to be sure said perker gravely you must take the matter in hand for them my dear sir these young men will respect you when they would listen to nobody else you must prevent mischief my dear sir hot blood hot blood and the little man took a warning pinch and shook his head doubtfully you forget my love said mr pickwick gently you forget that i am a prisoner no indeed i do not my dear sir replied arabella i never have forgotten it i have never ceased to think how great your sufferings must have been in this shocking place but i hoped that what no consideration for yourself would induce you to do a regard to our happiness might if my brother hears of this first from you i feel certain we shall be reconciled he is my only relation in the world mr pickwick and unless you plead for me i fear i have lost even him i have done wrong very very wrong i know here poor arabella hid her face in her handkerchief and wept bitterly mr pickwick's nature was a good deal worked upon by these same tears but when mrs winkle drying her eyes took to coaxing and entreating in the sweetest tones of a very sweet voice he became particularly restless and evidently undecided how to act as was evinced by sundry nervous rubbings of his spectacle glasses nose tights head and gaiters taking advantage of these symptoms of indecision mr perker to whom it appeared the young couple had driven straight that morning urged with legal point and shrewdness that mr winkle senior was still unacquainted with the important rise in life's flight of steps which his son had taken that the future expectations of the said son depended entirely upon the said winkle senior continuing to regard him with undiminished feelings of affection and attachment which it was very unlikely he would if this great event were long kept a secret from him that mr pickwick repairing to bristol to seek mr allen might with equal reason repair to birmingham to seek mr winkle senior lastly that mr winkle senior had good right and title to consider mr pickwick as in some degree the guardian and adviser of his son and that it consequently behoved that gentleman and was indeed due to his personal character to acquaint the aforesaid winkle senior personally and by word of mouth with the whole circumstances of the case and with the share he had taken in the transaction mr tupman and mr snodgrass arrived most opportunely in this stage of the pleadings and as it was necessary to explain to them all that had occurred together with the various reasons pro and con the whole of the arguments were gone over again after which everybody urged every argument in his own way and at his own length and at last mr pickwick fairly argued and remonstrated out of all his resolutions and being in imminent danger of being argued and remonstrated out of his wits caught arabella in his arms and declaring that she was a very amiable creature and that he didn't know how it was but he had always been very fond of her from the first said he could never find it in his heart to stand in the way of young people's happiness and they might do with him as they pleased mr weller's first act on hearing this concession was to despatch job trotter to the illustrious mr pell with an authority to deliver to the bearer the formal discharge which his prudent parent had had the foresight to leave in the hands of that learned gentleman in case it should be at any time required on an emergency his next proceeding was to invest his whole stock of ready money in the purchase of five and twenty gallons of mild porter which he himself dispensed on the racket ground to everybody who would partake of it this done he hurra'd in divers parts of the building until he lost his voice and then quietly relapsed into his usual collected and philosophical condition at three o'clock that afternoon mr pickwick took a last look at his little room and made his way as well as he could through the throng of debtors who pressed eagerly forward to shake him by the hand until he reached the lodge steps he turned here to look about him and his eyes lightened as he did so in all the crowd of wan emaciated faces he saw not one which was not the happier for his sympathy and charity perker said mr pickwick beckoning one young man towards him this is mr jingle whom i spoke to you about very good my dear sir replied perker looking hard at jingle you will see me again young man to morrow i hope you may live to remember and feel deeply what i shall have to communicate sir jingle bowed respectfully trembled very much as he took mr pickwick's proffered hand and withdrew job you know i think said mr pickwick presenting that gentleman i know the rascal replied perker good humouredly see after your friend and be in the way to morrow at one do you hear now is there anything more nothing rejoined mr pickwick you have delivered the little parcel i gave you for your old landlord sam i have sir replied sam he bust out a cryin' sir and said you wos wery gen'rous and thoughtful and he only wished you could have him innokilated for a gallopin' consumption for his old friend as had lived here so long wos dead and he'd noweres to look for another poor fellow poor fellow said mr pickwick god bless you my friends as mr pickwick uttered this adieu the crowd raised a loud shout many among them were pressing forward to shake him by the hand again when he drew his arm through perker's and hurried from the prison far more sad and melancholy for the moment than when he had first entered it alas how many sad and unhappy beings had he left behind a happy evening was that for at least one party in the george and vulture and light and cheerful were two of the hearts that emerged from its hospitable door next morning the owners thereof were mr pickwick and sam weller the former of whom was speedily deposited inside a comfortable post coach with a little dickey behind in which the latter mounted with great agility sir called out mr weller to his master well sam replied mr pickwick thrusting his head out of the window i wish them horses had been three months and better in the fleet sir why sam inquired mr pickwick vy sir exclaimed mr weller rubbing his hands how they would go if they had been chapter xx illustration relates how mr pickwick with the assistance of samuel weller essayed to soften the heart of mr benjamin allen and to mollify the wrath of mr robert sawyer mr ben allen and mr bob sawyer sat together in the little surgery behind the shop discussing minced veal and future prospects when the discourse not unnaturally turned upon the practice acquired by bob the aforesaid and his present chances of deriving a competent independence from the honourable profession to which he had devoted himself which i think observed mr bob sawyer pursuing the thread of the subject which i think ben are rather dubious what's rather dubious inquired mr ben allen at the same time sharpening his intellects with a draught of beer what's dubious why the chances responded mr bob sawyer i forgot said mr ben allen the beer has reminded me that i forgot bob yes they are dubious it's wonderful how the poor people patronise me said mr bob sawyer reflectively they knock me up at all hours of the night they take medicine to an extent which i should have conceived impossible they put on blisters and leeches with a perseverance worthy of a better cause they make additions to their families in a manner which is quite awful six of those last named little promissory notes all due on the same day ben and all entrusted to me it's very gratifying isn't it said mr ben allen holding his plate for some more minced veal oh very replied bob only not quite so much so as the confidence of patients with a shilling or two to spare would be this business was capitally described in the advertisement ben it is a practice a very extensive practice and that's all bob said mr ben allen laying down his knife and fork and fixing his eyes on the visage of his friend bob i'll tell you what it is what is it inquired mr bob sawyer you must make yourself with as little delay as possible master of arabella's one thousand pounds three per cent consolidated bank annuities now standing in her name in the book or books of the governor and company of the bank of england added bob sawyer in legal phraseology exactly so said ben she has it when she comes of age or marries she wants a year of coming of age and if you plucked up a spirit she needn't want a month of being married she's a very charming and delightful creature quoth mr robert sawyer in reply and has only one fault that i know of ben it happens unfortunately that that single blemish is a want of taste she don't like me it's my opinion that she don't know what she does like said mr ben allen contemptuously perhaps not remarked mr bob sawyer but it's my opinion that she does know what she doesn't like and that's of more importance i wish said mr ben allen setting his teeth together and speaking more like a savage warrior who fed on raw wolf's flesh which he carved with his fingers than a peaceable young gentleman who ate minced veal with a knife and fork i wish i knew whether any rascal really has been tampering with her and attempting to engage her affections i think i should assassinate him bob i'd put a bullet in him if i found him out said mr sawyer stopping in the course of a long draught of beer and looking malignantly out of the porter pot if that didn't do his business i'd extract it afterwards and kill him that way mr benjamin allen gazed abstractedly on his friend for some minutes in silence and then said you have never proposed to her point blank bob no because i saw it would be of no use replied mr robert sawyer you shall do it before you are twenty four hours older retorted ben with desperate calmness she shall have you or i'll know the reason why i'll exert my authority well said mr bob sawyer we shall see we shall see my friend replied mr ben allen fiercely he paused for a few seconds and added in a voice broken by emotion you have loved her from a child my friend you loved her when we were boys at school together and even then she was wayward and slighted your young feelings do you recollect with all the eagerness of a child's love one day pressing upon her acceptance two small caraway seed biscuits and one sweet apple neatly folded into a circular parcel with the leaf of a copybook i do replied bob sawyer she slighted that i think said ben allen she did rejoined bob she said i had kept the parcel so long in the pockets of my corduroys that the apple was unpleasantly warm i remember said mr allen gloomily upon which we ate it ourselves in alternate bites bob sawyer intimated his recollection of the circumstance last alluded to by a melancholy frown and the two friends remained for some time absorbed each in his own meditations while these observations were being exchanged between mr bob sawyer and mr benjamin allen and while the boy in the grey livery marvelling at the unwonted prolongation of the dinner cast an anxious look from time to time towards the glass door distracted by inward misgivings regarding the amount of minced veal which would be ultimately reserved for his individual cravings there rolled soberly on through the streets of bristol a private fly painted of a sad green colour drawn by a chubby sort of brown horse and driven by a surly looking man with his legs dressed like the legs of a groom and his body attired in the coat of a coachman such appearances are common to many vehicles belonging to and maintained by old ladies of economic habits and in this vehicle sat an old lady who was its mistress and proprietor martin said the old lady calling to the surly man out of the front window well said the surly man touching his hat to the old lady mr sawyer's said the old lady i was going there said the surly man the old lady nodded the satisfaction which this proof of the surly man's foresight imparted to her feelings and the surly man giving a smart lash to the chubby horse they all repaired to mr bob sawyer's together martin said the old lady when the fly stopped at the door of mr robert sawyer late nockemorf well said martin ask the lad to step out and mind the horse i'm going to mind the horse myself said martin laying his whip on the roof of the fly i can't permit it on any account said the old lady your testimony will be very important and i must take you into the house with me you must not stir from my side during the whole interview do you hear i hear replied martin well what are you stopping for nothing replied martin so saying the surly man leisurely descended from the wheel on which he had been poising himself on the tips of the toes of his right foot and having summoned the boy in the grey livery opened the coach door flung down the steps and thrusting in a hand enveloped in a dark wash leather glove pulled out the old lady with as much concern in his manner as if she were a bandbox dear me exclaimed the old lady i am so flurried now i have got here martin that i'm all in a tremble mr martin coughed behind the dark wash leather glove but expressed no sympathy so the old lady composing herself trotted up mr bob sawyer's steps and mr martin followed immediately on the old lady's entering the shop mr benjamin allen and mr bob sawyer who had been putting the spirits and water out of sight and upsetting nauseous drugs to take off the smell of the tobacco smoke issued hastily forth in a transport of pleasure and affection my dear aunt exclaimed mr ben allen how kind of you to look in upon us mr sawyer aunt my friend mr bob sawyer whom i have spoken to you about regarding you know aunt and here mr ben allen who was not at the moment extraordinarily sober added the word arabella in what was meant to be a whisper but which was an especially audible and distinct tone of speech which nobody could avoid hearing if anybody were so disposed my dear benjamin said the old lady struggling with a great shortness of breath and trembling from head to foot don't be alarmed my dear but i think i had better speak to mr sawyer alone for a moment only for one moment bob said mr allen will you take my aunt into the surgery certainly responded bob in a most professional voice step this way my dear ma'am don't be frightened ma'am we shall be able to set you to rights in a very short time i have no doubt ma'am here my dear ma'am now then with this mr bob sawyer having handed the old lady to a chair shut the door drew another chair close to her and waited to hear detailed the symptoms of some disorder from which he saw in perspective a long train of profits and advantages the first thing the old lady did was to shake her head a great many times and begin to cry nervous said bob sawyer complacently camphor julep and water three times a day and composing draught at night i don't know how to begin mr sawyer said the old lady it is so very painful and distressing you need not begin ma'am rejoined mr bob sawyer i can anticipate all you would say the head is in fault i should be very sorry to think it was the heart said the old lady with a slight groan not the slightest danger of that ma'am replied bob sawyer the stomach is the primary cause mr sawyer exclaimed the old lady starting not the least doubt of it ma'am rejoined bob looking wondrous wise medicine in time my dear ma'am would have prevented it all mr sawyer said the old lady more flurried than before this conduct is either great impertinence to one in my situation sir or it arises from your not understanding the object of my visit if it had been in the power of medicine or any foresight i could have used to prevent what has occurred i should certainly have done so i had better see my nephew at once said the old lady twirling her reticule indignantly and rising as she spoke stop a moment ma'am said bob sawyer i'm afraid i have not understood you what is the matter ma'am my niece mr sawyer said the old lady your friend's sister yes ma'am said bob all impatience for the old lady although much agitated spoke with the most tantalising deliberation as old ladies often do yes ma'am left my home mr sawyer three days ago on a pretended visit to my sister another aunt of hers who keeps the large boarding school just beyond the third mile stone where there is a very large laburnum tree and an oak gate said the old lady stopping in this place to dry her eyes oh devil take the laburnum tree ma'am said bob quite forgetting his professional dignity in his anxiety get on a little faster put a little more steam on ma'am pray this morning said the old lady slowly this morning she she came back ma'am i suppose said bob with great animation did she come back no she did not she wrote replied the old lady what did she say inquired bob eagerly she said mr sawyer replied the old lady and it is this i want you to prepare benjamin's mind for gently and by degrees she said that she was i have got the letter in my pocket mr sawyer but my glasses are in the carriage and i should only waste your time if i attempted to point out the passage to you without them she said in short mr sawyer that she was married what said or rather shouted mr bob sawyer married repeated the old lady mr bob sawyer stopped to hear no more but darting from the surgery into the outer shop cried in a stentorian voice ben my boy she's bolted mr ben allen who had been slumbering behind the counter with his head half a foot or so below his knees no sooner heard this appalling communication than he made a precipitate rush at mr martin and twisting his hand in the neckcloth of that taciturn servitor expressed an intention of choking him where he stood this intention with a promptitude often the effect of desperation he at once commenced carrying into execution with much vigour and surgical skill mr martin who was a man of few words and possessed but little power of eloquence or persuasion submitted to this operation with a very calm and agreeable expression of countenance for some seconds finding however that it threatened speedily to lead to a result which would place it beyond his power to claim any wages board or otherwise in all time to come he muttered an inarticulate remonstrance and felled mr benjamin allen to the ground as that gentleman had his hands entangled in his cravat he had no alternative but to follow him to the floor there they both lay struggling when the shop door opened and the party was increased by the arrival of two most unexpected visitors to wit mr pickwick and mr samuel weller illustration he felled mr benjamin allen to the ground the impression at once produced on mr weller's mind by what he saw was that mr martin was hired by the establishment of sawyer late nockemorf to take strong medicine or to go into fits and be experimentalised upon or to swallow poison now and then with the view of testing the efficacy of some new antidotes or to do something or other to promote the great science of medicine and gratify the ardent spirit of inquiry burning in the bosoms of its two young professors so without presuming to interfere sam stood perfectly still and looked on as if he were mightily interested in the result of the then pending experiment not so mr pickwick he at once threw himself on the astonished combatants with his accustomed energy and loudly called upon the bystanders to interpose this roused mr bob sawyer who had been hitherto quite paralysed by the frenzy of his companion with that gentleman's assistance mr pickwick raised ben allen to his feet mr martin finding himself alone on the floor got up and looked about him mr allen said mr pickwick what is the matter sir never mind sir replied mr allen with haughty defiance what is it inquired mr pickwick looking at bob sawyer is he unwell before bob could reply mr ben allen seized mr pickwick by the hand and murmured in sorrowful accents my sister my dear sir my sister oh is that all said mr pickwick we shall easily arrange that matter i hope your sister is safe and well and i am here my dear sir to sorry to do anythin' as may cause an interruption to such wery pleasant proceedin's as the king said ven he dissolved the parliament interposed mr weller who had been peeping through the glass door but there's another experiment here sir here's a wenerable old lady a lyin' on the carpet waiting for dissection or galwinism or some other rewivin' and scientific inwention i forgot exclaimed mr ben allen it is my aunt dear me said mr pickwick poor lady gently sam gently strange sitivation for one o' the family observed sam weller hoisting the aunt into a chair now depitty sawbones bring out the wollatilly the latter observation was addressed to the boy in grey who having handed over the fly to the care of the street keeper had come back to see what all the noise was about between the boy in grey and mr bob sawyer and mr benjamin allen who having frightened his aunt into a fainting fit was affectionately solicitous for her recovery the old lady was at length restored to consciousness then mr ben allen turning with a puzzled countenance to mr pickwick asked him what he was about to say when he had been so alarmingly interrupted we are all friends here i presume said mr pickwick clearing his voice and looking towards the man of few words with the surly countenance who drove the fly with the chubby horse this reminded mr bob sawyer that the boy in grey was looking on with eyes wide open and greedy ears the incipient chemist having been lifted up by his coat collar and dropped outside the door bob sawyer assured mr pickwick that he might speak without reserve your sister my dear sir said mr pickwick turning to benjamin allen is in london well and happy her happiness is no object to me sir said mr benjamin allen with a flourish of the hand her husband is an object to me sir said bob sawyer he shall be an object to me sir at twelve paces and a very pretty object i'll make of him sir a mean spirited scoundrel this as it stood was a very pretty denunciation and magnanimous withal but mr bob sawyer rather weakened its effect by winding up with some general observations concerning the punching of heads and knocking out of eyes which were commonplace by comparison stay sir said mr pickwick before you apply those epithets to the gentleman in question consider dispassionately the extent of his fault and above all remember that he is a friend of mine what said mr bob sawyer his name cried ben allen his name mr nathaniel winkle said mr pickwick mr benjamin allen deliberately crushed his spectacles beneath the heel of his boot and having picked up the pieces and put them into three separate pockets folded his arms bit his lips and looked in a threatening manner at the bland features of mr pickwick then it's you is it sir who have encouraged and brought about this match inquired mr benjamin allen at length and it's this gentleman's servant i suppose interrupted the old lady who has been skulking about my house and endeavouring to entrap my servants to conspire against their mistress martin well said the surly man coming forward is that the young man you saw in the lane whom you told me about this morning mr martin who as it has already appeared was a man of few words looked at sam weller nodded his head and growled forth that's the man mr weller who was never proud gave a smile of friendly recognition as his eyes encountered those of the surly groom and admitted in courteous terms that he had knowed him afore and this is the faithful creature exclaimed mr ben allen whom i had nearly suffocated mr pickwick how dare you allow your fellow to be employed in the abduction of my sister i demand that you explain this matter sir explain it sir cried mr bob sawyer fiercely it's a conspiracy said ben allen a regular plant added mr bob sawyer a disgraceful imposition observed the old lady nothing but a do remarked martin pray hear me urged mr pickwick as mr ben allen fell into a chair that patients were bled in and gave way to his pocket handkerchief i have rendered no assistance in this matter beyond that of being present at one interview between the young people which i could not prevent and from which i conceived my presence would remove any slight colouring of impropriety that it might otherwise have had this is the whole share i have taken in the transaction and i had no suspicion that an immediate marriage was even contemplated though mind added mr pickwick hastily checking himself mind i do not say i should have prevented it if i had known that it was intended you hear that all of you you hear that said mr benjamin allen i hope they do mildly observed mr pickwick looking round and added that gentleman his colour mounting as he spoke i hope they hear this sir also that from what has been stated to me sir i assert that you were by no means justified in attempting to force your sister's inclinations as you did and that you should rather have endeavoured by your kindness and forbearance to have supplied the place of other nearer relations whom she has never known from a child as regards my young friend i must beg to add that in every point of worldly advantage he is at least on an equal footing with yourself if not on a much better one and that unless i hear this question discussed with becoming temper and moderation i decline hearing any more said upon the subject i wish to make a wery few remarks in addition to wot has been put forard by the honourable gen'l'm'n as has jist give over said mr weller stepping forth which is this here a indiwidual in company has called me a feller that has nothing whatever to do with the matter sam interposed mr pickwick pray hold your tongue i ain't a goin' to say nothin' on that ere pint sir replied sam but merely this here p'raps that gen'l'm'n may think as there wos a priory 'tachment but there worn't nothin' o' the sort for the young lady said in the wery beginnin' o' keepin' company that she couldn't abide him nobody's cut him out and it 'ud ha' been jist the wery same for him if the young lady had never seen mr vinkle that's wot i wished to say sir and i hope i've now made that 'ere gen'l'm'n's mind easy a short pause followed these consolatory remarks of mr weller then mr ben allen rising from his chair protested that he would never see arabella's face again while mr bob sawyer despite sam's flattering assurance vowed dreadful vengeance on the happy bridegroom but just when matters were at their height and threatening to remain so mr pickwick found a powerful assistant in the old lady who evidently much struck by the mode in which he had advocated her niece's cause ventured to approach mr benjamin allen with a few comforting reflections of which the chief were that after all perhaps it was well it was no worse the least said the soonest mended and upon her word she did not know that it was so very bad after all what was over couldn't be begun and what couldn't be cured must be endured with various other assurances of the like novel and strengthening description to all of these mr benjamin allen replied that he meant no disrespect to his aunt or anybody there but if it were all the same to them and they would allow him to have his own way he would rather have the pleasure of hating his sister till death and after it at length when this determination had been announced half a hundred times the old lady suddenly bridling up and looking very majestic wished to know what she had done that no respect was to be paid to her years or station and that she should be obliged to beg and pray in that way of her own nephew whom she remembered about five and twenty years before he was born and whom she had known personally when he hadn't a tooth in his head to say nothing of her presence on the first occasion of his having his hair cut and assistance at numerous other times and ceremonies during his babyhood of sufficient importance to found a claim upon his affection obedience and sympathies for ever while the good lady was bestowing this objurgation on mr ben allen bob sawyer and mr pickwick had retired in close conversation to the inner room where mr sawyer was observed to apply himself several times to the mouth of a black bottle under the influence of which his features gradually assumed a cheerful and even jovial expression and at last he emerged from the room bottle in hand and remarking that he was very sorry to say he had been making a fool of himself begged to propose the health and happiness of mr and mrs winkle whose felicity so far from envying he would be the first to congratulate them upon hearing this mr ben allen suddenly arose from his chair and seizing the black bottle drank the toast so heartily that the liquor being strong he nearly became as black in the face as the bottle finally the black bottle went round till it was empty and there was so much shaking of hands and interchanging of compliments that even the metal visaged mr martin condescended to smile and now said bob sawyer rubbing his hands we'll have a jolly night i am sorry said mr pickwick that i must return to my inn i have not been accustomed to fatigue lately and my journey has tired me exceedingly you'll take some tea mr pickwick said the old lady with irresistible sweetness thank you i would rather not replied that gentleman the truth is that the old lady's evidently increasing admiration was mr pickwick's principal inducement for going away he thought of mrs bardell and every glance of the old lady's eyes threw him into a cold perspiration as mr pickwick could by no means be prevailed upon to stay it was arranged at once on his own proposition that mr benjamin allen should accompany him on his journey to the elder mr winkle's and that the coach should be at the door at nine o'clock next morning he then took his leave and followed by samuel weller repaired to the bush it is worthy of remark that mr martin's face was horribly convulsed as he shook hands with sam at parting and that he gave vent to a smile and an oath simultaneously from which tokens it has been inferred by those who were best acquainted with that gentleman's peculiarities that he expressed himself much pleased with mr weller's society and requested the honour of his further acquaintance shall i order a private room sir inquired sam when they reached the bush why no sam replied mr pickwick as i dined in the coffee room and shall go to bed soon it is hardly worth while see who there is in the travellers' room sam mr weller departed on his errand and presently returned to say there was only a gentleman with one eye and that he and the landlord were drinking a bowl of bishop together i will join them said mr pickwick he's a queer customer the vun eyed vun sir observed mr weller as he led the way he's a gammonin' that 'ere landlord he is sir till he don't rightly know vether he's a standing on the soles of his boots or the crown of his hat the individual to whom this observation referred was sitting at the upper end of the room when mr pickwick entered and was smoking a large dutch pipe with his eye intently fixed on the round face of the landlord a jolly looking old personage to whom he had recently been relating some tale of wonder as was testified by sundry disjointed exclamations of well i wouldn't have believed it the strangest thing i ever heard couldn't have supposed it possible and other expressions of astonishment which burst spontaneously from his lips as he returned the fixed gaze of the one eyed man servant sir said the one eyed man to mr pickwick fine night sir very much so indeed replied mr pickwick as the waiter placed a small decanter of brandy and some hot water before him while mr pickwick was mixing his brandy and water the one eyed man looked round at him earnestly from time to time and at length said i think i've seen you before i don't recollect you rejoined mr pickwick i daresay not said the one eyed man you didn't know me but i knew two friends of yours that were stopping at the peacock at eatanswill at the time of the election oh indeed exclaimed mr pickwick yes rejoined the one eyed man i mentioned a little circumstance to them about a friend of mine of the name of tom smart perhaps you have heard them speaking of it often rejoined mr pickwick smiling he was your uncle i think no no only a friend of my uncle's replied the one eyed man he was a wonderful man that uncle of yours though remarked the landlord shaking his head well i think he was i think i may say he was answered the one eyed man i could tell you a story about that same uncle gentlemen that would rather surprise you could you said mr pickwick let us hear it by all means the one eyed bagman ladled out a glass of negus from the bowl and drank it smoked a long whiff out of the dutch pipe and then calling to sam weller who was lingering near the door that he needn't go away unless he wanted to because the story was no secret fixed his eye upon the landlord's and proceeded in the words of the next chapter chapter xxi illustration containing the story of the bagman's uncle my uncle gentlemen said the bagman was one of the merriest pleasantest cleverest fellows that ever lived i wish you had known him gentlemen on second thoughts gentlemen i don't wish you had known him for if you had you would have been all by this time in the ordinary course of nature if not dead at all events so near it as to have taken to stopping at home and giving up company which would have deprived me of the inestimable pleasure of addressing you at this moment gentlemen i wish your fathers and mothers had known my uncle they would have been amazingly fond of him especially your respectable mothers i know they would if any two of his numerous virtues predominated over the many that adorned his character i should say they were his mixed punch and his after supper song excuse my dwelling on these melancholy reflections of departed worth you won't see a man like my uncle every day in the week i have always considered it a great point in my uncle's character gentlemen that he was the intimate friend and companion of tom smart of the great house of bilson and slum cateaton street city my uncle collected for tiggin and welps but for a long time he went pretty near the same journey as tom and the very first night they met my uncle took a fancy for tom and tom took a fancy for my uncle they made a bet of a new hat before they had known each other half an hour who should brew the best quart of punch and drink it the quickest my uncle was judged to have won the making but tom smart beat him in the drinking by about half a salt spoonful they took another quart a piece to drink each other's health in and were staunch friends ever afterwards there's a destiny in these things gentlemen we can't help it in personal appearance my uncle was a trifle shorter than the middle size he was a thought stouter too than the ordinary run of people and perhaps his face might be a shade redder he had the jolliest face you ever saw gentlemen something like punch with a handsomer nose and chin his eyes were always twinkling and sparkling with good humour and a smile not one of your unmeaning wooden grins but a real merry hearty good tempered smile was perpetually on his countenance he was pitched out of his gig once and knocked head first against a mile stone there he lay stunned and so cut about the face with some gravel which had been heaped up alongside it that to use my uncle's own strong expression if his mother could have revisited the earth she wouldn't have known him indeed when i come to think of the matter gentlemen i feel pretty sure she wouldn't for she died when my uncle was two years and seven months old and i think it's very likely that even without the gravel his top boots would have puzzled the good lady not a little to say nothing of his jolly red face however there he lay and i have heard my uncle say many a time that the man said who picked him up that he was smiling as merrily as if he had tumbled out for a treat and that after they had bled him the first glimmerings of returning animation were his jumping up in bed bursting out into a loud laugh kissing the young woman who held the basin and demanding a mutton chop and a pickled walnut he was very fond of pickled walnuts gentlemen he said he always found that taken without vinegar they relished the beer my uncle's great journey was in the fall of the leaf at which time he collected debts and took orders in the north going from london to edinburgh from edinburgh to glasgow from glasgow back to edinburgh and thence to london by the smack you are to understand that his second visit to edinburgh was for his own pleasure he used to go back for a week just to look up his old friends and what with breakfasting with this one lunching with that dining with a third and supping with another a pretty tight week he used to make of it i don't know whether any of you gentlemen ever partook of a real substantial hospitable scotch breakfast and then went to a slight lunch of a bushel of oysters a dozen or so of bottled ale and a noggin or two of whisky to close up with if you ever did you will agree with me that it requires a pretty strong head to go out to dinner and supper afterwards but bless your hearts and eyebrows all this sort of thing was nothing to my uncle he was so well seasoned that it was mere child's play i have heard him say that he could see the dundee people out any day and walk home afterwards without staggering and yet the dundee people have as strong heads and as strong punch gentleman as you are likely to meet with between the poles i have heard of a glasgow man and a dundee man drinking against each other for fifteen hours at a sitting they were both suffocated as nearly as could be ascertained at the same moment but with this trifling exception gentlemen they were not a bit the worse for it one night within four and twenty hours of the time when he had settled to take shipping for london my uncle supped at the house of a very old friend of his a bailie mac something and four syllables after it who lived in the old town of edinburgh there were the bailie's wife and the bailie's three daughters and the bailie's grown up son and three or four stout bushy eye browed canny old scotch fellows that the bailie had got together to do honour to my uncle and help to make merry it was a glorious supper there were kippered salmon and finnan haddocks and a lamb's head and a haggis a celebrated scotch dish gentlemen which my uncle used to say always looked to him when it came to the table very much like a cupid's stomach and a great many other things besides that i forget the names of but very good things notwithstanding the lassies were pretty and agreeable the bailie's wife was one of the best creatures that ever lived and my uncle was in thoroughly good cue the consequence of which was that the young ladies tittered and giggled and the old lady laughed out loud and the bailie and the other old fellows roared till they were red in the face the whole mortal time i don't quite recollect how many tumblers of whisky toddy each man drank after supper but this i know that about one o'clock in the morning the bailie's grown up son became insensible while attempting the first verse of 'willie brewed a peak o' maut' and he having been for half an hour before the only other man visible above the mahogany it occurred to my uncle that it was almost time to think about going especially as drinking had set in at seven o'clock in order that he might get home at a decent hour but thinking it might not be quite polite to go just then my uncle voted himself into the chair mixed another glass rose to propose his own health addressed himself in a neat and complimentary speech and drank the toast with great enthusiasm still nobody woke so my uncle took a little drop more neat this time to prevent the toddy from disagreeing with him and laying violent hands on his hat sallied forth into the street it was a wild gusty night when my uncle closed the bailie's door and settling his hat firmly on his head to prevent the wind from taking it thrust his hands into his pockets and looking upward took a short survey of the state of the weather the clouds were drifting over the moon at their giddiest speed at one time wholly obscuring her at another suffering her to burst forth in full splendour and shed her light on all the subjects around anon driving over her again with increased velocity and shrouding everything in darkness 'really this won't do' said my uncle addressing himself to the weather as if he felt himself personally offended 'this is not at all the kind of thing for my voyage it will not do at any price' said my uncle very impressively having repeated this several times he recovered his balance with some difficulty for he was rather giddy with looking up into the sky so long and walked merrily on the bailie's house was in the canongate and my uncle was going to the other end of leith walk rather better than a mile's journey on either side of him there shot up against the dark sky tall gaunt straggling houses with time stained fronts and windows that seemed to have shared the lot of eyes in mortals and to have grown dim and sunken with age six seven eight storeys high were the houses storey piled above storey as the children build with cards throwing their dark shadows over the roughly paved road and making the dark night darker a few oil lamps were scattered at long distances but they only served to mark the dirty entrance to some narrow close or to show where a common stair communicated by steep and intricate windings with the various flats above glancing at all these things with the air of a man who had seen them too often before to think them worthy of much notice now my uncle walked up the middle of the street with a thumb in each waistcoat pocket indulging from time to time in various snatches of song chanted forth with such good will and spirit that the quiet honest folk started from their first sleep and lay trembling in bed till the sound died away in the distance when satisfying themselves that it was only some drunken ne'er do weel finding his way home they covered themselves up warm and fell asleep again i am particular in describing how my uncle walked up the middle of the street with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets gentlemen because as he often used to say and with great reason too there is nothing at all extraordinary in this story unless you distinctly understand at the beginning that he was not by any means of a marvellous or romantic turn gentlemen my uncle walked on with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets taking the middle of the street to himself and singing now a verse of a love song and then a verse of a drinking one and when he was tired of both whistling melodiously until he reached the north bridge which at this point connects the old and new towns of edinburgh here he stopped for a minute to look at the strange irregular clusters of lights piled one above the other and twinkling afar off so high that they looked like stars gleaming from the castle walls on the one side and the calton hill on the other as if they illuminated veritable castles in the air while the old picturesque town slept heavily on in gloom and darkness below its palace and chapel of holyrood guarded day and night as a friend of my uncle's used to say by old arthur's seat towering surly and dark like some gruff genius over the ancient city he has watched so long i say gentlemen my uncle stopped here for a minute to look about him and then paying a compliment to the weather which had a little cleared up though the moon was sinking walked on again as royally as before keeping the middle of the road with great dignity and looking as if he would very much like to meet somebody who would dispute possession of it with him there was nobody at all disposed to contest the point as it happened and so on he went with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets like a lamb when my uncle reached the end of leith walk he had to cross a pretty large piece of waste ground which separated him from a short street which he had to turn down to go direct to his lodging now in this piece of waste ground there was at that time an enclosure belonging to some wheelwright who contracted with the post office for the purchase of old worn out mail coaches and my uncle being very fond of coaches old young or middle aged all at once took it into his head to step out of his road for no other purpose than to peep between the palings at these mails about a dozen of which he remembered to have seen crowded together in a very forlorn and dismantled state inside my uncle was a very enthusiastic emphatic sort of person gentlemen so finding that he could not obtain a good peep between the palings he got over them and sitting himself quietly down on an old axletree began to contemplate the mail coaches with a great deal of gravity there might be a dozen of them or there might be more my uncle was never quite certain on this point and being a man of very scrupulous veracity about numbers didn't like to say but there they stood all huddled together in the most desolate condition imaginable the doors had been torn from their hinges and removed the linings had been stripped off only a shred hanging here and there by a rusty nail the lamps were gone the poles had long since vanished the iron work was rusty the paint was worn away the wind whistled through the chinks in the bare wood work and the rain which had collected on the roofs fell drop by drop into the insides with a hollow and melancholy sound they were the decaying skeletons of departed mails and in that lonely place at that time of night they looked chill and dismal my uncle rested his head upon his hands and thought of the busy bustling people who had rattled about years before in the old coaches and were now as silent and changed he thought of the numbers of people to whom one of those crazy mouldering vehicles had borne night after night for many years and through all weathers the anxiously expected intelligence the eagerly looked for remittance the promised assurance of health and safety the sudden announcement of sickness and death the merchant the lover the wife the widow the mother the schoolboy the very child who tottered to the door at the postman's knock how had they all looked forward to the arrival of the old coach and where were they all now gentlemen my uncle used to say that he thought all this at the time but i rather suspect he learnt it out of some book afterwards for he distinctly stated that he fell into a kind of doze as he sat on the old axletree looking at the decayed mail coaches and that he was suddenly awakened by some deep church bell striking two now my uncle was never a fast thinker and if he had thought all these things i am quite certain it would have taken him till full half past two o'clock at the very least i am therefore decidedly of opinion gentlemen that my uncle fell into a kind of doze without having thought about anything at all be this as it may a church bell struck two my uncle woke rubbed his eyes and jumped up in astonishment in one instant after the clock struck two the whole of this deserted and quiet spot had become a scene of most extraordinary life and animation the mail coach doors were on their hinges the lining was replaced the iron work was as good as new the paint was restored the lamps were alight cushions and great coats were on every box porters were thrusting parcels into every boot guards were stowing away letter bags hostlers were dashing pails of water against the renovated wheels numbers of men were rushing about fixing poles into every coach passengers arrived portmanteaus were handed up horses were put to in short it was perfectly clear that every mail there was to be off directly gentlemen my uncle opened his eyes so wide at all this that to the very last moment of his life he used to wonder how it fell out that he had ever been able to shut 'em again 'now then' said a voice as my uncle felt a hand on his shoulder 'you're booked for inside you'd better get in' 'i booked' said my uncle turning round 'yes certainly' my uncle gentlemen could say nothing he was so very much astonished the queerest thing of all was that although there was such a crowd of persons and although fresh faces were pouring in every moment there was no telling where they came from they seemed to start up in some strange manner from the ground or the air and disappear in the same way when a porter had put his luggage in the coach and received his fare he turned round and was gone and before my uncle had well begun to wonder what had become of him half a dozen fresh ones started up and staggered along under the weight of parcels which seemed big enough to crush them the passengers were all dressed so oddly too large broad skirted laced coats with great cuffs and no collars and wigs gentlemen great formal wigs with a tie behind my uncle could make nothing of it 'now are you going to get in' said the person who had addressed my uncle before he was dressed as a mail guard with a wig on his head and most enormous cuffs to his coat and had a lantern in one hand and a huge blunderbuss in the other which he was going to stow away in his little arm chest 'are you going to get in jack martin' said the guard holding the lantern to my uncle's face 'hallo' said my uncle falling back a step or two 'that's familiar' 'it's so on the way bill' replied the guard 'isn't there a mister before it' said my uncle for he felt gentlemen that for a guard he didn't know to call him jack martin was a liberty which the post office wouldn't have sanctioned if they had known it 'no there is not' rejoined the guard coolly 'is the fare paid' inquired my uncle 'of course it is' rejoined the guard 'it is is it' said my uncle 'then here goes which coach' 'this' said the guard pointing to an old fashioned edinburgh and london mail which had the steps down and the door open 'stop here are the other passengers let them get in first' as the guard spoke there all at once appeared right in front of my uncle a young gentleman in a powdered wig and a sky blue coat trimmed with silver made very full and broad in the skirts which were lined with buckram tiggin and welps were in the printed calico and waistcoatpiece line gentlemen so my uncle knew all the materials at once he wore knee breeches and a kind of leggings rolled up over his silk stockings and shoes with buckles he had ruffles at his wrists a three cornered hat on his head and a long taper sword by his side the flaps of his waistcoat came half way down his thighs and the ends of his cravat reached to his waist he stalked gravely to the coach door pulled off his hat and held it above his head at arm's length cocking his little finger in the air at the same time as some affected people do when they take a cup of tea then he drew his feet together and made a low grave bow and then put out his left hand my uncle was just going to step forward and shake it heartily when he perceived that these attentions were directed not towards him but to a young lady who had just then appeared at the foot of the steps attired in an old fashioned green velvet dress with a long waist and stomacher she had no bonnet on her head gentlemen which was muffled in a black silk hood but she looked round for an instant as she prepared to get into the coach and such a beautiful face as she disclosed my uncle had never seen not even in a picture she got into the coach holding up her dress with one hand and as my uncle always said with a round oath when he told the story he wouldn't have believed it possible that legs and feet could have been brought to such a state of perfection unless he had seen them with his own eyes but in this one glimpse of the beautiful face my uncle saw that the young lady cast an imploring look upon him and that she appeared terrified and distressed he noticed too that the young fellow in the powdered wig notwithstanding his show of gallantry which was all very fine and grand clasped her tight by the wrist when she got in and followed himself immediately afterwards an uncommonly ill looking fellow in a close brown wig and a plum coloured suit wearing a very large sword and boots up to his hips belonged to the party and when he sat himself down next to the young lady who shrunk into a corner at his approach my uncle was confirmed in his original impression that something dark and mysterious was going forward or as he always said himself that 'there was a screw loose somewhere' it's quite surprising how quickly he made up his mind to help the lady at any peril if she needed help 'death and lightning' exclaimed the young gentleman laying his hand upon his sword as my uncle entered the coach 'blood and thunder' roared the other gentleman with this he whipped his sword out and made a lunge at my uncle without further ceremony my uncle had no weapon about him but with great dexterity he snatched the ill looking gentleman's three cornered hat from his head and receiving the point of his sword right through the crown squeezed the sides together and held it tight 'pink him behind' cried the ill looking gentleman to his companion as he struggled to regain his sword 'he had better not' cried my uncle displaying the heel of one of his shoes in a threatening manner 'i'll kick his brains out if he has any or fracture his skull if he hasn't' exerting all his strength at this moment my uncle wrenched the ill looking man's sword from his grasp and flung it clean out of the coach window upon which the younger gentleman vociferated 'death and lightning' again and laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword in a very fierce manner but didn't draw it perhaps gentlemen as my uncle used to say with a smile perhaps he was afraid of alarming the lady 'now gentlemen' said my uncle taking his seat deliberately 'i don't want to have any death with or without lightning in a lady's presence and we have had quite blood and thundering enough for one journey so if you please we'll sit in our places like quiet insides here guard pick up that gentleman's carving knife' as quickly as my uncle said the words the guard appeared at the coach window with the gentleman's sword in his hand he held up his lantern and looked earnestly in my uncle's face as he handed it in when by its light my uncle saw to his great surprise that an immense crowd of mail coach guards swarmed round the window every one of whom had his eyes earnestly fixed upon him too he had never seen such a sea of white faces red bodies and earnest eyes in all his born days 'this is the strangest sort of thing i ever had anything to do with' thought my uncle 'allow me to return you your hat sir' the ill looking gentleman received his three cornered hat in silence looked at the hole in the middle with an inquiring air and finally stuck it on the top of his wig with a solemnity the effect of which was a trifle impaired by his sneezing violently at the moment and jerking it off again 'all right' cried the guard with the lantern mounting into his little seat behind away they went my uncle peeped out of the coach window as they emerged from the yard and observed that the other mails with coachmen guards horses and passengers complete were driving round and round in circles at a slow trot of about five miles an hour my uncle burnt with indignation gentlemen as a commercial man he felt that the mail bags were not to be trifled with and he resolved to memorialise the post office on the subject the very instant he reached london at present however his thoughts were occupied with the young lady who sat in the farthest corner of the coach with her face muffled closely in her hood the gentleman with the sky blue coat sitting opposite to her the other man in the plum coloured suit by her side and both watching her intently if she so much as rustled the folds of her hood he could hear the ill looking man clap his hand upon his sword and could tell by the other's breathing it was so dark he couldn't see his face that he was looking as big as if he were going to devour her at a mouthful this roused my uncle more and more and he resolved come what come might to see the end of it he had great admiration for bright eyes and sweet faces and pretty legs and feet in short he was fond of the whole sex it runs in our family gentlemen so am i many were the devices which my uncle practised to attract the lady's attention or at all events to engage the mysterious gentlemen in conversation they were all in vain the gentlemen wouldn't talk and the lady didn't dare he thrust his head out of the coach window at intervals and bawled out to know why they didn't go faster but he called till he was hoarse nobody paid the least attention to him he leant back in the coach and thought of the beautiful face and the feet and legs this answered better it wiled away the time and kept him from wondering where he was going and how it was that he found himself in such an odd situation not that this would have worried him much any way he was a mighty free and easy roving devil may care sort of person was my uncle gentlemen all of a sudden the coach stopped 'hallo' said my uncle 'what's in the wind now' 'alight here' said the guard letting down the steps 'here' cried my uncle 'here' rejoined the guard 'i'll do nothing of the sort' said my uncle 'very well then stop where you are' said the guard 'i will' said my uncle 'do' said the guard the other passengers had regarded this colloquy with great attention and finding that my uncle was determined not to alight the younger man squeezed past him to hand the lady out at this moment the ill looking man was inspecting the hole in the crown of his three cornered hat as the young lady brushed past she dropped one of her gloves into my uncle's hand and softly whispered with her lips so close to his face that he felt her warm breath on his nose the single word 'help' gentlemen my uncle leaped out of the coach at once with such violence that it rocked on the springs again 'oh you've thought better of it have you' said the guard when he saw my uncle standing on the ground my uncle looked at the guard for a few seconds in some doubt whether it wouldn't be better to wrench his blunderbuss from him fire it in the face of the man with the big sword knock the rest of the company over the head with the stock snatch up the young lady and go off in the smoke on second thoughts however he abandoned this plan as being a shade too melodramatic in the execution and followed the two mysterious men who keeping the lady between them were now entering an old house in front of which the coach had stopped they turned into the passage and my uncle followed of all the ruinous and desolate places my uncle had ever beheld this was the most so it looked as if it had once been a large house of entertainment but the roof had fallen in in many places and the stairs were steep rugged and broken there was a huge fireplace in the room into which they walked and the chimney was blackened with smoke but no warm blaze lighted it up now the white feathery dust of burnt wood was still strewed over the hearth but the stove was cold and all was dark and gloomy 'well' said my uncle as he looked about him 'a mail travelling at the rate of six miles and a half an hour and stopping for an indefinite period at such a hole as this is rather an irregular sort of proceeding i fancy this shall be made known i'll write to the papers' my uncle said this in a pretty loud voice and in an open unreserved sort of manner with the view of engaging the two strangers in conversation if he could but neither of them took any more notice of him than whispering to each other and scowling at him as they did so the lady was at the farther end of the room and once she ventured to wave her hand as if beseeching my uncle's assistance at length the two strangers advanced a little and the conversation began in earnest 'you don't know this is a private room i suppose fellow said the gentleman in sky blue 'no i do not fellow' rejoined my uncle 'only if this is a private room specially ordered for the occasion i should think the public room must be a very comfortable one' with this my uncle sat himself down in a high backed chair and took such an accurate measure of the gentleman with his eyes that tiggin and welps could have supplied him with printed calico for a suit and not an inch too much or too little from that estimate alone 'quit this room' said both the men together grasping their swords 'eh' said my uncle not at all appearing to comprehend their meaning 'quit the room or you are a dead man' said the ill looking fellow with the large sword drawing it at the same time and flourishing it in the air 'down with him' cried the gentleman in sky blue drawing his sword also and falling back two or three yards 'down with him' the lady gave a loud scream now my uncle was always remarkable for great boldness and great presence of mind all the time that he had appeared so indifferent to what was going on he had been looking slyly about for some missile or weapon of defence and at the very instant when the swords were drawn he espied standing in the chimney corner an old basket hilted rapier in a rusty scabbard at one bound my uncle caught it in his hand drew it flourished it gallantly above his head called aloud to the lady to keep out of the way hurled the chair at the man in sky blue and the scabbard at the man in plum colour and taking advantage of the confusion fell upon them both pell mell gentlemen there is an old story none the worse for being true regarding a fine young irish gentleman who being asked if he could play the fiddle replied he had no doubt he could but he couldn't exactly say for certain because he had never tried this is not inapplicable to my uncle and his fencing he had never had a sword in his hand before except once when he played richard the third at a private theatre upon which occasion it was arranged with richmond that he was to be run through from behind without showing fight at all but here he was cutting and slashing with two experienced swordsmen thrusting and guarding and poking and slicing and acquitting himself in the most manful and dexterous manner possible although up to that time he had never been aware that he had the least notion of the science it only shows how true the old saying is that a man never knows what he can do till he tries gentlemen the noise of the combat was terrific each of the three combatants swearing like troopers and their swords clashing with as much noise as if all the knives and steels in newport market were rattling together at the same time when it was at its very height the lady to encourage my uncle most probably withdrew her hood entirely from her face and disclosed a countenance of such dazzling beauty that he would have fought against fifty men to win one smile from it and die he had done wonders before but now he began to powder away like a raving mad giant at this very moment the gentleman in sky blue turning round and seeing the young lady with her face uncovered vented an exclamation of rage and jealousy and turning his weapon against her beautiful bosom pointed a thrust at her heart which caused my uncle to utter a cry of apprehension that made the building ring the lady stepped lightly aside and snatching the young man's sword from his hand before he had recovered his balance drove him to the wall and running it through him and the panelling up to the very hilt pinned him there hard and fast it was a splendid example my uncle with a loud shout of triumph and a strength that was irresistible made his adversary retreat in the same direction and plunging the old rapier into the very centre of a large red flower in the pattern of his waistcoat nailed him beside his friend there they both stood gentlemen jerking their arms and legs about in agony like the toy shop figures that are moved by a piece of packthread my uncle always said afterwards that this was one of the surest means he knew of for disposing of an enemy but it was liable to one objection on the ground of expense inasmuch as it involved the loss of a sword for every man disabled 'the mail the mail' cried the lady running up to my uncle and throwing her beautiful arms round his neck 'we may yet escape' 'may' cried my uncle 'why my dear there's nobody else to kill is there' my uncle was rather disappointed gentlemen for he thought a little quiet bit of love making would be agreeable after the slaughtering if it were only to change the subject 'we have not an instant to lose here' said the young lady 'he pointing to the young gentleman in sky blue is the only son of the powerful marquess of filletoville' 'well then my dear i'm afraid he'll never come to the title' said my uncle looking coolly at the young gentleman as he stood fixed up against the wall in the cockchafer fashion i have described 'you have cut off the entail my love' 'i have been torn from my home and friends by these villains' said the young lady her features glowing with indignation 'that wretch would have married me by violence in another hour' 'confound his impudence' said my uncle bestowing a very contemptuous look on the dying heir of filletoville 'as you may guess from what you have seen' said the young lady 'the party were prepared to murder me if i appealed to any one for assistance if their accomplices find us here we are lost two minutes hence may be too late the mail' with these words overpowered by her feelings and the exertion of sticking the young marquess of filletoville she sunk into my uncle's arms my uncle caught her up and bore her to the house door there stood the mail with four long tailed flowing maned black horses ready harnessed but no coachman no guard no hostler even at the horses' heads gentlemen i hope i do no injustice to my uncle's memory when i express my opinion that although he was a bachelor he had held some ladies in his arms before this time i believe indeed that he had rather a habit of kissing barmaids and i know that in one or two instances he had been seen by credible witnesses to hug a landlady in a very perceptible manner i mention the circumstance to show what a very uncommon sort of person this beautiful young lady must have been to have affected my uncle in the way she did he used to say that as her long dark hair trailed over his arm and her beautiful dark eyes fixed themselves upon his face when she recovered he felt so strange and nervous that his legs trembled beneath him but who can look in a sweet soft pair of dark eyes without feeling queer i can't gentlemen i am afraid to look at some eyes i know and that's the truth of it 'you will never leave me' murmured the young lady 'never' said my uncle and he meant it too 'my dear preserver' exclaimed the young lady 'my dear kind brave preserver' 'don't' said my uncle interrupting her 'why' inquired the young lady 'because your mouth looks so beautiful when you speak' rejoined my uncle 'that i'm afraid i shall be rude enough to kiss it' the young lady put up her hand as if to caution my uncle not to do so and said no she didn't say anything she smiled when you are looking at a pair of the most delicious lips in the world and see them gently break into a roguish smile if you are very near them and nobody else by you cannot better testify your admiration of their beautiful form and colour than by kissing them at once my uncle did so and i honour him for it 'hark' cried the young lady starting 'the noise of wheels and horses' 'so it is' said my uncle listening he had a good ear for wheels and the trampling of hoofs but there appeared to be so many horses and carriages rattling towards them from a distance that it was impossible to form a guess at their number the sound was like that of fifty breaks with six blood cattle in each 'we are pursued' cried the young lady clasping her hands 'we are pursued i have no hope but in you' there was such an expression of terror in her beautiful face that my uncle made up his mind at once he lifted her into the coach told her not to be frightened pressed his lips to hers once more and then advising her to draw up the window to keep the cold air out mounted the box 'stay love' cried the young lady 'what's the matter' said my uncle from the coach box 'i want to speak to you' said the young lady 'only a word only one word dearest' 'must i get down' inquired my uncle the lady made no answer but she smiled again such a smile gentlemen it beat the other one all to nothing my uncle descended from his perch in a twinkling 'what is it my dear' said my uncle looking in at the coach window the lady happened to bend forward at the same time and my uncle thought she looked more beautiful than she had done yet he was very close to her just then gentlemen so he really ought to know 'what is it my dear' said my uncle 'will you never love any one but me never marry any one beside' said the young lady my uncle swore a great oath that he would never marry anybody else and the young lady drew in her head and pulled up the window he jumped upon the box squared his elbows adjusted the ribbons seized the whip which lay on the roof gave one flick to the off leader and away went the four long tailed flowing maned black horses at fifteen good english miles an hour with the old mail coach behind them whew how they tore along the noise behind grew louder the faster the old mail went the faster came the pursuers man horses dogs were leagued in the pursuit the noise was frightful but above all rose the voice of the young lady urging my uncle on and shrieking 'faster faster' they whirled past the dark trees as feathers would be swept before a hurricane houses gates churches haystacks objects of every kind they shot by with a velocity and noise like roaring waters suddenly let loose still the noise of pursuit grew louder and still my uncle could hear the young lady wildly screaming 'faster faster' my uncle plied whip and rein and the horses flew onward till they were white with foam and yet the noise behind increased and yet the young lady cried 'faster faster' my uncle gave a loud stamp on the boot in the energy of the moment and found that it was grey morning and he was sitting in the wheelwright's yard on the box of an old edinburgh mail shivering with the cold and wet and stamping his feet to warm them he got down and looked eagerly inside for the beautiful young lady alas there was neither door nor seat to the coach it was a mere shell illustration my uncle gave a loud stamp on the boot in the energy of the moment of course my uncle knew very well that there was some mystery in the matter and that everything had passed exactly as he used to relate it he remained staunch to the great oath he had sworn to the beautiful young lady refusing several eligible landladies on her account and dying a bachelor at last he always said what a curious thing it was that he should have found out by such a mere accident as his clambering over the palings that the ghosts of mail coaches and horses guards coachmen and passengers were in the habit of making journeys regularly every night he used to add that he believed he was the only living person who had ever been taken as a passenger on one of these excursions and i think he was right gentlemen at least i never heard of any other i wonder what these ghosts of mail coaches carry in their bags said the landlord who had listened to the whole story with profound attention the dead letters of course said the bagman oh ah to be sure rejoined the landlord i never thought of that chapter xxii illustration how mr pickwick sped upon his mission and how he was reinforced in the outset by a most unexpected auxiliary the horses were put to punctually at a quarter before nine next morning and mr pickwick and sam weller having each taken his seat the one inside and the other out the postilion was duly directed to repair in the first instance to mr bob sawyer's house for the purpose of taking up mr benjamin allen it was with feelings of no small astonishment when the carriage drew up before the door with the red lamp and the very legible inscription of sawyer late nockemorf that mr pickwick saw on popping his head out of the coach window the boy in the grey livery very busily engaged in putting up the shutters the which being an unusual and un business like proceeding at that hour in the morning at once suggested to his mind two inferences the one that some good friend and patient of mr bob sawyer's was dead the other that mr bob sawyer himself was bankrupt what is the matter said mr pickwick to the boy nothing's the matter sir replied the boy expanding his mouth to the whole breadth of his countenance all right all right cried bob sawyer suddenly appearing at the door with a small leathern knapsack limp and dirty in one hand and a rough coat and shawl thrown over the other arm i'm going old fellow you exclaimed mr pickwick yes replied bob sawyer and a regular expedition we'll make of it here sam look out thus briefly bespeaking mr weller's attention mr bob sawyer jerked the leathern knapsack into the dickey where it was immediately stowed away under the seat by sam who regarded the proceeding with great admiration this done mr bob sawyer with the assistance of the boy forcibly worked himself into a rough coat which was a few sizes too small for him and then advancing to the coach window thrust in his head and laughed boisterously what a start it is isn't it cried bob wiping the tears out of his eyes with one of the cuffs of the rough coat my dear sir said mr pickwick with some embarrassment i had no idea of your accompanying us no that's just the very thing replied bob seizing mr pickwick by the lappel of the coat that's the joke oh that's the joke said mr pickwick of course replied bob it's the whole point of the thing you know that and leaving the business to take care of itself as it seems to have made up its mind not to take care of me with this explanation of the phenomenon of the shutters mr bob sawyer pointed to the shop and relapsed into an ecstasy of mirth bless me you are surely not mad enough to think of leaving your patients without anybody to attend them remonstrated mr pickwick in a very serious tone why not asked bob in reply i shall save by it you know none of them ever pay besides said bob lowering his voice to a confidential whisper they will be all the better for it for being nearly out of drugs and not able to increase my account just now i should have been obliged to give them calomel all round and it would have been certain to have disagreed with some of them so it's all for the best there was a philosophy and a strength of reasoning about this reply which mr pickwick was not prepared for he paused a few moments and added less firmly than before but this chaise my young friend will only hold two and i am pledged to mr allen don't think of me for a minute replied bob i've arranged it all sam and i will share the dickey between us look here this little bill is to be wafered on the shop door 'sawyer late nockemorf inquire of mrs cripps over the way' mrs cripps is my boy's mother 'mr sawyer's very sorry' says mrs cripps 'couldn't help it fetched away early this morning to a consultation of the very first surgeons in the country couldn't do without him would have him at any price tremendous operation' the fact is said bob in conclusion it'll do me more good than otherwise i expect if it gets into one of the local papers it will be the making of me here's ben now then jump in with these hurried words mr bob sawyer pushed the postboy on one side jerked his friend into the vehicle slammed the door put up the steps wafered the bill on the street door locked it put the key in his pocket jumped into the dickey gave the word for starting and did the whole with such extraordinary precipitation that before mr pickwick had well begun to consider whether mr bob sawyer ought to go or not they were rolling away with mr bob sawyer thoroughly established as part and parcel of the equipage so long as their progress was confined to the streets of bristol the facetious bob kept his professional green spectacles on and conducted himself with becoming steadiness and gravity of demeanour merely giving utterance to divers verbal witticisms for the exclusive behoof and entertainment of mr samuel weller but when they emerged on the open road he threw off his green spectacles and his gravity together and performed a great variety of practical jokes which were calculated to attract the attention of the passers by and to render the carriage and those it contained objects of more than ordinary curiosity the least conspicuous among these feats being a most vociferous imitation of a key bugle and the ostentatious display of a crimson silk pocket handkerchief attached to a walking stick which was occasionally waved in the air with various gestures indicative of supremacy and defiance i wonder said mr pickwick stopping in the midst of a most sedate conversation with ben allen bearing reference to the numerous good qualities of mr winkle and his sister i wonder what all the people we pass can see in us to make them stare so it's a neat turn out replied ben allen with something of pride in his tone they're not used to see this sort of thing every day i daresay possibly replied mr pickwick it may be so perhaps it is mr pickwick might very probably have reasoned himself into the belief that it really was had he not just then happening to look out of the coach window observed that the looks of the passengers betokened anything but respectful astonishment and that various telegraphic communications appeared to be passing between them and some persons outside the vehicle whereupon it occurred to him that these demonstrations might be in some remote degree referable to the humorous deportment of mr robert sawyer i hope said mr pickwick that our volatile friend is committing no absurdities in that dickey behind oh dear no replied ben allen except when he's elevated bob's the quietest creature breathing here a prolonged imitation of a key bugle broke upon the ear succeeded by cheers and screams all of which evidently proceeded from the throat and lungs of the quietest creature breathing or in plainer designation of mr bob sawyer himself mr pickwick and mr ben allen looked expressively at each other and the former gentleman taking off his hat and leaning out of the coach window until nearly the whole of his waistcoat was outside it was at length enabled to catch a glimpse of his facetious friend mr bob sawyer was seated not in the dickey but on the roof of the chaise with his legs as far asunder as they would conveniently go wearing mr samuel weller's hat on one side of his head and bearing in one hand a most enormous sandwich while in the other he supported a goodly sized case bottle to both of which he applied himself with intense relish varying the monotony of the occupation by an occasional howl or the interchange of some lively badinage with any passing stranger the crimson flag was carefully tied in an erect position to the rail of the dickey and mr samuel weller decorated with bob sawyer's hat was seated in the centre thereof discussing a twin sandwich with an animated countenance the expression of which betokened his entire and perfect approval of the whole arrangement this was enough to irritate a gentleman of mr pickwick's sense of propriety but it was not the whole extent of the aggravation for a stage coach full inside and out was meeting them at the moment and the astonishment of the passengers was very palpably evinced the congratulations of an irish family too who were keeping up with the chaise and begging all the time were of a rather boisterous description especially those of its male head who appeared to consider the display as part and parcel of some political or other procession of triumph mr sawyer cried mr pickwick in a state of great excitement mr sawyer sir hallo responded that gentleman looking over the side of the chaise with all the coolness in life are you mad sir demanded mr pickwick not a bit of it replied bob only cheerful cheerful sir ejaculated mr pickwick take down that scandalous red handkerchief i beg i insist sir sam take it down before sam could interpose mr bob sawyer gracefully struck his colours and having put them in his pocket nodded in a courteous manner to mr pickwick wiped the mouth of the case bottle and applied it to his own thereby informing him without any unnecessary waste of words that he devoted that draught to wishing him all manner of happiness and prosperity having done this bob replaced the cork with great care and looking benignantly down on mr pickwick took a large bite out of the sandwich and smiled come said mr pickwick whose momentary anger was not quite proof against bob's immovable self possession pray let us have no more of this absurdity no no replied bob once more exchanging hats with mr weller i didn't mean to do it only i got so enlivened with the ride that i couldn't help it think of the look of the thing expostulated mr pickwick have some regard to appearances oh certainly said bob it's not the sort of thing at all all over governor satisfied with this assurance mr pickwick once more drew his head into the chaise and pulled up the glass but he had scarcely resumed the conversation which mr bob sawyer had interrupted when he was somewhat startled by the apparition of a small dark body of an oblong form on the outside of the window which gave sundry taps against it as if impatient of admission what's this exclaimed mr pickwick it looks like a case bottle remarked ben allen eyeing the object in question through his spectacles with some interest i rather think it belongs to bob the impression was perfectly accurate for mr bob sawyer having attached the case bottle to the end of the walking stick was battering the window with it in token of his wish that his friends inside would partake of its contents in all good fellowship and harmony what's to be done said mr pickwick looking at the bottle this proceeding is more absurd than the other i think it would be best to take it in replied mr ben allen it would serve him right to take it and keep it wouldn't it it would said mr pickwick shall i i think it the most proper course we could possibly adopt replied ben this advice quite coinciding with his own opinion mr pickwick gently let down the window and disengaged the bottle from the stick upon which the latter was drawn up and mr bob sawyer was heard to laugh heartily what a merry dog it is said mr pickwick looking round at his companion with the bottle in his hand he is said mr allen you cannot possibly be angry with him remarked mr pickwick quite out of the question observed benjamin allen during this short interchange of sentiments mr pickwick had in an abstracted mood uncorked the bottle what is it inquired ben allen carelessly i don't know replied mr pickwick with equal carelessness it smells i think like milk punch oh indeed said ben i think so rejoined mr pickwick very properly guarding himself against the possibility of stating an untruth mind i could not undertake to say certainly without tasting it you had better do so said ben we may as well know what it is do you think so replied mr pickwick well if you are curious to know of course i have no objection ever willing to sacrifice his own feelings to the wishes of his friend mr pickwick at once took a pretty long taste what is it inquired ben allen interrupting him with some impatience curious said mr pickwick smacking his lips i hardly know now oh yes said mr pickwick after a second taste it is punch mr ben allen looked at mr pickwick mr pickwick looked at mr ben allen mr ben allen smiled mr pickwick did not it would serve him right said the last named gentleman with some severity it would serve him right to drink it every drop the very thing that occurred to me said ben allen is it indeed rejoined mr pickwick then here's his health with these words that excellent person took a most energetic pull at the bottle and handed it to ben allen who was not slow to imitate his example the smiles became mutual and the milk punch was gradually and cheerfully disposed of after all said mr pickwick as he drained the last drop his pranks are really very amusing very entertaining indeed you may say that rejoined mr ben allen in proof of bob sawyer's being one of the funniest fellows alive he proceeded to entertain mr pickwick with a long and circumstantial account how that gentleman once drank himself into a fever and got his head shaved the relation of which pleasant and agreeable history was only stopped by the stoppage of the chaise at the bell at berkeley heath to change horses i say we're going to dine here aren't we said bob looking in at the window dine said mr pickwick why we have only come nineteen miles and have eighty seven and a half to go just the reason why we should take something to enable us to bear up against the fatigue remonstrated mr bob sawyer oh it's quite impossible to dine at half past eleven o'clock in the day replied mr pickwick looking at his watch so it is rejoined bob lunch is the very thing hallo you sir lunch for three directly and keep the horses back for a quarter of an hour tell them to put everything they have cold on the table and some bottled ale and let us taste your very best madeira issuing these orders with monstrous importance and bustle mr bob sawyer at once hurried into the house to superintend the arrangements in less than five minutes he returned and declared them to be excellent the quality of the lunch fully justified the eulogium which bob had pronounced and very great justice was done to it not only by that gentleman but mr ben allen and mr pickwick also under the auspices of the three the bottled ale and the madeira were promptly disposed of and when the horses being once more put to they resumed their seats with the case bottle full of the best substitute for milk punch that could be procured on so short a notice the key bugle sounded and the red flag waved without the slightest opposition on mr pickwick's part at the hop pole at tewkesbury they stopped to dine upon which occasion there was more bottled ale with some more madeira and some port besides and here the case bottle was replenished for the third time under the influence of these combined stimulants mr pickwick and mr ben allen fell fast asleep for thirty miles while bob and mr weller sang duets in the dickey it was quite dark when mr pickwick roused himself sufficiently to look out of the window the straggling cottages by the roadside the dingy hue of every object visible the murky atmosphere the paths of cinders and brick dust the deep red glow of furnace fires in the distance the volumes of dense smoke issuing heavily forth from the high toppling chimneys blackening and obscuring everything around the glare of distant lights the ponderous waggons which toiled along the road laden with clashing rods of iron or piled with heavy goods all betokened their rapid approach to the great working town of birmingham as they rattled through the narrow thoroughfares leading to the heart of the turmoil the sights and sounds of earnest occupation struck more forcibly on the senses the streets were thronged with working people the hum of labour resounded from every house lights gleamed from the long casement windows in the attic stories and the whirl of wheels and noise of machinery shook the trembling walls the fires whose lurid sullen light had been visible for miles blazed fiercely up in the great works and factories of the town the din of hammers the rushing of steam and the dead heavy clanking of engines was the harsh music which arose from every quarter the postboy was driving briskly through the open streets and past the handsome and well lighted shops which intervene between the outskirts of the town and the old royal hotel before mr pickwick had begun to consider the very difficult and delicate nature of the commission which had carried him thither the delicate nature of this commission and the difficulty of executing it in a satisfactory manner were by no means lessened by the voluntary companionship of mr bob sawyer truth to tell mr pickwick felt that his presence on the occasion however considerate and gratifying was by no means an honour he would willingly have sought in fact he would cheerfully have given a reasonable sum of money to have had mr bob sawyer removed to any place at not less than fifty miles distance without delay mr pickwick had never held any personal communication with mr winkle senior although he had once or twice corresponded with him by letter and returned satisfactory answers to his inquiries concerning the moral character and behaviour of his son he felt nervously sensible that to wait upon him for the first time attended by bob sawyer and ben allen both slightly fuddled was not the most ingenious and likely means that could have been hit upon to prepossess him in his favour however said mr pickwick endeavouring to reassure himself i must do the best i can i must see him to night for i faithfully promised to do so if they persist in accompanying me i must make the interview as brief as possible and be content to hope that for their own sakes they will not expose themselves as he comforted himself with these reflections the chaise stopped at the door of the old royal ben allen having been partially awakened from a stupendous sleep and dragged out by the collar by mr samuel weller mr pickwick was enabled to alight they were shown to a comfortable apartment and mr pickwick at once propounded a question to the waiter concerning the whereabout of mr winkle's residence close by sir said the waiter not above five hundred yards sir mr winkle is a wharfinger sir at the canal sir private residence is not oh dear no sir not five hundred yards sir here the waiter blew a candle out and made a feint of lighting it again in order to afford mr pickwick an opportunity of asking any further questions if he felt so disposed take anything now sir said the waiter lighting the candle in desperation at mr pickwick's silence tea or coffee sir dinner sir nothing now very good sir like to order supper sir not just now very good sir here he walked softly to the door and then stopping short turned round and said with great suavity shall i send the chambermaid gentlemen you may if you please replied mr pickwick if you please sir and bring some soda water said bob sawyer soda water sir yes sir with his mind apparently relieved from an overwhelming weight by having at last got an order for something the waiter imperceptibly melted away waiters never walk or run they have a peculiar and mysterious power of skimming out of rooms which other mortals possess not some slight symptoms of vitality having been awakened in mr ben allen by the soda water he suffered himself to be prevailed upon to wash his face and hands and to submit to be brushed by sam mr pickwick and bob sawyer having also repaired the disorder which the journey had made in their apparel the three started forth arm in arm to mr winkle's bob sawyer impregnating the atmosphere with tobacco smoke as he walked along about a quarter of a mile off in a quiet substantial looking street stood an old red brick house with three steps before the door and a brass plate upon it bearing in fat roman capitals the words mr winkle the steps were very white and the bricks were very red and the house was very clean and here stood mr pickwick mr benjamin allen and mr bob sawyer as the clock struck ten a smart servant girl answered the door and started on beholding the three strangers is mr winkle at home my dear inquired mr pickwick he is just going to supper sir replied the girl give him that card if you please rejoined mr pickwick say i am sorry to trouble him at so late an hour but i am anxious to see him to night and have only just arrived the girl looked timidly at mr bob sawyer who was expressing his admiration of her personal charms by a variety of wonderful grimaces and casting an eye at the hats and great coats which hung in the passage called another girl to mind the door while she went upstairs the sentinel was speedily relieved for the girl returned immediately and begging pardon of the gentlemen for leaving them in the street ushered them into a floor clothed back parlour half office and half dressing room in which the principal useful and ornamental articles of furniture were a desk a wash hand stand and shaving glass a boot rack and boot jack a high stool four chairs a table and an old eight day clock over the mantelpiece were the sunken doors of an iron safe while a couple of hanging shelves for books an almanack and several files of dusty papers decorated the walls very sorry to leave you standing at the door sir said the girl lighting a lamp and addressing mr pickwick with a winning smile but you was quite strangers to me and we have such a many trampers that only come to see what they can lay their hands on that really there is not the least occasion for any apology my dear said mr pickwick good humouredly not the slightest my love said bob sawyer playfully stretching forth his arms and skipping from side to side as if to prevent the young lady's leaving the room the young lady was not at all softened by these allurements for she at once expressed her opinion that mr bob sawyer was an odous creetur and on his becoming rather more pressing in his attentions imprinted her fair fingers upon his face and bounced out of the room with many expressions of aversion and contempt deprived of the young lady's society mr bob sawyer proceeded to divert himself by peeping into the desk looking into all the table drawers feigning to pick the lock of the iron safe turning the almanack with its face to the wall trying on the boots of mr winkle senior over his own and making several other humorous experiments upon the furniture all of which afforded mr pickwick unspeakable horror and agony and yielded mr bob sawyer proportionate delight at length the door opened and a little old gentleman in a snuff coloured suit with a head and face the precise counterpart of those belonging to mr winkle junior excepting that he was rather bald trotted into the room with mr pickwick's card in one hand and a silver candlestick in the other mr pickwick sir how do you do said winkle the elder putting down the candlestick and proffering his hand hope i see you well sir glad to see you be seated mr pickwick i beg sir this gentleman is my friend mr sawyer interposed mr pickwick your son's friend oh said mr winkle the elder looking rather grimly at bob i hope you are well sir right as a trivet sir replied bob sawyer illustration mr winkle senior this other gentleman cried mr pickwick is as you will see when you have read the letter with which i am entrusted a very near relative or i should rather say a very particular friend of your son's his name is allen that gentleman inquired mr winkle pointing with the card towards ben allen who had fallen asleep in an attitude which left nothing of him visible but his spine and his coat collar mr pickwick was on the point of replying to the question and reciting mr benjamin allen's name and honourable distinctions at full length when the sprightly mr bob sawyer with a view of rousing his friend to a sense of his situation inflicted a startling pinch upon the fleshy part of his arm which caused him to jump up with a shriek suddenly aware that he was in the presence of a stranger mr ben allen advanced and shaking mr winkle most affectionately by both hands for about five minutes murmured in some half intelligible fragments of sentences the great delight he felt in seeing him and a hospitable inquiry whether he felt disposed to take anything after his walk or would prefer waiting till dinner time which done he sat down and gazed about him with a petrified stare as if he had not the remotest idea where he was which indeed he had not all this was most embarrassing to mr pickwick the more especially as mr winkle senior evinced palpable astonishment at the eccentric not to say extraordinary behaviour of his two companions to bring the matter to an issue at once he drew a letter from his pocket and presenting it to mr winkle senior said this letter sir is from your son you will see by its contents that on your favourable and fatherly consideration of it depend his future happiness and welfare will you oblige me by giving it the calmest and coolest perusal and by discussing the subject afterwards with me in the tone and spirit in which alone it ought to be discussed you may judge of the importance of your decision to your son and his intense anxiety upon the subject by my waiting upon you without any previous warning at so late an hour and added mr pickwick glancing slightly at his two companions and under such unfavourable circumstances with this prelude mr pickwick placed four closely written sides of extra superfine wire woven penitence in the hands of the astounded mr winkle senior then reseating himself in his chair he watched his looks and manner anxiously it is true but with the open front of a gentleman who feels he has taken no part which he need excuse or palliate the old wharfinger turned the letter over looked at the front back and sides made a microscopic examination of the fat little boy on the seal raised his eyes to mr pickwick's face and then seating himself on the high stool and drawing the lamp closer to him broke the wax unfolded the epistle and lifting it to the light he prepared to read just at this moment mr bob sawyer whose wit had lain dormant for some minutes placed his hands upon his knees and made a face after the portrait of the late mr grimaldi as clown it so happened that mr winkle senior instead of being deeply engaged in reading the letter as mr bob sawyer thought chanced to be looking over the top of it at no less a person than mr bob sawyer himself rightly conjecturing that the face aforesaid was made in ridicule and derision of his own person he fixed his eyes on bob with such expressive sternness that the late mr grimaldi's lineaments gradually resolved themselves into a very fine expression of humility and confusion did you speak sir inquired mr winkle senior after an awful silence no sir replied bob with no remains of the clown about him save and except the extreme redness of his cheeks you are sure you did not sir said mr winkle senior oh dear yes sir quite replied bob i thought you did sir rejoined the old gentleman with indignant emphasis perhaps you looked at me sir oh no sir not at all replied bob with extreme civility i am very glad to hear it sir said mr winkle senior having frowned upon the abashed bob with great magnificence the old gentleman again brought the letter to the light and began to read it seriously mr pickwick eyed him intently as he turned from the bottom line of the first page to the top line of the second and from the bottom of the second to the top of the third and from the bottom of the third to the top of the fourth but not the slightest alteration of countenance afforded a clue to the feelings with which he received the announcement of his son's marriage which mr pickwick knew was in the very first half dozen lines he read the letter to the last word folded it again with all the carefulness and precision of a man of business and just when mr pickwick expected some great outbreak of feeling dipped a pen in the inkstand and said as quietly as if he were speaking on the most ordinary counting house topic what is nathaniel's address mr pickwick the george and vulture at present replied that gentleman george and vulture where is that george yard lombard street in the city yes the old gentleman methodically indorsed the address on the back of the letter and then placing it in the desk which he locked said as he got off the stool and placed the bunch of keys in his pocket i suppose there is nothing else which need detain us mr pickwick nothing else my dear sir observed that warm hearted person in indignant amazement nothing else have you no opinion to express on this momentous event in our young friend's life no assurance to convey to him through me of the continuance of your affection and protection nothing to say which will cheer and sustain him and the anxious girl who looks to him for comfort and support my dear sir consider i will consider replied the old gentleman i have nothing to say just now i am a man of business mr pickwick i never commit myself hastily in any affair and from what i see of this i by no means like the appearance of it a thousand pounds is not much mr pickwick you're very right sir interposed ben allen just awake enough to know that he had spent his thousand pounds without the smallest difficulty you're an intelligent man bob he's a very knowing fellow this i am very happy to find that you do me the justice to make the admission sir said mr winkle senior looking contemptuously at ben allen who was shaking his head profoundly the fact is mr pickwick that when i gave my son a roving license for a year or so to see something of men and manners which he has done under your auspices so that he might not enter into life a mere boarding school milk sop to be gulled by everybody i never bargained for this he knows that very well so if i withdraw my countenance from him on this account he has no call to be surprised he shall hear from me mr pickwick good night sir margaret open the door all this time bob sawyer had been nudging mr ben allen to say something on the right side ben accordingly now burst without the slightest preliminary notice into a brief but impassioned piece of eloquence sir said mr ben allen staring at the old gentleman out of a pair of very dim and languid eyes and working his right arm vehemently up and down you you ought to be ashamed of yourself as the lady's brother of course you are an excellent judge of the question retorted mr winkle senior there that's enough pray say no more mr pickwick good night gentlemen with these words the old gentleman took up the candlestick and opening the room door politely motioned towards the passage you will regret this sir said mr pickwick setting his teeth close together to keep down his choler for he felt how important the effect might prove to his young friend i am at present of a different opinion calmly replied mr winkle senior once again gentlemen i wish you a good night mr pickwick walked with angry strides into the street mr bob sawyer completely quelled by the decision of the old gentleman's manner took the same course mr ben allen's hat rolled down the steps immediately afterwards and mr ben allen's body followed it directly the whole party went silent and supperless to bed and mr pickwick thought just before he fell asleep that if he had known mr winkle senior had been quite so much of a man of business it was extremely probable he might never have waited upon him on such an errand chapter xxiii illustration in which mr pickwick encounters an old acquaintance to which fortunate circumstance the reader is mainly indebted for matter of thrilling interest herein set down concerning two great public men of might and power the morning which broke upon mr pickwick's sight at eight o'clock was not at all calculated to elevate his spirits or to lessen the depression which the unlooked for result of his embassy inspired the sky was dark and gloomy the air was damp and raw the streets were wet and sloppy the smoke hung sluggishly above the chimney tops as if it lacked the courage to rise and the rain came slowly and doggedly down as if it had not even the spirit to pour a game cock in the stable yard deprived of every spark of his accustomed animation balanced himself dismally on one leg in a corner a donkey moping with drooping head under the narrow roof of an outhouse appeared from his meditative and miserable countenance to be contemplating suicide in the street umbrellas were the only things to be seen and the clicking of pattens and splashing of rain drops were the only sounds to be heard the breakfast was interrupted by very little conversation even mr bob sawyer felt the influence of the weather and the previous day's excitement in his own expressive language he was floored so was mr ben allen so was mr pickwick in protracted expectation of the weather clearing up the last evening paper from london was read and re read with an intensity of interest only known in cases of extreme destitution every inch of the carpet was walked over with similar perseverance the windows were looked out of often enough to justify the imposition of an additional duty upon them all kinds of topics of conversation were started and failed and at length mr pickwick when noon had arrived without a change for the better rang the bell resolutely and ordered out the chaise although the roads were miry and the drizzling rain came down harder than it had done yet and although the mud and wet splashed in at the open windows of the carriage to such an extent that the discomfort was almost as great to the pair of insides as to the pair of outsides still there was something in the motion and the sense of being up and doing which was so infinitely superior to being pent in a dull room looking at the dull rain dripping into a dull street that they all agreed on starting that the change was a great improvement and wondered how they could possibly have delayed making it as long as they had done when they stopped to change at coventry the steam ascended from the horses in such clouds as wholly to obscure the hostler whose voice was however heard to declare from the mist that he expected the first gold medal from the humane society on their next distribution of rewards for taking the postboy's hat off the water descending from the brim of which the invisible gentleman declared must inevitably have drowned him the postboy but for his great presence of mind in tearing it promptly from his head and drying the gasping man's countenance with a wisp of straw this is pleasant said bob sawyer turning up his coat collar and pulling the shawl over his mouth to concentrate the fumes of a glass of brandy just swallowed wery replied sam composedly you don't seem to mind it observed bob vy i don't exactly see no good my mindin' on it 'ud do sir replied sam that's an unanswerable reason anyhow said bob yes sir rejoined mr weller wotever is is right as the young nobleman sveetly remarked ven they put him down in the pension list 'cos his mother's uncle's vife's grandfather vunce lit the king's pipe vith a portable tinder box not a bad notion that sam said mr bob sawyer approvingly just wot the young nobleman said ev'ry quarter day arterward for the rest of his life replied mr weller wos you ever called in inquired sam glancing at the driver after a short silence and lowering his voice to a mysterious whisper wos you ever called in ven you wos 'prentice to a sawbones to wisit a postboy i don't remember that i ever was replied bob sawyer you never see a postboy in that 'ere hospital as you walked as they says o' the ghosts did you demanded sam no replied bob sawyer i don't think i ever did never know'd a churchyard vere there wos a postboy's tombstone or see a dead postboy did you inquired sam pursuing his catechism no rejoined bob i never did no rejoined sam triumphantly nor never vill and there's another thing that no man never see and that's a dead donkey no man never see a dead donkey 'cept the gen'l'm'n in the black silk smalls as know'd a young 'ooman as kep' a goat and that wos a french donkey so wery likely he warn't vun o' the reg'lar breed well what has that got to do with the postboys asked bob sawyer this here replied sam without goin' so far as to as sert as some wery sensible people do that postboys and donkeys is both immortal wot i say is this that venever they feels theirselves gettin' stiff and past their work they just rides off together vun postboy to a pair in the usual way wot becomes on 'em nobody knows but it's wery probable as they starts avay to take their pleasure in some other world for there ain't a man alive as ever see either a donkey or a postboy a takin' his pleasure in this expatiating upon this learned and remarkable theory and citing many curious statistical and other facts in its support sam weller beguiled the time until they reached dunchurch where a dry postboy and fresh horses were procured the next stage was daventry and the next towcester and at the end of each stage it rained harder than it had done at the beginning i say remonstrated bob sawyer looking in at the coach window as they rolled up before the door of the saracen's head towcester this won't do you know bless me said mr pickwick just awakening from a nap i'm afraid you're wet oh you are are you returned bob yes i am a little that way uncomfortably damp perhaps bob did look dampish inasmuch as the rain was streaming from his neck elbows cuffs skirts and knees and his whole apparel shone so with the wet that it might have been mistaken for a full suit of prepared oilskin i am rather wet said bob giving himself a shake and casting a little hydraulic shower around like a newfoundland dog just emerged from the water i think it's quite impossible to go on to night interposed ben out of the question sir remarked sam weller coming to assist in the conference it's cruelty to animals sir to ask 'em to do it there's beds here sir said sam addressing his master everything clean and comfortable wery good little dinner sir they can get ready in half an hour pair of fowls sir and a weal cutlet french beans 'taturs tart and tidiness you'd better stop vere you are sir if i might recommend take advice sir as the doctor said the host of the saracen's head opportunely appeared at this moment to confirm mr weller's statement relative to the accommodations of the establishment and to back his entreaties with a variety of dismal conjectures regarding the state of the roads the doubt of fresh horses being to be had at the next stage the dead certainty of its raining all night the equally mortal certainty of its clearing up in the morning and other topics of inducement familiar to innkeepers well said mr pickwick but i must send a letter to london by some conveyance so that it may be delivered the very first thing in the morning or i must go forward at all hazards the landlord smiled his delight nothing could be easier than for the gentleman to inclose a letter in a sheet of brown paper and send it on either by the mail or the night coach from birmingham if the gentleman were particularly anxious to have it left as soon as possible he might write outside to be delivered immediately which was sure to be attended to or pay the bearer half a crown extra for instant delivery which was surer still very well said mr pickwick then we will stop here lights in the sun john make up the fire the gentlemen are wet cried the landlord this way gentlemen don't trouble yourselves about the postboy now sir i'll send him to you when you ring for him sir now john the candles the candles were brought the fire was stirred up and a fresh log of wood thrown on in ten minutes' time a waiter was laying the cloth for dinner the curtains were drawn the fire was blazing brightly and everything looked as everything always does in all decent english inns as if the travellers had been expected and their comforts prepared for days beforehand mr pickwick sat down at a side table and hastily indited a note to mr winkle merely informing him that he was detained by stress of weather but would certainly be in london next day until when he deferred any account of his proceedings this note was hastily made into a parcel and dispatched to the bar per mr samuel weller sam left it with the landlady and was returning to pull his master's boots off after drying himself by the kitchen fire when glancing casually through a half opened door he was arrested by the sight of a gentleman with a sandy head who had a large bundle of newspapers lying on the table before him and was perusing the leading article of one with a settled sneer which curled up his nose and all his other features into a majestic expression of haughty contempt hallo said sam i ought to know that 'ere head and them features the eye glass too and the broad brimmed tile eatansvill to vit or i'm a roman sam was taken with a troublesome cough at once for the purpose of attracting the gentleman's attention the gentleman starting at the sound raised his head and his eye glass and disclosed to view the profound and thoughtful features of mr pott of the eatanswill gazette beggin' your pardon sir said sam advancing with a bow my master's here mr pott hush hush cried pott drawing sam into the room and closing the door with a countenance of mysterious dread and apprehension wot's the matter sir inquired sam looking vacantly about him not a whisper of my name replied pott this is a buff neighbourhood if the excited and irritable populace knew i was here i should be torn to pieces no vould you sir inquired sam i should be the victim of their fury replied pott now young man what of your master he's a stopping here to night on his vay to town vith a couple of friends replied sam is mr winkle one of them inquired pott with a slight frown no sir mr vinkle stops at home now rejoined sam he's married married exclaimed pott with frightful vehemence he stopped smiled darkly and added in a low vindictive tone it serves him right having given vent to this cruel ebullition of deadly malice and cold blooded triumph over a fallen enemy mr pott inquired whether mr pickwick's friends were blue receiving a most satisfactory answer in the affirmative from sam who knew as much about the matter as pott himself he consented to accompany him to mr pickwick's room where a hearty welcome awaited him an agreement to club dinners together was at once made and ratified and how are matters going on in eatanswill inquired mr pickwick when pott had taken a seat near the fire and the whole party had got their wet boots off and dry slippers on is the independent still in being the independent sir replied pott is still dragging on a wretched and lingering career abhorred and despised by even the few who are cognizant of its miserable and disgraceful existence stifled by the very filth it so profusely scatters rendered deaf and blind by the exhalations of its own slime the obscene journal happily unconscious of its degraded state is rapidly sinking beneath that treacherous mud which while it seems to give it a firm standing with the low and debased classes of society is nevertheless rising above its detested head and will speedily engulf it for ever having delivered this manifesto which formed portion of his last week's leader with a vehement articulation the editor paused to take breath and looked majestically at bob sawyer you are a young man sir said pott mr bob sawyer nodded so are you sir said pott addressing mr ben allen ben admitted the soft impeachment and are both deeply imbued with those blue principles which as long as i live i have pledged myself to the people of these kingdoms to support and to maintain suggested pott why i don't exactly know about that replied bob sawyer i am not buff mr pickwick interrupted pott drawing back his chair your friend is not buff sir no no rejoined bob i'm a kind of plaid at present a compound of all sorts of colours a waverer said pott solemnly a waverer i should like to show you a series of eight articles sir that have appeared in the eatanswill gazette i think i may venture to say that you would not be long in establishing your opinions on a firm and solid blue basis sir i dare say i should turn very blue long before i got to the end of them responded bob mr pott looked dubiously at bob sawyer for some seconds and turning to mr pickwick said you have seen the literary articles which have appeared at intervals in the eatanswill gazette in the course of the last three months and which have excited such general i may say such universal attention and admiration why replied mr pickwick slightly embarrassed by the question the fact is i have been so much engaged in other ways that i really have not had an opportunity of perusing them you should do so sir said pott with a severe countenance i will said mr pickwick they appeared in the form of a copious review of a work on chinese metaphysics sir said pott oh observed mr pickwick from your pen i hope from the pen of my critic sir rejoined pott with dignity an abstruse subject i should conceive said mr pickwick very sir responded pott looking intensely sage he crammed for it to use a technical but expressive term he read up for the subject at my desire in the encyclopdia britannica indeed said mr pickwick i was not aware that that valuable work contained any information respecting chinese metaphysics he read sir rejoined pott laying his hand on mr pickwick's knee and looking round with a smile of intellectual superiority he read for metaphysics under the letter m and for china under the letter c and combined his information sir mr pott's features assumed so much additional grandeur at the recollection of the power and research displayed in the learned effusions in question that some minutes elapsed before mr pickwick felt emboldened to renew the conversation at length as the editor's countenance gradually relaxed into its customary expression of moral supremacy he ventured to resume the discourse by asking is it fair to inquire what great object has brought you so far from home that object which actuates and animates me in all my gigantic labours sir replied pott with a calm smile my country's good i supposed it was some public mission observed mr pickwick yes sir resumed pott it is here bending towards mr pickwick he whispered in a deep hollow voice a buff ball sir will take place in birmingham to morrow evening god bless me exclaimed mr pickwick yes sir and supper added pott you don't say so ejaculated mr pickwick pott nodded portentously now although mr pickwick feigned to stand aghast at this disclosure he was so little versed in local politics that he was unable to form an adequate comprehension of the importance of the dire conspiracy it referred to observing which mr pott drawing forth the last number of the eatanswill gazette and referring to the same delivered himself of the following paragraph hole and corner buffery a reptile contemporary has recently sweltered forth his black venom in the vain and hopeless attempt of sullying the fair name of our distinguished and excellent representative the honourable mr slumkey that slumkey whom we long before he gained his present noble and exalted position predicted would one day be as he now is at once his country's brightest honour and her proudest boast alike her bold defender and her honest pride our reptile contemporary we say has made himself merry at the expense of a superbly embossed plated coal scuttle which has been presented to that glorious man by his enraptured constituents and towards the purchase of which the nameless wretch insinuates the honourable mr slumkey himself contributed through a confidential friend of his butler's more than three fourths of the whole sum subscribed why does not the crawling creature see that even if this be the fact the honourable mr slumkey only appears in a still more amiable and radiant light than before if that be possible does not even his obtuseness perceive that this amiable and touching desire to carry out the wishes of the constituent body must for ever endear him to the hearts and souls of such of his fellow townsmen as are not worse than swine or in other words who are not as debased as our contemporary himself but such is the wretched trickery of hole and corner buffery these are not its only artifices treason is abroad we boldly state now that we are goaded to the disclosure and we throw ourselves on the country and its constables for protection we boldly state that secret preparations are at this moment in progress for a buff ball which is to be held in a buff town in the very heart and centre of a buff population which is to be conducted by a buff master of the ceremonies which is to be attended by four ultra buff members of parliament and the admission to which is to be by buff tickets does our fiendish contemporary wince let him writhe in impotent malice as we pen the words we will be there there sir said pott folding up the paper quite exhausted that is the state of the case the landlord and waiter entering at the moment with dinner caused mr pott to put his finger on his lips in token that he considered his life in mr pickwick's hands and depended on his secrecy messrs bob sawyer and benjamin allen who had irreverently fallen asleep during the reading of the quotation from the eatanswill gazette and the discussion which followed it were roused by the mere whispering of the talismanic word dinner in their ears and to dinner they went with good digestion waiting on appetite and health on both and a waiter on all three in the course of the dinner and the sitting which succeeded it mr pott descending for a few moments to domestic topics informed mr pickwick that the air of eatanswill not agreeing with his lady she was then engaged in making a tour of different fashionable watering places with a view to the recovery of her wonted health and spirits this was a delicate veiling of the fact that mrs pott acting upon her often repeated threat of separation had in virtue of an arrangement negotiated by her brother the lieutenant and concluded by mr pott permanently retired with the faithful body guard upon one moiety or half part of the annual income and profits arising from the editorship and sale of the eatanswill gazette while the great mr pott was dwelling upon this and other matters enlivening the conversation from time to time with various extracts from his own lucubrations a stern stranger calling from the window of a stage coach outward bound which halted at the inn to deliver packages requested to know whether if he stopped short on his journey and remained there for the night he could be furnished with the necessary accommodation of a bed and bedstead certainly sir replied the landlord i can can i inquired the stranger who seemed habitually suspicious in look and manner no doubt of it sir replied the landlord good said the stranger coachman i get down here guard my carpet bag bidding the other passengers good night in a rather snappish manner the stranger alighted he was a shortish gentleman with very stiff black hair cut in the porcupine or blacking brush style and standing stiff and straight all over his head his aspect was pompous and threatening his manner was peremptory his eyes were sharp and restless and his whole bearing bespoke a feeling of great confidence in himself and a consciousness of immeasurable superiority over all other people this gentleman was shown into the room originally assigned to the patriotic mr pott and the waiter remarked in dumb astonishment at the singular coincidence that he had no sooner lighted the candles than the gentleman diving into his hat drew forth a newspaper and began to read it with the very same expression of indignant scorn which upon the majestic features of pott had paralysed his energies an hour before the man observed too that whereas mr pott's scorn had been roused by a newspaper headed the eatanswill independent this gentleman's withering contempt was awakened by a newspaper entitled the eatanswill gazette send the landlord said the stranger yes sir rejoined the waiter the landlord was sent and came are you the landlord inquired the gentleman i am sir replied the landlord do you know me demanded the gentleman i have not that pleasure sir rejoined the landlord my name is slurk said the gentleman the landlord slightly inclined his head slurk sir repeated the gentleman haughtily do you know me now man the landlord scratched his head looked at the ceiling and at the stranger and smiled feebly do you know me man inquired the stranger angrily the landlord made a strong effort and at length replied well sir i do not know you great heaven said the stranger dashing his clenched fist upon the table and this is popularity the landlord took a step or two towards the door the stranger fixing his eyes upon him resumed this said the stranger this is gratitude for years of labour and study in behalf of the masses i alight wet and weary no enthusiastic crowds press forward to greet their champion the church bells are silent the very name elicits no responsive feeling in their torpid bosoms it is enough said the agitated mr slurk pacing to and fro to curdle the ink in one's pen and induce one to abandon their cause for ever did you say brandy and water sir said the landlord venturing a hint rum said mr slurk turning fiercely upon him have you got a fire anywhere we can light one directly sir said the landlord which will throw out no heat until it is bed time interrupted mr slurk is there anybody in the kitchen not a soul there was a beautiful fire everybody had gone and the house door was closed for the night i will drink my rum and water said mr slurk by the kitchen fire so gathering up his hat and newspaper he stalked solemnly behind the landlord to that humble apartment and throwing himself on a settle by the fireside resumed his countenance of scorn and began to read and drink in silent dignity now some demon of discord flying over the saracen's head at that moment on casting down his eyes in mere idle curiosity happened to behold slurk established comfortably by the kitchen fire and pott slightly elevated with wine in another room upon which the malicious demon darting down into the last mentioned apartment with inconceivable rapidity passed at once into the head of mr bob sawyer and prompted him for his the demon's own evil purposes to speak as follows i say we've let the fire out it's uncommonly cold after the rain isn't it it really is replied mr pickwick shivering it wouldn't be a bad notion to have a cigar by the kitchen fire would it said bob sawyer still prompted by the demon aforesaid it would be particularly comfortable i think replied mr pickwick mr pott what do you say mr pott yielded a ready assent and all four travellers each with his glass in his hand at once betook themselves to the kitchen with sam weller heading the procession to show them the way the stranger was still reading he looked up and started mr pott started what's the matter whispered mr pickwick that reptile replied pott what reptile said mr pickwick looking about him for fear he should tread on some overgrown black beetle or dropsical spider that reptile whispered pott catching mr pickwick by the arm and pointing towards the stranger that reptile slurk of the independent perhaps we had better retire whispered mr pickwick never sir rejoined pott pot valiant in a double sense never with these words mr pott took up his position on an opposite settle and selecting one from a little bundle of newspapers began to read against his enemy mr pott of course read the independent and mr slurk of course read the gazette and each gentleman audibly expressed his contempt of the other's compositions by bitter laughs and sarcastic sniffs whence they proceeded to more open expressions of opinion such as absurd wretched atrocity humbug knavery dirt filth slime ditch water and other critical remarks of the like nature both mr bob sawyer and mr ben allen had beheld these symptoms of rivalry and hatred with a degree of delight which imparted great additional relish to the cigars at which they were puffing most vigorously the moment they began to flag the mischievous mr bob sawyer addressing slurk with great politeness said will you allow me to look at your paper sir when you have quite done with it you will find very little to repay you for your trouble in this contemptible thing sir replied slurk bestowing a satanic frown on pott you shall have this presently said pott looking up pale with rage and quivering in his speech from the same cause ha ha you will be amused with this fellow's audacity terrific emphasis was laid on this thing and fellow and the faces of both editors began to glow with defiance the ribaldry of this miserable man is despicably disgusting said pott pretending to address bob sawyer and scowling upon slurk here mr slurk laughed very heartily and folding up the paper so as to get at a fresh column conveniently said that the blockhead really amused him what an impudent blunderer this fellow is said pott turning from pink to crimson did you ever read any of this man's foolery sir inquired slurk of bob sawyer never replied bob is it very bad oh shocking shocking rejoined slurk really dear me this is too atrocious exclaimed pott at this juncture still feigning to be absorbed in his reading if you can wade through a few sentences of malice meanness falsehood perjury treachery and cant said slurk handing the paper to bob you will perhaps be somewhat repaid by a laugh at the style of this ungrammatical twaddler what's that you said sir inquired mr pott looking up trembling all over with passion what's that to you sir replied slurk ungrammatical twaddler was it sir said pott yes sir it was replied slurk and blue bore sir if you like that better ha ha mr pott retorted not a word to this jocose insult but deliberately folded up his copy of the independent flattened it carefully down crushed it beneath his boot spat upon it with great ceremony and flung it into the fire there sir said pott retreating from the stove and that's the way i would serve the viper who produces it if i were not fortunately for him restrained by the laws of my country serve him so sir cried slurk starting up those laws shall never be appealed to by him sir in such a case serve him so sir hear hear said bob sawyer nothing can be fairer observed mr ben allen serve him so sir reiterated slurk in a loud voice mr pott darted a look of contempt which might have withered an anchor serve him so sir reiterated slurk in a louder voice than before i will not sir rejoined pott oh you won't won't you sir said mr slurk in a taunting manner you hear this gentlemen he won't not that he's afraid oh no he won't ha ha i consider you sir said mr pott moved by this sarcasm i consider you a viper i look upon you sir as a man who has placed himself beyond the pale of society by his most audacious disgraceful and abominable public conduct i view you sir personally and politically in no other light than as a most unparalleled and unmitigated viper the indignant independent did not wait to hear the end of this personal denunciation for catching up his carpet bag which was well stuffed with movables he swung it in the air as pott turned away and letting it fall with a circular sweep on his head just at that particular angle of the bag where a good thick hair brush happened to be packed caused a sharp crash to be heard throughout the kitchen and brought him at once to the ground gentlemen cried mr pickwick as pott started up and seized the fire shovel gentlemen consider for heaven's sake help sam here pray gentlemen interfere somebody uttering these incoherent exclamations mr pickwick rushed between the infuriated combatants just in time to receive the carpet bag on one side of his body and the fire shovel on the other whether the representatives of the public feeling of eatanswill were blinded by animosity or being both acute reasoners saw the advantage of having a third party between them to bear all the blows certain it is that they paid not the slightest attention to mr pickwick but defying each other with great spirit plied the carpet bag and the fire shovel most fearlessly mr pickwick would unquestionably have suffered severely for his humane interference if mr weller attracted by his master's cries had not rushed in at the moment and snatching up a meal sack effectually stopped the conflict by drawing it over the head and shoulders of the mighty pott and clasping him tight round the shoulders take avay that 'ere bag from t'other madman said sam to ben allen and bob sawyer who had done nothing but dodge round the group each with a tortoise shell lancet in his hand ready to bleed the first man stunned give it up you wretched little creetur or i'll smother you in it awed by these threats and quite out of breath the independent suffered himself to be disarmed and mr weller removing the extinguisher from pott set him free with a caution you take yourself off to bed quietly said sam or i'll put you both in it and let you fight it out vith the mouth tied as i vould a dozen sich if they played these games and you have the goodness to come this here vay sir if you please thus addressing his master sam took him by the arm and led him off while the rival editors were severally removed to their beds by the landlord under the inspection of mr bob sawyer and mr benjamin allen breathing as they went away many sanguinary threats and making vague appointments for mortal combat next day when they came to think it over however it occurred to them that they could do it much better in print so they recommenced deadly hostilities without delay and all eatanswill rung with their boldness on paper they had taken themselves off in separate coaches early next morning before the other travellers were stirring and the weather having now cleared up the chaise companions once more turned their faces to london chapter xxiv illustration involving a serious change in the weller family and the untimely downfall of the red nosed mr stiggins considering it a matter of delicacy to abstain from introducing either bob sawyer or ben allen to the young couple until they were fully prepared to expect them and wishing to spare arabella's feelings as much as possible mr pickwick proposed that he and sam should alight in the neighbourhood of the george and vulture and that the two young men should for the present take up their quarters elsewhere to this they very readily agreed and the proposition was accordingly acted upon mr ben allen and mr bob sawyer betaking themselves to a sequestered pot shop on the remotest confines of the borough behind the bar door of which their names had in other days very often appeared at the head of long and complex calculations worked in white chalk dear me mr weller said the pretty housemaid meeting sam at the door dear me i vish it vos my dear replied sam dropping behind to let his master get out of hearing wot a sweet looking creetur you are mary lor mr weller what nonsense you do talk said mary oh don't mr weller don't what my dear said sam why that replied the pretty housemaid lor do get along with you thus admonishing him the pretty housemaid pushed sam against the wall declaring that he had tumbled her cap and put her hair quite out of curl and prevented what i was going to say besides added mary there's a letter been waiting for you four days you hadn't been gone half an hour when it came and more than that it's got 'immediate' on the outside vere is it my love inquired sam i took care of it for you or i dare say it would have been lost long before this replied mary there take it it's more than you deserve with these words after many pretty little coquettish doubts and fears and wishes that she might not have lost it mary produced the letter from behind the nicest little muslin tucker possible and handed it over to sam who thereupon kissed it with much gallantry and devotion my goodness me said mary adjusting the tucker and feigning unconsciousness you seem to have grown very fond of it all at once to this mr weller only replied by a wink the intense meaning of which no description could convey the faintest idea of and sitting himself down beside mary on a window seat opened the letter and glanced at the contents hallo exclaimed sam wot's all this nothing the matter i hope said mary peeping over his shoulder bless them eyes o' yourn said sam looking up never mind my eyes you had much better read your letter said the pretty housemaid and as she said so she made the eyes twinkle with such slyness and beauty that they were perfectly irresistible sam refreshed himself with a kiss and read as follows markis gran by dorken wensdy my dear sammle i am wery sorry to have the pleasure of bein a bear of ill news your mother in law cort cold consekens of imprudently settin too long on the damp grass in the rain a hearin of a shepherd who warnt able to leave off till late at night owen to his havin vound his self up vith brandy and vater and not bein able to stop his self till he got a little sober which took

then my father comes a lookin' over him and complicates the whole concern by puttin' his oar in that's just the wery sort o' thing he'd do you're right mary my dear having satisfied himself on this point sam read the letter all over once more and appearing to form a clear notion of its contents for the first time ejaculated thoughtfully as he folded it up and so the poor creetur's dead i'm sorry for it she warn't a bad disposed 'ooman if them shepherds had let her alone i'm wery sorry for it mr weller uttered these words in so serious a manner that the pretty housemaid cast down her eyes and looked very grave hows'ever said sam putting the letter in his pocket with a gentle sigh it wos to be and wos as the old lady said arter she'd married the footman can't be helped now can it mary mary shook her head and sighed too i must apply to the hemperor for leave of absence said sam mary sighed again the letter was so very affecting good bye said sam good bye rejoined the pretty housemaid turning her head away well shake hands won't you said sam the pretty housemaid put out a hand which although it was a housemaid's was a very small one and rose to go i shan't be wery long avay said sam you're always away said mary giving her head the slightest possible toss in the air you no sooner come mr weller than you go again mr weller drew the household beauty closer to him and entered upon a whispering conversation which had not proceeded far when she turned her face round and condescended to look at him again when they parted it was somehow or other indispensably necessary for her to go to her room and arrange the cap and curls before she could think of presenting herself to her mistress which preparatory ceremony she went off to perform bestowing many nods and smiles on sam over the banisters as she tripped upstairs i shan't be avay more than a day or two sir at the farthest said sam when he had communicated to mr pickwick the intelligence of his father's loss as long as may be necessary sam replied mr pickwick you have my full permission to remain sam bowed you will tell your father sam that if i can be of any assistance to him in his present situation i shall be most willing and ready to lend him any aid in my power said mr pickwick thankee sir rejoined sam i'll mention it sir and with some expressions of mutual good will and interest master and man separated it was just seven o'clock when samuel weller alighting from the box of a stage coach which passed through dorking stood within a few hundred yards of the marquis of granby it was a cold dull evening the little street looked dreary and dismal and the mahogany countenance of the noble and gallant marquis seemed to wear a more sad and melancholy expression than it was wont to do as it swung to and fro creaking mournfully in the wind the blinds were pulled down and the shutters partly closed of the knot of loungers that usually collected about the door not one was to be seen the place was silent and desolate seeing nobody of whom he could ask any preliminary questions sam walked softly in glancing round he quickly recognised his parent in the distance the widower was seated at a small round table in the little room behind the bar smoking a pipe with his eyes intently fixed upon the fire the funeral had evidently taken place that day for attached to his hat which he still retained on his head was a hatband measuring about a yard and a half in length which hung over the top rail of the chair and streamed negligently down mr weller was in a very abstracted and contemplative mood notwithstanding that sam called him by name several times he still continued to smoke with the same fixed and quiet countenance and was only roused ultimately by his son's placing the palm of his hand on his shoulder sammy said mr weller you're velcome i've been a callin' to you half a dozen times said sam hanging his hat on a peg but you didn't hear me no sammy replied mr weller again looking thoughtfully at the fire i wos in a referee sammy wot about inquired sam drawing his chair up to the fire in a referee sammy replied the elder mr weller regarding her samivel here mr weller jerked his head in the direction of dorking churchyard in mute explanation that his words referred to the late mrs weller i wos a thinkin' sammy said mr weller eyeing his son with great earnestness over his pipe as if to assure him that however extraordinary and incredible the declaration might appear it was nevertheless calmly and deliberately uttered i wos a thinkin' sammy that upon the whole i wos wery sorry she wos gone vell and so you ought to be replied sam mr weller nodded his acquiescence in the sentiment and again fastening his eyes on the fire shrouded himself in a cloud and mused deeply those wos wery sensible observations as she made sammy said mr weller driving the smoke away with his hand after a long silence wot observations inquired sam them as she made arter she was took ill replied the old gentleman wot wos they somethin' to this here effect 'veller' she says 'i'm afeard i've not done by you quite wot i ought to have done you're a wery kind hearted man and i might ha' made your home more comfortabler i begin to see now' she says 'ven it's too late that if a married 'ooman vishes to be religious she should begin vith dischargin' her dooties at home and makin' them as is about her cheerful and happy and that vile she goes to church or chapel or wot not at all proper times she should be wery careful not to conwert this sort o' thing into a excuse for idleness or self indulgence i have done this' she says 'and i've wasted time and substance on them as has done it more than me but i hope ven i'm gone veller that you'll think on me as i wos afore i know'd them people and as i raly wos by natur'' 'susan' says i i wos took up wery short by this samivel i von't deny it my boy 'susan' i says 'you've been a wery good vife to me altogether don't say nothin' at all about it keep a good heart my dear and you'll live to see me punch that 'ere stiggins's head yet' she smiled at this samivel said the old gentleman stifling a sigh with his pipe but she died arter all vell said sam venturing to offer a little homely consolation after the lapse of three or four minutes consumed by the old gentleman in slowly shaking his head from side to side and solemnly smoking vell gov'ner ve must all come to it one day or another so we must sammy said mr weller the elder there's a providence in it all said sam o' course there is replied his father with a nod of grave approval wot 'ud become of the undertakers without it sammy lost in the immense field of conjecture opened by this reflection the elder mr weller laid his pipe on the table and stirred the fire with a meditative visage while the old gentleman was thus engaged a very buxom looking cook dressed in mourning who had been bustling about in the bar glided into the room and bestowing many smirks of recognition upon sam silently stationed herself at the back of his father's chair and announced her presence by a slight cough the which being disregarded was followed by a louder one hallo said the elder mr weller dropping the poker as he looked round and hastily drew his chair away wot's the matter now have a cup of tea there's a good soul replied the buxom female coaxingly i von't replied mr weller in a somewhat boisterous manner i'll see you mr weller hastily checked himself and added in a low tone furder fust oh dear dear how adversity does change people said the lady looking upwards it's the only think 'twixt this and the doctor as shall change my condition muttered mr weller i really never saw a man so cross said the buxom female never mind it's all for my own good vich is the reflection vith wich the penitent schoolboy comforted his feelin's ven they flogged him rejoined the old gentleman the buxom female shook her head with a compassionate and sympathising air and appealing to sam inquired whether his father really ought not to make an effort to keep up and not give way to that lowness of spirits you see mr samuel said the buxom female as i was telling him yesterday he will feel lonely he can't expect but what he should sir but he should keep up a good heart because dear me i'm sure we all pity his loss and are ready to do anything for him and there's no situation in life so bad mr samuel that it can't be mended which is what a very worthy person said to me when my husband died here the speaker putting her hand before her mouth coughed again and looked affectionately at the elder mr weller as i don't rekvire any o' your conversation just now mum vill you have the goodness to re tire inquired mr weller in grave and steady voice well mr weller said the buxom female i'm sure i only spoke to you out of kindness wery likely mum replied mr weller samivel show the lady out and shut the door arter her this hint was not lost upon the buxom female for she at once left the room and slammed the door behind her upon which mr weller senior falling back in his chair in a violent perspiration said sammy if i was to stop here alone vun veek only vun veek my boy that 'ere 'ooman 'ud marry me by force and wiolence afore it was over wot is she so wery fond on you inquired sam fond replied his father i can't keep her avay from me if i was locked up in a fire proof chest vith a patent brahmin she'd find means to get at me sammy wot a thing it is to be so sought arter observed sam smiling i don't take no pride out on it sammy replied mr weller poking the fire vehemently it's a horrid sitiwation i'm actiwally drove out o' house and home by it the breath was scarcely out o' your poor mother in law's body ven vun old 'ooman sends me a pot o' jam and another a pot o' jelly and another brews a blessed large jug o' camomile tea vich she brings in vith her own hands mr weller paused with an aspect of intense disgust and looking round added in a whisper they wos all widders sammy all on 'em 'cept the camomile tea vun as wos a single young lady o' fifty three sam gave a comical look in reply and the old gentleman having broken an obstinate lump of coal with a countenance expressive of as much earnestness and malice as if it had been the head of one of the widows last mentioned said in short sammy i feel that i ain't safe anyveres but on the box how are you safer there than anyveres else interrupted sam 'cos a coachman's a privileged indiwidual replied mr weller looking fixedly at his son 'cos a coachman may do vithout suspicion wot other men may not 'cos a coachman may be on the wery amicablest terms with eighty mile o' females and yet nobody think that he ever means to marry any vun among 'em and wot other man can say the same sammy vell there's somethin' in that said sam if your gov'ner had been a coachman reasoned mr weller do you suppose as that 'ere jury 'ud ever ha' conwicted him s'posin' it possible as the matter could ha' gone to that extremity they dustn't ha' done it vy not said sam rather disparagingly vy not rejoined mr weller 'cos it 'ud ha' gone agin their consciences a reg'lar coachman's a sort o' con nectin' link betwixt singleness and matrimony and every practicable man knows it wot you mean they're gen'ral fav'rites and nobody takes adwantage on 'em p'raps said sam his father nodded how it ever come to that 'ere pass resumed the parent weller i can't say vy it is that long stage coachmen possess such insiniwations and is alvays looked up to a dored i may say by ev'ry young 'ooman in ev'ry town he vurks through i don't know i only know that it is so it's a reg'lation of natur a dispensary as your poor mother in law used to say a dispensation said sam correcting the old gentleman wery good samivel a dispensation if you like it better returned mr weller i call it a dispensary and it's alvays writ up so at the places vere they gives you physic for nothin' in your own bottles that's all with these words mr weller re filled and re lighted his pipe and once more summing up a meditative expression of countenance continued as follows therefore my boy as i do not see the adwisability o' stoppin' here to be married vether i vant to or not and as at the same time i do not wish to separate myself from them interestin' members o' society altogether i have come to the determination o' drivin the safety and puttin' up vunce more at the bell savage vich is my nat'ral born element sammy and wot's to become o' the bis'ness inquired sam the bis'ness samivel replied the old gentleman good vill stock and fixters vill be sold by private contract and out o' the money two hundred pound agreeable to rekvest o' your mother in law's to me a little afore she died vill be inwested in your name in wot do you call them things agin wot things inquired sam them things as is alvays a goin' up and down in the city omnibuses suggested sam nonsense replied mr weller them things as is alvays a fluctooatin' and gettin' theirselves inwolved somehow or another vith the national debt and the checquers bills and all that oh the funds said sam ah rejoined mr weller the funs two hundred pounds o' the money is to be inwested for you samivel in the funs four and a half per cent reduced counsels sammy wery kind o' the old lady to think o' me said sam and i'm wery much obliged to her the rest vill be inwested in my name continued the elder mr weller and ven i'm took off the road it'll come to you so take care you don't spend it all at vunst my boy and mind that no widder gets a inklin' o' your fortun' or you're done having delivered this warning mr weller resumed his pipe with a more serene countenance the disclosure of these matters appearing to have eased his mind considerably somebody's a tappin' at the door said sam let 'em tap replied his father with dignity sam acted upon the direction there was another tap and another and then a long row of taps upon which sam inquired why the tapper was not admitted hush whispered mr weller with apprehensive looks don't take no notice on 'em sammy it's vun o' the widders p'raps no notice being taken of the taps the unseen visitor after a short lapse ventured to open the door and peep in it was no female head that was thrust in at the partially opened door but the long black locks and red face of mr stiggins mr weller's pipe fell from his hands the reverend gentleman gradually opened the door by almost imperceptible degrees until the aperture was just wide enough to admit of the passage of his lank body when he glided into the room and closed it after him with great care and gentleness turning towards sam and raising his hands and eyes in token of the unspeakable sorrow with which he regarded the calamity that had befallen the family he carried the high backed chair to his old corner by the fire and seating himself on the very edge drew forth a brown pocket handkerchief and applied the same to his optics while this was going forward the elder mr weller sat back in his chair with his eyes wide open his hands planted on his knees and his whole countenance expressive of absorbing and overwhelming astonishment sam sat opposite him in perfect silence waiting with eager curiosity for the termination of the scene mr stiggins kept the brown pocket handkerchief before his eyes for some minutes moaning decently meanwhile and then mastering his feelings by a strong effort put it in his pocket and buttoned it up after this he stirred the fire after that he rubbed his hands and looked at sam oh my young friend said mr stiggins breaking the silence in a very low voice here's a sorrowful affliction sam nodded very slightly for the man of wrath too added mr stiggins it makes a vessel's heart bleed mr weller was overheard by his son to murmur something relative to making a vessel's nose bleed but mr stiggins heard him not do you know young man whispered mr stiggins drawing his chair closer to sam whether she has left emanuel anything who's he inquired sam the chapel replied mr stiggins our chapel our fold mr samuel she hasn't left the fold nothin' nor the shepherd nothin' nor the animals nothin' said sam decisively nor the dogs neither mr stiggins looked slyly at sam glanced at the old gentleman who was sitting with his eyes closed as if asleep and drawing his chair still nearer said nothing for me mr samuel sam shook his head i think there's something said stiggins turning as pale as he could turn consider mr samuel no little token not so much as the vorth o' that 'ere old umberella o' yourn replied sam perhaps said mr stiggins hesitatingly after a few moments' deep thought perhaps she recommended me to the care of the man of wrath mr samuel i think that's wery likely from what he said rejoined sam he wos speakin' about you jist now was he though exclaimed stiggins brightening up ah he's changed i dare say we might live very comfortably together now mr samuel eh i could take care of his property when you are away good care you see heaving a long drawn sigh mr stiggins paused for a response sam nodded and mr weller the elder gave vent to an extraordinary sound which being neither a groan nor a grunt nor a gasp nor a growl seemed to partake in some degree of the character of all four mr stiggins encouraged by this sound which he understood to betoken remorse or repentance looked about him rubbed his hands wept smiled wept again and then walking softly across the room to a well remembered shelf in one corner took down a tumbler and with great deliberation put four lumps of sugar in it having got thus far he looked about him again and sighed grievously with that he walked softly into the bar and presently returning with the tumbler half full of pine apple rum advanced to the kettle which was singing gaily on the hob mixed his grog stirred it sipped it sat down and taking a long and hearty pull at the rum and water stopped for breath the elder mr weller who still continued to make various strange and uncouth attempts to appear asleep offered not a single word during these proceedings but when stiggins stopped for breath he darted upon him and snatching the tumbler from his hand threw the remainder of the rum and water in his face and the glass itself into the grate then seizing the reverend gentleman firmly by the collar he suddenly fell to kicking him most furiously accompanying every application of his top boots to mr stiggins's person with sundry violent and incoherent anathemas upon his limbs eyes and body sammy said mr weller put my hat on tight for me sam dutifully adjusted the hat with the long hatband more firmly on his father's head and the old gentleman resuming his kicking with greater agility than before tumbled with mr stiggins through the bar and through the passage out at the front door and so into the street the kicking continuing the whole way and increasing in vehemence rather than diminishing every time the top boot was lifted it was a beautiful and exhilarating sight to see the red nosed man writhing in mr weller's grasp and his whole frame quivering with anguish as kick followed kick in rapid succession it was a still more exciting spectacle to behold mr weller after a powerful struggle immersing mr stiggins's head in a horse trough full of water and holding it there until he was half suffocated there said mr weller throwing all his energy into one most complicated kick as he at length permitted mr stiggins to withdraw his head from the trough send any vun o' them lazy shepherds here and i'll pound him to a jelly first and drownd him artervards sammy help me in and fill me a small glass of brandy i'm out o' breath my boy illustration it was a beautiful and exhilarating sight to see the red nosed man writhing in mr weller's grasp chapter xxv illustration comprising the final exit of mr jingle and job trotter with a great morning of business in gray's inn square concluding with a double knock at mr perker's door when arabella after some gentle preparation and many assurances that there was not the least occasion for being low spirited was at length made acquainted by mr pickwick with the unsatisfactory result of his visit to birmingham she burst into tears and sobbing aloud lamented in moving terms that she should have been the unhappy cause of any estrangement between a father and his son my dear girl said mr pickwick kindly it is no fault of yours it was impossible to foresee that the old gentleman would be so strongly prepossessed against his son's marriage you know i am sure added mr pickwick glancing at her pretty face he can have very little idea of the pleasure he denies himself oh my dear mr pickwick said arabella what shall we do if he continues to be angry with us why wait patiently my dear until he thinks better of it replied mr pickwick cheerfully but dear mr pickwick what is to become of nathaniel if his father withdraws his assistance urged arabella in that case my love rejoined mr pickwick i will venture to prophesy that he will find some other friend who will not be backward in helping him to start in the world the significance of this reply was not so well disguised by mr pickwick but that arabella understood it so throwing her arms round his neck and kissing him affectionately she sobbed louder than before come come said mr pickwick taking her hand we will wait here a few days longer and see whether he writes or takes any other notice of your husband's communication if not i have thought of half a dozen plans any one of which would make you happy at once there my dear there with these words mr pickwick gently pressed arabella's hand and bade her dry her eyes and not distress her husband upon which arabella who was one of the best little creatures alive put her handkerchief in her reticule and by the time mr winkle joined them exhibited in full lustre the same beaming smiles and sparkling eyes that had originally captivated him this is a distressing predicament for these young people thought mr pickwick as he dressed himself next morning i'll walk up to perker's and consult him about the matter as mr pickwick was further prompted to betake himself to gray's inn square by an anxious desire to come to a pecuniary settlement with the kind hearted little attorney without further delay he made a hurried breakfast and executed his intention so speedily that ten o'clock had not struck when he reached gray's inn it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when he had ascended the staircase on which perker's chambers were the clerks had not arrived yet and he beguiled the time by looking out of the staircase window the healthy light of a fine october morning made even the dingy old houses brighten up a little some of the dusty windows actually looking almost cheerful as the sun's rays gleamed upon them clerk after clerk hastened into the square by one or other of the entrances and looking up at the hall clock accelerated or decreased his rate of walking according to the time at which his office hours nominally commenced the half past nine o'clock people suddenly becoming very brisk and the ten o'clock gentlemen falling into a pace of most aristocratic slowness the clock struck ten and clerks poured in faster than ever each one in a greater perspiration than his predecessor the noise of unlocking and opening doors echoed and re echoed on every side heads appeared as if by magic in every window the porters took up their stations for the day the slipshod laundresses hurried off the postman ran from house to house and the whole legal hive was in a bustle you're early mr pickwick said a voice behind him ah mr lowten replied that gentleman looking round and recognising his old acquaintance precious warm walking isn't it said lowten drawing a bramah key from his pocket with a small plug therein to keep the dust out you appear to feel it so rejoined mr pickwick smiling at the clerk who was literally red hot i've come along rather i can tell you replied lowten it went the half hour as i came through the polygon i'm here before him though so i don't mind comforting himself with this reflection mr lowten extracted the plug from the door key and having opened the door re plugged and re pocketed his bramah and picked up the letters which the postman had dropped through the box he then ushered mr pickwick into the office here in the twinkling of an eye he divested himself of his coat put on a threadbare garment which he took out of a desk hung up his hat pulled forth a few sheets of cartridge and blotting paper in alternate layers and sticking a pen behind his ear rubbed his hands with an air of great satisfaction there you see mr pickwick he said now i'm complete i've got my office coat on and my pad out and let him come as soon as he likes you haven't got a pinch of snuff about you have you no i have not replied mr pickwick i'm sorry for it said lowten never mind i'll run out presently and get a bottle of soda don't i look rather queer about the eyes mr pickwick the individual appealed to surveyed mr lowten's eyes from a distance and expressed his opinion that no unusual queerness was perceptible in those features i'm glad of it said lowten we were keeping it up pretty tolerably at the stump last night and i'm rather out of sorts this morning perker's been about that business of yours by the bye what business inquired mr pickwick mrs bardell's costs no i don't mean that replied mr lowten about getting that customer that we paid the ten shillings in the pound to the bill discounter for on your account to get him out of the fleet you know about getting him to demerara oh mr jingle said mr pickwick hastily yes well well it's all arranged said lowten mending his pen the agent at liverpool said he had been obliged to you many times when you were in business and he would be glad to take him on your recommendation that's well said mr pickwick i am delighted to hear it but i say resumed lowten scraping the back of the pen preparatory to making a fresh split what a soft chap that other is which other why that servant or friend or whatever he is you know trotter ah said mr pickwick with a smile i always thought him the reverse well and so did i from what little i saw of him replied lowten it only shows how one may be deceived what do you think of his going to demerara too what and giving up what was offered him here exclaimed mr pickwick treating perker's offer of eighteen bob a week and a rise if he behaved himself like dirt replied lowten he said he must go along with the other one and so they persuaded perker to write again and they've got him something on the same estate not near so good perker says as a convict would get in new south wales if he appeared at his trial in a new suit of clothes foolish fellow said mr pickwick with glistening eyes foolish fellow oh it's worse than foolish it's downright sneaking you know replied lowten nibbing the pen with a contemptuous face he says that he's the only friend he ever had and he's attached to him and all that friendship's a very good thing in its way we are all very friendly and comfortable at the stump for instance over our grog where every man pays for himself but damn hurting yourself for anybody else you know no man should have more than two attachments the first to number one and the second to the ladies that's what i say ha ha mr lowten concluded with a loud laugh half in jocularity and half in derision which was prematurely cut short by the sound of perker's footsteps on the stairs at the first approach of which he vaulted on his stool with an agility most remarkable and wrote intensely the greeting between mr pickwick and his professional adviser was warm and cordial the client was scarcely ensconced in the attorney's arm chair however when a knock was heard at the door and a voice inquired whether mr perker was within hark said perker that's one of our vagabond friends jingle himself my dear sir will you see him what do you think inquired mr pickwick hesitating yes i think you had better here you sir what's your name walk in will you in compliance with this unceremonious invitation jingle and job walked into the room but seeing mr pickwick stopped short in some confusion well said perker don't you know that gentleman good reason to replied mr jingle stepping forward mr pickwick deepest obligations life preserver made a man of me you shall never repent it sir i am happy to hear you say so said mr pickwick you look much better thanks to you sir great change majesty's fleet unwholesome place very said jingle shaking his head he was decently and cleanly dressed and so was job who stood bolt upright behind him staring at mr pickwick with a visage of iron when do they go to liverpool inquired mr pickwick half aside to perker this evening sir at seven o'clock said job taking one step forward by the heavy coach from the city sir are your places taken they are sir replied job you have fully made up your mind to go i have sir answered job with regard to such an outfit as was indispensable for jingle said perker addressing mr pickwick aloud i have taken upon myself to make an arrangement for the deduction of a small sum from his quarterly salary which being made only for one year and regularly remitted will provide for that expense i entirely disapprove of your doing anything for him my dear sir which is not dependent on his own exertions and good conduct certainly interposed jingle with great firmness clear head man of the world quite right perfectly by compounding with his creditor releasing his clothes from the pawnbroker's relieving him in prison and paying for his passage continued perker without noticing jingle's observation you have already lost upwards of fifty pounds not lost said jingle hastily pay it all stick to business cash up every farthing yellow fever perhaps can't help that if not here mr jingle paused and striking the crown of his hat with great violence passed his hand over his eyes and sat down he means to say said job advancing a few paces that if he is not carried off by the fever he will pay the money back again if he lives he will mr pickwick i will see it done i know he will sir said job with energy i could undertake to swear it well well said mr pickwick who had been bestowing a score or two of frowns upon perker to stop his summary of benefits conferred which the little attorney obstinately disregarded you must be careful not to play any more desperate cricket matches mr jingle or to renew your acquaintance with sir thomas blazo and i have little doubt of your preserving your health mr jingle smiled at this sally but looked rather foolish notwithstanding so mr pickwick changed the subject by saying you don't happen to know do you what has become of another friend of yours a more humble one whom i saw at rochester dismal jemmy inquired jingle yes jingle shook his head clever rascal queer fellow hoaxing genius job's brother job's brother exclaimed mr pickwick well now i look at him closely there is a likeness we were always considered like each other sir said job with a cunning look just lurking in the corners of his eyes only i was really of a serious nature and he never was he emigrated to america sir in consequence of being too much sought after to be comfortable and has never been heard of since that accounts for my not having received the 'page from the romance of real life' which he promised me one morning when he appeared to be contemplating suicide on rochester bridge i suppose said mr pickwick smiling i need not inquire whether his dismal behaviour was natural or assumed he could assume anything sir said job you may consider yourself very fortunate in having escaped him so easily on intimate terms he would have been even more dangerous acquaintance than job looked at jingle hesitated and finally added than than myself even a hopeful family yours mr trotter said perker sealing a letter which he had just finished writing yes sir replied job very much so well said the little man laughing i hope you are going to disgrace it deliver this letter to the agent when you reach liverpool and let me advise you gentlemen not to be too knowing in the west indies if you throw away this chance you will both richly deserve to be hanged as i sincerely trust you will be and now you had better leave mr pickwick and me alone for we have other matters to talk over and time is precious as perker said this he looked towards the door with an evident desire to render the leave taking as brief as possible it was brief enough on mr jingle's part he thanked the little attorney in a few hurried words for the kindness and promptitude with which he had rendered his assistance and turning to his benefactor stood for a few seconds as if irresolute what to say or how to act job trotter relieved his perplexity for with a humble and grateful bow to mr pickwick he took his friend gently by the arm and led him away a worthy couple said perker as the door closed behind them i hope they may become so said mr pickwick what do you think is there any chance of their permanent reformation perker shrugged his shoulders doubtfully but observing mr pickwick's anxious and disappointed look rejoined of course there is a chance i hope it may prove a good one they are unquestionably penitent now but then you know they have the recollection of very recent suffering fresh upon them what they may become when that fades away is a problem that neither you nor i can solve however my dear sir added perker laying his hand on mr pickwick's shoulder your object is equally honourable whatever the result is whether that species of benevolence which is so very cautious and long sighted that it is seldom exercised at all lest its owner should be imposed upon and so wounded in his self love be real charity or a worldly counterfeit i leave to wiser heads than mine to determine but if those two fellows were to commit a burglary to morrow my opinion of this action would be equally high with these remarks which were delivered in a much more animated and earnest manner than is usual in legal gentlemen perker drew his chair to his desk and listened to mr pickwick's recital of old mr winkle's obstinacy give him a week said perker nodding his head prophetically do you think he will come round inquired mr pickwick i think he will rejoined perker if not we must try the young lady's persuasion and that is what anybody but you would have done first mr perker was taking a pinch of snuff with various grotesque contractions of countenance eulogistic of the persuasive powers appertaining unto young ladies when the murmur of inquiry and answer was heard in the outer office and lowten tapped at the door come in cried the little man the clerk came in and shut the door after him with great mystery what's the matter inquired perker you're wanted sir who wants me lowten looked at mr pickwick and coughed who wants me can't you speak mr lowten why sir replied lowten it's dodson and fogg is with him bless my life said the little man looking at his watch i appointed them to be here at half past eleven to settle that matter of yours pickwick i gave them an undertaking on which they sent down your discharge it's very awkward my dear sir what will you do would you like to step into the next room the next room being the identical room in which messrs dodson and fogg were mr pickwick replied that he would remain where he was the more especially as messrs dodson and fogg ought to be ashamed to look him in the face instead of his being ashamed to see them which latter circumstance he begged mr perker to note with a glowing countenance and many marks of indignation very well my dear sir very well replied perker i can only say that if you expect either dodson or fogg to exhibit any symptom of shame or confusion at having to look you or anybody else in the face you are the most sanguine man in your expectations that i ever met with show them in mr lowten mr lowten disappeared with a grin and immediately returned ushering in the firm in due form of precedence dodson first and fogg afterwards you have seen mr pickwick i believe said perker to dodson inclining his pen in the direction where that gentleman was seated how do you do mr pickwick said dodson in a loud voice dear me cried fogg how do you do mr pickwick i hope you are well sir i thought i knew the face said fogg drawing up a chair and looking round him with a smile mr pickwick bent his head very slightly in answer to these salutations and seeing fogg pull a bundle of papers from his coat pocket rose and walked to the window there's no occasion for mr pickwick to move mr perker said fogg untying the red tape which encircled the little bundle and smiling again more sweetly than before mr pickwick is pretty well acquainted with these proceedings there are no secrets between us i think he he he not many i think said dodson ha ha ha then both the partners laughed together pleasantly and cheerfully as men who are going to receive money often do we shall make mr pickwick pay for peeping said fogg with considerable native humour as he unfolded his papers the amount of the taxed costs is one hundred and thirty three six four mr perker there was a great comparing of papers and turning over of leaves by fogg and perker after this statement of profit and loss meanwhile dodson said in an affable manner to mr pickwick i don't think you are looking quite so stout as when i had the pleasure of seeing you last mr pickwick possibly not sir replied mr pickwick who had been flashing forth looks of fierce indignation without producing the smallest effect on either of the sharp practitioners i believe i am not sir i have been persecuted and annoyed by scoundrels of late sir perker coughed violently and asked mr pickwick whether he wouldn't like to look at the morning paper to which inquiry mr pickwick returned a most decided negative true said dodson i dare say you have been annoyed in the fleet there are some odd gentry there whereabouts were your apartments mr pickwick my one room replied that much injured gentleman was on the coffee room flight oh indeed said dodson i believe that is a very pleasant part of the establishment very replied mr pickwick dryly there was a coolness about all this which to a gentleman of an excitable temperament had under the circumstances rather an exasperating tendency mr pickwick restrained his wrath by gigantic efforts but when perker wrote a cheque for the whole amount and fogg deposited it in a small pocket book with a triumphant smile playing over his pimply features which communicated itself likewise to the stern countenance of dodson he felt the blood in his cheeks tingling with indignation now mr dodson said fogg putting up the pocket book and drawing on his gloves i am at your service very good said dodson rising i am quite ready i am very happy said fogg softened by the cheque to have had the pleasure of making mr pickwick's acquaintance i hope you don't think quite so ill of us mr pickwick as when we first had the pleasure of seeing you i hope not said dodson with the high tone of calumniated virtue mr pickwick now knows us better i trust whatever your opinion of gentlemen of our profession may be i beg to assure you sir that i bear no ill will or vindictive feeling towards you for the sentiments you thought proper to express in our office in freeman's court cornhill on the occasion to which my partner has referred oh no no nor i said fogg in a most forgiving manner our conduct sir said dodson will speak for itself and justify itself i hope upon every occasion we have been in the profession some years mr pickwick and have been honoured with the confidence of many excellent clients i wish you good morning sir good morning mr pickwick said fogg so saying he put his umbrella under his arm drew off his right glove and extended the hand of reconciliation to that most indignant gentleman who thereupon thrust his hands beneath his coat tails and eyed the attorney with looks of scornful amazement lowten cried perker at this moment open the door wait one instant said mr pickwick perker i will speak my dear sir pray let the matter rest where it is said the little attorney who had been in a state of nervous apprehension during the whole interview mr pickwick i beg i will not be put down sir replied mr pickwick hastily mr dodson you have addressed some remarks to me dodson turned round bent his head meekly and smiled some remarks to me repeated mr pickwick almost breathless and your partner has tendered me his hand and you have both assumed a tone of forgiveness and high mindedness which is an extent of impudence that i was not prepared for even in you what sir exclaimed dodson what sir reiterated fogg do you know that i have been the victim of your plots and conspiracies continued mr pickwick do you know that i am the man whom you have been imprisoning and robbing do you know that you were the attorneys for the plaintiff in bardell and pickwick yes sir we do know it replied dodson of course we know it sir rejoined fogg slapping his pocket perhaps by accident i see that you recollect it with satisfaction said mr pickwick attempting to call up a sneer for the first time in his life and failing most signally in so doing although i have long been anxious to tell you in plain terms what my opinion of you is i should have let even this opportunity pass in deference to my friend perker's wishes but for the unwarrantable tone you have assumed and your insolent familiarity i say insolent familiarity sir said mr pickwick turning upon fogg with a fierceness of gesture which caused that person to retreat towards the door with great expedition take care sir said dodson who though he was the biggest man of the party had prudently intrenched himself behind fogg and was speaking over his head with a very pale face let him assault you mr fogg don't return it on any account no no i won't return it said fogg falling back a little more as he spoke to the evident relief of his partner who by these means was gradually getting into the outer office you are continued mr pickwick resuming the thread of his discourse you are a well matched pair of mean rascally pettifogging robbers well interposed perker is that all it is all summed up in that rejoined mr pickwick they are mean rascally pettifogging robbers there said perker in a most conciliatory tone my dear sirs he has said all he has to say now pray go lowten is that door open mr lowten with a distant giggle replied in the affirmative there there good morning good morning now pray my dear sirs mr lowten the door cried the little man pushing dodson and fogg nothing loath out of the office this way my dear sirs now pray don't prolong this dear me mr lowten the door sir why don't you attend if there's law in england sir said dodson looking towards mr pickwick as he put on his hat you shall smart for this you are a couple of mean remember sir you pay dearly for this said fogg rascally pettifogging robbers continued mr pickwick taking not the least notice of the threats that were addressed to him robbers cried mr pickwick running to the stair head as the two attorneys descended robbers shouted mr pickwick breaking from lowten and perker and thrusting his head out of the staircase window when mr pickwick drew in his head again his countenance was smiling and placid and walking quietly back into the office he declared that he had now removed a great weight from his mind and that he felt perfectly comfortable and happy perker said nothing at all until he had emptied his snuff box and sent lowten out to fill it when he was seized with a fit of laughing which lasted five minutes at the expiration of which time he said that he supposed he ought to be very angry but he couldn't think of the business seriously yet when he could he would be well now said mr pickwick let me have a settlement with you of the same kind as the last inquired perker with another laugh not exactly rejoined mr pickwick drawing out his pocket book and shaking the little man heartily by the hand i only mean a pecuniary settlement you have done me many acts of kindness that i can never repay and have no wish to repay for i prefer continuing the obligation with this preface the two friends dived into some very complicated accounts and vouchers which having been duly displayed and gone through by perker were at once discharged by mr pickwick with many professions of esteem and friendship they had no sooner arrived at this point than a most violent and startling knocking was heard at the door it was not an ordinary double knock but a constant and uninterrupted succession of the loudest single raps as if the knocker were endowed with the perpetual motion or the person outside had forgotten to leave off dear me what's that exclaimed perker starting i think it is a knock at the door said mr pickwick as if there could be the smallest doubt of the fact the knocker made a more energetic reply than words could have yielded for it continued to hammer with surprising force and noise without a moment's cessation dear me said perker ringing the bell we shall alarm the inn mr lowten don't you hear a knock i'll answer the door in one moment sir replied the clerk the knocker appeared to hear the response and to assert that it was quite impossible he could wait so long it made a stupendous uproar it's quite dreadful said mr pickwick stopping his ears make haste mr lowten perker called out we shall have the panels beaten in mr lowten who was washing his hands in a dark closet hurried to the door and turning the handle beheld the appearance which is described in the next chapter chapter xxvi illustration containing some particulars relative to the double knock and other matters among which certain interesting disclosures relative to mr snodgrass and a young lady are by no means irrelevant to this history the object that presented itself to the eyes of the astonished clerk was a boy a wonderfully fat boy habited as a serving lad standing upright on the mat with his eyes closed as if in sleep he had never seen such a fat boy in or out of a travelling caravan and this coupled with the calmness and repose of his appearance so very different from what was reasonably to have been expected of the inflictor of the knocks smote him with wonder what's the matter inquired the clerk the extraordinary boy replied not a word but he nodded once and seemed to the clerk's imagination to snore feebly where do you come from inquired the clerk the boy made no sign he breathed heavily but in all other respects was motionless the clerk repeated the question thrice and receiving no answer prepared to shut the door when the boy suddenly opened his eyes winked several times sneezed once and raised his hand as if to repeat the knocking finding the door open he stared about him with astonishment and at length fixed his eyes on mr lowten's face what the devil do you knock in that way for inquired the clerk angrily which way said the boy in a slow and sleepy voice why like forty hackney coachmen replied the clerk because master said i wasn't to leave off knocking till they opened the door for fear i should go to sleep said the boy well said the clerk what message have you brought he's down stairs rejoined the boy who master he wants to know whether you're at home mr lowten bethought himself at this juncture of looking out of the window seeing an open carriage with a hearty old gentleman in it looking up very anxiously he ventured to beckon him on which the old gentleman jumped out directly that's your master in the carriage i suppose said lowten the boy nodded all further inquiries were superseded by the appearance of old wardle who running up stairs and just recognising lowten passed at once into mr perker's room pickwick said the old gentleman your hand my boy why have i never heard until the day before yesterday of your suffering yourself to be cooped up in jail and why did you let him do it perker i couldn't help it my dear sir replied perker with a smile and a pinch of snuff you know how obstinate he is of course i do of course i do replied the old gentleman i am heartily glad to see him notwithstanding i will not lose sight of him again in a hurry with these words wardle shook mr pickwick's hand once more and having done the same by perker threw himself into an arm chair his jolly red face shining again with smiles and health well said wardle here are pretty goings on a pinch of your snuff perker my boy never were such times eh what do you mean inquired mr pickwick mean replied wardle why i think the girls are all running mad that's no news you'll say perhaps it's not but it's true for all that you have not come up to london of all places in the world to tell us that my dear sir have you inquired perker no not altogether replied wardle though it was the main cause of my coming how's arabella very well replied mr pickwick and will be delighted to see you i am sure black eyed little jilt replied wardle i had a great idea of marrying her myself one of these odd days but i am glad of it too very glad illustration his jolly red face shining with smiles and health how did the intelligence reach you asked mr pickwick oh it came to my girls of course replied wardle arabella wrote the day before yesterday to say she had made a stolen match without her husband's father's consent and so you had gone down to get it when his refusing it couldn't prevent the match and all the rest of it i thought it a very good time to say something serious to my girls so i said what a dreadful thing it was that children should marry without their parents' consent and so forth but bless your hearts i couldn't make the least impression upon them they thought it such a much more dreadful thing that there should have been a wedding without bridesmaids that i might as well have preached to joe himself here the old gentleman stopped to laugh and having done so to his heart's content presently resumed but this is not the best of it it seems this is only half the love making and plotting that have been going forward we have been walking on mines for the last six months and they're sprung at last what do you mean exclaimed mr pickwick turning pale no other secret marriage i hope no no replied old wardle not so bad as that no what then inquired mr pickwick am i interested in it shall i answer that question perker said wardle if you don't commit yourself by doing so my dear sir well then you are said wardle how asked mr pickwick anxiously in what way really replied wardle you're such a fiery sort of young fellow that i am almost afraid to tell you but however if perker will sit between us to prevent mischief i'll venture having closed the room door and fortified himself with another application to perker's snuff box the old gentleman proceeded with his great disclosure in these words the fact is that my daughter bella bella who married young trundle you know yes yes we know said mr pickwick impatiently don't alarm me at the very beginning my daughter bella emily having gone to bed with a headache after she had read arabella's letter to me sat herself down by my side the other evening and began to talk over this marriage affair 'well pa' she says 'what do you think of it' 'why my dear' i said 'i suppose it's all very well i hope it's for the best' i answered in this way because i was sitting before the fire at the time drinking my grog rather thoughtfully and i knew my throwing in an undecided word now and then would induce her to continue talking both my girls are pictures of their dear mother and as i grow old i like to sit with only them by me for their voices and looks carry me back to the happiest period of my life and make me for the moment as young as i used to be then though not quite so light hearted 'it's quite a marriage of affection pa' said bella after a short silence 'yes my dear' said i 'but such marriages do not always turn out the happiest' i question that mind interposed mr pickwick warmly very good responded wardle question anything you like when it's your turn to speak but don't interrupt me i beg your pardon said mr pickwick granted replied wardle 'i am sorry to hear you express your opinion against marriages of affection pa' said bella colouring a little 'i was wrong i ought not to have said so my dear either' said i patting her cheek as kindly as a rough old fellow like me could pat it 'for your mother's was one and so was yours' 'it's not that i meant pa' said bella 'the fact is pa i wanted to speak to you about emily' mr pickwick started what's the matter now inquired wardle stopping in his narrative nothing replied mr pickwick pray go on i never could spin out a story said wardle abruptly it must come out sooner or later and it'll save us all a great deal of time if it comes at once the long and the short of it is then that bella at last mustered up courage to tell me that emily was very unhappy that she and your young friend snodgrass had been in constant correspondence and communication ever since last christmas that she had very dutifully made up her mind to run away with him in laudable imitation of her old friend and schoolfellow but that having some compunctions of conscience on the subject inasmuch as i had always been rather kindly disposed to both of them they had thought it better in the first instance to pay me the compliment of asking whether i would have any objection to their being married in the usual matter of fact manner there now mr pickwick if you can make it convenient to reduce your eyes to their usual size again and to let me hear what you think we ought to do i shall feel rather obliged to you the testy manner in which the hearty old gentleman uttered this last sentence was not wholly unwarranted for mr pickwick's face had settled down into an expression of blank amazement and perplexity quite curious to behold snodgrass since last christmas were the first broken words that issued from the lips of the confounded gentleman since last christmas replied wardle that's plain enough and very bad spectacles we must have worn not to have discovered it before i don't understand it said mr pickwick ruminating i really cannot understand it it's easy enough to understand replied the choleric old gentleman if you had been a younger man you would have been in the secret long ago and besides added wardle after a moment's hesitation the truth is that knowing nothing of this matter i have rather pressed emily for four or five months past to receive favourably if she could i would never attempt to force a girl's inclinations the addresses of a young gentleman down in our neighbourhood i have no doubt that girl like to enhance her own value and increase the ardour of mr snodgrass she has represented this matter in very glowing colours and that they have both arrived at the conclusion that they are a terribly persecuted pair of unfortunates and have no resource but clandestine matrimony or charcoal now the question is what's to be done what have you done inquired mr pickwick i i mean what did you do when your married daughter told you this oh i made a fool of myself of course rejoined wardle just so interposed perker who had accompanied this dialogue with sundry twitchings of his watch chain vindictive rubbings of his nose and other symptoms of impatience that's very natural but how i went into a great passion and frightened my mother into a fit said wardle that was judicious remarked perker and what else i fretted and fumed all next day and raised a great disturbance rejoined the old gentleman at last i got tired of rendering myself unpleasant and making everybody miserable so i hired a carriage at muggleton and putting my own horses in it came up to town under pretence of bringing emily to see arabella miss wardle is with you then said mr pickwick to be sure she is replied wardle she is at osborne's hotel in the adelphi at this moment unless your enterprising friend has run away with her since i came out this morning you are reconciled then said perker not a bit of it answered wardle she has been crying and moping ever since except last night between tea and supper when she made a great parade of writing a letter that i pretended to take no notice of you want my advice in this matter i suppose said perker looking from the musing face of mr pickwick to the eager countenance of wardle and taking several consecutive pinches of his favourite stimulant i suppose so said wardle looking at mr pickwick certainly replied that gentleman well then said perker rising and pushing his chair back my advice is that you both walk away together or ride away or get away by some means or other for i'm tired of you and just talk this matter over between you if you have not settled it by the next time i see you i'll tell you what to do this is satisfactory said wardle hardly knowing whether to smile or be offended pooh pooh my dear sir returned perker i know you both a great deal better than you know yourselves you have settled it already to all intents and purposes thus expressing himself the little gentleman poked his snuff box first into the chest of mr pickwick and then into the waistcoat of mr wardle upon which they all three laughed but especially the two last named gentlemen who at once shook hands again without any obvious or particular reason you dine with me to day said wardle to perker as he showed them out can't promise my dear sir can't promise replied perker i'll look in in the evening at all events i shall expect you at five said wardle now joe and joe having been at length awakened the two friends departed in mr wardle's carriage which in common humanity had a dickey behind for the fat boy who if there had been a foot board instead would have rolled off and killed himself in his very first nap driving to the george and vulture they found that arabella and her maid had sent for a hackney coach immediately on the receipt of a short note from emily announcing her arrival in town and had proceeded straight to the adelphi as wardle had business to transact in the city they sent the carriage and the fat boy to his hotel with the information that he and mr pickwick would return together for dinner at five o'clock charged with this message the fat boy returned slumbering as peaceably in his dickey over the stones as if it had been a down bed on watch springs by some extraordinary miracle he awoke of his own accord when the coach stopped and giving himself a good shake to stir up his faculties went up stairs to execute his commission now whether the shake had jumbled the fat boy's faculties together instead of arranging them in proper order or had roused such a quantity of new ideas within him as to render him oblivious of ordinary forms and ceremonies or which is also possible had proved unsuccessful in preventing his falling asleep as he ascended the stairs it is an undoubted fact that he walked into the sitting room without previously knocking at the door and so beheld a gentleman with his arms clasping his young mistress's waist sitting very lovingly by her side on a sofa while arabella and her pretty handmaid feigned to be absorbed in looking out of a window at the other end of the room at sight of this phenomenon the fat boy uttered an interjection the ladies a scream and the gentleman an oath almost simultaneously wretched creature what do you want here said the gentleman who it is needless to say was mr snodgrass to this the fat boy considerably terrified briefly responded missis what do you want me for inquired emily turning her head aside you stupid creature master and mr pickwick is a going to dine here at five replied the fat boy leave the room said mr snodgrass glaring upon the bewildered youth no no no added emily hastily bella dear advise me upon this emily and mr snodgrass and arabella and mary crowded into a corner and conversed earnestly in whispers for some minutes during which the fat boy dozed joe said arabella at length looking round with a most bewitching smile how do you do joe joe said emily you're a very good boy i won't forget you joe joe said mr snodgrass advancing to the astonished youth and seizing his hand i didn't know you before there's five shillings for you joe i'll owe you five said arabella for old acquaintance' sake you know and another most captivating smile was bestowed upon the corpulent intruder the fat boy's perception being slow he looked rather puzzled at first to account for this sudden prepossession in his favour and stared about him in a very alarming manner at length his broad face began to show symptoms of a grin of proportionately broad dimensions and then thrusting half a crown into each of his pockets and a hand and wrist after it he burst into a hoarse laugh being for the first and only time in his existence he understands us i see said arabella he had better have something to eat immediately remarked emily the fat boy almost laughed again when he heard this suggestion mary after a little more whispering tripped forth from the group and said i am going to dine with you to day sir if you have no objection this way said the fat boy eagerly there is such a jolly meat pie with these words the fat boy led the way down stairs his pretty companion captivating all the waiters and angering all the chambermaids as she followed him to the eating room there was the meat pie of which the youth had spoken so feelingly and there were moreover a steak and a dish of potatoes and a pot of porter sit down said the fat boy oh my eye how prime i am so hungry having apostrophised his eye in a species of rapture five or six times the youth took the head of the little table and mary seated herself at the bottom will you have some of this said the fat boy plunging into the pie up to the very ferrules of the knife and fork a little if you please replied mary the fat boy assisted mary to a little and himself to a great deal and was just going to begin eating when he suddenly laid down his knife and fork leant forward in his chair and letting his hands with the knife and fork in them fall on his knees said very slowly i say how nice you look this was said in an admiring manner and was so far gratifying but still there was enough of the cannibal in the young gentleman's eyes to render the compliment a double one dear me joseph said mary affecting to blush what do you mean the fat boy gradually recovering his former position replied with a heavy sigh and remaining thoughtful for a few moments drank a long draught of porter having achieved this feat he sighed again and applied himself assiduously to the pie what a nice young lady miss emily is said mary after a long silence the fat boy had by this time finished the pie he fixed his eyes on mary and replied i knows a nicerer indeed said mary yes indeed replied the fat boy with unwonted vivacity what's her name inquired mary what's yours mary so's hers said the fat boy you're her the boy grinned to add point to the compliment and put his eyes into something between a squint and a cast which there is reason to believe he intended for an ogle you mustn't talk to me in that way said mary you don't mean it don't i though replied the fat boy i say well are you going to come here regular no rejoined mary shaking her head i'm going away to night why oh said the fat boy in a tone of strong feeling how we should have enjoyed ourselves at meals if you had been i might come here sometimes perhaps to see you said mary plaiting the table cloth in assumed coyness if you would do me a favour the fat boy looked from the pie dish to the steak as if he thought a favour must be in a manner connected with something to eat and then took out one of the half crowns and glanced at it nervously don't you understand me said mary looking slyly in his fat face again he looked at the half crown and said faintly no the ladies want you not to say anything to the old gentleman about the young gentleman having been up stairs and i want you too is that all said the fat boy evidently very much relieved as he pocketed the half crown again of course i ain't a going to you see said mary mr snodgrass is very fond of miss emily and miss emily's very fond of him and if you were to tell about it the old gentleman would carry you all away miles into the country where you'd see nobody no no i won't tell said the fat boy stoutly that's a dear said mary now it's time i went up stairs and got my lady ready for dinner don't go yet urged the fat boy i must replied mary good bye for the present the fat boy with elephantine playfulness stretched out his arms to ravish a kiss but as it required no great agility to elude him his fair enslaver had vanished before he closed them again upon which the apathetic youth ate a pound or so of steak with a sentimental countenance and fell fast asleep there was so much to say up stairs and there were so many plans to concert for elopement and matrimony in the event of old wardle continuing to be cruel that it wanted only half an hour of dinner when mr snodgrass took his final adieu the ladies ran to emily's bedroom to dress and the lover taking up his hat walked out of the room he had scarcely got outside the door when he heard wardle's voice talking loudly and looking over the banisters beheld him followed by some other gentlemen coming straight up stairs knowing nothing of the house mr snodgrass in his confusion stepped hastily back into the room he had just quitted and passing from thence into an inner apartment mr wardle's bed chamber closed the door softly just as the persons he had caught a glimpse of entered the sitting room these were mr wardle mr pickwick mr nathaniel winkle and mr benjamin allen whom he had no difficulty in recognising by their voices very lucky i had the presence of mind to avoid them thought mr snodgrass with a smile and walking on tiptoe to another door near the bedside this opens into the same passage and i can walk quietly and comfortably away there was only one obstacle to his walking quietly and comfortably away which was that the door was locked and the key gone let us have some of your best wine to day waiter said old wardle rubbing his hands you shall have some of the very best sir replied the waiter let the ladies know we have come in yes sir devoutly and ardently did mr snodgrass wish that the ladies could know he had come in he ventured once to whisper waiter through the keyhole but as the probability of the wrong waiter coming to his relief flashed upon his mind together with a sense of the strong resemblance between his own situation and that in which another gentleman had been recently found in a neighbouring hotel an account of whose misfortunes had appeared under the head of police in that morning's paper he sat himself on a portmanteau and trembled violently we won't wait a minute for perker said wardle looking at his watch he is always exact he will be here in time if he means to come and if he does not it's of no use waiting ha arabella my sister exclaimed mr benjamin allen folding her in a most romantic embrace oh ben dear how you do smell of tobacco said arabella rather overcome by this mark of affection do i said mr benjamin allen do i bella well perhaps i do perhaps he did having just left a pleasant little smoking party of twelve medical students in a small back parlour with a large fire but i am delighted to see you said mr ben allen bless you bella there said arabella bending forward to kiss her brother don't take hold of me again ben dear because you tumble me so at this point of the reconciliation mr ben allen allowed his feelings and the cigars and porter to overcome him and looked round upon the beholders with damp spectacles is nothing to be said to me cried wardle with open arms a great deal whispered arabella as she received the old gentleman's hearty caress and congratulation you are a hard hearted unfeeling cruel monster you are a little rebel replied wardle in the same tone and i am afraid i shall be obliged to forbid you the house people like you who get married in spite of everybody ought not to be let loose on society but come added the old gentleman aloud here's the dinner you shall sit by me joe why damn the boy he's awake to the great distress of his master the fat boy was indeed in a state of remarkable vigilance his eyes being wide open and looking as if they intended to remain so there was an alacrity in his manner too which was equally unaccountable every time his eyes met those of emily or arabella he smirked and grinned once wardle could have sworn he saw him wink this alteration in the fat boy's demeanour originated in his increased sense of his own importance and the dignity he acquired from having been taken into the confidence of the young ladies and the smirks and grins and winks were so many condescending assurances that they might depend upon his fidelity as these tokens were rather calculated to awaken suspicion than to allay it and were somewhat embarrassing besides they were occasionally answered by a frown or shake of the head from arabella which the fat boy considering as hints to be on his guard expressed his perfect understanding of by smirking grinning and winking with redoubled assiduity joe said mr wardle after an unsuccessful search in all his pockets is my snuff box on the sofa no sir replied the fat boy oh i recollect i left it on my dressing table this morning said wardle run into the next room and fetch it the fat boy went into the next room and having been absent about a minute returned with the snuff box and the palest face that ever a fat boy wore what's the matter with the boy exclaimed wardle nothen's the matter with me replied joe nervously have you been seeing any spirits inquired the old gentleman or taking any added ben allen i think you're right whispered wardle across the table he is intoxicated i'm sure ben allen replied that he thought he was and as that gentleman had seen a vast deal of the disease in question wardle was confirmed in an impression which had been hovering about his mind for half an hour and at once arrived at the conclusion that the fat boy was drunk just keep your eye upon him for a few minutes murmured wardle we shall soon find out whether he is or not the unfortunate youth had only interchanged a dozen words with mr snodgrass that gentleman having implored him to make a private appeal to some friend to release him and then pushed him out with the snuff box lest his prolonged absence should lead to a discovery he ruminated a little with a most disturbed expression of face and left the room in search of mary but mary had gone home after dressing her mistress and the fat boy came back again more disturbed than before wardle and mr ben allen exchanged glances joe said wardle yes sir what did you go away for the fat boy looked hopelessly in the face of everybody at table and stammered out that he didn't know oh said wardle you don't know eh take this cheese to mr pickwick now mr pickwick being in the very best health and spirits had been making himself perfectly delightful all dinner time and was at this moment engaged in an energetic conversation with emily and mr winkle bowing his head courteously in the emphasis of his discourse gently waving his left hand to lend force to his observations and all glowing with placid smiles he took a piece of cheese from the plate and was on the point of turning round to renew the conversation when the fat boy stooping so as to bring his head on a level with that of mr pickwick pointed with his thumb over his shoulder and made the most horrible and hideous face that was ever seen out of a christmas pantomime illustration pointed with his thumb over his shoulder dear me said mr pickwick starting what a very eh he stopped for the fat boy had drawn himself up and was or pretended to be fast asleep what's the matter inquired wardle this is such an extremely singular lad replied mr pickwick looking uneasily at the boy it seems an odd thing to say but upon my word i am afraid that at times he is a little deranged oh mr pickwick pray don't say so cried emily and arabella both at once i am not certain of course said mr pickwick amidst profound silence and looks of general dismay but his manner to me this moment was really very alarming oh ejaculated mr pickwick suddenly jumping up with a short scream i beg your pardon ladies but at that moment he ran some sharp instrument into my leg really he is not safe he's drunk roared old wardle passionately ring the bell call the waiters he's drunk i ain't said the fat boy falling on his knees as his master seized him by the collar i ain't drunk then you're mad that's worse call the waiters said the old gentleman i ain't mad i'm sensible rejoined the fat boy beginning to cry then what the devil do you run sharp instruments into mr pickwick's legs for inquired wardle angrily he wouldn't look at me replied the boy i wanted to speak to him what did you want to say asked half a dozen voices at once the fat boy gasped looked at the bedroom door gasped again and wiped two tears away with the knuckle of each of his forefingers what did you want to say demanded wardle shaking him stop said mr pickwick allow me what did you wish to communicate to me my poor boy i want to whisper to you replied the fat boy you want to bite his ear off i suppose said wardle don't come near him he's vicious ring the bell and let him be taken down stairs just as mr winkle caught the bell rope in his hand it was arrested by a general expression of astonishment the captive lover his face burning with confusion suddenly walked in from the bedroom and made a comprehensive bow to the company hallo cried wardle releasing the fat boy's collar and staggering back what's this i have been concealed in the next room sir since you returned explained mr snodgrass emily my girl said wardle reproachfully i detest meanness and deceit this is unjustifiable and indelicate in the highest degree i don't deserve this at your hands emily indeed dear papa said emily arabella knows everybody here knows joe knows that i was no party to this concealment augustus for heaven's sake explain it mr snodgrass who had only waited for a hearing at once recounted how he had been placed in his then distressing predicament how the fear of giving rise to domestic dissensions had alone prompted him to avoid mr wardle on his entrance how he merely meant to depart by another door but finding it locked had been compelled to stay against his will it was a painful situation to be placed in but he now regretted it the less inasmuch as it afforded him an opportunity of acknowledging before their mutual friends that he loved mr wardle's daughter deeply and sincerely that he was proud to avow that the feeling was mutual and that if thousands of miles were placed between them or oceans rolled their waters he could never for an instant forget those happy days when first and so on having delivered himself to this effect mr snodgrass bowed again looked into the crown of his hat and stepped towards the door stop shouted wardle why in the name of all that's inflammable mildly suggested mr pickwick who thought something worse was coming well that's inflammable said wardle adopting the substitute couldn't you say all this to me in the first instance or confide in me added mr pickwick dear dear said arabella taking up the defence what is the use of asking all that now especially when you know you had set your covetous old heart on a richer son in law and are so wild and fierce besides that everybody is afraid of you except me shake hands with him and order him some dinner for goodness gracious sake for he looks half starved and pray have your wine up at once for you'll not be tolerable until you have taken two bottles at least the worthy old gentleman pulled arabella's ear kissed her without the smallest scruple kissed his daughter also with great affection and shook mr snodgrass warmly by the hand she is right on one point at all events said the old gentleman cheerfully ring for the wine the wine came and perker came up stairs at the same moment mr snodgrass had dinner at a side table and when he had despatched it drew his chair next emily without the smallest opposition on the old gentleman's part the evening was excellent little mr perker came out wonderfully told various comic stories and sang a serious song which was almost as funny as the anecdotes arabella was very charming mr wardle very jovial mr pickwick very harmonious mr ben allen very uproarious the lovers very silent mr winkle very talkative and all of them very happy

very seriously too then i'll tell you wot it is said mr weller after a short meditation this is a case for that 'ere confidential pal o' the chancellorship's pell must look into this sammy he's the man for a difficult question at law ve'll have this here brought afore the solvent court directly samivel i never did see such a addle headed old creetur exclaimed sam irritably old baileys and solvent courts and alleybis and ev'ry species o' gammon alvays a runnin' through his brain you'd better get your out o' door clothes on and come to town about this bisness than stand a preachin' there about wot you don't understand nothin' on wery good sammy replied mr weller i'm quite agreeable to anythin' as vill hexpedite business sammy but mind this here my boy nobody but pell nobody but pell as a legal adwiser i don't want anybody else replied sam now are you a comin' vait a minute sammy replied mr weller who having tied his shawl with the aid of a small glass that hung in the window was now by dint of the most wonderful exertions struggling into his upper garments vait a minit sammy ven you grow as old as your father you von't get into your veskit quite as easy as you do now my boy if i couldn't get into it easier than that i'm blessed if i'd vear vun at all rejoined his son you think so now said mr weller with the gravity of age but you'll find that as you get vider you'll get viser vidth and visdom sammy alvays grows together as mr weller delivered this infallible maxim the result of many years' personal experience and observation he contrived by a dexterous twist of his body to get the bottom button of his coat to perform its office having paused a few seconds to recover breath he brushed his hat with his elbow and declared himself ready as four heads is better than two sammy said mr weller as they drove along the london road in the chaise cart and as all this here property is a wery great temptation to a legal gen'l'm'n ve'll take a couple o' friends o' mine vith us as'll be wery soon down upon him if he comes anythin' irreg'lar two o' them as saw you to the fleet that day they're the wery best judges added mr weller in a half whisper the wery best judges of a horse you ever know'd and of a lawyer too inquired sam the man as can form a ackerate judgment of a animal can form a ackerate judgment of anythin' replied his father so dogmatically that sam did not attempt to controvert the position in pursuance of this notable resolution the services of the mottled faced gentleman and of two other very fat coachmen selected by mr weller probably with a view to their width and consequent wisdom were put into requisition and this assistance having been secured the party proceeded to the public home in portugal street whence a messenger was despatched to the insolvent court over the way requiring mr solomon pell's immediate attendance illustration a cold collation of an abernethy biscuit and a saveloy the messenger fortunately found mr solomon pell in court regaling himself business being rather slack with a cold collation of an abernethy biscuit and a saveloy the message was no sooner whispered in his ear than he thrust them in his pocket among various professional documents and hurried over the way with such alacrity that he reached the parlour before the messenger had even emancipated himself from the court gentlemen said mr pell touching his hat my service to you all i don't say it to flatter you gentlemen but there are not five other men in the world that i'd have come out of that court for to day so busy eh said sam busy replied pell i'm completely sewn up as my friend the late lord chancellor many a time used to say to me gentlemen when he came out from hearing appeals in the house of lords poor fellow he was very susceptible of fatigue he used to feel those appeals uncommonly i actually thought more than once that he'd have sunk under 'em i did indeed here mr pell shook his head and paused on which the elder mr weller nudging his neighbour as begging him to mark the attorney's high connections asked whether the duties in question produced any permanent ill effects on the constitution of his noble friend i don't think he ever quite recovered them replied pell in fact i'm sure he never did 'pell' he used to say to me many a time 'how the blazes you can stand the head work you do is a mystery to me' 'well' i used to answer 'i hardly know how i do it upon my life' 'pell' he'd add sighing and looking at me with a little envy friendly envy you know gentlemen mere friendly envy i never minded it 'pell you're a wonder a wonder' ah you'd have liked him very much if you had known him gentlemen bring me three penn'orth of rum my dear addressing this latter remark to the waitress in a tone of subdued grief mr pell sighed looked at his shoes and the ceiling and the rum having by that time arrived drunk it up however said pell drawing a chair to the table a professional man has no right to think of his private friendships when his legal assistance is wanted by the bye gentlemen since i saw you here before we have had to weep over a very melancholy occurrence mr pell drew out a pocket handkerchief when he came to the word weep but he made no further use of it than to wipe away a slight tinge of rum which hung upon his upper lip i saw it in the advertiser mr weller continued pell bless my soul not more than fifty two dear me only think these indications of a musing spirit were addressed to the mottled faced man whose eyes mr pell had accidentally caught on which the mottled faced man whose apprehension of matters in general was of a foggy nature moved uneasily in his seat and opined that indeed so far as that went there was no saying how things was brought about which observation involving one of those subtle propositions which it is so difficult to encounter in argument was controverted by nobody i have heard it remarked that she was a very fine woman mr weller said pell in a sympathising manner yes sir she wos replied the elder mr weller not much relishing this mode of discussing the subject and yet thinking that the attorney from his long intimacy with the late lord chancellor must know best on all matters of polite breeding she wos a wery fine 'ooman sir ven i first know'd her she wos a widder sir at that time now it's curious said pell looking round with a sorrowful smile mrs pell was a widow that's very extraordinary said the mottled faced man well it is a curious coincidence said pell not at all gruffly remarked the elder mr weller more widders is married than single wimin very good very good said pell you're quite right mr weller mrs pell was a very elegant and accomplished woman her manners were the theme of universal admiration in our neighbourhood i was proud to see that woman dance there was something so firm and dignified and yet natural in her motion her cutting gentlemen was simplicity itself ah well well excuse my asking the question mr samuel continued the attorney in a lower voice was your mother in law tall not wery replied sam mrs pell was a tall figure said pell a splendid woman with a noble shape and a nose gentlemen formed to command and be majestic she was very much attached to me very much highly connected too her mother's brother gentlemen failed for eight hundred pounds as a law stationer vell said mr weller who had grown rather restless during this discussion vith regard to bis'ness the word was music to pell's ears he had been revolving in his mind whether any business was to be transacted or whether he had been merely invited to partake of a glass of brandy and water or a bowl of punch or any similar professional compliment and now the doubt was set at rest without his appearing at all eager for its solution his eyes glistened as he laid his hat on the table and said what is the business upon which um either of these gentlemen wish to go through the court we require an arrest a friendly arrest will do you know we are all friends here i suppose give me the dockyment sammy said mr weller taking the will from his son who appeared to enjoy the interview amazingly wot we rekvire sir is a probe o' this here probate my dear sir probate said pell well sir replied mr weller sharply probe and probe it is wery much the same if you don't understand wot i mean sir i dessay i can find them as does no offence i hope mr weller said pell meekly you are the executor i see he added casting his eyes over the paper i am sir replied mr weller these other gentlemen i presume are legatees are they inquired pell with a congratulatory smile sammy is a leg at ease replied mr weller these other gen'l'm'n is friends o' mine just come to see fair a kind of umpires oh said pell very good i have no objections i'm sure i shall want a matter of five pound of you before i begin ha ha ha it being decided by the committee that the five pound might be advanced mr weller produced that sum after which a long consultation about nothing particular took place in the course whereof mr pell demonstrated to the perfect satisfaction of the gentlemen who saw fair that unless the management of the business had been entrusted to him it must all have gone wrong for reasons not clearly made out but no doubt sufficient this important point being dispatched mr pell refreshed himself with three chops and liquids both malt and spirituous at the expense of the estate and then they all went away to doctors' commons the next day there was another visit to doctors' commons and a great to do with an attesting hostler who being inebriated declined swearing anything but profane oaths to the great scandal of a proctor and surrogate next week there were more visits to doctors' commons and there was a visit to the legacy duty office besides and there were treaties entered into for the disposal of the lease and business and ratifications of the same and inventories to be made out and lunches to be taken and dinners to be eaten and so many profitable things to be done and such a mass of papers accumulated that mr solomon pell and the boy and the blue bag to boot all got so stout that scarcely anybody would have known them for the same man boy and bag that had loitered about portugal street a few days before at length all these weighty matters being arranged a day was fixed for selling out and transferring the stock and of waiting with that view upon wilkins flasher esq stock broker of somewhere near the bank who had been recommended by mr solomon pell for the purpose it was a kind of festive occasion and the parties were attired accordingly mr weller's tops were newly cleaned and his dress was arranged with peculiar care the mottled faced gentleman wore at his button hole a full sized dahlia with several leaves and the coats of his two friends were adorned with nosegays of laurel and other evergreens all three were habited in strict holiday costume that is to say they were wrapped up to the chins and wore as many clothes as possible which is and has been a stage coachman's idea of full dress ever since stage coaches were invented mr pell was waiting at the usual place of meeting at the appointed time even mr pell wore a pair of gloves and a clean shirt much frayed at the collar and wristbands by frequent washings a quarter to two said pell looking at the parlour clock if we are with mr flasher at a quarter past we shall just hit the best time what should you say to a drop o' beer gen'l'm'n suggested the mottled faced man and a little bit of cold beef said the second coachman or a oyster added the third who was a hoarse gentleman supported by very round legs hear hear said pell to congratulate mr weller on his coming into possession of his property eh ha ha i'm quite agreeable gen'l'm'n answered mr weller sammy pull the bell sam complied and the porter cold beef and oysters being promptly produced the lunch was done ample justice to where everybody took so active a part it is almost invidious to make a distinction but if one individual evinced greater powers than another it was the coachman with the hoarse voice who took an imperial pint of vinegar with his oysters without betraying the least emotion mr pell sir said the elder mr weller stirring a glass of brandy and water of which one was placed before every gentleman when the oyster shells were removed mr pell sir it wos my intention to have proposed the funs on this occasion but samivel has vispered to me here mr samuel weller who had silently eaten his oysters with tranquil smiles cried hear in a very loud voice has vispered to me resumed his father that it vould be better to dewote the liquor to vishin' you success and prosperity and thankin' you for the manner in which you've brought this here business through here's your health sir hold hard there interposed the mottled faced gentleman with sudden energy your eyes on me gen'l'm'n saying this the mottled faced gentleman rose as did the other gentlemen the mottled faced gentleman reviewed the company and slowly lifted his hand upon which every man including him of the mottled countenance drew a long breath and lifted his tumbler to his lips in one instant the mottled faced gentleman depressed his hand again and every glass was set down empty it is impossible to describe the thrilling effect produced by this striking ceremony at once dignified solemn and impressive it combined every element of grandeur well gentlemen said mr pell all i can say is that such marks of confidence must be very gratifying to a professional man i don't wish to say anything that might appear egotistical gentlemen but i'm very glad for your own sakes that you came to me that's all if you had gone to any low member of the profession it's my firm conviction and i assure you of it as a fact that you would have found yourselves in queer street before this i could have wished my noble friend had been alive to have seen my management of this case i don't say it out of pride but i think however gentlemen i won't trouble you with that i am generally to be found here gentlemen but if i'm not here or over the way that's my address you'll find my terms very cheap and reasonable and no man attends more to his clients than i do and i hope i know a little of my profession besides if you have any opportunity of recommending me to any of your friends gentlemen i shall be very much obliged to you and so will they too when they come to know me your healths gentlemen with this expression of his feelings mr solomon pell laid three small written cards before mr weller's friends and looking at the clock again feared it was time to be walking upon this hint mr weller settled the bill and issuing forth the executor legatee attorney and umpires directed their steps towards the city the office of wilkins flasher esquire of the stock exchange was in a first floor up a court behind the bank of england the house of wilkins flasher esquire was at brixton surrey the horse and stanhope of wilkins flasher esquire were at an adjacent livery stable the groom of wilkins flasher esquire was on his way to the west end to deliver some game the clerk of wilkins flasher esquire had gone to his dinner and wilkins flasher esquire himself cried come in when mr pell and his companions knocked at the counting house door good morning sir said pell bowing obsequiously we want to make a little transfer if you please oh come in will you said mr flasher sit down a minute i'll attend to you directly thank you sir said pell there's no hurry take a chair mr weller mr weller took a chair and sam took a box and the umpires took what they could get and looked at the almanack and one or two papers which were wafered against the wall with as much open eyed reverence as if they had been the finest efforts of the old masters well i'll bet you half a dozen of claret on it come said wilkins flasher esquire resuming the conversation to which mr pell's entrance had caused a momentary interruption this was addressed to a very smart young gentleman who wore his hat on his right whisker and was lounging over the desk killing flies with a ruler wilkins flasher esquire was balancing himself on two legs of an office stool spearing a wafer box with a pen knife which he dropped every now and then with great dexterity into the very centre of a small red wafer that was stuck outside both gentlemen had very open waistcoats and very rolling collars and very small boots and very big rings and very little watches and very large guard chains and symmetrical inexpressibles and scented pocket handkerchiefs i never bet half a dozen said the other gentleman i'll take a dozen done simmery done said wilkins flasher esquire p p mind observed the other of course replied wilkins flasher esquire wilkins flasher esquire entered it in a little book with a gold pencil case and the other gentleman entered it also in another little book with another gold pencil case i see there's a notice up this morning about boffer observed mr simmery poor devil he's expelled the house i'll bet you ten guineas to five he cuts his throat said wilkins flasher esquire stop i bar said wilkins flasher esquire thoughtfully perhaps he may hang himself very good rejoined mr simmery pulling out the gold pencil case again i've no objection to take you that way say makes away with himself kills himself in fact said wilkins flasher esquire just so replied mr simmery putting down 'flasher ten guineas to five boffer kills himself' within what time shall we say a fortnight suggested wilkins flasher esquire confound it no rejoined mr simmery stopping for an instant to smash a fly with the ruler say a week split the difference said wilkins flasher esquire make it ten days well ten days rejoined mr simmery so it was entered down in the little books that boffer was to kill himself within ten days or wilkins flasher esquire was to hand over to frank simmery esquire the sum of ten guineas and that if boffer did kill himself within that time frank simmery esquire would pay to wilkins flasher esquire five guineas instead i'm very sorry he has failed said wilkins flasher esquire capital dinners he gave fine port he had too remarked mr simmery we are going to send our butler to the sale to morrow to pick up some of that sixty four the devil you are said wilkins flasher esquire my man's going too five guineas my man outbids your man done another entry was made in the little books with the gold pencil cases and mr simmery having by this time killed all the flies and taken all the bets strolled away to the stock exchange to see what was going forward wilkins flasher esquire now condescended to receive mr solomon's pell's instructions and having filled up some printed forms requested the party to follow him to the bank which they did mr weller and his three friends staring at all they beheld in unbounded astonishment and sam encountering everything with a coolness which nothing could disturb crossing a court yard which was all noise and bustle and passing a couple of porters who seemed dressed to match the red fire engine which was wheeled away into a corner they passed into an office where their business was to be transacted and where pell and mr flasher left them standing for a few moments while they went upstairs into the will office wot place is this here whispered the mottled faced gentleman to the elder mr weller counsel's office replied the executor in a whisper wot are them gen'l'men a settin' behind the counters asked the hoarse coachman reduced counsels i s'pose replied mr weller ain't they the reduced counsels samivel vy you don't suppose the reduced counsels is alive do you inquired sam with some disdain how should i know retorted mr weller i thought they looked wery like it wot are they then clerks replied sam wot are they all a eatin' ham sangwidges for inquired his father 'cos it's their dooty i suppose replied sam it's a part o' the system they're always a doin' it here all day long mr weller and his friends had scarcely had a moment to reflect upon this singular regulation as connected with the monetary system of the country when they were rejoined by pell and wilkins flasher esquire who led them to a part of the counter above which was a round black board with a large w on it wot's that for sir inquired mr weller directing pell's attention to the target in question the first letter of the name of the deceased replied pell i say said mr weller turning round to the umpires there's somethin' wrong here we's our letter this won't do the referees at once gave it as their decided opinion that the business could not be legally proceeded with under the letter w and in all probability it would have stood over for one day at least had it not been for the prompt though at first sight undutiful behaviour of sam who seizing his father by the skirt of the coat dragged him to the counter and pinned him there until he had affixed his signature to a couple of instruments which from mr weller's habit of printing was a work of so much labour and time that the officiating clerk peeled and ate three ribston pippins while it was performing as the elder mr weller insisted on selling out his portion forthwith they proceeded from the bank to the gate of the stock exchange to which wilkins flasher esquire after a short absence returned with a cheque on smith payne and smith for five hundred and thirty pounds that being the sum of money to which mr weller at the market price of the day was entitled in consideration of the balance of the second mrs weller's funded savings sam's two hundred pounds stood transferred to his name and wilkins flasher esquire having been paid his commission dropped the money carelessly into his coat pocket and lounged back to his office mr weller was at first obstinately determined on cashing the cheque in nothing but sovereigns but it being represented by the umpires that by so doing he must incur the expense of a small sack to carry them home in he consented to receive the amount in five pound notes my son said mr weller as they came out of the banking house my son and me has a wery particular engagement this arternoon and i should like to have this here bis'ness settled out of hand so let's jest go straight avay someveres vere ve can hordit the accounts a quiet room was soon found and the accounts were produced and audited mr pell's bill was taxed by sam and some charges were disallowed by the umpires but notwithstanding mr pell's declaration accompanied with many solemn asseverations that they were really too hard upon him it was by very many degrees the best professional job he had ever had and one on which he boarded lodged and washed for six months afterwards the umpires having partaken of a dram shook hands and departed as they had to drive out of town that night mr solomon pell finding that nothing more was going forward either in the eating or drinking way took a friendly leave and sam and his father were left alone there said mr weller thrusting his pocket book in his side pocket vith the bills for the lease and that there's eleven hundred and eighty pound here now samivel my boy turn the horses' heads to the george and wulter chapter xxviii illustration an important conference takes place between mr pickwick and samuel weller at which his parent assists an old gentleman in a snuff coloured suit arrives unexpectedly mr pickwick was sitting alone musing over many things and thinking among other considerations how he could best provide for the young couple whose present unsettled condition was matter of constant regret and anxiety to him when mary stepped lightly into the room and advancing to the table said rather hastily oh if you please sir samuel is down stairs and he says may his father see you surely replied mr pickwick thank you sir said mary tripping towards the door again sam has not been here long has he inquired mr pickwick oh no sir replied mary eagerly he has only just come home he is not going to ask you for any more leave sir he says mary might have been conscious that she had communicated this last intelligence with more warmth than seemed actually necessary or she might have observed the good humoured smile with which mr pickwick regarded her when she had finished speaking she certainly held down her head and examined the corner of a very smart little apron with more closeness than there appeared any absolute occasion for tell them they can come up at once by all means said mr pickwick mary apparently much relieved hurried away with her message mr pickwick took two or three turns up and down the room and rubbing his chin with his left hand as he did so appeared lost in thought well well said mr pickwick at length in a kind but somewhat melancholy tone it is the best way in which i could reward him for his attachment and fidelity let it be so in heaven's name it is the fate of a lonely old man that those about him should form new and different attachments and leave him i have no right to expect that it should be otherwise with me no no added mr pickwick more cheerfully it would be selfish and ungrateful i ought to be happy to have an opportunity of providing for him so well i am of course i am mr pickwick had been so absorbed in these reflections that a knock at the door was three or four times repeated before he heard it hastily seating himself and calling up his accustomed pleasant looks he gave the required permission and sam weller entered followed by his father glad to see you back again sam said mr pickwick how do you do mr weller wery hearty thankee sir replied the widower hope i see you well sir quite i thank you replied mr pickwick i wanted to have a little bit o' conwersation with you sir said mr weller if you could spare me five minits or so sir certainly replied mr pickwick sam give your father a chair thankee samivel i've got a cheer here said mr weller bringing one forward as he spoke uncommon fine day it's been sir added the old gentleman laying his hat on the floor as he sat himself down remarkably so indeed replied mr pickwick very seasonable seasonablest veather i ever see sir rejoined mr weller here the old gentleman was seized with a violent fit of coughing which being terminated he nodded his head and winked and made several supplicatory and threatening gestures to his son all of which sam weller steadily abstained from seeing mr pickwick perceiving that there was some embarrassment on the old gentleman's part affected to be engaged in cutting the leaves of a book that lay beside him and waited patiently until mr weller should arrive at the object of his visit i never see sich a aggerawatin' boy as you are samivel said mr weller looking indignantly at his son never in all my born days what is he doing mr weller inquired mr pickwick he von't begin sir rejoined mr weller he knows i ain't ekal to ex pressin' myself ven there's anythin' partickler to be done and yet he'll stand and see me a settin' here takin' up your walable time and makin' a reg'lar spectacle o' myself rayther than help me out vith a syllable it ain't filial conduct samivel said mr weller wiping his forehead wery far from it you said you'd speak replied sam how should i know you wos done up at the wery beginnin' you might ha' seen i warn't able to start rejoined his father i'm on the wrong side of the road and backin' into the palin's and all manner of unpleasantness and yet you von't put out a hand to help me i'm ashamed on you samivel the fact is sir said sam with a slight bow the gov'ner's been a drawin' his money wery good samivel wery good said mr weller nodding his head with a satisfied air i didn't mean to speak harsh to you sammy wery good that's the vay to begin come to the pint at once wery good indeed samivel mr weller nodded his head an extraordinary number of times in the excess of his gratification and waited in a listening attitude for sam to resume his statement you may sit down sam said mr pickwick apprehending that the interview was likely to prove rather longer than he had expected sam bowed again and sat down his father looking round he continued the gov'ner sir has drawn out five hundred and thirty pound reduced counsels interposed mr weller senior in an undertone it don't much matter vether it's reduced counsels or wot not said sam five hundred and thirty pound is the sum ain't it all right samivel replied mr weller to vich sum he has added for the house and bis'ness lease good vill stock and fixters interposed mr weller as much as makes it continued sam altogether eleven hundred and eighty pound indeed said mr pickwick i am delighted to hear it i congratulate you mr weller on having done so well vait a minit sir said mr weller raising his hand in a deprecatory manner get on samivel this here money said sam with a little hesitation he's anxious to put someveres vere he knows it'll be safe and i'm wery anxious too for if he keeps it he'll go a lendin' it to somebody or inwestin' property in horses or droppin' his pocket book down a airy or makin' a egyptian mummy of his self in some vay or another wery good samivel observed mr weller in as complacent a manner as if sam had been passing the highest eulogiums on his prudence and foresight wery good for vich reasons continued sam plucking nervously at the brim of his hat for vich reasons he's drawed it out to day and come here vith me to say leastvays to offer or in other vords to to say this here said the elder mr weller impatiently that it ain't no use to me i'm a goin' to vork a coach reg'lar and han't got noveres to keep it in unless i vos to pay the guard for takin' care on it or to put it in vun o' the coach pockets vich 'ud be a temptation to the insides if you'll take care on it for me sir i shall be wery much obliged to you p'raps said mr weller walking up to mr pickwick and whispering in his ear p'raps it'll go a little vay towards the expenses o' that 'ere conwiction all i say is just you keep it till i ask you for it again with these words mr weller placed the pocket book in mr pickwick's hands caught up his hat and ran out of the room with a celerity scarcely to be expected from so corpulent a subject stop him sam exclaimed mr pickwick earnestly overtake him bring him back instantly mr weller here come back sam saw that his master's injunctions were not to be disobeyed and catching his father by the arm as he was descending the stairs dragged him back by main force my good friend said mr pickwick taking the old man by the hand your honest confidence overpowers me i don't see no occasion for nothin' o' the kind sir replied mr weller obstinately i assure you my good friend i have more money than i can ever need far more than a man at my age can ever live to spend said mr pickwick no man knows how much he can spend till he tries observed mr weller perhaps not replied mr pickwick but as i have no intention of trying any such experiments i am not likely to come to want i must beg you to take this back mr weller wery well said mr weller with a discontented look mark my vords sammy i'll do something desperate vith this here property somethin' desperate you'd better not replied sam mr weller reflected for a short time and then buttoning up his coat with great determination said i'll keep a pike wot exclaimed sam a pike rejoined mr weller through his set teeth i'll keep a pike say good bye to your father samivel i devote the remainder o' my days to' a pike this threat was such an awful one and mr weller besides appearing fully resolved to carry it into execution seemed so deeply mortified by mr pickwick's refusal that that gentleman after a short reflection said well well mr weller i will keep the money i can do more good with it perhaps than you can just the wery thing to be sure said mr weller brightening up o' course you can sir say no more about it said mr pickwick locking the pocket book in his desk i am heartily obliged to you my good friend now sit down again i want to ask your advice the internal laughter occasioned by the triumphant success of his visit which had convulsed not only mr weller's face but his arms legs and body also during the locking up of the pocket book suddenly gave place to the most dignified gravity as he heard these words wait outside a few minutes sam will you said mr pickwick sam immediately withdrew mr weller looked uncommonly wise and very much amazed when mr pickwick opened the discourse by saying you are not an advocate for matrimony i think mr weller mr weller shook his head he was wholly unable to speak vague thoughts of some wicked widow having been successful in her designs on mr pickwick choked his utterance did you happen to see a young girl down stairs when you came in just now with your son inquired mr pickwick yes i see a young gal replied mr weller shortly what did you think of her now candidly mr weller what did you think of her i thought she wos wery plump and vell made said mr weller with a critical air so she is said mr pickwick so she is what did you think of her manners from what you saw of her wery pleasant rejoined mr weller wery pleasant and conformable the precise meaning which mr weller attached to this last mentioned adjective did not appear but as it was evident from the tone in which he used it that it was a favourable expression mr pickwick was as well satisfied as if he had been thoroughly enlightened on the subject i take a great interest in her mr weller said mr pickwick mr weller coughed i mean an interest in her doing well resumed mr pickwick a desire that she may be comfortable and prosperous you understand wery clearly replied mr weller who understood nothing yet that young person said mr pickwick is attached to your son to samivel veller exclaimed the parent yes said mr pickwick it's nat'ral said mr weller after some consideration nat'ral but rather alarmin' sammy must be careful how do you mean inquired mr pickwick wery careful that he don't say nothin' to her responded mr weller wery careful that he ain't led avay in a innocent moment to say anythink as may lead to a conwiction for breach you're never safe vith 'em mr pickwick ven they vunce has designs on you there's no knowin' vere to have 'em and vile you're a considering of it they have you i wos married fust that vay myself sir and sammy was the consekens o' the manoover you give me no great encouragement to conclude what i have to say observed mr pickwick but i had better do so at once this young person is not only attached to your son mr weller but your son is attached to her vell said mr weller this here's a pretty sort o' thing to come to a father's ears this is i have observed them on several occasions said mr pickwick making no comment on mr weller's last remark and entertain no doubt at all about it supposing i were desirous of establishing them comfortably as man and wife in some little business or situation where they might hope to obtain a decent living what should you think of it mr weller at first mr weller received with wry faces a proposition involving the marriage of anybody in whom he took an interest but as mr pickwick argued the point with him and laid great stress on the fact that mary was not a widow he gradually became more tractable mr pickwick had great influence over him and he had been much struck with mary's appearance having in fact bestowed several very unfatherly winks upon her already at length he said that it was not for him to oppose mr pickwick's inclination and that he would be very happy to yield to his advice upon which mr pickwick joyfully took him at his word and called sam back into the room sam said mr pickwick clearing his throat your father and i have been having some conversation about you about you samivel said mr weller in a patronising and impressive voice i am not so blind sam as not to have seen a long time since that you entertain something more than a friendly feeling towards mrs winkle's maid said mr pickwick you hear this samivel said mr weller in the same judicial form of speech as before i hope sir said sam addressing his master i hope there's no harm in a young man takin' notice of a young 'ooman as is undeniably good looking and well conducted certainly not said mr pickwick not by no means acquiesced mr weller affably but magisterially so far from thinking there is anything wrong in conduct so natural resumed mr pickwick it is my wish to assist and promote your wishes in this respect with this view i have had a little conversation with your father and finding that he is of my opinion the lady not bein' a widder interposed mr weller in explanation the lady not being a widow said mr pickwick smiling i wish to free you from the restraint which your present position imposes upon you and to mark my sense of your fidelity and many excellent qualities by enabling you to marry this girl at once and to earn an independent livelihood for yourself and family i shall be proud sam said mr pickwick whose voice had faltered a little hitherto but now resumed its customary tone proud and happy to make your future prospects in life my grateful and peculiar care there was a profound silence for a short time and then sam said in a low husky sort of voice but firmly withal i'm very much obliged to you for your goodness sir as is only like yourself but it can't be done can't be done ejaculated mr pickwick in astonishment samivel said mr weller with dignity i say it can't be done repeated sam in a louder key wot's to become of you sir my good fellow replied mr pickwick the recent changes among my friends will alter my mode of life in future entirely besides i am growing older and want repose and quiet my rambles sam are over how do i know that 'ere sir argued sam you think so now s'pose you wos to change your mind vich is not unlikely for you've the spirit o' five and tventy in you still what 'ud become on you vithout me it can't be done sir it can't be done wery good samivel there's a good deal in that said mr weller encouragingly i speak after long deliberation sam and with the certainty that i shall keep my word said mr pickwick shaking his head new scenes have closed upon me my rambles are at an end wery good rejoined sam then that's the wery best reason vy you should alvays have somebody by you as understands you to keep you up and make you comfortable if you vant a more polished sort o' feller vell and good have him but vages or no vages notice or no notice board or no board lodgin' or no lodgin' sam veller as you took from the old inn in the borough sticks by you come what come may and let ev'rythin' and ev'rybody do their wery fiercest nothin' shall ever perwent it at the close of this declaration which sam made with great emotion the elder mr weller rose from his chair and forgetting all considerations of time place or propriety waved his hat above his head and gave three vehement cheers my good fellow said mr pickwick when mr weller had sat down again rather abashed at his own enthusiasm you are bound to consider the young woman also i do consider the young 'ooman sir said sam i have considered the young 'ooman i've spoke to her i've told her how i'm sitivated she's ready to wait till i'm ready and i believe she vill if she don't she's not the young 'ooman i take her for and i give her up vith readiness you've know'd me afore sir my mind's made up and nothin' can ever alter it who could combat this resolution not mr pickwick he derived at that moment more pride and luxury of feeling from the disinterested attachment of his humble friends than ten thousand protestations from the greatest men living could have awakened in his heart while this conversation was passing in mr pickwick's room a little old gentleman in a suit of snuff coloured clothes followed by a porter carrying a small portmanteau presented himself below and after securing a bed for the night inquired of the waiter whether one mrs winkle was staying there to which question the waiter of course responded in the affirmative is she alone inquired the little old gentleman i believe she is sir replied the waiter i can call her own maid sir if you no i don't want her said the old gentleman quickly show me to her room without announcing me eh sir said the waiter are you deaf inquired the little old gentleman no sir then listen if you please can you hear me now yes sir that's well show me to mrs winkle's room without announcing me as the little old gentleman uttered this command he slipped five shillings into the waiter's hand and looked steadily at him really sir said the waiter i don't know sir whether ah you'll do it i see said the little old gentleman you had better do it at once it will save time there was something so very cool and collected in the gentleman's manner that the waiter put the five shillings in his pocket and led him up stairs without a word this is the room is it said the gentleman you may go illustration a little old gentleman in a suit of snuff coloured clothes the waiter complied wondering much who the gentleman could be and what he wanted the little old gentleman waiting till he was out of sight tapped at the door come in said arabella um a pretty voice at any rate murmured the little old gentleman but that's nothing as he said this he opened the door and walked in arabella who was sitting at work rose on beholding a stranger a little confused but by no means ungracefully so pray don't rise ma'am said the unknown walking in and closing the door after him mrs winkle i believe arabella inclined her head mrs nathaniel winkle who married the son of the old man at birmingham said the stranger eyeing arabella with visible curiosity again arabella inclined her head and looked uneasily round as if uncertain whether to call for assistance i surprise you i see ma'am said the old gentleman rather i confess replied arabella wondering more and more i'll take a chair if you'll allow me ma'am said the stranger he took one and drawing a spectacle case from his pocket leisurely pulled out a pair of spectacles which he adjusted on his nose you don't know me ma'am he said looking so intently at arabella that she began to feel alarmed no sir she replied timidly no said the gentleman nursing his left leg i don't know how you should you know my name though ma'am do i said arabella trembling though she scarcely knew why may i ask you what it is presently ma'am presently said the stranger not having yet removed his eyes from her countenance you have been recently married ma'am i have replied arabella in a scarcely audible tone laying aside her work and becoming greatly agitated as a thought that had occurred to her before struck more forcibly upon her mind without having represented to your husband the propriety of first consulting his father on whom he is dependent i think said the stranger arabella applied her handkerchief to her eyes without an endeavour even to ascertain by some indirect appeal what were the old man's sentiments on a point in which he would naturally feel much interested said the stranger i cannot deny it sir said arabella and without having sufficient property of your own to afford your husband any permanent assistance in exchange for the worldly advantages which you knew he would have gained if he had married agreeably to his father's wishes said the old gentleman this is what boys and girls call disinterested affection till they have boys and girls of their own and then they see it in a rougher and very different light arabella's tears flowed fast as she pleaded in extenuation that she was young and inexperienced that her attachment had alone induced her to take the step to which she had resorted and that she had been deprived of the counsel and guidance of her parents almost from infancy it was wrong said the old gentleman in a milder tone very wrong it was foolish romantic unbusiness like it was my fault all my fault sir replied poor arabella weeping nonsense said the old gentleman it was not your fault that he fell in love with you i suppose yes it was though said the old gentleman looking rather slyly at arabella it was your fault he couldn't help it this little compliment or the little gentleman's odd way of paying it or his altered manner so much kinder than it was at first or all three together forced a smile from arabella in the midst of her tears where's your husband inquired the old gentleman abruptly stopping a smile which was just coming over his own face i expect him every instant sir said arabella i persuaded him to take a walk this morning he is very low and wretched at not having heard from his father low is he said the old gentleman serve him right he feels it on my account i am afraid said arabella and indeed sir i feel it deeply on his i have been the sole means of bringing him to his present condition don't mind on his account my dear said the old gentleman it serves him right i am glad of it actually glad of it as far as he is concerned the words were scarcely out of the old gentleman's lips when footsteps were heard ascending the stairs which he and arabella seemed both to recognise at the same moment the little gentleman turned pale and making a strong effort to appear composed stood up as mr winkle entered the room father cried mr winkle recoiling in amazement yes sir replied the little old gentleman well sir what have you got to say to me mr winkle remained silent you are ashamed of yourself i hope sir said the old gentleman still mr winkle said nothing are you ashamed of yourself sir or are you not inquired the old gentleman no sir replied mr winkle drawing arabella's arm through his i am not ashamed of myself or of my wife either upon my word cried the old gentleman ironically i am very sorry to have done anything which has lessened your affection for me sir said mr winkle but i will say at the same time that i have no reason to be ashamed of having this lady for my wife nor you of having her for a daughter give me your hand nat said the old gentleman in an altered voice kiss me my love you are a very charming little daughter in law after all in a few minutes' time mr winkle went in search of mr pickwick and returning with that gentleman presented him to his father whereupon they shook hands for five minutes incessantly mr pickwick i thank you most heartily for all your kindness to my son said old mr winkle in a bluff straightforward way i am a hasty fellow and when i saw you last i was vexed and taken by surprise i have judged for myself now and am more than satisfied shall i make any more apologies mr pickwick not one replied that gentleman you have done the only thing wanting to complete my happiness hereupon there was another shaking of hands for five minutes longer accompanied by a great number of complimentary speeches which besides being complimentary had the additional and very novel recommendation of being sincere sam had dutifully seen his father to the belle sauvage when on returning he encountered the fat boy in the court who had been charged with the delivery of a note from emily wardle i say said joe who was unusually loquacious what a pretty girl mary is isn't she i am so fond of her i am mr weller made no verbal remark in reply but eyeing the fat boy for a moment quite transfixed at his presumption led him by the collar to the corner and dismissed him with a harmless but ceremonious kick after which he walked home whistling illustration dismissed him with a harmless but ceremonious kick chapter xxix illustration in which the pickwick club is finally dissolved and everything concluded to the satisfaction of everybody for a whole week after the happy arrival of mr winkle from birmingham mr pickwick and sam weller were from home all day long only returning just in time for dinner and then wearing an air of mystery and importance quite foreign to their natures it was evident that very grave and eventful proceedings were on foot but various surmises were afloat respecting their precise character some among whom was mr tupman were disposed to think that mr pickwick contemplated a matrimonial alliance but this idea the ladies most strenuously repudiated others rather inclined to the belief that he had projected some distant tour and was at present occupied in effecting the preliminary arrangements but this again was stoutly denied by sam himself who had unequivocally stated when cross examined by mary that no new journeys were to be undertaken at length when the brains of the whole party had been racked for six long days by unavailing speculation it was unanimously resolved that mr pickwick should be called upon to explain his conduct and to state distinctly why he had thus absented himself from the society of his admiring friends with this view mr wardle invited the full circle to dinner at the adelphi and the decanters having been twice sent round opened the business we are all anxious to know said the old gentleman what we have done to offend you and to induce you to desert us and devote yourself to these solitary walks are you said mr pickwick it is singular enough that i had intended to volunteer a full explanation this very day so if you will give me another glass of wine i will satisfy your curiosity the decanters passed from hand to hand with unwonted briskness and mr pickwick looking round on the faces of his friends with a cheerful smile proceeded all the changes that have taken place among us said mr pickwick i mean the marriage that has taken place and the marriage that will take place with the changes they involve rendered it necessary for me to think soberly and at once upon my future plans i determined on retiring to some quiet pretty neighbourhood in the vicinity of london i saw a house which exactly suited my fancy i have taken it and furnished it it is fully prepared for my reception and i intend entering upon it at once trusting that i may yet live to spend many quiet years in peaceful retirement cheered through life by the society of my friends and followed in death by their affectionate remembrance here mr pickwick paused and a low murmur ran round the table the house i have taken said mr pickwick is at dulwich it has a large garden and is situated in one of the most pleasant spots near london it has been fitted up with every attention to substantial comfort perhaps to a little elegance besides but of that you shall judge for yourselves sam accompanies me there i have engaged on perker's representation a housekeeper a very old one and such other servants as she thinks i shall require i propose to consecrate this little retreat by having a ceremony in which i take a great interest performed there i wish if my friend wardle entertains no objection that his daughter should be married from my new house on the day i take possession of it the happiness of young people said mr pickwick a little moved has ever been the chief pleasure of my life it will warm my heart to witness the happiness of those friends who are dearest to me beneath my own roof mr pickwick paused again emily and arabella sobbed audibly i have communicated both personally and by letter with the club resumed mr pickwick acquainting them with my intention during our long absence it had suffered much from internal dissensions and the withdrawal of my name coupled with this and other circumstances has occasioned its dissolution the pickwick club exists no longer illustration the happiness of young people said mr pickwick a little moved has ever been the chief pleasure of my life i shall never regret said mr pickwick in a low voice i shall never regret having devoted the greater part of two years to mixing with different varieties and shades of human character frivolous as my pursuit of novelty may have appeared to many nearly the whole of my previous life having been devoted to business and the pursuit of wealth numerous scenes of which i had no previous conception have dawned upon me i hope to the enlargement of my mind and the improvement of my understanding if i have done but little good i trust i have done less harm and that none of my adventures will be other than a source of amusing and pleasant recollection to me in the decline of life god bless you all with these words mr pickwick filled and drained a bumper with a trembling hand and his eyes moistened as his friends rose with one accord and pledged him from their hearts there were very few preparatory arrangements to be made for the marriage of mr snodgrass as he had neither father nor mother and had been in his minority a ward of mr pickwick's that gentleman was perfectly well acquainted with his possessions and prospects his account of both was quite satisfactory to wardle as almost any other account would have been for the good old gentleman was overflowing with hilarity and kindness and a handsome portion having been bestowed upon emily the marriage was fixed to take place on the fourth day from that time the suddenness of which preparations reduced three dressmakers and a tailor to the extreme verge of insanity getting post horses to the carriage old wardle started off next day to bring his mother up to town communicating his intelligence to the old lady with characteristic impetuosity she instantly fainted away but being promptly revived ordered the brocaded silk gown to be packed up forthwith and proceeded to relate some circumstances of a similar nature attending the marriage of the eldest daughter of lady tollimglower deceased which occupied three hours in the recital and were not half finished at last mrs trundle had to be informed of all the mighty preparations that were making in london and being in a delicate state of health was informed thereof through mr trundle lest the news should be too much for her but it was not too much for her inasmuch as she at once wrote off to muggleton to order a new cap and a black satin gown and moreover avowed her determination of being present at the ceremony hereupon mr trundle called in the doctor and the doctor said mrs trundle ought to know best how she felt herself to which mrs trundle replied that she felt herself quite equal to it and that she had made up her mind to go upon which the doctor who was a wise and discreet doctor and knew what was good for himself as well as for other people said that perhaps if mrs trundle stopped at home she might hurt herself more by fretting than by going so perhaps she had better go and she did go the doctor with great attention sending in half a dozen of medicine to be drunk upon the road in addition to these points of distraction wardle was entrusted with two small letters to two small young ladies who were to act as bridesmaids upon the receipt of which the two young ladies were driven to despair by having no things ready for so important an occasion and no time to make them in a circumstance which appeared to afford the two worthy papas of the two small young ladies rather a feeling of satisfaction than otherwise however old frocks were trimmed and new bonnets made and the young ladies looked as well as could possibly have been expected of them and as they cried at the subsequent ceremony in the proper places and trembled at the right times they acquitted themselves to the admiration of all beholders how the two poor relations ever reached london whether they walked or got behind coaches or procured lifts in waggons or carried each other by turns is uncertain but there they were before wardle and the very first people that knocked at the door of mr pickwick's house on the bridal morning were the two poor relations all smiles and shirt collar they were welcomed heartily though for riches or poverty had no influence on mr pickwick the new servants were all alacrity and readiness sam was in a most unrivalled state of high spirits and excitement mary was glowing with beauty and smart ribands the bridegroom who had been staying at the house for two or three days previous sallied forth gallantly to dulwich church to meet the bride attended by mr pickwick ben allen bob sawyer and mr tupman with sam weller outside having at his button hole a white favour the gift of his lady love and clad in a new and gorgeous suit of livery invented for the occasion they were met by the wardles and the winkles and the bride and bridesmaids and the trundles and the ceremony having been performed the coaches rattled back to mr pickwick's to breakfast where little mr perker already awaited them here all the light clouds of the more solemn part of the proceedings passed away every face shone forth joyously nothing was to be heard but congratulations and commendations everything was so beautiful the lawn in front the garden behind the miniature conservatory the dining room the drawing room the bedrooms the smoking room and above all the study with its pictures and easy chairs and odd cabinets and queer tables and books out of number with a large cheerful window opening upon a pleasant lawn and commanding a pretty landscape dotted here and there with little houses almost hidden by the trees and then the curtains and the carpets and the chairs and the sofas everything was so beautiful so compact so neat and in such exquisite taste said everybody that there really was no deciding what to admire most and in the midst of all this stood mr pickwick his countenance lighted up with smiles which the heart of no man woman or child could resist himself the happiest of the group shaking hands over and over again with the same people and when his own hands were not so employed rubbing them with pleasure turning round in a different direction at every fresh expression of gratification or curiosity and inspiring everybody with his looks of gladness and delight breakfast is announced mr pickwick leads the old lady who has been very eloquent on the subject of lady tollimglower to the top of a long table wardle takes the bottom the friends arrange themselves on either side sam takes his station behind his master's chair the laughter and talking cease mr pickwick having said grace pauses for an instant and looks round him as he does so the tears roll down his cheeks in the fulness of his joy let us leave our old friend in one of those moments of unmixed happiness of which if we seek them there are ever some to cheer our transitory existence here there are dark shadows on the earth but its lights are stronger in the contrast some men like bats or owls have better eyes for the darkness than for the light we who have no such optical powers are better pleased to take our last parting look at the visionary companions of many solitary hours when the brief sunshine of the world is blazing full upon them illustration the admiration of numerous elderly ladies of single condition it is the fate of most men who mingle with the world and attain even the prime of life to make many real friends and lose them in the course of nature it is the fate of all authors or chroniclers to create imaginary friends and lose them in the course of art nor is this the full extent of their misfortunes for they are required to furnish an account of them besides in compliance with this custom unquestionably a bad one we subjoin a few biographical words in relation to the party at mr pickwick's assembled mr and mrs winkle being fully received into favour by the old gentleman were shortly afterwards installed in a newly built house not half a mile from mr pickwick's mr winkle being engaged in the city as agent or town correspondent of his father exchanged his old costume for the ordinary dress of englishmen and presented all the external appearance of a civilised christian ever afterwards illustration exchanged his old costume for the ordinary dress of englishmen mr and mrs snodgrass settled at dingley dell where they purchased and cultivated a small farm more for occupation than profit mr snodgrass being occasionally abstracted and melancholy is to this day reputed a great poet among his friends and acquaintance although we do not find that he has ever written anything to encourage the belief there are many celebrated characters literary philosophical and otherwise who hold a high reputation on a similar tenure mr tupman when his friends married and mr pickwick settled took lodgings at richmond where he has ever since resided he walks constantly on the terrace during the summer months with a youthful and jaunty air which has rendered him the admiration of the numerous elderly ladies of single condition who reside in the vicinity he has never proposed again mr bob sawyer having previously passed through the gazette passed over to bengal accompanied by mr benjamin allen both gentlemen having received surgical appointments from the east india company they each had the yellow fever fourteen times and then resolved to try a little abstinence since which period they have been doing well mrs bardell let lodgings to many conversable single gentleman with great profit but never brought any more actions for breach of promise of marriage her attorneys messrs dodson and fogg continue in business from which they realise a large income and in which they are universally considered among the sharpest of the sharp sam weller kept his word and remained unmarried for two years the old housekeeper dying at the end of that time mr pickwick promoted mary to the situation on condition of her marrying mr weller at once which she did without a murmur from the circumstance of two sturdy little boys having been repeatedly seen at the gate of the back garden there is reason to suppose that sam has some family the elder mr weller drove a coach for twelve months but being afflicted with the gout was compelled to retire the contents of the pocket book had been so well invested for him however by mr pickwick that he had a handsome independence to retire on upon which he still lives at an excellent public house near shooter's hill where he is quite reverenced as an oracle boasting very much of his intimacy with mr pickwick and retaining a most unconquerable aversion to widows mr pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house employing his leisure hours in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented to the secretary of the once famous club or in hearing sam weller read aloud with such remarks as suggested themselves to his mind which never failed to afford mr pickwick great amusement he was much troubled at first by the numerous applications made to him by mr snodgrass mr winkle and mr trundle to act as godfather to their offspring but he has become used to it now and officiates as a matter of course he never had occasion to regret his bounty to mr jingle for both that person and job trotter became in time worthy members of society although they have always steadily objected to return to the scenes of their old haunts and temptations mr pickwick is somewhat infirm now but he retains all his former juvenility of spirit and may still be frequently seen contemplating the pictures in the dulwich gallery or enjoying a walk about the pleasant neighbourhood on a fine day he is known by all the poor people about who never fail to take their hats off as he passes with great respect the children idolise him and so indeed does the whole neighbourhood every year he repairs to a large family merry making at mr wardle's on this as on all other occasions he is invariably attended by the faithful sam between whom and his master there exists a steady and reciprocal attachment which nothing but death will terminate illustration

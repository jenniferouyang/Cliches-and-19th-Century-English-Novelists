fagin and the boys oliver twist by charles dickens author of the pickwick papers second edition in three volumes vol i london richard bentley new burlington street london printed by samuel bentley dorset street fleet street oliver twist chapter i treats of the place where oliver twist was born and of the circumstances attending his birth among other public buildings in a certain town which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning and to which i will assign no fictitious name it boasts of one which is common to most towns great or small to wit a workhouse and in this workhouse was born on a day and date which i need not take upon myself to repeat inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader in this stage of the business at all events the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter for a long time after he was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble by the parish surgeon it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared or if they had being comprised within a couple of pages that they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography extant in the literature of any age or country although i am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befal a human being i do mean to say that in this particular instance it was the best thing for oliver twist that could by possibility have occurred the fact is that there was considerable difficulty in inducing oliver to take upon himself the office of respirationa troublesome practice but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existenceand for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress rather unequally poised between this world and the next the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter now if during this brief period oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers anxious aunts experienced nurses and doctors of profound wisdom he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time there being nobody by however but a pauper old woman who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract oliver and nature fought out the point between them the result was that after a few struggles oliver breathed sneezed and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage a voice for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter as oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead rustled the pale face of a young female was raised feebly from the pillow and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words let me see the child and die the surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately but as the young woman spoke he rose and advancing to the beds head said with more kindness than might have been expected of him oh you must not talk about dying yet lor bless her dear heart no interposed the nurse hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction lor bless her dear heart when she has lived as long as i have sir and had thirteen children of her own and all on em dead except two and them in the wurkus with me shell know better than to take on in that way bless her dear heart think what it is to be a mother theres a dear young lamb do apparently this consolatory perspective of a mothers prospects failed in producing its due effect the patient shook her head and stretched out her hand towards the child the surgeon deposited it in her arms she imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead passed her hands over her face gazed wildly round shuddered fell backand died they chafed her breast hands and temples but the blood had frozen for ever they talked of hope and comfort they had been strangers too long its all over mrs thingummy said the surgeon at last ah poor dear so it is said the nurse picking up the cork of the green bottle which had fallen out on the pillow as she stooped to take up the child poor dear you neednt mind sending up to me if the child cries nurse said the surgeon putting on his gloves with great deliberation its very likely it will be troublesome give it a little gruel if it is he put on his hat and pausing by the bed side on his way to the door added she was a good looking girl too where did she come from she was brought here last night replied the old woman by the overseers order she was found lying in the streetshe had walked some distance for her shoes were worn to pieces but where she came from or where she was going to nobody knows the surgeon leant over the body and raised the left hand the old story he said shaking his head no wedding ring i see ah good night the medical gentleman walked away to dinner and the nurse having once more applied herself to the green bottle sat down on a low chair before the fire and proceeded to dress the infant and what an excellent example of the power of dress young oliver twist was wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggarit would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have fixed his station in society but now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service he was badged and ticketed and fell into his place at oncea parish childthe orphan of a workhousethe humble half starved drudgeto be cuffed and buffeted through the world despised by all and pitied by none oliver cried lustily if he could have known that he was an orphan left to the tender mercies of churchwardens and overseers perhaps he would have cried the louder chapter ii treats of oliver twists growth education and board for the next eight or ten months oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deceptionhe was brought up by hand the hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities the parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities whether there was no female then domiciled in the house who was in a situation to impart to oliver twist the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need the workhouse authorities replied with humility that there was not upon this the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved that oliver should be farmed or in other words that he should be despatched to a branch workhouse some three miles off where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor laws rolled about the floor all day without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing under the parental superintendence of an elderly female who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence halfpenny per small head per week sevenpence halfpennys worth per week is a good round diet for a child a great deal may be got for sevenpence halfpennyquite enough to overload its stomach and make it uncomfortable the elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience she knew what was good for children and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself so she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating and who demonstrated it so well that he got his own horse down to a straw a day and would most unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal upon nothing at all if he had not died just four and twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care oliver twist was delivered over a similar result usually attended the operation of her system for at the very moment when a child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten either that it sickened from want and cold or fell into the fire from neglect or got smothered by accident in any one of which cases the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world and there gathered to the fathers which it had never known in this occasionally when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing though the latter accident was very scarceanything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farmthe jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance but these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon and the testimony of the beadle the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside which was very probable indeed and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted which was very self devotional besides the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm and always sent the beadle the day before to say they were going the children were neat and clean to behold when they went and what more would the people have it cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop oliver twists ninth birth day found him a pale thin child somewhat diminutive in stature and decidedly small in circumference but nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in olivers breast it had had plenty of room to expand thanks to the spare diet of the establishment and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth day at all be this as it may however it was his ninth birth day and he was keeping it in the coal cellar with a select party of two other young gentlemen who after participating with him in a sound threshing had been locked up therein for atrociously presuming to be hungry when mrs mann the good lady of the house was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of mr bumble the beadle striving to undo the wicket of the garden gate goodness gracious is that you mr bumble sir said mrs mann thrusting her head out of the window in well affected ecstasies of joy susan take oliver and them two brats up stairs and wash em directlymy heart alive mr bumble how glad i am to see you sure ly now mr bumble was a fat man and a choleric one so instead of responding to this open hearted salutation in a kindred spirit he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadles lor only think said mrs mann running outfor the three boys had been removed by this timeonly think of that that i should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside on account of them dear children walk in sir walk in pray mr bumble do sir although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a churchwarden it by no means mollified the beadle do you think this respectful or proper conduct mrs mann inquired mr bumble grasping his caneto keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden gate when they come here upon porochial business connected with the porochial orphans are you aware mrs mann that you are as i may say a porochial delegate and a stipendiary im sure mr bumble that i was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you that it was you a coming replied mrs mann with great humility mr bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance he had displayed the one and vindicated the other he relaxed well well mrs mann he replied in a calmer tone it may be as you say it may be lead the way in mrs mann for i come on business and have got something to say mrs mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor placed a seat for him and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table before him mr bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered glanced complacently at the cocked hat and smiled yes he smiled beadles are but men and mr bumble smiled now dont you be offended at what im a going to say observed mrs mann with captivating sweetness youve had a long walk you know or i wouldnt mention it now will you take a little drop of something mr bumble not a dropnot a drop said mr bumble waving his right hand in a dignified but still placid manner i think you will said mrs mann who had noticed the tone of the refusal and the gesture that had accompanied it just a leetle drop with a little cold water and a lump of sugar mr bumble coughed now just a little drop said mrs mann persuasively what is it inquired the beadle why its what im obliged to keep a little of in the house to put in the blessed infants daffy when they aint well mr bumble replied mrs mann as she opened a corner cupboard and took down a bottle and glass its gin do you give the children daffy mrs mann inquired bumble following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing ah bless em that i do dear as it is replied the nurse i couldnt see em suffer before my very eyes you know sir no said mr bumble approvingly no you could not you are a humane woman mrs mannhere she set down the glassi shall take an early opportunity of mentioning it to the board mrs mannhe drew it towards himyou feel as a mother mrs mannhe stirred the gin and waterii drink your health with cheerfulness mrs mannand he swallowed half of it and now about business said the beadle taking out a leathern pocket book the child that was half baptized oliver twist is nine year old to day bless him interposed mrs mann inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron and notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound which was afterwards increased to twenty poundnotwithstanding the most superlative and i may say supernatral exertions on the part of this parish said bumble we have never been able to discover who is his father or what is his mothers settlement name or condition mrs mann raised her hands in astonishment but added after a moments reflection how comes he to have any name at all then the beadle drew himself up with great pride and said i inwented it you mr bumble i mrs mann we name our foundlins in alphabetical order the last was a sswubble i named him this was a ttwist i named him the next one as comes will be unwin and the next vilkins i have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet and all the way through it again when we come to z why youre quite a literary character sir said mrs mann well well said the beadle evidently gratified with the compliment perhaps i may beperhaps i may be mrs mann he finished the gin and water and added oliver being now too old to remain here the board have determined to have him back into the house and i have come out myself to take him thereso let me see him at once ill fetch him directly said mrs mann leaving the room for that purpose and oliver having by this time had as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands removed as could be scrubbed off in one washing was led into the room by his benevolent protectress make a bow to the gentleman oliver said mrs mann oliver made a bow which was divided between the beadle on the chair and the cocked hat on the table will you go along with me oliver said mr bumble in a majestic voice oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness when glancing upwards he caught sight of mrs mann who had got behind the beadles chair and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance he took the hint at once for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection will she go with me inquired poor oliver no she cant replied mr bumble but shell come and see you sometimes this was no very great consolation to the child but young as he was he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away it was no very difficult matter for the boy to call the tears into his eyes hunger and recent ill usage are great assistants if you want to cry and oliver cried very naturally indeed mrs mann gave him a thousand embraces and what oliver wanted a great deal more a piece of bread and butter lest he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse with the slice of bread in his hand and the little brown cloth parish cap upon his head oliver was then led away by mr bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years and yet he burst into an agony of childish grief as the cottage gate closed after him wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind they were the only friends he had ever known and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world sank into the childs heart for the first time mr bumble walked on with long strides and little oliver firmly grasping his gold laced cuff trotted beside him inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were nearly there to which interrogations mr bumble returned very brief and snappish replies for the temporary blandness which gin and water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated and he was once again a beadle oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread when mr bumble who had handed him over to the care of an old woman returned and telling him it was a board night informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry he had no time to think about the matter however for mr bumble gave him a tap on the head with his cane to wake him up and another on the back to make him lively and bidding him follow conducted him into a large whitewashed room where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table at the top of which seated in an arm chair rather higher than the rest was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round red face bow to the board said bumble oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes and seeing no board but the table fortunately bowed to that whats your name boy said the gentleman in the high chair oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen which made him tremble and the beadle gave him another tap behind which made him cry and these two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool which was a capital way of raising his spirits and putting him quite at his ease boy said the gentleman in the high chair listen to me you know youre an orphan i suppose whats that sir inquired poor oliver the boy is a fooli thought he was said the gentleman in the white waistcoat in a very decided tone if one member of a class be blessed with an intuitive perception of others of the same race the gentleman in the white waistcoat was unquestionably well qualified to pronounce an opinion on the matter hush said the gentleman who had spoken first you know youve got no father or mother and that you are brought up by the parish dont you yes sir replied oliver weeping bitterly what are you crying for inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat and to be sure it was very extraordinary what could the boy be crying for i hope you say your prayers every night said another gentleman in a gruff voice and pray for the people who feed you and take care of you like a christian yes sir stammered the boy the gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right it would have been very like a christian and a marvellously good christian too if oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of him but he hadnt because nobody had taught him well you have come here to be educated and taught a useful trade said the red faced gentleman in the high chair so youll begin to pick oakum to morrow morning at six oclock added the surly one in the white waistcoat for the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle and was then hurried away to a large ward where on a rough hard bed he sobbed himself to sleep what a noble illustration of the tender laws of this favoured countrythey let the paupers go to sleep poor oliver he little thought as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes but they had and this was it the members of this board were very sage deep philosophical men and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse they found out at once what ordinary folks would never have discoveredthe poor people liked it it was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classesa tavern where there was nothing to paya public breakfast dinner tea and supper all the year rounda brick and mortar elysium where it was all play and no work oho said the board looking very knowing we are the fellows to set this to rights well stop it all in no time so they established the rule that all poor people should have the alternative for they would compel nobody not they of being starved by a gradual process in the house or by a quick one out of it with this view they contracted with the waterworks to lay on an unlimited supply of water and with a corn factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal and issued three meals of thin gruel a day with an onion twice a week and half a roll on sundays they made a great many other wise and humane regulations having reference to the ladies which it is not necessary to repeat kindly undertook to divorce poor married people in consequence of the great expense of a suit in doctors commons and instead of compelling a man to support his family as they had theretofore done took his family away from him and made him a bachelor there is no telling how many applicants for relief under these last two heads would not have started up in all classes of society if it had not been coupled with the workhouse but they were long headed men and they had provided for this difficulty the relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel and that frightened the people for the first six months after oliver twist was removed the system was in full operation it was rather expensive at first in consequence of the increase of the undertakers bill and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers which fluttered loosely on their wasted shrunken forms after a week or twos gruel but the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers and the board were in ecstasies the room in which the boys were fed was a large stone hall with a copper at one end out of which the master dressed in an apron for the purpose and assisted by one or two women ladled the gruel at meal times of which composition each boy had one porringer and no moreexcept on festive occasions and then he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides the bowls never wanted washingthe boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again and when they had performed this operation which never took very long the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls they would sit staring at the copper with such eager eyes as if they could devour the very bricks of which it was composed employing themselves meanwhile in sucking their fingers most assiduously with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon boys have generally excellent appetites oliver twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger that one boy who was tall for his age and hadnt been used to that sort of thing for his father had kept a small cooks shop hinted darkly to his companions that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem he was afraid he should some night eat the boy who slept next him who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age he had a wild hungry eye and they implicitly believed him a council was held lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening and ask for more and it fell to oliver twist illustration oliver asking for more the evening arrived the boys took their places the master in his cooks uniform stationed himself at the copper his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him the gruel was served out and a long grace was said over the short commons the gruel disappeared and the boys whispered each other and winked at oliver while his next neighbours nudged him child as he was he was desperate with hunger and reckless with misery he rose from the table and advancing basin and spoon in hand to the master said somewhat alarmed at his own temerity please sir i want some more the master was a fat healthy man but he turned very pale he gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds and then clung for support to the copper the assistants were paralysed with wonder and the boys with fear what said the master at length in a faint voice please sir replied oliver i want some more the master aimed a blow at olivers head with the ladle pinioned him in his arms and shrieked aloud for the beadle the board were sitting in solemn conclave when mr bumble rushed into the room in great excitement and addressing the gentleman in the high chair said mr limbkins i beg your pardon siroliver twist has asked for more there was a general start horror was depicted on every countenance for more said mr limbkins compose yourself bumble and answer me distinctly do i understand that he asked for more after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary he did sir replied bumble that boy will be hung said the gentleman in the white waistcoat i know that boy will be hung nobody controverted the prophetic gentlemans opinion an animated discussion took place oliver was ordered into instant confinement and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take oliver twist off the hands of the parish in other words five pounds and oliver twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade business or calling i never was more convinced of anything in my life said the gentleman in the white waistcoat as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morningi never was more convinced of anything in my life than i am that that boy will come to be hung as i purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not i should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative supposing it to possess any at all if i ventured to hint just yet whether the life of oliver twist had this violent termination or no chapter iii relates how oliver twist was very near getting a place which would not have been a sinecure for a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board it appears at first sight not unreasonable to suppose that if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat he would have established that sage individuals prophetic character once and for ever by tying one end of his pocket handkerchief to a hook in the wall and attaching himself to the other to the performance of this feat however there was one obstacle namely that pocket handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury had been for all future times and ages removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board in council assembled solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals there was a still greater obstacle in olivers youth and childishness he only cried bitterly all day and when the long dismal night came on he spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness and crouching in the corner tried to sleep ever and anon waking with a start and tremble and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him let it not be supposed by the enemies of the system that during the period of his solitary incarceration oliver was denied the benefit of exercise the pleasure of society or the advantages of religious consolation as for exercise it was nice cold weather and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump in a stone yard in the presence of mr bumble who prevented his catching cold and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame by repeated applications of the cane as for society he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example and so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer time and there permitted to listen to and console his mind with a general supplication of the boys containing a special clause therein inserted by authority of the board in which they entreated to be made good virtuous contented and obedient and to be guarded from the sins and vices of oliver twist whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness and an article direct from the manufactory of the devil himself it chanced one morning while olivers affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state that mr gamfield chimney sweeper was wending his way adown the high street deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent for which his landlord had become rather pressing mr gamfields most sanguine calculation of funds could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount and in a species of arithmetical desperation he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey when passing the workhouse his eyes encountered the bill on the gate woo said mr gamfield to the donkey the donkey was in a state of profound abstractionwondering probably whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden so without noticing the word of command he jogged onwards mr gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally but more particularly on his eyes and running after him bestowed a blow on his head which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkeys then catching hold of the bridle he gave his jaw a sharp wrench by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master and having by these means turned him round he gave him another blow on the head just to stun him till he came back again and having done so walked up to the gate to read the bill the gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board room having witnessed the little dispute between mr gamfield and the donkey he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill for he saw at once that mr gamfield was exactly the sort of master oliver twist wanted mr gamfield smiled too as he perused the document for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for and as to the boy with which it was encumbered mr gamfield knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was well knew he would be a nice small pattern just the very thing for register stoves so he spelt the bill through again from beginning to end and then touching his fur cap in token of humility accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat this here boy sir wot the parish wants to prentis said mr gamfield yes my man said the gentleman in the white waistcoat with a condescending smile what of him if the parish vould like him to learn a light pleasant trade in a good spectable chimbley sweepin bisness said mr gamfield i wants a prentis and im ready to take him walk in said the gentleman in the white waistcoat mr gamfield having lingered behind to give the donkey another blow on the head and another wrench of the jaw as a caution not to run away in his absence followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where oliver had first seen him its a nasty trade said mr limbkins when gamfield had again stated his wish young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now said another gentleman thats acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make em come down again said gamfield thats all smoke and no blaze vereas smoke aint o no use at all in makin a boy come down for it only sinds him to sleep and thats wot he likes boys is wery obstinit and wery lazy genlmen and theres nothink like a good hot blaze to make em com down vith a run its humane too genlmen acause even if theyve stuck in the chimbley roastin their feet makes em struggle to hextricate theirselves the gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from mr limbkins the board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes but in so low a tone that the words saving of expenditure look well in the accounts have a printed report published were alone audible and they only chanced to be heard on account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis at length the whispering ceased and the members of the board having resumed their seats and their solemnity mr limbkins said we have considered your proposition and we dont approve of it not at all said the gentleman in the white waistcoat decidedly not added the other members as mr gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already it occurred to him that the board had perhaps in some unaccountable freak taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings it was very unlike their general mode of doing business if they had but still as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour he twisted his cap in his hands and walked slowly from the table so you wont let me have him genlmen said mr gamfield pausing near the door no replied mr limbkins at least as its a nasty business we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered mr gamfields countenance brightened as with a quick step he returned to the table and said whatll you give genlmen come dont be too hard on a poor man whatll you give i should say three pound ten was plenty said mr limbkins ten shillings too much said the gentleman in the white waistcoat come said gamfield say four pound genlmen say four pound and youve got rid of him for good and all there three pound ten repeated mr limbkins firmly come ill split the difference genlmen urged gamfield three pound fifteen not a farthing more was the firm reply of mr limbkins youre desprate hard upon me genlmen said gamfield wavering pooh pooh nonsense said the gentleman in the white waistcoat hed be cheap with nothing at all as a premium take him you silly fellow hes just the boy for you he wants the stick now and then itll do him good and his board neednt come very expensive for he hasnt been overfed since he was born ha ha ha mr gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table and observing a smile on all of them gradually broke into a smile himself the bargain was made and mr bumble was at once instructed that oliver twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate for signature and approval that very afternoon in pursuance of this determination little oliver to his excessive astonishment was released from bondage and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt he had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance when mr bumble brought him with his own hands a basin of gruel and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread at sight of which oliver began to cry very piteously thinking not unnaturally that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose or they never would have begun to fatten him up in this way dont make your eyes red oliver but eat your food and be thankful said mr bumble in a tone of impressive pomposity youre a going to be made a prentice of oliver a prentice sir said the child trembling yes oliver said mr bumble the kind and blessed gentlemen which is so many parents to you oliver when you have none of your own are a going to prentice you and to set you up in life and make a man of you although the expense to the parish is three pound tenthree pound ten oliverseventy shillinsone hundred and forty sixpencesand all for a naughty orphan which nobody cant love as mr bumble paused to take breath after delivering this address in an awful voice the tears rolled down the poor childs face and he sobbed bitterly come said mr bumble somewhat less pompously for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced come oliver wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket and dont cry into your gruel thats a very foolish action oliver it certainly was for there was quite enough water in it already on their way to the magistrates mr bumble instructed oliver that all he would have to do would be to look very happy and say when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed that he should like it very much indeed both of which injunctions oliver promised to obey the rather as mr bumble threw in a gentle hint that if he failed in either particular there was no telling what would be done to him when they arrived at the office he was shut up in a little room by himself and admonished by mr bumble to stay there until he came back to fetch him there the boy remained with a palpitating heart for half an hour at the expiration of which time mr bumble thrust in his head unadorned with the cocked hat and said aloud now oliver my dear come to the gentleman as mr bumble said this he put on a grim and threatening look and added in a low voice mind what i told you you young rascal oliver stared innocently in mr bumbles face at this somewhat contradictory style of address but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon by leading him at once into an adjoining room the door of which was open it was a large room with a great window and behind a desk sat two old gentlemen with powdered heads one of whom was reading the newspaper while the other was perusing with the aid of a pair of tortoise shell spectacles a small piece of parchment which lay before him mr limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side and mr gamfield with a partially washed face on the other while two or three bluff looking men in top boots were lounging about the old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off over the little bit of parchment and there was a short pause after oliver had been stationed by mr bumble in front of the desk this is the boy your worship said mr bumble the old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve whereupon the last mentioned old gentleman woke up oh is this the boy said the old gentleman this is him sir replied mr bumble bow to the magistrate my dear oliver roused himself and made his best obeisance he had been wondering with his eyes fixed on the magistrates powder whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads and were boards from thenceforth on that account well said the old gentleman i suppose hes fond of chimney sweeping he doats on it your worship replied bumble giving oliver a sly pinch to intimate that he had better not say he didnt and he will be a sweep will he inquired the old gentleman if we was to bind him to any other trade to morrow hed run away simultaneously your worship replied bumble and this man thats to be his masteryou siryoull treat him well and feed him and do all that sort of thingwill you said the old gentleman when i says i will i means i will replied mr gamfield doggedly youre a rough speaker my friend but you look an honest open hearted man said the old gentleman turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for olivers premium whose villanous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty but the magistrate was half blind and half childish so he couldnt reasonably be expected to discern what other people did i hope i am sir said mr gamfield with an ugly leer i have no doubt you are my friend replied the old gentleman fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose and looking about him for the inkstand it was the critical moment of olivers fate if the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was he would have dipped his pen into it and signed the indentures and oliver would have been straightway hurried off but as it chanced to be immediately under his nose it followed as a matter of course that he looked all over his desk for it without finding it and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of oliver twist who despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of bumble was regarding the very repulsive countenance of his future master with a mingled expression of horror and fear too palpable to be mistaken even by a half blind magistrate the old gentleman stopped laid down his pen and looked from oliver to mr limbkins who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect my boy said the old gentleman leaning over the desk oliver started at the soundhe might be excused for doing so for the words were kindly said and strange sounds frighten one he trembled violently and burst into tears my boy said the old gentleman you look pale and alarmed what is the matter stand a little away from him beadle said the other magistrate laying aside the paper and leaning forward with an expression of interest now boy tell us whats the matter dont be afraid illustration oliver escapes being bound apprentice to the sweep oliver fell on his knees and clasping his hands together prayed that they would order him back to the dark roomthat they would starve himbeat himkill him if they pleasedrather than send him away with that dreadful man well said mr bumble raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnitywell of all the artful and designing orphans that ever i see oliver you are one of the most bare facedest hold your tongue beadle said the second old gentleman when mr bumble had given vent to this compound adjective i beg your worships pardon said mr bumble incredulous of his having heard arightdid your worship speak to me yeshold your tongue mr bumble was stupefied with astonishment a beadle ordered to hold his tongue a moral revolution the old gentleman in the tortoise shell spectacles looked at his companion he nodded significantly we refuse to sanction these indentures said the old gentleman tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke i hope stammered mr limbkinsi hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct on the unsupported testimony of a mere child the magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter said the second old gentleman sharply take the boy back to the workhouse and treat him kindly he seems to want it that same evening the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed not only that oliver would be hung but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain mr bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery and said he wished he might come to good whereunto mr gamfield replied that he wished he might come to him which although he agreed with the beadle in most matters would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description the next morning the public were once more informed that oliver twist was again to let and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him chapter iv oliver being offered another place makes his first entry into public life in great families when an advantageous place cannot be obtained either in possession reversion remainder or expectancy for the young man who is growing up it is a very general custom to send him to sea the board in imitation of so wise and salutary an example took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off oliver twist in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port which suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him the probability being that the skipper would either flog him to death in a playful mood some day after dinner or knock his brains out with an iron barboth pastimes being as is pretty generally known very favourite and common recreations among gentlemen of that class the more the case presented itself to the board in this point of view the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared so they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for oliver effectually was to send him to sea without delay mr bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin boy without any friends and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission when he encountered just at the gate no less a person than mr sowerberry the parochial undertaker mr sowerberry was a tall gaunt large jointed man attired in a suit of thread bare black with darned cotton stockings of the same colour and shoes to answer his features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity his step was elastic and his face betokened inward pleasantry as he advanced to mr bumble and shook him cordially by the hand i have taken the measure of the two women that died last night mr bumble said the undertaker youll make your fortune mr sowerberry said the beadle as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff box of the undertaker which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin i say youll make your fortune mr sowerberry repeated mr bumble tapping the undertaker on the shoulder in a friendly manner with his cane think so said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event the prices allowed by the board are very small mr bumble so are the coffins replied the beadle with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in mr sowerberry was much tickled at this as of course he ought to be and laughed a long time without cessation well well mr bumble he said at length theres no denying that since the new system of feeding has come in the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be but we must have some profit mr bumble well seasoned timber is an expensive article sir and all the iron handles come by canal from birmingham well well said mr bumble every trade has its drawbacks and a fair profit is of course allowable of course of course replied the undertaker and if i dont get a profit upon this or that particular article why i make it up in the long run you seehe he he just so said mr bumble though i must saycontinued the undertaker resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interruptedthough i must say mr bumble that i have to contend against one very great disadvantage which is that all the stout people go off the quickesti mean that the people who have been better off and have paid rates for many years are the first to sink when they come into the house and let me tell you mr bumble that three or four inches over ones calculation makes a great hole in ones profits especially when one has a family to provide for sir as mr sowerberry said this with the becoming indignation of an ill used man and as mr bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject and oliver twist being uppermost in his mind he made him his theme by the bye said mr bumble you dont know anybody who wants a boy do youa porochial prentis who is at present a dead weighta millstone as i may sayround the porochial throat liberal terms mr sowerberryliberal termsand as mr bumble spoke he raised his cane to the bill above him and gave three distinct raps upon the words five pounds which were printed thereon in roman capitals of gigantic size gadso said the undertaker taking mr bumble by the gilt edged lappel of his official coat thats just the very thing i wanted to speak to you about you knowdear me what a very elegant button this is mr bumble i never noticed it before yes i think it is rather pretty said the beadle glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat the die is the same as the porochial sealthe good samaritan healing the sick and bruised man the board presented it to me on new years morning mr sowerberry i put it on i remember for the first time to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway at midnight i recollect said the undertaker the jury brought in died from exposure to the cold and want of the common necessaries of lifedidnt they mr bumble nodded and they made it a special verdict i think said the undertaker by adding some words to the effect that if the relieving officer had tushfoolery interposed the beadle angrily if the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk theyd have enough to do very true said the undertaker they would indeed juries said mr bumble grasping his cane tightly as was his wont when working into a passionjuries is ineddicated vulgar grovelling wretches so they are said the undertaker they havent no more philosophy nor political economy about em than that said the beadle snapping his fingers contemptuously no more they have acquiesced the undertaker i despise em said the beadle growing very red in the face so do i rejoined the undertaker and i only wish wed a jury of the independent sort in the house for a week or two said the beadle the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for them let em alone for that replied the undertaker so saying he smiled approvingly to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer mr bumble lifted off his cocked hat took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered fixed the cocked hat on again and turning to the undertaker said in a calmer voice well what about the boy oh replied the undertaker why you know mr bumble i pay a good deal towards the poors rates hem said mr bumble well well replied the undertaker i was thinking that if i pay so much towards em ive a right to get as much out of em as i can mr bumble and soand soi think ill take the boy myself mr bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm and led him into the building mr sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes and it was arranged that oliver should go to him that evening upon likinga phrase which means in the case of a parish apprentice that if the master find upon a short trial that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food in him he shall have him for a term of years to do what he likes with when little oliver was taken before the gentlemen that evening and informed that he was to go that night as general house lad to a coffin makers and that if he complained of his situation or ever came back to the parish again he would be sent to sea there to be drowned or knocked on the head as the case might be he evinced so little emotion that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal and ordered mr bumble to remove him forthwith now although it was very natural that the board of all people in the world should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody they were rather out in this particular instance the simple fact was that oliver instead of possessing too little feeling possessed rather too much and was in a fair way of being reduced to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness for life by the ill usage he had received he heard the news of his destination in perfect silence and having had his luggage put into his handwhich was not very difficult to carry inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel about half a foot square by three inches deephe pulled his cap over his eyes and once more attaching himself to mr bumbles coat cuff was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering for some time mr bumble drew oliver along without notice or remark for the beadle carried his head very erect as a beadle always should and it being a windy day little oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of mr bumbles coat as they blew open and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee breeches as they drew near to their destination however mr bumble thought it expedient to look down and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master which he accordingly did with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage oliver said mr bumble yes sir replied oliver in a low tremulous voice pull that cap off your eyes and hold up your head sir although oliver did as he was desired at once and passed the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes he left a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor as mr bumble gazed sternly upon him it rolled down his cheek it was followed by another and another the child made a strong effort but it was an unsuccessful one and withdrawing his other hand from mr bumbles he covered his face with both and wept till the tears sprung out from between his thin and bony fingers well exclaimed mr bumble stopping short and darting at his little charge a look of intense malignitywell of all the ungratefullest and worst disposed boys as ever i see oliver you are the no no sir sobbed oliver clinging to the hand which held the well known cane no no sir i will be good indeed indeed indeed i will sir i am a very little boy sir and it is soso so what inquired mr bumble in amazement so lonely sirso very lonely cried the child everybody hates me oh sir dont dont pray be cross to me the child beat his hand upon his heart and looked into his companions face with tears of real agony mr bumble regarded olivers piteous and helpless look with some astonishment for a few seconds hemmed three or four times in a husky manner and after muttering something about that troublesome cough bid oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy and once more taking his hand walked on with him in silence the undertaker had just put up the shutters of his shop and was making some entries in his day book by the light of a most appropriately dismal candle when mr bumble entered aha said the undertaker looking up from the book and pausing in the middle of a word is that you bumble no one else mr sowerberry replied the beadle here ive brought the boy oliver made a bow oh thats the boy is it said the undertaker raising the candle above his head to get a full glimpse of oliver mrs sowerberry will you come here a moment my dear mrs sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop and presented the form of a short thin squeezed up woman with a vixenish countenance my dear said mr sowerberry deferentially this is the boy from the workhouse that i told you of oliver bowed again dear me said the undertakers wife hes very small why he is rather small replied mr bumble looking at oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger he is smalltheres no denying it but hell grow mrs sowerberryhell grow ah i dare say he will replied the lady pettishly on our victuals and our drink i see no saving in parish children not i for they always cost more to keep than theyre worth however men always think they know best there get down stairs little bag o bones with this the undertakers wife opened a side door and pushed oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell damp and dark forming the ante room to the coal cellar and denominated the kitchen wherein sat a slatternly girl in shoes down at heel and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair here charlotte said mrs sowerberry who had followed oliver down give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for trip he hasnt come home since the morning so he may go without em i dare say he isnt too dainty to eat emare you boy oliver whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it replied in the negative and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him i wish some well fed philosopher whose meat and drink turn to gall within him whose blood is ice and whose heart is iron could have seen oliver twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected and witnessed the horrible avidity with which he tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of faminethere is only one thing i should like better and that would be to see him making the same sort of meal himself with the same relish well said the undertakers wife when oliver had finished his supper which she had regarded in silent horror and with fearful auguries of his future appetite have you done there being nothing eatable within his reach oliver replied in the affirmative then come with me said mrs sowerberry taking up a dim and dirty lamp and leading the way up stairs your beds under the counter you wont mind sleeping among the coffins i supposebut it doesnt much matter whether you will or not for you wont sleep anywhere else come dont keep me here all night oliver lingered no longer but meekly followed his new mistress chapter v oliver mingles with new associates and going to a funeral for the first time forms an unfavourable notion of his masters business oliver being left to himself in the undertakers shop set the lamp down on a workmans bench and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread which many people a good deal older than he was will be at no loss to understand an unfinished coffin on black tressels which stood in the middle of the shop looked so gloomy and death like that a cold tremble came over him every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head to drive him mad with terror against the wall were ranged in regular array a long row of elm boards cut into the same shape and looking in the dim light like high shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets coffin plates elm chips bright headed nails and shreds of black cloth lay scattered on the floor and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths on duty at a large private door with a hearse drawn by four black steeds approaching in the distance the shop was close and hot and the atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins the recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust looked like a grave nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed oliver he was alone in a strange place and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation the boy had no friends to care for or to care for him the regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind the absence of no loved and well remembered face sunk heavily into his heart but his heart was heavy notwithstanding and he wished as he crept into his narrow bed that that were his coffin and that he could be laid in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground with the tall grass waving gently above his head and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep oliver was awakened in the morning by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop door which before he could huddle on his clothes was repeated in an angry and impetuous manner about twenty five times and when he began to undo the chain the legs left off their volleys and a voice began open the door will yer cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door i will directly sir replied oliver undoing the chain and turning the key i suppose yer the new boy ant yer said the voice through the key hole yes sir replied oliver how old are yer inquired the voice ten sir replied oliver then ill whop yer when i get in said the voice you just see if i dont thats all my workus brat and having made this obliging promise the voice began to whistle oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice whoever he might be would redeem his pledge most honourably he drew back the bolts with a trembling hand and opened the door for a second or two oliver glanced up the street and down the street and over the way impressed with the belief that the unknown who had addressed him through the key hole had walked a few paces off to warm himself for nobody did he see but a big charity boy sitting on a post in front of the house eating a slice of bread and butter which he cut into wedges the size of his mouth with a clasp knife and then consumed with great dexterity i beg your pardon sir said oliver at length seeing that no other visitor made his appearance did you knock i kicked replied the charity boy did you want a coffin sir inquired oliver innocently at this the charity boy looked monstrous fierce and said that oliver would stand in need of one before long if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way yer dont know who i am i suppose workus said the charity boy in continuation descending from the top of the post meanwhile with edifying gravity no sir rejoined oliver im mister noah claypole said the charity boy and youre under me take down the shutters yer idle young ruffian with this mr claypole administered a kick to oliver and entered the shop with a dignified air which did him great credit it is difficult for a large headed small eyed youth of lumbering make and heavy countenance to look dignified under any circumstances but it is more especially so when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls oliver having taken down the shutters and broken a pane of glass in his efforts to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day was graciously assisted by noah who having consoled him with the assurance that hed catch it condescended to help him mr sowerberry came down soon after and shortly afterwards mrs sowerberry appeared and oliver having caught it in fulfilment of noahs prediction followed that young gentleman down stairs to breakfast come near the fire noah said charlotte i saved a nice little piece of bacon for you from masters breakfast oliver shut that door at mister noahs back and take them bits that ive put out on the cover of the bread pan theres your tea take it away to that box and drink it there and make haste for theyll want you to mind the shop dye hear dye hear workus said noah claypole lor noah said charlotte what a rum creature you are why dont you let the boy alone let him alone said noah why every body lets him alone enough for the matter of that neither his father nor mother will ever interfere with him all his relations let him have his own way pretty well eh charlotte he he he oh you queer soul said charlotte bursting into a hearty laugh in which she was joined by noah after which they both looked scornfully at poor oliver twist as he sat shivering upon the box in the coldest corner of the room and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him noah was a charity boy but not a workhouse orphan no chance child was he for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents who lived hard by his mother being a washerwoman and his father a drunken soldier discharged with a wooden leg and a diurnal pension of twopence halfpenny and an unstateable fraction the shop boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding noah in the public streets with the ignominious epithets of leathers charity and the like and noah had borne them without reply but now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn he retorted on him with interest this affords charming food for contemplation it shows us what a beautiful thing human nature sometimes is and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity boy oliver had been sojourning at the undertakers some three weeks or a month and mr and mrs sowerberry the shop being shut up were taking their supper in the little back parlour when mr sowerberry after several deferential glances at his wife said my dear he was going to say more but mrs sowerberry looking up with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect he stopped short well said mrs sowerberry sharply nothing my dear nothing said mr sowerberry ugh you brute said mrs sowerberry not at all my dear said mr sowerberry humbly i thought you didnt want to hear my dear i was only going to say oh dont tell me what you were going to say interposed mrs sowerberry i am nobody dont consult me pray i dont want to intrude upon your secrets and as mrs sowerberry said this she gave an hysterical laugh which threatened violent consequences but my dear said sowerberry i want to ask your advice no no dont ask mine replied mrs sowerberry in an affecting manner ask somebody elses here there was another hysterical laugh which frightened mr sowerberry very much this is a very common and much approved matrimonial course of treatment which is often very effective it at once reduced mr sowerberry to begging as a special favour to be allowed to say what mrs sowerberry was most curious to hear and after a short altercation of less than three quarters of an hours duration the permission was most graciously conceded its only about young twist my dear said mr sowerberry a very good looking boy that my dear he need be for he eats enough observed the lady theres an expression of melancholy in his face my dear resumed mr sowerberry which is very interesting he would make a delightful mute my dear mrs sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment mr sowerberry remarked it and without allowing time for any observation on the good ladys part proceeded i dont mean a regular mute to attend grown up people my dear but only for childrens practice it would be very new to have a mute in proportion my dear you may depend upon it that it would have a superb effect mrs sowerberry who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way was much struck by the novelty of this idea but as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so under existing circumstances she merely inquired with much sharpness why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husbands mind before mr sowerberry rightly construed this as an acquiescence in his proposition it was speedily determined that oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the profession and with this view that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required the occasion was not long in coming for half an hour after breakfast next morning mr bumble entered the shop and supporting his cane against the counter drew forth his large leathern pocket book from which he selected a small scrap of paper which he handed over to sowerberry aha said the undertaker glancing over it with a lively countenance an order for a coffin eh for a coffin first and a porochial funeral afterwards replied mr bumble fastening the strap of the leathern pocket book which like himself was very corpulent bayton said the undertaker looking from the scrap of paper to mr bumble i never heard the name before bumble shook his head as he replied obstinate people mr sowerberry very obstinate proud too im afraid sir proud eh exclaimed mr sowerberry with a sneercome thats too much oh its sickening replied the beadle perfectly antimonial mr sowerberry so it is acquiesced the undertaker we only heard of them the night before last said the beadle and we shouldnt have known anything about them then only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad he had gone out to dinner but his prentice which is a very clever lad sent em some medicine in a blacking bottle off hand ah theres promptness said the undertaker promptness indeed replied the beadle but whats the consequence whats the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels sir why the husband sends back word that the medicine wont suit his wifes complaint and so she shant take itsays she shant take it sir good strong wholesome medicine as was given with great success to two irish labourers and a coalheaver only a week beforesent em for nothing with a blackin bottle inand he sends back word that she shant take it sir as the flagrant atrocity presented itself to mr bumbles mind in full force he struck the counter sharply with his cane and became flushed with indignation well said the undertaker i neverdid never did sir ejaculated the beadleno nor nobody never did but now shes dead weve got to bury her and thats the direction and the sooner its done the better thus saying mr bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first in a fever of parochial excitement and flounced out of the shop why he was so angry oliver that he forgot even to ask after you said mr sowerberry looking after the beadle as he strode down the street yes sir replied oliver who had carefully kept himself out of sight during the interview and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of mr bumbles voice he neednt have taken the trouble to shrink from mr bumbles glance however for that functionary on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression thought that now the undertaker had got oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome well said mr sowerberry taking up his hat the sooner this job is done the better noah look after the shop oliver put on your cap and come with me oliver obeyed and followed his master on his professional mission they walked on for some time through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town and then striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through paused to look for the house which was the object of their search the houses on either side were high and large but very old and tenanted by people of the poorest class as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who with folded arms and bodies half doubled occasionally skulked along a great many of the tenements had shop fronts but they were fast closed and mouldering away only the upper rooms being inhabited others which had become insecure from age and decay were prevented from falling into the street by huge beams of wood which were reared against the walls and firmly planted in the road but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window were wrenched from their positions to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body the kennel was stagnant and filthy the very rats which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness were hideous with famine there was neither knocker nor bell handle at the open door where oliver and his master stopped so groping his way cautiously through the dark passage and bidding oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs and stumbling against a door on the landing rapped at it with his knuckles it was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen the undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed he stepped in and oliver followed him there was no fire in the room but a man was crouching mechanically over the empty stove an old woman too had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth and was sitting beside him there were some ragged children in another corner and in a small recess opposite the door there lay upon the ground something covered with an old blanket oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes towards the place and crept involuntarily closer to his master for though it was covered up the boy felt that it was a corpse the mans face was thin and very pale his hair and beard were grizzly and his eyes were bloodshot the old womans face was wrinkled her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip and her eyes were bright and piercing oliver was afraid to look at either her or the manthey seemed so like the rats he had seen outside nobody shall go near her said the man starting fiercely up as the undertaker approached the recess keep back dn you keep back if youve a life to lose nonsense my good man said the undertaker who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapesnonsense i tell you said the man clenching his hands and stamping furiously on the floori tell you i wont have her put into the ground she couldnt rest there the worms would worrynot eat hershe is so worn away the undertaker offered no reply to this raving but producing a tape from his pocket knelt down for a moment by the side of the body ah said the man bursting into tears and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman kneel down kneel downkneel round her every one of you and mark my words i say she was starved to death i never knew how bad she was till the fever came upon her and then her bones were starting through the skin there was neither fire nor candle she died in the darkin the dark she couldnt even see her childrens faces though we heard her gasping out their names i begged for her in the streets and they sent me to prison when i came back she was dying and all the blood in my heart has dried up for they starved her to death i swear it before the god that saw itthey starved herhe twined his hands in his hair and with a loud scream rolled grovelling upon the floor his eyes fixed and the foam gushing from his lips the terrified children cried bitterly but the old woman who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed menaced them into silence and having unloosened the mans cravat who still remained extended on the ground tottered towards the undertaker she was my daughter said the old woman nodding her head in the direction of the corpse and speaking with an idiotic leer more ghastly than even the presence of death itselflord lordwell it is strange that i who gave birth to her and was a woman then should be alive and merry now and she lying there so cold and stiff lord lordto think of itits as good as a playas good as a play as the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment the undertaker turned to go away stop stop said the old woman in a loud whisper will she be buried to morrowor next dayor to night i laid her out and i must walk you know send me a large cloaka good warm one for it is bitter cold we should have cake and wine too before we go never mind send some breadonly a loaf of bread and a cup of water shall we have some bread dear she said eagerly catching at the undertakers coat as he once more moved towards the door yes yes said the undertaker of course anything everything he disengaged himself from the old womans grasp and dragging oliver after him hurried away the next day the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half quartern loaf and a piece of cheese left with them by mr bumble himself oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode where mr bumble had already arrived accompanied by four men from the workhouse who were to act as bearers an old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man and the bare coffin having been screwed down was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers and carried into the street now you must put your best leg foremost old lady whispered sowerberry in the old womans ear we are rather late and it wont do to keep the clergyman waiting move on my menas quick as you like thus directed the bearers trotted on under their light burden and the two mourners kept as near them as they could mr bumble and sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front and oliver whose legs were not so long as his masters ran by the side there was not so great a necessity for hurrying as mr sowerberry had anticipated however for when they reached the obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew and the parish graves were made the clergyman had not arrived and the clerk who was sitting by the vestry room fire seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so before he came so they put the bier down on the brink of the grave and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay with a cold rain drizzling down while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hide and seek among the tomb stones or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin mr sowerberry and bumble being personal friends of the clerk sat by the fire with him and read the paper at length after the lapse of something more than an hour mr bumble and sowerberry and the clerk were seen running towards the grave and immediately afterwards the clergyman appeared putting on his surplice as he came along mr bumble then threshed a boy or two to keep up appearances and the reverend gentleman having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes gave his surplice to the clerk and ran away again now bill said sowerberry to the grave digger fill up it was no very difficult task for the grave was so full that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface the grave digger shovelled in the earth stamped it loosely down with his feet shouldered his spade and walked off followed by the boys who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon come my good fellow said bumble tapping the man on the back they want to shut up the yard the man who had never once moved since he had taken his station by the grave side started raised his head stared at the person who had addressed him walked forward for a few paces and fell down in a swoon the crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak which the undertaker had taken off to pay him any attention so they threw a can of cold water over him and when he came to saw him safely out of the churchyard locked the gate and departed on their different ways well oliver said sowerberry as they walked home how do you like it pretty well thank you sir replied oliver with considerable hesitation not very much sir ah youll get used to it in time oliver said sowerberry nothing when you are used to it my boy oliver wondered in his own mind whether it had taken a very long time to get mr sowerberry used to it but he thought it better not to ask the question and walked back to the shop thinking over all he had seen and heard chapter vi oliver being goaded by the taunts of noah rouses into action and rather astonishes him the months trial over oliver was formally apprenticed it was a nice sickly season just at this time in commercial phrase coffins were looking up and in the course of a few weeks oliver had acquired a great deal of experience the success of mr sowerberrys ingenious speculation exceeded even his most sanguine hopes the oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent or so fatal to infant existence and many were the mournful processions which little oliver headed in a hat band reaching down to his knees to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town as oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too in order that he might acquire that unanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which are so essential to a finished undertaker he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong minded people bear their trials and losses for instance when sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions they would be as happy among themselves as need bequite cheerful and contented conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them husbands too bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness and wives again put on weeds for their husbands as if so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible it was observable too that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment recovered almost as soon as they reached home and became quite composed before the tea drinking was over all this was very pleasant and improving to see and oliver beheld it with great admiration that oliver twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people i cannot although i am his biographer undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence but i can most distinctly say that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and ill treatment of noah claypole who used him far worse than ever now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hat band while he the old one remained stationary in the muffin cap and leathers charlotte treated him badly because noah did and mrs sowerberry was his decided enemy because mr sowerberry was disposed to be his friend so between these three on one side and a glut of funerals on the other oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was when he was shut up by mistake in the grain department of a brewery and now i come to a very important passage in olivers history for i have to record an act slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance but which indirectly produced a most material change in all his future prospects and proceedings one day oliver and noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner hour to banquet upon a small joint of muttona pound and a half of the worst end of the neck when charlotte being called out of the way there ensued a brief interval of time which noah claypole being hungry and vicious considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young oliver twist intent upon this innocent amusement noah put his feet on the table cloth and pulled olivers hair and twitched his ears and expressed his opinion that he was a sneak and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hung whenever that desirable event should take place and entered upon various other topics of petty annoyance like a malicious and ill conditioned charity boy as he was but none of these taunts producing the desired effect of making oliver cry noah attempted to be more facetious still and in this attempt did what many small wits with far greater reputations than noah notwithstanding do to this day when they want to be funnyhe got rather personal workus said noah hows your mother shes dead replied oliver dont you say anything about her to me olivers colour rose as he said this he breathed quickly and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils which mr claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying under this impression he returned to the charge what did she die of workus said noah of a broken heart some of our old nurses told me replied oliver more as if he were talking to himself than answering noah i think i know what it must be to die of that tol de rol lol lol right fol lairy workus said noah as a tear rolled down olivers cheek whats set you a snivelling now not you replied oliver hastily brushing the tear away dont think it oh not me eh sneered noah no not you replied oliver sharply there thats enough dont say anything more to me about her youd better not better not exclaimed noah well better not workus dont be impudent your mother too she was a nice un she was oh lor and here noah nodded his head expressively and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together for the occasion yer know workus continued noah emboldened by olivers silence and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pityof all tones the most annoyingyer know workus it carnt be helped now and of course yer couldnt help it then and im very sorry for it and im sure we all are and pity yer very much but yer must know workus yer mother was a regular right down bad un what did you say inquired oliver looking up very quickly a regular right down bad un workus replied noah coolly and its a great deal better workus that she died when she did or else shed have been hard labouring in bridewell or transported or hung which is more likely than either isnt it crimson with fury oliver started up overthrew chair and table seized noah by the throat shook him in the violence of his rage till his teeth chattered in his head and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow felled him to the ground a minute ago the boy had looked the quiet mild dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him but his spirit was roused at last the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire his breast heaved his attitude was erect his eye bright and vivid and his whole person changed as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who lay crouching at his feet and defied him with an energy he had never known before illustration oliver plucks up a spirit hell murder me blubbered noah charlotte missis heres the new boy a murdering of me help help olivers gone mad charlotte noahs shouts were responded to by a loud scream from charlotte and a louder from mrs sowerberry the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side door while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life to come further down oh you little wretch screamed charlotte seizing oliver with her utmost force which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good trainingoh you little un grate ful mur de rous hor rid vil lain and between every syllable charlotte gave oliver a blow with all her might and accompanied it with a scream for the benefit of society charlottes fist was by no means a light one but lest it should not be effectual in calming olivers wrath mrs sowerberry plunged into the kitchen and assisted to hold him with one hand while she scratched his face with the other in this favourable position of affairs noah rose from the ground and pummeled him from behind this was rather too violent exercise to last long when they were all three wearied out and could tear and beat no longer they dragged oliver struggling and shouting but nothing daunted into the dust cellar and there locked him up this being done mrs sowerberry sunk into a chair and burst into tears bless her shes going off said charlotte a glass of water noah dear make haste oh charlotte said mrs sowerberry speaking as well as she could through a deficiency of breath and a sufficiency of cold water which noah had poured over her head and shouldersoh charlotte what a mercy we have not been all murdered in our beds ah mercy indeed maam was the reply i only hope thisll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle poor noah he was all but killed maam when i came in poor fellow said mrs sowerberry looking piteously on the charity boy noah whose top waistcoat button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of olivers head rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him and performed some affecting tears and sniffs whats to be done exclaimed mrs sowerberry your masters not at hometheres not a man in the houseand hell kick that door down in ten minutes olivers vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question rendered this occurrence highly probable dear dear i dont know maam said charlotte unless we send for the police officers or the millingtary suggested mr claypole no no said mrs sowerberry bethinking herself of olivers old friend run to mr bumble noah and tell him to come here directly and not to lose a minute never mind your capmake haste you can hold a knife to that black eye as you run along and itll keep the swelling down noah stopped to make no reply but started off at his fullest speed and very much it astonished the people who were out walking to see a charity boy tearing through the streets pell mell with no cap on his head and a clasp knife at his eye chapter vii oliver continues refractory noah claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace and paused not once for breath until he reached the workhouse gate having rested here for a minute or so to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror he knocked loudly at the wicket and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it that even he who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times started back in astonishment why whats the matter with the boy said the old pauper mr bumble mr bumble cried noah with well affected dismay and in tones so loud and agitated that they not only caught the ear of mr bumble himself who happened to be hard by but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hatwhich is a very curious and remarkable circumstance as showing that even a beadle acted upon by a sudden and powerful impulse may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self possession and forgetfulness of personal dignity oh mr bumble sir said noah oliver siroliver has whatwhat interposed mr bumble with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes not run away he hasnt run away has he noah no sir no not run away sir but hes turned wicious replied noah he tried to murder me sir and then he tried to murder charlotte and then missis oh what dreadful pain it is such agony please sir and here noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel like positions thereby giving mr bumble to understand that from the violent and sanguinary onset of oliver twist he had sustained severe internal injury and damage from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture when noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralyzed mr bumble he imparted additional effect thereunto by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice and rouse the indignation of the gentleman aforesaid the gentlemans notice was very soon attracted for he had not walked three paces when he turned angrily round and inquired what that young cur was howling for and why mr bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated an involuntary process its a poor boy from the free school sir replied mr bumble who has been nearly murderedall but murdered sirby young twist by jove exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat stopping short i knew it i felt a strange presentiment from the very first that that audacious young savage would come to be hung he has likewise attempted sir to murder the female servant said mr bumble with a face of ashy paleness and his missis interposed mr claypole and his master too i think you said noah added mr bumble no hes out or he would have murdered him replied noah he said he wanted to ah said he wanted todid he my boy inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat yes sir replied noah and please sir missis wants to know whether mr bumble can spare time to step up there directly and flog him cause masters out certainly my boy certainly said the gentleman in the white waistcoat smiling benignly and patting noahs head which was about three inches higher than his own youre a good boya very good boy heres a penny for you bumble just step up to sowerberrys with your cane and see whats best to be done dont spare him bumble no i will not sir replied the beadle adjusting the wax end which was twisted round the bottom of his cane for purposes of parochial flagellation tell sowerberry not to spare him either theyll never do anything with him without stripes and bruises said the gentleman in the white waistcoat ill take care sir replied the beadle and the cocked hat and cane having been by this time adjusted to their owners satisfaction mr bumble and noah claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertakers shop here the position of affairs had not at all improved or sowerberry had not yet returned and oliver continued to kick with undiminished vigour at the cellar door the accounts of his ferocity as related by mrs sowerberry and charlotte were of so startling a nature that mr bumble judged it prudent to parley before opening the door with this view he gave a kick at the outside by way of prelude and then applying his mouth to the keyhole said in a deep and impressive tone oliver come you let me out replied oliver from the inside do you know this here voice oliver said mr bumble yes replied oliver aint you afraid of it sir aint you a tremling while i speak sir said mr bumble no replied oliver boldly an answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit and was in the habit of receiving staggered mr bumble not a little he stepped back from the keyhole drew himself up to his full height and looked from one to another of the three by standers in mute astonishment oh you know mr bumble he must be mad said mrs sowerberry no boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you its not madness maam replied mr bumble after a few moments of deep meditation its meat what exclaimed mrs sowerberry meat maam meat replied bumble with stern emphasis youve overfed him maam youve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him maam unbecoming a person of his condition as the board mrs sowerberry who are practical philosophers will tell you what have paupers to do with soul or spirit either its quite enough that we let em have live bodies if you had kept the boy on gruel maam this would never have happened dear dear ejaculated mrs sowerberry piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling this comes of being liberal the liberality of mrs sowerberry to oliver had consisted in a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat so that there was a great deal of meekness and self devotion in her voluntarily remaining under mr bumbles heavy accusation of which to do her justice she was wholly innocent in thought word or deed ah said mr bumble when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again the only thing that can be done now that i know of is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so till hes a little starved down and then to take him out and keep him on gruel all through his apprenticeship he comes of a bad familyexcitable natures mrs sowerberry both the nurse and doctor said that that mother of his made her way here against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well disposed woman weeks before at this point of mr bumbles discourse oliver just hearing enough to know that some further allusion was being made to his mother recommenced kicking with a violence which rendered every other sound inaudible sowerberry returned at this juncture and olivers offence having been explained to him with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire he unlocked the cellar door in a twinkling and dragged his rebellious apprentice out by the collar olivers clothes had been torn in the beating he had received his face was bruised and scratched and his hair scattered over his forehead the angry flush had not disappeared however and when he was pulled out of his prison he scowled boldly on noah and looked quite undismayed now you are a nice young fellow aint you said sowerberry giving oliver a shake and a box on the ear he called my mother names replied oliver well and what if he did you little ungrateful wretch said mrs sowerberry she deserved what he said and worse she didnt said oliver she did said mrs sowerberry its a lie said oliver mrs sowerberry burst into a flood of tears this flood of tears left sowerberry no alternative if he had hesitated for one instant to punish oliver most severely it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established a brute an unnatural husband an insulting creature a base imitation of a man and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter to do him justice he was as far as his power wentit was not very extensivekindly disposed towards the boy perhaps because it was his interest to be so perhaps because his wife disliked him the flood of tears however left him no resource so he at once gave him a drubbing which satisfied even mrs sowerberry herself and rendered mr bumbles subsequent application of the parochial cane rather unnecessary for the rest of the day he was shut up in the back kitchen in company with a pump and a slice of bread and at night mrs sowerberry after making various remarks outside the door by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother looked into the room and amidst the jeers and pointings of noah and charlotte ordered him up stairs to his dismal bed it was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker that oliver gave way to the feelings which the days treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child he had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt he had borne the lash without a cry for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last if they had roasted him alive but now that there were none to see or hear him he fell upon his knees on the floor and hiding his face in his hands wept such tears as god send for the credit of our nature few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him for a long time oliver remained motionless in this attitude the candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet and having gazed cautiously round him and listened intently gently undid the fastenings of the door and looked abroad it was a cold dark night the stars seemed to the boys eyes further from the earth than he had ever seen them before there was no wind and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees on the earth looked sepulchral and death like from being so still he softly reclosed the door and having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had sat himself down upon a bench to wait for morning with the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters oliver rose and again unbarred the door one timid look aroundone moments pause of hesitationhe had closed it behind him and was in the open street he looked to the right and to the left uncertain whither to fly he remembered to have seen the waggons as they went out toiling up the hill he took the same route and arriving at a footpath across the fields which he knew after some distance led out again into the road struck into it and walked quickly on along this same footpath oliver well remembered he had trotted beside mr bumble when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm his way lay directly in front of the cottage his heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this and he half resolved to turn back he had come a long way though and should lose a great deal of time by doing so besides it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen so he walked on he reached the house there was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour oliver stopped and peeped into the garden a child was weeding one of the little beds and as he stopped he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions oliver felt glad to see him before he went for though younger than himself he had been his little friend and playmate they had been beaten and starved and shut up together many and many a time hush dick said oliver as the boy ran to the gate and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him is any one up nobody but me replied the child you mustnt say you saw me dick said oliver i am running away they beat and ill use me dick and i am going to seek my fortune some long way off i dont know where how pale you are i heard the doctor tell them i was dying replied the child with a faint smile i am very glad to see you dear but dont stop dont stop yes yes i will to say good bye to you replied oliver i shall see you again dick i know i shall you will be well and happy i hope so replied the child after i am dead but not before i know the doctor must be right oliver because i dream so much of heaven and angels and kind faces that i never see when i am awake kiss me said the child climbing up the low gate and flinging his little arms round olivers neck good bye dear god bless you the blessing was from a young childs lips but it was the first that oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head and through all the struggles and sufferings and troubles and changes of his after life he never once forgot it chapter viii oliver walks to london and encounters on the road a strange sort of young gentleman oliver reached the style at which the bypath terminated and once more gained the high road it was eight oclock now and though he was nearly five miles away from the town he ran and hid behind the hedges by turns till noon fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken then he sat down to rest by the side of a mile stone and began to think for the first time where he had better go and try to live the stone by which he was seated bore in large characters an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to london the name awakened a new train of ideas in the boys mind londonthat great large placenobodynot even mr bumblecould ever find him there he had often heard the old men in the workhouse too say that no lad of spirit need want in london and that there were ways of living in that vast city which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of it was the very place for a homeless boy who must die in the streets unless some one helped him as these things passed through his thoughts he jumped upon his feet and again walked forward he had diminished the distance between himself and london by full four miles more before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination as this consideration forced itself upon him he slackened his pace a little and meditated upon his means of getting there he had a crust of bread a coarse shirt and two pairs of stockings in his bundle and a pennya gift of sowerberrys after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily wellin his pocket a clean shirt thought oliver is a very comfortable thingvery and so are two pairs of darned stockings and so is a penny but they are small helps to a sixty five miles walk in winter time but olivers thoughts like those of most other people although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them so after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder and trudged on oliver walked twenty miles that day and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread and a few draughts of water which he begged at the cottage doors by the road side when the night came he turned into a meadow and creeping close under a hay rick determined to lie there till morning he felt frightened at first for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields and he was cold and hungry and more alone than he had ever felt before being very tired with his walk however he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles he felt cold and stiff when he got up next morning and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf in the very first village through which he passed he had walked no more than twelve miles when night closed in again for his feet were sore and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him another night passed in the bleak damp air only made him worse and when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along he waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage coach came up and then begged of the outside passengers but there were very few who took any notice of him and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny poor oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way but was unable to do it by reason of his fatigue and sore feet when the outsides saw this they put their halfpence back into their pockets again declaring that he was an idle young dog and didnt deserve anything and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind in some villages large painted boards were fixed up warning all persons who begged within the district that they would be sent to jail which frightened oliver very much and made him very glad to get out of them with all possible expedition in others he would stand about the inn yards and look mournfully at every one who passed a proceeding which generally terminated in the landladys ordering one of the post boys who were lounging about to drive that strange boy out of the place for she was sure he had come to steal something if he begged at a farmers house ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him and when he showed his nose in a shop they talked about the beadle which brought olivers heart into his mouthvery often the only thing he had there for many hours together in fact if it had not been for a good hearted turnpike man and a benevolent old lady olivers troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which put an end to his mothers in other words he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the kings highway but the turnpike man gave him a meal of bread and cheese and the old lady who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefooted in some distant part of the earth took pity upon the poor orphan and gave him what little she could affordand morewith such kind and gentle words and such tears of sympathy and compassion that they sank deeper into olivers soul than all the sufferings he had ever undergone early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place oliver limped slowly into the little town of barnet the window shutters were closed the street was empty not a soul had awakened to the business of the day the sun was rising in all his splendid beauty but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation as he sat with bleeding feet and covered with dust upon a cold door step by degrees the shutters were opened the window blinds were drawn up and people began passing to and fro some few stopped to gaze at oliver for a moment or two or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by but none relieved him or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there he had no heart to beg and there he sat he had been crouching on the step for some time wondering at the great number of public houses every other house in barnet is a tavern large or small gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do with ease in a few hours what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish when he was roused by observing that a boy who had passed him carelessly some minutes before had returned and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way he took little heed of this at first but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long that oliver raised his head and returned his steady look upon this the boy crossed over and walking close up to oliver said hullo my covey whats the row the boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer was about his own age but one of the queerest looking boys that oliver had ever seen he was a snub nosed flat browed common faced boy enough and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man he was short of his age with rather bow legs and little sharp ugly eyes his hat was stuck on the top of his head so slightly that it threatened to fall off every moment and would have done so very often if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch which brought it back to its old place again he wore a mans coat which reached nearly to his heels he had turned the cuffs back halfway up his arm to get his hands out of the sleeves apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers for there he kept them he was altogether as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six or something less in his bluchers hullo my covey whats the row said this strange young gentleman to oliver i am very hungry and tired replied oliver the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke i have walked a long wayi have been walking these seven days walking for sivin days said the young gentleman oh i see beaks order eh but he added noticing olivers look of surprise i suppose you dont know what a beak is my flash com pan i on oliver mildly replied that he had always heard a birds mouth described by the term in question my eyes how green exclaimed the young gentleman why a beaks a madgstrate and when you walk by a beaks order its not straight forerd but always going up and nivir coming down agen was you never on the mill what mill inquired oliver what millwhy the millthe mill as takes up so little room thatll work inside a stone jug and always goes better when the winds low with people than when its high acos then they cant get workmen but come said the young gentleman you want grub and you shall have it im at low water markonly one bob and a magpie but as far as it goes ill fork out and stump up with you on your pins there now then morrice assisting oliver to rise the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandlers shop where he purchased a sufficiency of ready dressed ham and a half quartern loaf or as he himself expressed it a fourpenny bran the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb and stuffing it therein taking the bread under his arm the young gentleman turned into a small public house and led the way to a tap room in the rear of the premises here a pot of beer was brought in by the direction of the mysterious youth and oliver falling to at his new friends bidding made a long and hearty meal during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention going to london said the strange boy when oliver had at length concluded yes got any lodgings no money no the strange boy whistled and put his arms into his pockets as far as the big coat sleeves would let them go do you live in london inquired oliver yes i do when im at home replied the boy i suppose you want some place to sleep in to night dont you i do indeed answered oliver i have not slept under a roof since i left the country dont fret your eyelids on that score said the young gentleman ive got to be in london to night and i know a spectable old genelman as lives there wotll give you lodgings for nothink and never ask for the change that is if any genelman he knows interduces you and dont he know meoh nonot in the leastby no meanscertainly not the young gentleman smiled as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical and finished the beer as he did so this unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted especially as it was immediately followed up by the assurance that the old gentleman already referred to would doubtless provide oliver with a comfortable place without loss of time this led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue from which oliver discovered that his friends name was jack dawkins and that he was a peculiar pet and proteg of the elderly gentleman before mentioned mr dawkinss appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patrons interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection but as he had a rather flighty and dissolute mode of conversing and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the soubriquet of the artful dodger oliver concluded that being of a dissipated and careless turn the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him under this impression he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible and if he found the dodger incorrigible as he more than half suspected he should to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance as john dawkins objected to their entering london before nightfall it was nearly eleven oclock when they reached the turnpike at islington they crossed from the angel into st johns road struck down the small street which terminates at sadlers wells theatre through exmouth street and coppice row down the little court by the side of the workhouse across the classic ground which once bore the name of hockley in the hole thence into little saffron hill and so into saffron hill the great along which the dodger scudded at a rapid pace directing oliver to follow close at his heels although oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way as he passed along a dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen the street was very narrow and muddy and the air was impregnated with filthy odours there were a good many small shops but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children who even at that time of night were crawling in and out at the doors or screaming from the inside the sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place were the public houses and in them the lowest orders of irish who are generally the lowest orders of anything were wrangling with might and main covered ways and yards which here and there diverged from the main street disclosed little knots of houses where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in the filth and from several of the door ways great ill looking fellows were cautiously emerging bound to all appearance upon no very well disposed or harmless errands oliver was just considering whether he hadnt better run away when they reached the bottom of the hill his conductor catching him by the arm pushed open the door of a house near field lane and drawing him into the passage closed it behind them now then cried a voice from below in reply to a whistle from the dodger plummy and slam was the reply this seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the farther end of the passage and a mans face peeped out from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away theres two on you said the man thrusting the candle farther out and shading his eyes with his hand whos the tother one a new pal replied jack dawkins pulling oliver forward where did he come from greenland is fagin up stairs yes hes a sortin the wipes up with you the candle was drawn back and the face disappeared oliver groping his way with one hand and with the other firmly grasped by his companion ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them he threw open the door of a back room and drew oliver in after him the walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt there was a deal table before the fire upon which was a candle stuck in a ginger beer bottle two or three pewter pots a loaf and butter and a plate in a frying pan which was on the fire and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string some sausages were cooking and standing over them with a toasting fork in his hand was a very old shrivelled jew whose villanous looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair he was dressed in a greasy flannel gown with his throat bare and seemed to be dividing his attention between the frying pan and a clothes horse over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging several rough beds made of old sacks were huddled side by side on the floor and seated round the table were four or five boys none older than the dodger smoking long clay pipes and drinking spirits with the air of middle aged men these all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the jew and then turned round and grinned at oliver as did the jew himself toasting fork in hand illustration oliver introduced to the respectable old gentleman this is him fagin said jack dawkins my friend oliver twist the jew grinned and making a low obeisance to oliver took him by the hand and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance upon this the young gentlemen with the pipes came round him and shook both his hands very hardespecially the one in which he held his little bundle one young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets in order that as he was very tired he might not have the trouble of emptying them when he went to bed these civilities would probably have been extended much further but for a liberal exercise of the jews toasting fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them we are very glad to see you oliververy said the jew dodger take off the sausages and draw a tub near the fire for oliver ah youre a staring at the pocket handkerchiefs eh my dear there are a good many of em aint there weve just looked em out ready for the wash thats all oliver thats all ha ha ha the latter part of this speech was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman in the midst of which they went to supper oliver ate his share and the jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin and water telling him he must drink it off directly because another gentleman wanted the tumbler oliver did as he was desired almost instantly afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks and then he sunk into a deep sleep chapter ix containing further particulars concerning the pleasant old gentleman and his hopeful pupils it was late next morning when oliver awoke from a sound long sleep there was no other person in the room but the old jew who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round with an iron spoon he would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below and when he had satisfied himself he would go on whistling and stirring again as before although oliver had roused himself from sleep he was not thoroughly awake there is a drowsy state between sleeping and waking when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness at such times a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers its bounding from earth and spurning time and space when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate oliver was precisely in this condition he saw the jew with his half closed eyes heard his low whistling and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepans sides and yet the self same senses were mentally engaged at the same time in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known when the coffee was done the jew drew the saucepan to the hob and standing in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes as if he did not well know how to employ himself turned round and looked at oliver and called him by his name he did not answer and was to all appearance asleep after satisfying himself upon this head the jew stepped gently to the door which he fastened he then drew forth as it seemed to oliver from some trap in the floor a small box which he placed carefully on the table his eyes glistened as he raised the lid and looked in dragging an old chair to the table he sat down and took from it a magnificent gold watch sparkling with diamonds aha said the jew shrugging up his shoulders and distorting every feature with a hideous grin clever dogs clever dogsstaunch to the last never told the old parson where they were never peached upon old fagin and why should they it wouldnt have loosened the knot or kept the drop up a minute longer no no no fine fellowsfine fellows with these and other muttered reflections of the like nature the jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety at least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box and surveyed with equal pleasure besides rings brooches bracelets and other articles of jewellery of such magnificent materials and costly workmanship that oliver had no idea even of their names having replaced these trinkets the jew took out another so small that it lay in the palm of his hand there seemed to be some very minute inscription on it for the jew laid it flat upon the table and shading it with his hand pored over it long and earnestly at length he put it down as if despairing of success and leaning back in his chair muttered what a fine thing capital punishment is dead men never repent dead men never bring awkward stories to light ah its a fine thing for the trade five of them sprung up in a row and none left to play booty or turn white livered as the jew uttered these words his bright dark eyes which had been staring vacantly before him fell on olivers face the boys eyes were fixed on his in mute curiosity and although the recognition was only for an instantfor the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceivedit was enough to show the old man that he had been observed he closed the lid of the box with a loud crash and laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table started furiously up he trembled very much though for even in his terror oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air whats that said the jew what do you watch me for why are you awake what have you seen speak out boy quickquick for your life i wasnt able to sleep any longer sir replied oliver meekly i am very sorry if i have disturbed you sir you were not awake an hour ago said the jew scowling fiercely on the boy nono indeed sir replied oliver are you sure cried the jew with a still fiercer look than before and a threatening attitude upon my word i was not sir replied oliver earnestly i was not indeed sir tush tush my dear said the jew abruptly resuming his old manner and playing with the knife a little before he laid it down as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up in mere sport of course i know that my dear i only tried to frighten you youre a brave boy ha ha youre a brave boy oliver and the jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle but looked uneasily at the box notwithstanding did you see any of these pretty things my dear said the jew laying his hand upon it after a short pause yes sir replied oliver ah said the jew turning rather pale theytheyre mine oliver my little property all i have to live upon in my old age the folks call me a miser my dearonly a miser thats all oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place with so many watches but thinking that perhaps his fondness for the dodger and the other boys cost him a good deal of money he only cast a deferential look at the jew and asked if he might get up certainly my dearcertainly replied the old gentleman stay theres a pitcher of water in the corner by the door bring it here and ill give you a basin to wash in my dear oliver got up walked across the room and stooped for one instant to raise the pitcher when he turned his head the box was gone he had scarcely washed himself and made everything tidy by emptying the basin out of the window agreeably to the jews directions than the dodger returned accompanied by a very sprightly young friend whom oliver had seen smoking on the previous night and who was now formally introduced to him as charley bates the four sat down to breakfast upon the coffee and some hot rolls and ham which the dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat well said the jew glancing slyly at oliver and addressing himself to the dodger i hope youve been at work this morning my dears hard replied the dodger as nails added charley bates good boys good boys said the jew what have you got dodger a couple of pocket books replied that young gentleman lined inquired the jew with trembling eagerness pretty well replied the dodger producing two pocket books one green and the other red not so heavy as they might be said the jew after looking at the insides carefully but very neat and nicely made ingenious workman aint he oliver very indeed sir said oliver at which mr charles bates laughed uproariously very much to the amazement of oliver who saw nothing to laugh at in anything that had passed and what have you got my dear said fagin to charley bates wipes replied master bates at the same time producing four pocket handkerchiefs well said the jew inspecting them closely theyre very good onesvery you havent marked them well though charley so the marks shall be picked out with a needle and well teach oliver how to do it shall us oliver ehha ha ha if you please sir said oliver youd like to be able to make pocket handkerchiefs as easy as charley bates wouldnt you my dear said the jew very much indeed if youll teach me sir replied oliver master bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply that he burst into another laugh which laugh meeting the coffee he was drinking and carrying it down some wrong channel very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation he is so jolly green said charley when he recovered as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour the dodger said nothing but he smoothed olivers hair down over his eyes and said hed know better by and by upon which the old gentleman observing olivers colour mounting changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning this made him wonder more and more for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there and oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious when the breakfast was cleared away the merry old gentleman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game which was performed in this waythe merry old gentleman placing a snuff box in one pocket of his trousers a note case in the other and a watch in his waistcoat pocket with a guard chain round his neckand sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt buttoned his coat tight round him and putting his spectacle case and handkerchief in the pockets trotted up and down the room with a stick in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets every hour in the day sometimes he stopped at the fire place and sometimes at the door making belief that he was staring with all his might into shop windows at such times he would look constantly round him for fear of thieves and keep slapping all his pockets in turn to see that he hadnt lost anything in such a very funny and natural manner that oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face all this time the two boys followed him closely about getting out of his sight so nimbly every time he turned round that it was impossible to follow their motions at last the dodger trod upon his toes or ran upon his boot accidentally while charley bates stumbled up against him behind and in that one moment they took from him with the most extraordinary rapidity snuff box note case watch guard chain shirt pin pocket handkerchiefeven the spectacle case if the old gentleman felt a hand in any one of his pockets he cried out where it was and then the game began all over again when this game had been played a great many times a couple of young ladies came to see the young gentlemen one of whom was called bet and the other nancy they wore a good deal of hair not very neatly turned up behind and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings they were not exactly pretty perhaps but they had a great deal of colour in their faces and looked quite stout and hearty being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners oliver thought them very nice girls indeed as there is no doubt they were these visitors stopped a long time spirits were produced in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn at length charley bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof which it occurred to oliver must be french for going out for directly afterwards the dodger and charley and the two young ladies went away together having been kindly furnished with money to spend by the amiable old jew there my dear said fagin thats a pleasant life isnt it they have gone out for the day have they done work sir inquired oliver yes said the jew that is unless they should unexpectedly come across any when they are out and they wont neglect it if they do my dear depend upon it make em your models my dear make em your models said the jew tapping the fire shovel on the hearth to add force to his words do everything they bid you and take their advice in all matters especially the dodgers my dear hell be a great man himself and make you one too if you take pattern by him is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket my dear said the jew stopping short yes sir said oliver see if you can take it out without my feeling it as you saw them do when we were at play this morning oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand as he had seen the dodger hold it and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other is it gone cried the jew here it is sir said oliver showing it in his hand youre a clever boy my dear said the playful old gentleman patting oliver on the head approvingly i never saw a sharper lad heres a shilling for you if you go on in this way youll be the greatest man of the time and now come here and ill show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs oliver wondered what picking the old gentlemans pocket in play had to do with his chances of being a great man but thinking that the jew being so much his senior must know best followed him quietly to the table and was soon deeply involved in his new study chapter x oliver becomes better acquainted with the characters of his new associates and purchases experience at a high price being a short but very important chapter in this history for many days oliver remained in the jews room picking the marks out of the pocket handkerchiefs of which a great number were brought home and sometimes taking part in the game already described which the two boys and the jew played regularly every morning at length he began to languish for the fresh air and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentlemans character whenever the dodger or charley bates came home at night empty handed he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits and enforce upon them the necessity of an active life by sending them supperless to bed upon one occasion indeed he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent at length one morning oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought there had been no handkerchiefs to work upon for two or three days and the dinners had been rather meagre perhaps these were reasons for the old gentlemans giving his assent but whether they were or no he told oliver he might go and placed him under the joint guardianship of charley bates and his friend the dodger the three boys sallied out the dodger with his coat sleeves tucked up and his hat cocked as usual master bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets and oliver between them wondering where they were going and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in first the pace at which they went was such a very lazy ill looking saunter that oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman by not going to work at all the dodger had a vicious propensity too of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas while charley bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction these things looked so bad that oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back in the best way he could when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the dodger they were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in clerkenwell which is yet called by some strange perversion of terms the green when the dodger made a sudden stop and laying his finger on his lip drew his companions back again with the greatest caution and circumspection whats the matter demanded oliver hush replied the dodger do you see that old cove at the book stall the old gentleman over the way said oliver yes i see him hell do said the dodger a prime plant observed charley bates oliver looked from one to the other with the greatest surprise but was not permitted to make any inquiries for the two boys walked stealthily across the road and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed oliver walked a few paces after them and not knowing whether to advance or retire stood looking on in silent amazement the old gentleman was a very respectable looking personage with a powdered head and gold spectacles dressed in a bottle green coat with a black velvet collar and white trousers with a smart bamboo cane under his arm he had taken up a book from the stall and there he stood reading away as hard as if he were in his elbow chair in his own study it was very possible that he fancied himself there indeed for it was plain from his utter abstraction that he saw not the book stall nor the street nor the boys nor in short anything but the book itself which he was reading straight through turning over the leaves when he got to the bottom of a page beginning at the top line of the next one and going regularly on with the greatest interest and eagerness illustration oliver amazed at the dodgers mode of going to work what was olivers horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go to see the dodger plunge his hand into this old gentlemans pocket and draw from thence a handkerchief which he handed to charley bates and with which they both ran away round the corner at full speed in one instant the whole mystery of the handkerchiefs and the watches and the jewels and the jew rushed upon the boys mind he stood for a moment with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror that he felt as if he were in a burning fire then confused and frightened he took to his heels and not knowing what he did made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground this was all done in a minutes space and the very instant that oliver began to run the old gentleman putting his hand to his pocket and missing his handkerchief turned sharp round seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator and shouting stop thief with all his might made off after him book in hand but the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue and cry the dodger and master bates unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner they no sooner heard the cry and saw oliver running than guessing exactly how the matter stood they issued forth with great promptitude and shouting stop thief too joined in the pursuit like good citizens although oliver had been brought up by philosophers he was not theoretically acquainted with their beautiful axiom that self preservation is the first law of nature if he had been perhaps he would have been prepared for this not being prepared however it alarmed him the more so away he went like the wind with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him stop thiefstop thief there is a magic in the sound the tradesman leaves his counter and the carman his waggon the butcher throws down his tray the baker his basket the milk man his pail the errand boy his parcels the schoolboy his marbles the paviour his pick axe the child his battledore away they run pell mell helter skelter slap dash tearing yelling and screaming knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners rousing up the dogs and astonishing the fowls and streets squares and courts re echo with the sound stop thiefstop thief the cry is taken up by a hundred voices and the crowd accumulate at every turning away they fly splashing through the mud and rattling along the pavements up go the windows out run the people onward bear the mob a whole audience desert punch in the very thickest of the plot and joining the rushing throng swell the shout and lend fresh vigour to the cry stop thiefstop thief stop thiefstop thief there is a passion for hunting something deeply implanted in the human breast one wretched breathless child panting with exhaustion terror in his looks agony in his eye large drops of perspiration streaming down his face strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers and as they follow on his track and gain upon him every instant they hail his decreasing strength with still louder shouts and whoop and scream with joy stop thiefay stop him for gods sake were it only in mercy stopped at last a clever blow that he is down upon the pavement and the crowd eagerly gather round him each new comer jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse stand asidegive him a little airnonsense he dont deserve itwheres the gentlemanhere he is coming down the streetmake room there for the gentlemanis this the boy siryes oliver lay covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers and made this reply to their anxious inquiries yes said the gentleman in a benevolent voice i am afraid it is afraid murmured the crowd thats a good un poor fellow said the gentleman he has hurt himself i did that sir said a great lubberly fellow stepping forward and preciously i cut my knuckle gain his mouth i stopped him sir the fellow touched his hat with a grin expecting something for his pains but the old gentleman eyeing him with an expression of disgust looked anxiously round as if he contemplated running away himself which it is very possible he might have attempted to do and thus afforded another chase had not a police officer who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases at that moment made his way through the crowd and seized oliver by the collar come get up said the man roughly it wasnt me indeed sir indeed indeed it was two other boys said oliver clasping his hands passionately and looking round they are here somewhere oh no they aint said the officer he meant this to be ironical but it was true besides for the dodger and charley bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to come get up dont hurt him said the old gentleman compassionately oh no i wont hurt him replied the officer tearing his jacket half off his back in proof thereof come i know you it wont do will you stand upon your legs you young devil oliver who could hardly stand made a shift to raise himself upon his feet and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket collar at a rapid pace the gentleman walked on with them by the officers side and as many of the crowd as could got a little a head and stared back at oliver from time to time the boys shouted in triumph and on they went chapter xi treats of mr fang the police magistrate and furnishes a slight specimen of his mode of administering justice the offence had been committed within the district and indeed in the immediate neighbourhood of a very notorious metropolitan police office the crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying oliver through two or three streets and down a place called mutton hill when he was led beneath a low arch way and up a dirty court into this dispensary of summary justice by the back way it was a small paved yard into which they turned and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face and a bunch of keys in his hand whats the matter now said the man carelessly a young fogle hunter replied the man who had oliver in charge are you the party thats been robbed sir inquired the man with the keys yes i am replied the old gentleman but i am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief ii would rather not press the case must go before the magistrate now sir replied the man his worship will be disengaged in half a minute now young gallows this was an invitation for oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke and which led into a stone cell here he was searched and nothing being found upon him locked up this cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar only not so light it was most intolerably dirty for it was monday morning and it had been tenanted by six drunken people who had been locked up elsewhere since saturday night but this is nothing in our station houses men and women are every night confined on the most trivial chargesthe word is worth notingin dungeons compared with which those in newgate occupied by the most atrocious felons tried found guilty and under sentence of death are palaces let any man who doubts this compare the two the old gentleman looked almost as rueful as oliver when the key grated in the lock and turned with a sigh to the book which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance there is something in that boys face said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away tapping his chin with the cover of the book in a thoughtful manner something that touches and interests me can he be innocent he looked like by the bye exclaimed the old gentleman halting very abruptly and staring up into the sky god bless my soulwhere have i seen something like that look before after musing for some minutes the old gentleman walked with the same meditative face into a back ante room opening from the yard and there retiring into a corner called up before his minds eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years no said the old gentleman shaking his head it must be imagination he wandered over them again he had called them into view and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them there were the faces of friends and foes and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women there were others that the grave had changed to ghastly trophies of death but which the mind superior to his power still dressed in their old freshness and beauty calling back the lustre of the eyes the brightness of the smile the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb changed but to be heightened and taken from earth only to be set up as a light to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to heaven but the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which olivers features bore a trace so he heaved a sigh over the recollections he had awakened and being happily for himself an absent old gentleman buried them again in the pages of the musty book he was roused by a touch on the shoulder and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office he closed his book hastily and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned mr fang the office was a front parlour with a paneled wall mr fang sat behind a bar at the upper end and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little oliver was already deposited trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene mr fang was a middle sized man with no great quantity of hair and what he had growing on the back and sides of his head his face was stern and much flushed if he were really not in the habit of taking rather more than was exactly good for him he might have brought an action against his countenance for libel and have recovered heavy damages the old gentleman bowed respectfully and advancing to the magistrates desk said suiting the action to the word that is my name and address sir he then withdrew a pace or two and with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head waited to be questioned now it so happened that mr fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning adverting to some recent decision of his and commending him for the three hundred and fiftieth time to the special and particular notice of the secretary of state for the home department he was out of temper and he looked up with an angry scowl who are you said mr fang the old gentleman pointed with some surprise to his card officer said mr fang tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper who is this fellow my name sir said the old gentleman speaking like a gentlemanmy name sir is brownlow permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable man under the protection of the bench saying this mr brownlow looked round the office as if in search of some person who would afford him the required information officer said mr fang throwing the paper on one side whats this fellow charged with hes not charged at all your worship replied the officer he appears against the boy your worship his worship knew this perfectly well but it was a good annoyance and a safe one appears against the boy does he said fang surveying mr brownlow contemptuously from head to foot swear him before i am sworn i must beg to say one word said mr brownlow and that is that i never without actual experience could have believed hold your tongue sir said mr fang peremptorily i will not sir replied the old gentleman hold your tongue this instant or ill have you turned out of the office said mr fang youre an insolent impertinent fellow how dare you bully a magistrate what exclaimed the old gentleman reddening swear this person said fang to the clerk ill not hear another word swear him mr brownlows indignation was greatly roused but reflecting that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once now said fang whats the charge against this boy what have you got to say sir i was standing at a book stall mr brownlow began hold your tongue sir said mr fang policemanwheres the policeman here swear this man now policeman what is this the policeman with becoming humility related how he had taken the charge how he had searched oliver and found nothing on his person and how that was all he knew about it are there any witnesses inquired mr fang none your worship replied the policeman mr fang sat silent for some minutes and then turning round to the prosecutor said in a towering passion do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is fellow or do you not you have been sworn now if you stand there refusing to give evidence ill punish you for disrespect to the bench i will by by what or by whom nobody knows for the clerk and jailer coughed very loud just at the right moment and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor thus preventing the word from being heardaccidentally of course with many interruptions and repeated insults mr brownlow contrived to state his case observing that in the surprise of the moment he had run after the boy because he saw him running away and expressing his hope that if the magistrate should believe him although not actually the thief to be connected with thieves he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow he has been hurt already said the old gentleman in conclusion and i fear he added with great energy looking towards the bari really fear that he is very ill oh yes i dare say said mr fang with a sneer come none of your tricks here you young vagabond they wont do whats your name oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him he was deadly pale and the whole place seemed turning round and round whats your name you hardened scoundrel thundered mr fang officer whats his name this was addressed to a bluff old fellow in a striped waistcoat who was standing by the bar he bent over oliver and repeated the inquiry but finding him really incapable of understanding the question and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more and add to the severity of his sentence he hazarded a guess he says his names tom white your worship said this kind hearted thief taker oh he wont speak out wont he said fang very well very well where does he live where he can your worship replied the officer again pretending to receive olivers answer has he any parents inquired mr fang he says they died in his infancy your worship replied the officer hazarding the usual reply at this point of the inquiry oliver raised his head and looking round with imploring eyes murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water stuff and nonsense said mr fang dont try to make a fool of me i think he really is ill your worship remonstrated the officer i know better said mr fang take care of him officer said the old gentleman raising his hands instinctively hell fall down stand away officer cried fang savagely let him if he likes oliver availed himself of the kind permission and fell heavily to the floor in a fainting fit the men in the office looked at each other but no one dared to stir i knew he was shamming said fang as if this were incontestable proof of the fact let him lie hell soon be tired of that how do you propose to deal with the case sir inquired the clerk in a low voice summarily replied mr fang he stands committed for three monthshard labour of course clear the office the door was opened for this purpose and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance clad in an old suit of black rushed hastily into the office and advanced to the bench stop stopdont take him awayfor heavens sake stop a moment cried the new comer breathless with haste although the presiding geniuses in such an office as this exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties the good name the character almost the lives of her majestys subjects especially of the poorer class and although within such walls enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels weep hot tears of blood they are closed to the public save through the medium of the daily press mr fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder what is thiswho is this turn this man out clear the office cried mr fang i will speak cried the man i will not be turned outi saw it all i keep the book stall i demand to be sworn i will not be put down mr fang you must hear me you dare not refuse sir the man was right his manner was bold and determined and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up swear the fellow growled fang with a very ill grace now man what have you got to say this said the man i saw three boystwo others and the prisoner hereloitering on the opposite side of the way when this gentleman was reading the robbery was committed by another boy i saw it done and i saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it having by this time recovered a little breath the worthy book stall keeper proceeded to relate in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery why didnt you come here before said fang after a pause i hadnt a soul to mind the shop replied the man everybody that could have helped me had joined in the pursuit i could get nobody till five minutes ago and ive run here all the way the prosecutor was reading was he inquired fang after another pause yes replied the man the very book he has in his hand oh that book eh said fang is it paid for no it is not replied the man with a smile dear me i forgot all about it exclaimed the absent old gentleman innocently a nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy said fang with a comical effort to look humane i consider sir that you have obtained possession of that book under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute let this be a lesson to you my man or the law will overtake you yet the boy is discharged clear the office dn me cried the old gentleman bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long dme ill clear the office roared the magistrate officers do you hear clear the office the mandate was obeyed and the indignant mr brownlow was conveyed out with the book in one hand and the bamboo cane in the other in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance he reached the yard and it vanished in a moment little oliver twist lay on his back on the pavement with his shirt unbuttoned and his temples bathed with water his face a deadly white and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame poor boy poor boy said mr brownlow bending over him call a coach somebody praydirectly a coach was obtained and oliver having been carefully laid on one seat the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other may i accompany you said the book stall keeper looking in bless me yes my dear friend said mr brownlow quickly i forgot you dear dear i have this unhappy book still jump in poor fellow theres no time to lose the book stall keeper got into the coach and away they drove chapter xii in which oliver is taken better care of than he ever was before with some particulars concerning a certain picture the coach rattled away down mount pleasant and up exmouth streetover nearly the same ground as that which oliver had traversed when he first entered london in company with the dodgerand turning a different way when it reached the angel at islington stopped at length before a neat house in a quiet shady street near pentonville here a bed was prepared without loss of time in which mr brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited and here he was tended with a kindness and solicitude which knew no bounds but for many days oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends the sun rose and sunk and rose and sunk again and many times after that and still the boy lay stretched upon his uneasy bed dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of feverthat heat which like the subtle acid that gnaws into the very heart of hardest iron burns only to corrode and to destroy the worm does not his work more surely on the dead body than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame weak and thin and pallid he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream feebly raising himself in the bed with his head resting on his trembling arm he looked anxiously round what room is thiswhere have i been brought to said oliver this is not the place i went to sleep in he uttered these words in a feeble voice being very faint and weak but they were overheard at once for the curtain at the beds head was hastily drawn back and a motherly old lady very neatly and precisely dressed rose as she undrew it from an arm chair close by in which she had been sitting at needle work hush my dear said the old lady softly you must be very quiet or you will be ill again and you have been very badas bad as bad could be pretty nigh lie down againtheres a dear with these words the old lady very gently placed olivers head upon the pillow and smoothing back his hair from his forehead looked so kindly and lovingly in his face that he could not help placing his little withered hand upon hers and drawing it round his neck save us said the old lady with tears in her eyes what a grateful little dear it is pretty creetur what would his mother feel if she had sat by him as i have and could see him now perhaps she does see me whispered oliver folding his hands together perhaps she has sat by me maam i almost feel as if she had that was the fever my dear said the old lady mildly i suppose it was replied oliver thoughtfully because heaven is a long way off and they are too happy there to come down to the bedside of a poor boy but if she knew i was ill she must have pitied me even there for she was very ill herself before she died she cant know anything about me though added oliver after a moments silence for if she had seen me beat it would have made her sorrowful and her face has always looked sweet and happy when i have dreamt of her the old lady made no reply to this but wiping her eyes first and her spectacles which lay on the counterpane afterwards as if they were part and parcel of those features brought some cool stuff for oliver to drink and then patting him on the cheek told him he must lie very quiet or he would be ill again so oliver kept very still partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things and partly to tell the truth because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said he soon fell into a gentle doze from which he was awakened by the light of a candle which being brought near the bed showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud ticking gold watch in his hand who felt his pulse and said he was a great deal better you are a great deal better are you not my dear said the gentleman yes thank you sir replied oliver yes i know you are said the gentleman youre hungry too ant you no sir answered oliver hem said the gentleman no i know youre not he is not hungry mrs bedwin said the gentleman looking very wise the old lady made a respectful inclination of the head which seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man the doctor appeared very much of the same opinion himself you feel sleepy dont you my dear said the doctor no sir replied oliver no said the doctor with a very shrewd and satisfied look youre not sleepy nor thirsty are you yes sir rather thirsty answered oliver just as i expected mrs bedwin said the doctor its very natural that he should be thirstyperfectly natural you may give him a little tea maam and some dry toast without any butter dont keep him too warm maam but be careful that you dont let him be too coldwill you have the goodness the old lady dropped a curtsey and the doctor after tasting the cool stuff and expressing a qualified approval thereof hurried away his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went down stairs oliver dozed off again soon after this and when he awoke it was nearly twelve oclock the old lady tenderly bade him good night shortly afterwards and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come bringing with her in a little bundle a small prayer book and a large nightcap putting the latter on her head and the former on the table the old woman after telling oliver that she had come to sit up with him drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward and divers moans and chokings which however had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard and then fall asleep again and thus the night crept slowly on oliver lay awake for some time counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight shade threw upon the ceiling or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall the darkness and deep stillness of the room were very solemn and as they brought into the boys mind the thought that death had been hovering there for many days and nights and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence he turned his face upon the pillow and fervently prayed to heaven gradually he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from who if this were death would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of lifeto all its cares for the present its anxieties for the future and more than all its weary recollections of the past it had been bright day for hours when oliver opened his eyes and when he did so he felt cheerful and happy the crisis of the disease was safely past and he belonged to the world again in three days time he was able to sit in an easy chair well propped up with pillows and as he was still too weak to walk mrs bedwin had him carried down stairs into the little house keepers room which belonged to her where having sat him up by the fireside the good old lady sat herself down too and being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better forthwith began to cry most violently never mind me my dear said the old lady im only having a regular good cry there its all over now and im quite comfortable youre very very kind to me maam said oliver well never you mind that my dear said the old lady thats got nothing to do with your broth and its full time you had it for the doctor says mr brownlow may come in to see you this morning and we must get up our best looks because the better we look the more hell be pleased and with this the old lady applied herself to warming up in a little saucepan a basin full of broth strong enough to furnish an ample dinner when reduced to the regulation strength for three hundred and fifty paupers at the very lowest computation are you fond of pictures dear inquired the old lady seeing that oliver had fixed his eyes most intently on a portrait which hung against the wall just opposite his chair i dont quite know maam said oliver without taking his eyes from the canvass i have seen so few that i hardly know what a beautiful mild face that ladys is ah said the old lady painters always make ladies out prettier than they are or they wouldnt get any custom child the man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed its a deal too honesta deal said the old lady laughing very heartily at her own acuteness isis that a likeness maam said oliver yes said the old lady looking up for a moment from the broth thats a portrait whose maam asked oliver eagerly why really my dear i dont know answered the old lady in a good humoured manner its not a likeness of anybody that you or i know i expect it seems to strike your fancy dear it is so very prettyso very beautiful replied oliver why sure youre not afraid of it said the old lady observing in great surprise the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting oh no no returned oliver quickly but the eyes look so sorrowful and where i sit they seem fixed upon me it makes my heart beat added oliver in a low voice as if it was alive and wanted to speak to me but couldnt lord save us exclaimed the old lady starting dont talk in that way child youre weak and nervous after your illness let me wheel your chair round to the other side and then you wont see it there said the old lady suiting the action to the word you dont see it now at all events oliver did see it in his minds eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady so he smiled gently when she looked at him and mrs bedwin satisfied that he felt more comfortable salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition and had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful when there came a soft tap at the door come in said the old lady and in walked mr brownlow now the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be but he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressing gown to take a good long look at oliver than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up out of respect to his benefactor which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again and the fact is if the truth must be told that mr brownlows heart being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition forced a supply of tears into his eyes by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain illustration oliver recovering from the fever poor boy poor boy said mr brownlow clearing his throat im rather hoarse this morning mrs bedwin im afraid i have caught cold i hope not sir said mrs bedwin everything you have had has been well aired sir i dont know bedwini dont know said mr brownlow i rather think i had a damp napkin at dinner time yesterday but never mind that how do you feel my dear very happy sir replied oliver and very grateful indeed sir for your goodness to me good boy said mr brownlow stoutly have you given him any nourishment bedwinany slops eh he has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth sir replied mrs bedwin drawing herself up slightly and laying a strong emphasis on the last word to intimate that between slops and broth well compounded there existed no affinity or connexion whatsoever ugh said mr brownlow with a slight shudder a couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more goodwouldnt they tom whiteeh my name is oliver sir replied the little invalid with a look of great astonishment oliver said mr brownlow oliver what oliver whiteeh no sir twistoliver twist queer name said the old gentleman what made you tell the magistrate your name was white i never told him so sir returned oliver in amazement this sounded so like a falsehood that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in olivers face it was impossible to doubt him there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments some mistake said mr brownlow but although his motive for looking steadily at oliver no longer existed the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly that he could not withdraw his gaze i hope you are not angry with me sir said oliver raising his eyes beseechingly no no replied the old gentlemangracious god whats thisbedwin look look there as he spoke he pointed hastily to the picture above olivers head and then to the boys face there was its living copythe eyes the head the mouth every feature was the same the expression was for the instant so precisely alike that the minutest line seemed copied with an accuracy which was perfectly unearthly oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation for he was not strong enough to bear the start it gave him and he fainted away chapter xiii reverts to the merry old gentleman and his youthful friends through whom a new acquaintance is introduced to the intelligent reader and connected with whom various pleasant matters are related appertaining to this history when the dodger and his accomplished friend master bates joined in the hue and cry which was raised at olivers heels in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of mr brownlows personal property as has been already described with great perspicuity in a foregoing chapter they were actuated as we therein took occasion to observe by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true hearted englishman so i need hardly beg the reader to observe that this action must tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound judging philosophers have laid down as the mainsprings of all natures deeds and actions the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good ladys proceedings to matters of maxim and theory and by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart or generous impulse and feeling as matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be so far beyond the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex if i wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament i should at once find it in the fact also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative of their quitting the pursuit when the general attention was fixed upon oliver and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut for although i do not mean to assert that it is the practice of renowned and learned sages at all to shorten the road to any great conclusion their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas are prone to indulge still i do mean to say and do say distinctly that it is the invariable practice of all mighty philosophers in carrying out their theories to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves thus to do a great right you may do a little wrong and you may take any means which the end to be attained will justify the amount of the right or the amount of the wrong or indeed the distinction between the two being left entirely to the philosopher concerned to be settled and determined by his clear comprehensive and impartial view of his own particular case it was not until the two boys had scoured with great rapidity through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts that they ventured to halt by one consent beneath a low and dark archway having remained silent here just long enough to recover breath to speak master bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight and bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter flung himself upon a door step and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth whats the matter inquired the dodger ha ha ha roared charley bates hold your noise remonstrated the dodger looking cautiously round do you want to be grabbed stupid i cant help it said charley i cant help it to see him splitting away at that pace and cutting round the corners and knocking up against the posts and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them and me with the wipe in my pocket singing out arter himoh my eye the vivid imagination of master bates presented the scene before him in too strong colours as he arrived at this apostrophe he again rolled upon the door step and laughed louder than before whatll fagin say inquired the dodger taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question what repeated charley bates ah what said the dodger why what should he say inquired charley stopping rather suddenly in his merriment for the dodgers manner was impressive what should he say mr dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes and then taking off his hat scratched his head and nodded thrice what do you mean said charley toor rul lol loo gammon and spinnage the frog he wouldnt and high cockolorum said the dodger with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance this was explanatory but not satisfactory master bates felt it so and again said what do you mean the dodger made no reply but putting his hat on again and gathering the skirts of his long tailed coat under his arms thrust his tongue into his cheek slapped the bridge of his nose some half dozen times in a familiar but expressive manner and turning on his heel slunk down the court master bates followed with a thoughtful countenance the noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his left hand a pocket knife in his right and a pewter pot on the trivet there was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows bent his ear towards the door and listened intently why hows this muttered the jew changing countenance only two of em wheres the third they cant have got into trouble hark the footsteps approached nearer they reached the landing the door was slowly opened and the dodger and charley bates entered and closed it behind them wheres oliver said the furious jew rising with a menacing look wheres the boy the young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence and looked uneasily at each other but made no reply whats become of the boy said the jew seizing the dodger tightly by the collar and threatening him with horrid imprecations speak out or ill throttle you mr fagin looked so very much in earnest that charley bates who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side and conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second dropped upon his knees and raised a loud well sustained and continuous roar something between an insane bull and a speaking trumpet will you speak thundered the jew shaking the dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all seemed perfectly miraculous why the traps have got him and thats all about it said the dodger sullenly come let go o me will you and swinging himself at one jerk clean out of the big coat which he left in the jews hands the dodger snatched up the toasting fork and made a pass at the merry old gentlemans waistcoat which if it had taken effect would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced in a month or two the jew stepped back in this emergency with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude and seizing up the pot prepared to hurl it at his assailants head but charley bates at this moment calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl he suddenly altered its destination and flung it full at that young gentleman why what the blazes is in the wind now growled a deep voice who pitched that ere at me its well its the beer and not the pot as hit me or id have settled somebody i might have knowd as nobody but an infernal rich plundering thundering old jew could afford to throw away any drink but water and not that unless he done the river company every quarter wots it all about fagin dme if my neckankecher ant lined with beer come in you sneaking warmint wot are you stopping outside for as if you was ashamed of your master come in the man who growled out these words was a stoutly built fellow of about five and thirty in a black velveteen coat very soiled drab breeches lace up half boots and grey cotton stockings which enclosed a very bulky pair of legs with large swelling calvesthe kind of legs which in such costume always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them he had a brown hat on his head and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke disclosing when he had done so a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days growth and two scowling eyes one of which displayed various parti coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow come in dye hear growled this engaging looking ruffian a white shaggy dog with his face scratched and torn in twenty different places skulked into the room why didnt you come in afore said the man youre getting too proud to own me afore company are you lie down this command was accompanied with a kick which sent the animal to the other end of the room he appeared well used to it however for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly without uttering a sound and winking his very ill looking eyes about twenty times in a minute appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment what are you up to ill treating the boys you covetous avaricious in sa ti a ble old fence said the man seating himself deliberately i wonder they dont murder you i would if i was them if id been your prentice id have done it long ago andno i couldnt have sold you arterwards though for youre fit for nothing but keeping as a curiosity of ugliness in a glass bottle and i suppose they dont blow them large enough hush hush mr sikes said the jew trembling dont speak so loud none of your mistering replied the ruffian you always mean mischief when you come that you know my name out with it i shant disgrace it when the time comes well well thenbill sikes said the jew with abject humility you seem out of humour bill perhaps i am replied sikes i should think you were rather out of sorts too unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about as you do when you blab and are you mad said the jew catching the man by the sleeve and pointing towards the boys mr sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear and jerking his head over on the right shoulder a piece of dumb show which the jew appeared to understand perfectly he then in cant terms with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here demanded a glass of liquor and mind you dont poison it said mr sikes laying his hat upon the table this was said in jest but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary or the wish at all events to improve upon the distillers ingenuity not very far from the old gentlemans merry heart after swallowing two or three glassfulls of spirits mr sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen which gracious act led to a conversation in which the cause and manner of olivers capture were circumstantially detailed with such alterations and improvements on the truth as to the dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances im afraid said the jew that he may say something which will get us into trouble thats very likely returned sikes with a malicious grin youre blowed upon fagin and im afraid you see added the jew speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption and regarding the other closely as he did soim afraid that if the game was up with us it might be up with a good many more and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me my dear the man started and turned fiercely round upon the jew but the old gentlemans shoulders were shrugged up to his ears and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall there was a long pause every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections not excepting the dog who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out somebody must find out whats been done at the office said mr sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in the jew nodded assent if he hasnt peached and is committed theres no fear till he comes out again said mr sikes and then he must be taken care on you must get hold of him somehow again the jew nodded the prudence of this line of action indeed was obvious but unfortunately there was one very strong objection to its being adopted and this was that the dodger and charley bates and fagin and mr william sikes happened one and all to entertain a most violent and deeply rooted antipathy to going near a police office on any ground or pretext whatever how long they might have sat and looked at each other in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind it is difficult to say it is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject however for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom oliver had seen on a former occasion caused the conversation to flow afresh the very thing said the jew bet will go wont you my dear wheres inquired the young lady only just up to the office my dear said the jew coaxingly it is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be blessed if she would a polite and delicate evasion of the request which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow creature the pain of a direct and pointed refusal the jews countenance fell and he turned from this young lady who was gaily not to say gorgeously attired in a red gown green boots and yellow curl papers to the other female nancy my dear said the jew in a soothing manner what do you say that it wont do so its no use a trying it on fagin replied nancy what do you mean by that said mr sikes looking up in a surly manner what i say bill replied the lady collectedly why youre just the very person for it reasoned mr sikes nobody about here knows anything of you and as i dont want em to neither replied nancy in the same composed manner its rather more no than yes with me bill shell go fagin said sikes no she wont fagin bawled nancy yes she will fagin said sikes and mr sikes was right by dint of alternate threats promises and bribes the female in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission she was not indeed withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend for having very recently removed into the neighbourhood of field lane from the remote but genteel suburb of ratcliffe she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintance accordingly with a clean white apron tied over her gown and her curl papers tucked up under a straw bonnetboth articles of dress being provided from the jews inexhaustible stockmiss nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand stop a minute my dear said the jew producing a little covered basket carry that in one hand it looks more respectable my dear give her a door key to carry in her tother one fagin said sikes it looks real and genivine like yes yes my dear so it does said the jew hanging a large street door key on the fore finger of the young ladys right hand there very goodvery good indeed my dear said the jew rubbing his hands oh my brother my poor dear sweet innocent little brother exclaimed nancy bursting into tears and wringing the little basket and the street door key in an agony of distress what has become of himwhere have they taken him to oh do have pity and tell me whats been done with the dear boy gentlemen do gentlemen if you please gentlemen having uttered these words in a most lamentable and heart broken tone to the immeasurable delight of her hearers miss nancy paused winked to the company nodded smilingly round and disappeared ah shes a clever girl my dears said the jew turning round to his young friends and shaking his head gravely as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld shes a honour to her sex said mr sikes filling his glass and smiting the table with his enormous fist heres her health and wishing they was all like her while these and many other encomiums were being passed on the accomplished nancy that young lady made the best of her way to the police office whither notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards entering by the back way she tapped softly with the key at one of the cell doors and listened there was no sound within so she coughed and listened again still there was no reply so she spoke nolly dear murmured nancy in a gentle voicenolly there was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal who had been taken up for playing the flute and whothe offence against society having been clearly provedhad been very properly committed by mr fang to the house of correction for one month with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare it would be much more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument he made no answer being occupied in mentally bewailing the loss of the flute which had been confiscated for the use of the county so nancy passed on to the next cell and knocked there well cried a faint and feeble voice is there a little boy here inquired nancy with a preliminary sob no replied the voice god forbid this was a vagrant of sixty five who was going to prison for not playing the flute or in other words for begging in the streets and doing nothing for his livelihood in the next cell was another man who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without a licence thereby doing something for his living in defiance of the stamp office but as neither of these criminals answered to the name of oliver or knew anything about him nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street door key and the little basket demanded her own dear brother i havent got him my dear said the old man where is he screamed nancy in a distracted manner why the gentlemans got him replied the officer what gentlemanoh gracious heavens what gentleman exclaimed nancy in reply to this incoherent questioning the old man informed the deeply affected sister that oliver had been taken ill in the office and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy not in custody and that the prosecutor had carried him away in an insensible condition to his own residence of and concerning which all the informant knew was that it was somewhere at pentonville he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman in a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty the agonised young woman staggered to the gate and thenexchanging her faltering gait for a good swift steady run returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of to the domicile of the jew mr bill sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered than he very hastily called up the white dog and putting on his hat expeditiously departed without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company good morning we must know where he is my dears he must be found said the jew greatly excited charley do nothing but skulk about till you bring home some news of him nancy my dear i must have him found i trust to you my dearto you and the artful for everything stay stay added the jew unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand theres money my dears i shall shut up this shop to night youll know where to find me dont stop here a minutenot an instant my dears with these words he pushed them from the room and carefully double locking and barring the door behind them drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to oliver and hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing a rap at the door startled him in this occupation whos there he cried in a shrill tone of alarm me replied the voice of the dodger through the key hole what now cried the jew impatiently is he to be kidnapped to the other ken nancy says inquired the dodger cautiously yes replied the jew wherever she lays hands on him find him find him out thats all i shall know what to do next never fear the boy murmured a reply of intelligence and hurried down stairs after his companions he has not peached so far said the jew as he pursued his occupation if he means to blab us among his new friends we may stop his windpipe yet chapter xiv comprising further particulars of olivers stay at mr brownlows with the remarkable prediction which one mr grimwig uttered concerning him when he went out on an errand oliver soon recovered from the fainting fit into which mr brownlows abrupt exclamation had thrown him and the subject of the picture was carefully avoided both by the old gentleman and mrs bedwin in the conversation that ensued which indeed bore no reference to olivers history or prospects but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him he was still too weak to get up to breakfast but when he came down into the housekeepers room next day his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady his expectations were disappointed however for the picture had been removed ah said the housekeeper watching the direction of olivers eyes it is gone you see i see it is maam replied oliver with a sigh why have they taken it away it has been taken down child because mr brownlow said that as it seemed to worry you perhaps it might prevent your getting well you know rejoined the old lady oh no indeed it didnt worry me maam said oliver i liked to see it i quite loved it well well said the old lady good humouredly you get well as fast as ever you can dear and it shall be hung up again there i promise you that now let us talk about something else this was all the information oliver could obtain about the picture at that time and as the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then so listened attentively to a great many stories she told him about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers who was married to an amiable and handsome man and lived in the country and a son who was clerk to a merchant in the west indies and who was also such a good young man and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a year that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them when the old lady had expatiated a long time on the excellences of her children and the merits of her kind good husband besides who had been dead and gone poor dear soul just six and twenty years it was time to have tea and after tea she began to teach oliver cribbage which he learnt as quickly as she could teach and at which game they played with great interest and gravity until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water with a slice of dry toast and to go cosily to bed they were happy days those of olivers recovery everything was so quiet and neat and orderly everybody so kind and gentle that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived it seemed like heaven itself he was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on properly than mr brownlow caused a complete new suit and a new cap and a new pair of shoes to be provided for him as oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him and asked her to sell them to a jew and keep the money for herself this she very readily did and as oliver looked out of the parlour window and saw the jew roll them up in his bag and walk away he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again they were sad rags to tell the truth and oliver had never had a new suit before one evening about a week after the affair of the picture as he was sitting talking to mrs bedwin there came a message down from mr brownlow that if oliver twist felt pretty well he should like to see him in his study and talk to him a little while bless us and save us wash your hands and let me part your hair nicely for you child said mrs bedwin dear heart alive if we had known he would have asked for you we would have put you a clean collar on and made you as smart as sixpence oliver did as the old lady bade him and although she lamented grievously meanwhile that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt collar he looked so delicate and handsome despite that important personal advantage that she went so far as to say looking at him with great complacency from head to foot that she really didnt think it would have been possible on the longest notice to have made much difference in him for the better thus encouraged oliver tapped at the study door and on mr brownlow calling to him to come in found himself in a little back room quite full of books with a window looking into some pleasant little gardens there was a table drawn up before the window at which mr brownlow was seated reading when he saw oliver he pushed the book away from him and told him to come near the table and sit down oliver complied marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiserwhich is still a marvel to more experienced people than oliver twist every day of their lives there are a good many books are there not my boy said mr brownlow observing the curiosity with which oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling a great number sir replied oliver i never saw so many you shall read them if you behave well said the old gentleman kindly and you will like that better than looking at the outsidesthat is in some cases because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts i suppose they are those heavy ones sir said oliver pointing to some large quartos with a good deal of gilding about the binding not always those said the old gentleman patting oliver on the head and smiling as he did so there are other equally heavy ones though of a much smaller size how should you like to grow up a clever man and write books eh i think i would rather read them sir replied oliver what wouldnt you like to be a book writer said the old gentleman oliver considered a little while and at last said he should think it would be a much better thing to be a bookseller upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily and declared he had said a very good thing which oliver felt glad to have done though he by no means knew what it was well well said the old gentleman composing his features dont be afraid we wont make an author of you while theres an honest trade to be learnt or brick making to turn to thank you sir said oliver and at the earnest manner of his reply the old gentleman laughed again and said something about a curious instinct which oliver not understanding paid no very great attention to now said mr brownlow speaking if possible in a kinder but at the same time in a much more serious manner than oliver had ever heard him speak in yet i want you to pay great attention my boy to what i am going to say i shall talk to you without any reserve because i am sure you are as well able to understand me as many older persons would be oh dont tell me you are going to send me away sir pray exclaimed oliver alarmed by the serious tone of the old gentlemans commencement dont turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again let me stay here and be a servant dont send me back to the wretched place i came from have mercy upon a poor boy sir do my dear child said the old gentleman moved by the warmth of olivers sudden appeal you need not be afraid of my deserting you unless you give me cause i never never will sir interposed oliver i hope not rejoined the old gentleman i do not think you ever will i have been deceived before in the objects whom i have endeavoured to benefit but i feel strongly disposed to trust you nevertheless and more interested in your behalf than i can well account for even to myself the persons on whom i have bestowed my dearest love lie deep in their graves but although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too i have not made a coffin of my heart and sealed it up for ever on my best affections deep affliction has only made them stronger it ought i think for it should refine our nature as the old gentleman said this in a low voice more to himself than to his companion and remained silent for a short time afterwards oliver sat quite still almost afraid to breathe well well said the old gentleman at length in a more cheerful tone i only say this because you have a young heart and knowing that i have suffered great pain and sorrow you will be more careful perhaps not to wound me again you say you are an orphan without a friend in the world all the inquiries i have been able to make confirm the statement let me hear your story where you came from who brought you up and how you got into the company in which i found you speak the truth and if i find you have committed no crime you will never be friendless while i live olivers sobs checked his utterance for some minutes and when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm and carried to the workhouse by mr bumble a peculiarly impatient little double knock was heard at the street door and the servant running up stairs announced mr grimwig is he coming up inquired mr brownlow yes sir replied the servant he asked if there were any muffins in the house and when i told him yes he said he had come to tea mr brownlow smiled and turning to oliver said mr grimwig was an old friend of his and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners for he was a worthy creature at bottom as he had reason to know shall i go down stairs sir inquired oliver no replied mr brownlow i would rather you stopped here at this moment there walked into the room supporting himself by a thick stick a stout old gentleman rather lame in one leg who was dressed in a blue coat striped waistcoat nankeen breeches and gaiters and a broad brimmed white hat with the sides turned up with green a very small plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat and a very long steel watch chain with nothing but a key at the end dangled loosely below it the ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orangethe variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted defy description he had a manner of screwing his head round on one side when he spoke and looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot in this attitude he fixed himself the moment he made his appearance and holding out a small piece of orange peel at arms length exclaimed in a growling discontented voice look here do you see this isnt it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that i cant call at a mans house but i find a piece of this poor surgeons friend on the staircase ive been lamed with orange peel once and i know orange peel will be my death at last it will sir orange peel will be my death or ill be content to eat my own head sir this was the handsome offer with which mr grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made and it was the more singular in his case because even admitting for the sake of argument the possibility of scientific improvements being ever brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed mr grimwigs head was such a particularly large one that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sittingto put entirely out of the question a very thick coating of powder ill eat my head sir repeated mr grimwig striking his stick upon the ground hallo whats that he added looking at oliver and retreating a pace or two this is young oliver twist whom we were speaking about said mr brownlow oliver bowed you dont mean to say thats the boy that had the fever i hope said mr grimwig recoiling a little further wait a minute dont speak stop continued mr grimwig abruptly losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery thats the boy that had the orange if thats not the boy sir that had the orange and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase ill eat my head and his too no no he has not had one said mr brownlow laughing come put down your hat and speak to my young friend i feel strongly on this subject sir said the irritable old gentleman drawing off his gloves theres always more or less orange peel on the pavement in our street and i know its put there by the surgeons boy at the corner a young woman stumbled over a bit last night and fell against my garden railings directly she got up i saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime light dont go to him i called out of the window hes an assassina man trap so he is if he is not here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick which as always understood by his friends to imply the customary offer whenever it was not expressed in words then still keeping his stick in his hand he sat down and opening a double eye glass which he wore attached to a broad black riband took a view of oliver who seeing that he was the object of inspection coloured and bowed again thats the boy is it said mr grimwig at length that is the boy replied mr brownlow nodding good humouredly to oliver how are you boy said mr grimwig a great deal better thank you sir replied oliver mr brownlow seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable asked oliver to step down stairs and tell mrs bedwin they were ready for tea which as he did not half like the visitors manner he was very happy to do he is a nice looking boy is he not inquired mr brownlow i dont know replied grimwig pettishly dont know no i dont know i never see any difference in boys i only know two sorts of boysmealy boys and beef faced boys and which is oliver mealy i know a friend whos got a beef faced boy a fine boy they call him with a round head and red cheeks and glaring eyes a horrid boy with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clotheswith the voice of a pilot and the appetite of a wolf i know him the wretch come said mr brownlow these are not the characteristics of young oliver twist so he neednt excite your wrath they are not replied grimwig he may have worse here mr brownlow coughed impatiently which appeared to afford mr grimwig the most exquisite delight he may have worse i say repeated mr grimwig where does he come from who is he what is he he has had a feverwhat of that fevers are not peculiar to good people are they bad people have fevers sometimes havent they eh i knew a man that was hung in jamaica for murdering his master he had had a fever six times he wasnt recommended to mercy on that account pooh nonsense now the fact was that in the inmost recesses of his own heart mr grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that olivers appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing but he had a strong appetite for contradiction sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange peel and inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well looking or not he had resolved from the first to oppose his friend when mr brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer and that he had postponed any investigation into olivers previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to bear it mr grimwig chuckled maliciously and demanded with a sneer whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night because if she didnt find a table spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning why he would be content to et cetera all this mr brownlow although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman knowing his friends peculiarities bore with great good humour as mr grimwig at tea was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins matters went on very smoothly and oliver who made one of the party began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentlemans presence and when are you going to hear a full true and particular account of the life and adventures of oliver twist asked grimwig of mr brownlow at the conclusion of the meal looking sideways at oliver as he resumed the subject to morrow morning replied mr brownlow i would rather he was alone with me at the time come up to me to morrow morning at ten oclock my dear yes sir replied oliver he answered with some hesitation because he was confused by mr grimwigs looking so hard at him ill tell you what whispered that gentleman to mr brownlow he wont come up to you to morrow morning i saw him hesitate he is deceiving you my dear friend ill swear he is not replied mr brownlow warmly if he is not said mr grimwig ill and down went the stick ill answer for that boys truth with my life said mr brownlow knocking the table and i for his falsehood with my head rejoined mr grimwig knocking the table also we shall see said mr brownlow checking his rising passion we will replied mr grimwig with a provoking smile we will as fate would have it mrs bedwin chanced to bring in at this moment a small parcel of books which mr brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall keeper who has already figured in this history which having laid on the table she prepared to leave the room stop the boy mrs bedwin said mr brownlow there is something to go back he has gone sir replied mrs bedwin call after him said mr brownlow its particular he is a poor man and they are not paid for there are some books to be taken back too the street door was opened oliver ran one way and the girl another and mrs bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy but there was no boy in sight and both oliver and the girl returned in a breathless state to report that there were no tidings of him dear me i am very sorry for that exclaimed mr brownlow i particularly wished those books to be returned to night send oliver with them said mr grimwig with an ironical smile he will be sure to deliver them safely you know yes do let me take them if you please sir said oliver ill run all the way sir the old gentleman was just going to say that oliver should not go out on any account when a most malicious cough from mr grimwig determined him that he should and by his prompt discharge of the commission prove to him the injustice of his suspicions on this head at least at once you shall go my dear said the old gentleman the books are on a chair by my table fetch them down oliver delighted to be of use brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle and waited cap in hand to hear what message he was to take you are to say said mr brownlow glancing steadily at grimwigyou are to say that you have brought those books back and that you have come to pay the four pound ten i owe him this is a five pound note so you will have to bring me back ten shillings change i wont be ten minutes sir replied oliver eagerly and having buttoned up the bank note in his jacket pocket and placed the books carefully under his arm he made a respectful bow and left the room mrs bedwin followed him to the street door giving him many directions about the nearest way and the name of the bookseller and the name of the street all of which oliver said he clearly understood and having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold the careful old lady at length permitted him to depart bless his sweet face said the old lady looking after him i cant bear somehow to let him go out of my sight at this moment oliver looked gaily round and nodded before he turned the corner the old lady smilingly returned his salutation and closing the door went back to her own room let me see hell be back in twenty minutes at the longest said mr brownlow pulling out his watch and placing it on the table it will be dark by that time oh you really expect him to come back do you inquired mr grimwig dont you asked mr brownlow smiling the spirit of contradiction was strong in mr grimwigs breast at the moment and it was rendered stronger by his friends confident smile no he said smiting the table with his fist i do not the boy has a new suit of clothes on his back a set of valuable books under his arm and a five pound note in his pocket hell join his old friends the thieves and laugh at you if ever that boy returns to this house sir ill eat my head with these words he drew his chair closer to the table and there the two friends sat in silent expectation with the watch between them it is worthy of remark as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions that although mr grimwig was not by any means a bad hearted man and would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment that oliver twist might not come back of such contradictions is human nature made up it grew so dark that the figures on the dial were scarcely discernible but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit in silence with the watch between them chapter xv showing how very fond of oliver twist the merry old jew and miss nancy were in the obscure parlour of a low public house situate in the filthiest part of little saffron hilla dark and gloomy den where a flaring gaslight burnt all day in the winter time and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summerthere sat brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor a man in a velveteen coat drab shorts half boots and stockings whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of police would have hesitated for one instant to recognise as mr william sikes at his feet sat a white coated red eyed dog who occupied himself alternately in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time and in licking a large fresh cut on one side of his mouth which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict keep quiet you warmint keep quiet said mr sikes suddenly breaking silence whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dogs winking or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them is matter for argument and consideration whatever was the cause the effect was a kick and a curse bestowed upon the dog simultaneously dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters but mr sikess dog having faults of temper in common with his owner and labouring perhaps at this moment under a powerful sense of injury made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half boots and having given it a good hearty shake retired growling under a form thereby just escaping the pewter measure which mr sikes levelled at his head you would would you said sikes seizing the poker in one hand and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp knife which he drew from his pocket come here you born devil come here dye hear the dog no doubt heard because mr sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice but appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut he remained where he was and growled more fiercely than before at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth and biting at it like a wild beast this resistance only infuriated mr sikes the more who dropping on his knees began to assail the animal most furiously the dog jumped from right to left and from left to right snapping growling and barking the man thrust and swore and struck and blasphemed and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other when the door suddenly opening the dog darted out leaving bill sikes with the poker and the clasp knife in his hands there must always be two parties to a quarrel says the old adage mr sikes being disappointed of the dogs presence at once transferred the quarrel to the new comer what the devil do you come in between me and my dog for said sikes with a fierce gesture i didnt know my dear i didnt know replied fagin humblyfor the jew was the new comer didnt know you white livered thief growled sikes couldnt you hear the noise not a sound of it as im a living man bill replied the jew oh no you hear nothing you dont retorted sikes with a fierce sneer sneaking in and out so as nobody hears how you come or go i wish you had been the dog fagin half a minute ago why inquired the jew with a forced smile cause the government as cares for the lives of such men as you as havent half the pluck of curs lets a man kill his dog how he likes replied sikes shutting up the knife with a very expressive look thats why the jew rubbed his hands and sitting down at the table affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friendobviously very ill at his ease however grin away said sikes replacing the poker and surveying him with savage contempt grin away youll never have the laugh at me though unless its behind a nightcap ive got the upper hand over you fagin and d me ill keep it there if i go you go so take care of me well well my dear said the jew i know all that wewehave a mutual interest billa mutual interest humph said sikes as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the jews side than on his well what have you got to say to me its all passed safe through the melting pot replied fagin and this is your share its rather more than it ought to be my dear but as i know youll do me a good turn another time and stow that gammon interposed the robber impatiently where is it hand over yes yes bill give me time give me time replied the jew soothingly here it isall safe as he spoke he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast and untying a large knot in one corner produced a small brown paper packet which sikes snatching from him hastily opened and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained this is all is it inquired sikes all replied the jew you havent opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along have you inquired sikes suspiciously dont put on a injured look at the question youve done it many a time jerk the tinkler these words in plain english conveyed an injunction to ring the bell it was answered by another jew younger than fagin but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance bill sikes merely pointed to the empty measure and the jew perfectly understanding the hint retired to fill it previously exchanging a remarkable look with fagin who raised his eyes for an instant as if in expectation of it and shook his head in reply so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to a third person it was lost upon sikes who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot lace which the dog had torn possibly if he had observed the brief interchange of signals he might have thought that it boded no good to him is anybody here barney inquired fagin speakingnow that sikes was looking onwithout raising his eyes from the ground dot a shoul replied barney whose words whether they came from the heart or not made their way through the nose nobody inquired fagin in a tone of surprise which perhaps might mean that barney was at liberty to tell the truth dobody but biss dadsy replied barney nancy exclaimed sikes where strike me blind if i dont honor that ere girl for her native talents shes bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar replied barney send her here said sikes pouring out a glass of liquor send her here barney looked timidly at fagin as if for permission the jew remaining silent and not lifting his eyes from the ground he retired and presently returned ushering in nancy who was decorated with the bonnet apron basket and street door key complete you are on the scent are you nancy inquired sikes proffering the glass yes i am bill replied the young lady disposing of its contents and tired enough of it i am too the young brats been ill and confined to the crib and ah nancy dear said fagin looking up now whether a peculiar contraction of the jews red eye brows and a half closing of his deeply set eyes warned miss nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative is not a matter of much importance the fact is all we need care for here and the fact is that she suddenly checked herself and with several gracious smiles upon mr sikes turned the conversation to other matters in about ten minutes time mr fagin was seized with a fit of coughing upon which nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders and declared it was time to go mr sikes finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself expressed his intention of accompanying her and they went away together followed at a little distance by the dog who slunk out of a back yard as soon as his master was out of sight the jew thrust his head out of the room door when sikes had left it looked after him as he walked up the dark passage shook his clenched fist muttered a deep curse and then with a horrible grin re seated himself at the table where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the hue and cry meanwhile oliver twist little dreaming that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman was on his way to the bookstall when he got into clerkenwell he accidentally turned down a by street which was not exactly in his way but not discovering his mistake till he had got halfway down it and knowing it must lead in the right direction he did not think it worth while to turn back and so marched on as quickly as he could with the books under his arm he was walking along thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel and how much he would give for only one look at poor little dick who starved and beaten might be weeping bitterly at that very moment when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud oh my dear brother and he had hardly looked up to see what the matter was when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck dont cried oliver struggling let go of me who is it what are you stopping me for the only reply to this was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him and who had a little basket and a street door key in her hand oh my gracious said the young woman ive found him oh oliver oliver oh you naughty boy to make me suffer such distress on your account come home dear come oh ive found him thank gracious goodness heavins ive found him with these incoherent exclamations the young woman burst into another fit of crying and got so dreadfully hysterical that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butchers boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet who was also looking on whether he didnt think he had better run for the doctor to which the butchers boy who appeared of a lounging not to say indolent disposition replied that he thought not illustration oliver claimed by his affectionate friends oh no no never mind said the young woman grasping olivers hand im better now come home directly you cruel boy come whats the matter maam inquired one of the women oh maam replied the young woman he ran away near a month ago from his parents who are hard working and respectable people and joined a set of thieves and bad characters and almost broke his mothers heart young wretch said one woman go home do you little brute said the other im not replied oliver greatly alarmed i dont know her i havent any sister or father and mother either im an orphan i live at pentonville oh only hear him how he braves it out cried the young woman why its nancy exclaimed oliver who now saw her face for the first time and started back in irrepressible astonishment you see he knows me cried nancy appealing to the by standers he cant help himself make him come home theres good people or hell kill his dear mother and father and break my heart what the devils this said a man bursting out of a beer shop with a white dog at his heels young oliver come home to your poor mother you young dog come home directly i dont belong to them i dont know them help help cried oliver struggling in the mans powerful grasp help repeated the man yes ill help you you young rascal what books are these youve been a stealing em have you give em here with these words the man tore the volumes from his grasp and struck him violently on the head thats right cried a looker on from a garret window thats the only way of bringing him to his senses to be sure cried a sleepy faced carpenter casting an approving look at the garret window itll do him good said the two women and he shall have it too rejoined the man administering another blow and seizing oliver by the collar come on you young villain here bulls eye mind him boy mind him weak with recent illness stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack terrified by the fierce growling of the dog and the brutality of the man and overpowered by the conviction of the by standers that he was really the hardened little wretch he was described to be what could one poor child do darkness had set in it was a low neighbourhood no help was near resistance was useless in another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts and forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to wholly unintelligible it was of little moment indeed whether they were intelligible or not for there was nobody to care for them had they been ever so plain the gas lamps were lighted mrs bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of oliver and still the two old gentlemen sat perseveringly in the dark parlour with the watch between them chapter xvi relates what became of oliver twist after he had been claimed by nancy the narrow streets and courts at length terminated in a large open space scattered about which were pens for beasts and other indications of a cattle market sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot the girl being quite unable to support any longer the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked turning to oliver he roughly commanded him to take hold of nancys hand do you hear growled sikes as oliver hesitated and looked round they were in a dark corner quite out of the track of passengers and oliver saw but too plainly that resistance would be of no avail he held out his hand which nancy clasped tight in hers give me the other said sikes seizing olivers unoccupied hand here bulls eye the dog looked up and growled see here boy said sikes putting his other hand to olivers throat and uttering a savage oath if he speaks ever so soft a word hold him dye mind the dog growled again and licking his lips eyed oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without any unnecessary delay hes as willing as a christian strike me blind if he isnt said sikes regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval now you know what youve got to expect master so call away as quick as you like the dog will soon stop that game get on young un bulls eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech and giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of oliver led the way onward it was smithfield that they were crossing although it might have been grosvenor square for anything oliver knew to the contrary the night was dark and foggy the lights in the shops could scarcely struggle through the heavy mist which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom rendering the strange place still stranger in olivers eyes and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing they had hurried on a few paces when a deep church bell struck the hour with its first stroke his two conductors stopped and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded eight oclock bill said nancy when the bell ceased whats the good of telling me that i can hear it cant i replied sikes i wonder whether they can hear it said nancy of course they can replied sikes it was bartlemy time when i was shopped and there warnt a penny trumpet in the fair as i couldnt hear the squeaking on arter i was locked up for the night the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent that i could almost have beat my head out against the iron plates of the door poor fellows said nancy who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded oh bill such fine young chaps as them yes thats all you women think of answered sikes fine young chaps well theyre as good as dead so it dont much matter with this consolation mr sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy and clasping olivers wrist more firmly told him to step out again wait a minute said the girl i wouldnt hurry by if it was you that was coming out to be hung the next time eight oclock struck bill id walk round and round the place till i dropped if the snow was on the ground and i hadnt a shawl to cover me and what good would that do inquired the unsentimental mr sikes unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope you might as well be walking fifty mile off or not walking at all for all the good it would do me come on will you and dont stand preaching there the girl burst into a laugh drew her shawl more closely round her and they walked away but oliver felt her hand tremble and looking up in her face as they passed a gas lamp saw that it had turned a deadly white they walked on by little frequented and dirty ways for a full half hour meeting very few people and those they did meet appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as mr sikes himself at length they turned into a very filthy narrow street nearly full of old clothes shops the dog running forward as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard stopped before the door of a shop which was closed and apparently untenanted for the house was in a ruinous condition and upon the door was nailed a board intimating that it was to let which looked as if it had hung there for many years all right said sikes glancing cautiously about nancy stooped below the shutters and oliver heard the sound of a bell they crossed to the opposite side of the street and stood for a few moments under a lamp a noise as if a sash window were gently raised was heard and soon afterwards the door softly opened upon which mr sikes seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony and all three were quickly inside the house the passage was perfectly dark and they waited while the person who had let them in chained and barred the door anybody here inquired sikes no replied a voice which oliver thought he had heard before is the old un here asked the robber yes replied the voice and precious down in the mouth he has been wont he be glad to see you oh no the style of this reply as well as the voice which delivered it seemed familiar to olivers ears but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness lets have a glim said sikes or we shall go breaking our necks or treading on the dog look after your legs if you do thats all stand still a moment and ill get you one replied the voice the receding footsteps of the speaker were heard and in another minute the form of mr john dawkins otherwise the artful dodger appeared bearing in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick the young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon oliver than a humorous grin but turning away beckoned the visiters to follow him down a flight of stairs they crossed an empty kitchen and opening the door of a low earthy smelling room which seemed to have been built in a small back yard were received with a shout of laughter oh my wig my wig cried master charles bates from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded here he isoh cry here he is oh fagin look at him fagin do look at him i cant bear it it is such a jolly game i cant bear it hold me somebody while i laugh it out with this irrepressible ebullition of mirth master bates laid himself flat on the floor and kicked convulsively for five minutes in an ecstasy of facetious joy then jumping to his feet he snatched the cleft stick from the dodger and advancing to oliver viewed him round and round while the jew taking off his nightcap made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy the artful meantime who was of a rather saturnine disposition and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business rifling his pockets with steady assiduity look at his togs fagin said charley putting the light so close to olivers new jacket as nearly to set him on fire look at his togssuperfine cloth and the heavy swell cut oh my eye what a game and his books toonothing but a gentleman fagin delighted to see you looking so well my dear said the jew bowing with mock humility the artful shall give you another suit my dear for fear you should spoil that sunday one why didnt you write my dear and say you were comingwed have got something warm for supper at this master bates roared again so loud that fagin himself relaxed and even the dodger smiled but as the artful drew forth the five pound note at that instant it is doubtful whether the sally or the discovery awakened his merriment hallo whats that inquired sikes stepping forward as the jew seized the note thats mine fagin no no my dear said the jew mine bill mine you shall have the books if that aint mine said sikes putting on his hat with a determined airmine and nancys that isill take the boy back again the jew started and oliver started too though from a very different cause for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back come hand over will you said sikes this is hardly fair bill hardly fair is it nancy inquired the jew fair or not fair retorted sikes hand it over i tell you do you think nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter and kidnapping every young boy as gets grabbed through you give it here you avaricious old skeleton give it here with this gentle remonstrance mr sikes plucked the note from between the jews finger and thumb and looking the old man coolly in the face folded it up small and tied it in his neckerchief thats for our share of the trouble said sikes and not half enough neither you may keep the books if youre fond of reading and if not you can sell em theyre very pretty said charley bates who with sundry grimaces had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question beautiful writing isnt it oliver and at sight of the dismayed look with which oliver regarded his tormentors master bates who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous fell into another ecstasy more boisterous than the first they belong to the old gentleman said oliver wringing his handsto the good kind old gentleman who took me into his house and had me nursed when i was near dying of the fever oh pray send them back send him back the books and money keep me here all my life long but pray pray send them back hell think i stole themthe old lady all of them that were so kind to me will think i stole them oh do have mercy upon me and send them back with these words which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief oliver fell upon his knees at the jews feet and beat his hands together in perfect desperation the boys right remarked fagin looking covertly round and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot youre right oliver youre right they will think you have stolen em ha ha chuckled the jew rubbing his hands it couldnt have happened better if we had chosen our time of course it couldnt replied sikes i knowd that directly i see him coming through clerkenwell with the books under his arm its all right enough theyre soft hearted psalm singers or they wouldnt have taken him in at all and theyll ask no questions arter him fear they should be obliged to prosecute and so get him lagged hes safe enough oliver had looked from one to the other while these words were being spoken as if he were bewildered and could scarcely understand what passed but when bill sikes concluded he jumped suddenly to his feet and tore wildly from the room uttering shrieks for help which made the bare old house echo to the roof keep back the dog bill cried nancy springing before the door and closing it as the jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit keep back the dog hell tear the boy to pieces serve him right cried sikes struggling to disengage himself from the girls grasp stand off from me or ill split your skull against the wall i dont care for that bill i dont care for that screamed the girl struggling violently with the man the child shant be torn down by the dog unless you kill me first shant he said sikes setting his teeth fiercely ill soon do that if you dont keep off the housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room just as the jew and the two boys returned dragging oliver among them whats the matter here said the jew looking round the girls gone mad i think replied sikes savagely no she hasnt said nancy pale and breathless from the scuffle no she hasnt fagin dont think it then keep quiet will you said the jew with a threatening look no i wont do that neither replied nancy speaking very loud come what do you think of that mr fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which nancy belonged to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her at present with the view of diverting the attention of the company he turned to oliver so you wanted to get away my dear did you said the jew taking up a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fire place eh oliver made no reply but he watched the jews motions and breathed quickly wanted to get assistancecalled for the police did you sneered the jew catching the boy by the arm well cure you of that my young master the jew inflicted a smart blow on olivers shoulders with the club and was raising it for a second when the girl rushing forward wrested it from his hand and flung it into the fire with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room i wont stand by and see it done fagin cried the girl youve got the boy and what more would you have let him belet him be or i shall put that mark on some of you that will bring me to the gallows before my time the girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat and with her lips compressed and her hands clenched looked alternately at the jew and the other robberher face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself why nancy said the jew in a soothing tone after a pause during which he and mr sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner youyoure more clever than ever to night ha ha my dear you are acting beautifully am i said the girl take care i dont overdo it you will be the worse for it fagin if i do and so i tell you in good time to keep clear of me there is something about a roused woman especially if she add to all her other strong passions the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair which few men like to provoke the jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of miss nancys rage and shrinking involuntarily back a few paces cast a glance half imploring and half cowardly at sikes as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue mr sikes thus mutely appealed to and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of miss nancy to reason gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention as they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged however he resorted to more tangible arguments what do you mean by this said sikes backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features which if it were heard above only once out of every fifty thousand times it is uttered below would render blindness as common a disorder as measles what do you mean by it burn my bodydo you know who you are and what you are oh yes i know all about it replied the girl laughing hysterically and shaking her head from side to side with a poor assumption of indifference well then keep quiet rejoined sikes with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog or ill quiet you for a good long time to come the girl laughed again even less composedly than before and darting a hasty look at sikes turned her face aside and bit her lip till the blood came youre a nice one added sikes as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air to take up the humane and genteel side a pretty subject for the child as you call him to make a friend of god almighty help me i am cried the girl passionately and i wish i had been struck dead in the street or changed places with them we passed so near to night before i had lent a hand in bringing him here hes a thief a liar a devil all thats bad from this night forth isnt that enough for the old wretch without blows come come sikes said the jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone and motioning towards the boys who were eagerly attentive to all that passed we must have civil wordscivil words bill civil words cried the girl whose passion was frightful to see civil words you villain yes you deserve em from me i thieved for you when i was a child not half as old as this pointing to oliver i have been in the same trade and in the same service for twelve years since dont you know it speak outdont you know it well well replied the jew with an attempt at pacification and if you have its your living ay it is returned the girl not speaking but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream it is my living and the cold wet dirty streets are my home and youre the wretch that drove me to them long ago and thatll keep me there day and night day and night till i die i shall do you a mischief interposed the jew goaded by these reproaches a mischief worse than that if you say much more the girl said nothing more but tearing her hair and dress in a transport of phrensy made such a rush at the jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him had not her wrists been seized by sikes at the right moment upon which she made a few ineffectual struggles and fainted shes all right now said sikes laying her down in a corner shes uncommon strong in the arms when shes up in this way the jew wiped his forehead and smiled as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over but neither he nor sikes nor the dog nor the boys seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurrence incidental to business its the worst of having to do with women said the jew replacing the club but theyre clever and we cant get on in our line without emcharley show oliver to bed i suppose hed better not wear his best clothes to morrow fagin had he inquired charley bates certainly not replied the jew reciprocating the grin with which charley put the question master bates apparently much delighted with his commission took the cleft stick and led oliver into an adjacent kitchen where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before and here with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter he produced the identical old suit of clothes which oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at mr brownlows and the accidental display of which to fagin by the jew who purchased them had been the very first clue received of his whereabout pull off the smart ones said charley and ill give em to fagin to take care of what fun it is poor oliver unwillingly complied and master bates rolling up the new clothes under his arm departed from the room leaving oliver in the dark and locking the door behind him the noise of charleys laughter and the voice of miss betsy who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which oliver was placed but he was sick and weary and soon fell sound asleep chapter xvii olivers destiny continuing unpropitious brings a great man to london to injure his reputation it is the custom on the stage in all good murderous melodramas to present the tragic and the comic scenes in as regular alternation as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky well cured bacon the hero sinks upon his straw bed weighed down by fetters and misfortunes and in the next scene his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song we behold with throbbing bosoms the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron her virtue and her life alike in danger drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch a whistle is heard and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle where a grey headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals who are free of all sorts of places from church vaults to palaces and roam about in company carolling perpetually such changes appear absurd but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight the transitions in real life from well spread boards to death beds and from mourning weeds to holiday garments are not a whit less startling only there we are busy actors instead of passive lookers on which makes a vast difference the actors in the mimic life of the theatre are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling which presented before the eyes of mere spectators are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous as sudden shiftings of the scene and rapid changes of time and place are not only sanctioned in books by long usage but are by many considered as the great art of authorshipan authors skill in his craft being by such critics chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapterthis brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary if so let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back directly to the town in which oliver twist was born the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition on any account mr bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse gate and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps up the high street he was in the full bloom and pride of beadleism his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun and he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power mr bumble always carried his head high but this morning it was higher than usual there was an abstraction in his eye and an elevation in his air which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadles mind too great for utterance mr bumble stopped not to converse with the small shop keepers and others who spoke to him deferentially as he passed along he merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand and relaxed not in his dignified pace until he reached the farm where mrs mann tended the infant paupers with a parish care drat that beadle said mrs mann hearing the well known impatient shaking at the garden gate if it isnt him at this time in the morninglauk mr bumble only think of its being you well dear me it is a pleasure this is come into the parlour sir please the first sentence was addressed to susan and the exclamations of delight were spoken to mr bumble as the good lady unlocked the garden gate and showed him with great attention and respect into the house mrs mann said mr bumblenot sitting upon or dropping himself into a seat as any common jackanapes would but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chairmrs mann maam good morning well and good morning to you sir replied mrs mann with many smiles and hoping you find yourself well sir so so mrs mann replied the beadle a porochial life is not a bed of roses mrs mann ah that it isnt indeed mr bumble rejoined the lady and all the infant paupers might have chorused the rejoinder with great propriety if they had heard it a porochial life maam continued mr bumble striking the table with his cane is a life of worry and vexation and hardihood but all public characters as i may say must suffer prosecution mrs mann not very well knowing what the beadle meant raised her hands with a look of sympathy and sighed ah you may well sigh mrs mann said the beadle finding she had done right mrs mann sighed again evidently to the satisfaction of the public character who repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat said mrs mann i am a going to london lauk mr bumble said mrs mann starting back to london maam resumed the inflexible beadle by coach i and two paupers mrs mann a legal action is coming on about a settlement and the board has appointed meme mrs mannto depose to the matter before the quarter sessions at clerkinwell and i very much question added mr bumble drawing himself up whether the clerkinwell sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me oh you mustnt be too hard upon them sir said mrs mann coaxingly the clerkinwell sessions have brought it upon themselves maam replied mr bumble and if the clerkinwell sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected the clerkinwell sessions have only themselves to thank there was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which mr bumble delivered himself of these words that mrs mann appeared quite awed by them at length she said youre going by coach sir i thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts thats when theyre ill mrs mann said the beadle we put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather to prevent their taking cold oh said mrs mann the opposition coach contracts for these two and takes them cheap said mr bumble they are both in a very low state and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move em than to bury emthat is if we can throw em upon another parish which i think we shall be able to do if they dont die upon the road to spite us ha ha ha when mr bumble had laughed a little while his eyes again encountered the cocked hat and he became grave we are forgetting business maam said the beadlehere is your porochial stipend for the month wherewith mr bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper from his pocket book and requested a receipt which mrs mann wrote its very much blotted sir said the farmer of infants but its formal enough i dare say thank you mr bumble sir i am very much obliged to you im sure mr bumble nodded blandly in acknowledgment of mrs manns curtsey and inquired how the children were bless their dear little hearts said mrs mann with emotion theyre as well as can be the dears of course except the two that died last week and little dick isnt that boy no better inquired mr bumble mrs mann shook her head hes a ill conditioned vicious bad disposed porochial child that said mr bumble angrily where is he ill bring him to you in one minute sir replied mrs mann here you dick after some calling dick was discovered and having had his face put under the pump and dried upon mrs manns gown he was led into the awful presence of mr bumble the beadle the child was pale and thin his cheeks were sunken and his eyes large and bright the scanty parish dress the livery of his misery hung loosely upon his feeble body and his young limbs had wasted away like those of an old man such was the little being who stood trembling beneath mr bumbles glance not daring to lift his eyes from the floor and dreading even to hear the beadles voice cant you look at the gentleman you obstinate boy said mrs mann the child meekly raised his eyes and encountered those of mr bumble whats the matter with you porochial dick inquired mr bumble with well timed jocularity nothing sir replied the child faintly i should think not said mrs mann who had of course laughed very much at mr bumbles exquisite humour you want for nothing im sure i should like faltered the child hey day interposed mrs mann i suppose youre going to say that you do want for something now why you little wretch stop mrs mann stop said the beadle raising his hand with a show of authority like what sir eh i should like faltered the child if somebody that can write would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper and fold it up and seal it and keep it for me after i am laid in the ground why what does the boy mean exclaimed mr bumble on whom the earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression accustomed as he was to such things what do you mean sir i should like said the child to leave my dear love to poor oliver twist and to let him know how often i have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him and i should like to tell him said the child pressing his small hands together and speaking with great fervour that i was glad to die when i was very young for perhaps if i lived to be a man and grew old my little sister who is in heaven might forget me or be unlike me and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together mr bumble surveyed the little speaker from head to foot with indescribable astonishment and turning to his companion said theyre all in one story mrs mann that out dacious oliver has demoralized them all i couldnt have believed it sir said mrs mann holding up her hands and looking malignantly at dick i never see such a hardened little wretch take him away maam said mr bumble imperiously this must be stated to the board mrs mann i hope the gentlemen will understand that it isnt my fault sir said mrs mann whimpering pathetically they shall understand that maam they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case said mr bumble pompously there take him away i cant bear the sight of him dick was immediately taken away and locked up in the coal cellar and mr bumble shortly afterwards took himself off to prepare for his journey at six oclock next morning mr bumble having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one and encased his person in a blue great coat with a cape to it took his place on the outside of the coach accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed with whom in due course of time he arrived in london having experienced no other crosses by the way than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers who persisted in shivering and complaining of the cold in a manner which mr bumble declared caused his teeth to chatter in his head and made him feel quite uncomfortable although he had a great coat on having disposed of these evil minded persons for the night mr bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped and took a temperate dinner of steaks oyster sauce and porter putting a glass of hot gin and water on the mantel piece he drew his chair to the fire and with sundry moral reflections on the too prevalent sin of discontent and complaining he then composed himself comfortably to read the paper the very first paragraph upon which mr bumbles eyes rested was the following advertisement five guineas reward whereas a young boy named oliver twist absconded or was enticed on thursday evening last from his home at pentonville and has not since been heard of the above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as may lead to the discovery of the said oliver twist or tend to throw any light upon his previous history in which the advertiser is for many reasons warmly interested and then followed a full description of olivers dress person appearance and disappearance with the name and address of mr brownlow at full length mr bumble opened his eyes read the advertisement slowly and carefully three several times and in something more than five minutes was on his way to pentonville having actually in his excitement left the glass of hot gin and water untasted on the mantel piece is mr brownlow at home inquired mr bumble of the girl who opened the door to this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon but rather evasive reply of i dont knowwhere do you come from mr bumble no sooner uttered olivers name in explanation of his errand than mrs bedwin who had been listening at the parlour door hastened into the passage in a breathless state come income in said the old lady i knew we should hear of him poor dear i knew we shouldi was certain of it bless his heart i said so all along having said this the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again and seating herself on a sofa burst into tears the girl who was not quite so susceptible had run up stairs meanwhile and now returned with a request that mr bumble would follow her immediately which he did he was shown into the little back study where sat mr brownlow and his friend mr grimwig with decanters and glasses before them the latter gentleman eyed him closely and at once burst into the exclamation a beadlea parish beadle or ill eat my head pray dont interrupt just now said mr brownlow take a seat will you mr bumble sat himself down quite confounded by the oddity of mr grimwigs manner mr brownlow moved the lamp so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadles countenance and said with a little impatience now sir you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement yes sir said mr bumble and you are a beadle are you not inquired mr grimwig i am a porochial beadle gentlemen rejoined mr bumble proudly of course observed mr grimwig aside to his friend i knew he was his greatcoat is a parochial cut and he looks a beadle all over mr brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend and resumed do you know where this poor boy is now no more than nobody replied mr bumble well what do you know of him inquired the old gentleman speak out my friend if you have anything to say what do you know of him you dont happen to know any good of him do you said mr grimwig caustically after an attentive perusal of mr bumbles features mr bumble caught at the inquiry very quickly and shook his head with portentous solemnity you see this said mr grimwig looking triumphantly at mr brownlow mr brownlow looked apprehensively at bumbles pursed up countenance and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding oliver in as few words as possible mr bumble put down his hat unbuttoned his coat folded his arms inclined his head in a retrospective manner and after a few moments reflection commenced his story it would be tedious if given in the beadles words occupying as it did some twenty minutes in the telling but the sum and substance of it was that oliver was a foundling born of low and vicious parents who had from his birth displayed no better qualities than treachery ingratitude and malice and who had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad and running away in the night time from his masters house in proof of his really being the person he represented himself mr bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town and folding his arms again awaited mr brownlows observations i fear it is all too true said the old gentleman sorrowfully after looking over the papers this is not much for your intelligence but i would gladly have given you treble the money if it had been favourable to the boy it is not at all improbable that if mr bumble had been possessed with this information at an earlier period of the interview he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history it was too late to do it now however so he shook his head gravely and pocketing the five guineas withdrew mr brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes evidently so much disturbed by the beadles tale that even mr grimwig forbore to vex him further at length he stopped and rang the bell violently mrs bedwin said mr brownlow when the housekeeper appeared that boy oliver is an impostor it cant be sir it cannot be said the old lady energetically i tell you he is retorted the old gentleman sharply what do you mean by cant be we have just heard a full account of him from his birth and he has been a thorough paced little villain all his life i never will believe it sir replied the old lady firmly you old women never believe anything but quack doctors and lying story books growled mr grimwig i knew it all along why didnt you take my advice in the beginning you would if he hadnt had a fever i supposeeh he was interesting wasnt he interesting bah and mr grimwig poked the fire with a flourish he was a dear grateful gentle child sir retorted mrs bedwin indignantly i know what children are sir and have done these forty years and people who cant say the same shouldnt say anything about themthats my opinion this was a hard hit at mr grimwig who was a bachelor but as it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile the old lady tossed her head and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech when she was stopped by mr brownlow silence said the old gentleman feigning an anger he was far from feeling never let me hear the boys name again i rang to tell you that nevernever on any pretence mind you may leave the room mrs bedwin remember i am in earnest there were sad hearts at mr brownlows that night olivers sunk within him when he thought of his good kind friends but it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard or it would have broken outright chapter xviii how oliver passed his time in the improving society of his reputable friends about noon next day when the dodger and master bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations mr fagin took the opportunity of reading oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty to no ordinary extent in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends and still more in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery mr fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken oliver in and cherished him when without his timely aid he might have perished with hunger and related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom in his philanthropy he had succoured under parallel circumstances but who proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police had unfortunately come to be hung at the old bailey one morning mr fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown which if it were not precisely true was indispensably necessary for the safety of him mr fagin and a few select friends mr fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging and with great friendliness and politeness of manner expressed his anxious hope that he might never be obliged to submit oliver twist to that unpleasant operation little olivers blood ran cold as he listened to the jews words and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them that it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship he knew already and that deeply laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over communicative persons had been really devised and carried out by the old jew on more occasions than one he thought by no means unlikely when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and mr sikes which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind as he glanced timidly up and met the jews searching look he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by the wary villain the jew smiled hideously and patting oliver on the head said that if he kept himself quiet and applied himself to business he saw they would be very good friends yet then taking his hat and covering himself up in an old patched great coat he went out and locked the room door behind him and so oliver remained all that day and for the greater part of many subsequent days seeing nobody between early morning and midnight and left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts which never failing to revert to his kind friends and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him were sad indeed after the lapse of a week or so the jew left the room door unlocked and he was at liberty to wander about the house it was a very dirty place but the rooms up stairs had great high wooden mantel pieces and large doors with paneled walls and cornices to the ceilings which although they were black with neglect and dust were ornamented in various ways from all of which tokens oliver concluded that a long time ago before the old jew was born it had belonged to better people and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome dismal and dreary as it looked now spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings and sometimes when oliver walked softly into a room the mice would scamper across the floor and run back terrified to their holes with these exceptions there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing and often when it grew dark and he was tired of wandering from room to room he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street door to be as near living people as he could and remain there listening and counting the hours until the jew or the boys returned in all the rooms the mouldering shutters were fast closed and the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood the only light which was admitted making its way through round holes at the top which made the rooms more gloomy and filled them with strange shadows there was a back garret window with rusty bars outside which had no shutter and out of which oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of house tops blackened chimneys and gable ends sometimes indeed a ragged grizzly head might be seen peering over the parapet wall of a distant house but it was quickly withdrawn again and as the window of olivers observatory was nailed down and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond without making any attempt to be seen or heardwhich he had as much chance of being as if he had been inside the ball of st pauls cathedral one afternoon the dodger and master bates being engaged out that evening the first named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person which to do him justice was by no means an habitual weakness with him and with this end and aim he condescendingly commanded oliver to assist him in his toilet straightway oliver was but too glad to make himself useful too happy to have some faces however bad to look upon and too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so to throw any objection in the way of this proposal so he at once expressed his readiness and kneeling on the floor while the dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his lap he applied himself to a process which mr dawkins designated as japanning his trotter cases and which phrase rendered into plain english signifieth cleaning his boots whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe swinging one leg carelessly to and fro and having his boots cleaned all the time without even the past trouble of having taken them off or the prospective misery of putting them on to disturb his reflections or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the dodger or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts he was evidently tinctured for the nonce with a spice of romance and enthusiasm foreign to his general nature he looked down on oliver with a thoughtful countenance for a brief space and then raising his head and heaving a gentle sigh said half in abstraction and half to master bates what a pity it is he isnt a prig ah said master charles bates he dont know whats good for him the dodger sighed again and resumed his pipe as did charley bates they both smoked for some seconds in silence i suppose you dont even know what a prig is said the dodger mournfully i think i know that replied oliver hastily looking up its a th youre one are you not inquired oliver checking himself i am replied the dodger id scorn to be anythink else mr dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock after delivering this sentiment and looked at master bates as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary i am repeated the dodger sos charley sos fagin sos sikes sos nancy sos bet so we all are down to the dog and hes the downiest one of the lot and the least given to peaching added charley bates he wouldnt so much as bark in a witness box for fear of committing himself no not if you tied him up in one and left him there without wittles for a fortnight said the dodger that he wouldnt not a bit of it observed charley hes a rum dog dont he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when hes in company pursued the dodger wont he growl at all when he hears a fiddle playing and dont he hate other dogs as aint of his breedoh no hes an out and out christian said charley this was merely intended as a tribute to the animals abilities but it was an appropriate remark in another sense if master bates had only known it for there are a great many ladies and gentlemen claiming to be out and out christians between whom and mr sikess dog there exist very strong and singular points of resemblance well well said the dodger recurring to the point from which they had strayed with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings this hasnt got anything to do with young green here no more it has said charley why dont you put yourself under fagin oliver and make your fortun out of hand added the dodger with a grin and so be able to retire on your property and do the gen teel as i mean to in the very next leap year but four that ever comes and the forty second tuesday in trinity week said charley bates i dont like it rejoined oliver timidly i wish they would let me go iiwould rather go and fagin would rather not rejoined charley oliver knew this too well but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly he only sighed and went on with his boot cleaning go exclaimed the dodger why wheres your spirit dont you take any pride out of yourself would you go and be dependent on your friends eh oh blow that said master bates drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his pocket and tossing them into a cupboard thats too mean that is i couldnt do it said the dodger with an air of haughty disgust you can leave your friends though said oliver with a half smile and let them be punished for what you did that rejoined the dodger with a wave of his pipethat was all out of consideration for fagin cause the traps know that we work together and he might have got into trouble if we hadnt made our lucky that was the move wasnt it charley master bates nodded assent and would have spoken but that the recollection of olivers flight came so suddenly upon him that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh and went up into his head and down into his throat and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping about five minutes long illustration master bates explains a professional technicality look here said the dodger drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence heres a jolly lifewhats the odds where it comes from here catch hold theres plenty more where they were took from you wont wont youoh you precious flat its naughty aint it oliver inquired charley bates hell come to be scragged wont he i dont know what that means replied oliver looking round something in this way old feller said charley as he said it master bates caught up an end of his neckerchief and holding it erect in the air dropped his head on his shoulder and jerked a curious sound through his teeth thereby indicating by a lively pantomimic representation that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing thats what it means said charley look how he stares jack i never did see such prime company as that ere boy hell be the death of me i know he will and master charles bates having laughed heartily again resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes youve been brought up bad said the dodger surveying his boots with much satisfaction when oliver had polished them fagin will make something of you though or youll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable youd better begin at once for youll come to the trade long before you think of it and youre only losing time oliver master bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own which being exhausted he and his friend mr dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led interspersed with a variety of hints to oliver that the best thing he could do would be to secure fagins favour without more delay by the same means which they had employed to gain it and always put this in your pipe nolly said the dodger as the jew was heard unlocking the door above if you dont take fogles and tickers whats the good of talking in that way interposed master bates he dont know what you mean if you dont take pocket hankechers and watches said the dodger reducing his conversation to the level of olivers capacity some other cove will so that the coves that lose em will be all the worse and youll be all the worse too and nobody half a haporth the better except the chaps wot gets themand youve just as good a right to them as they have to be sureto be sure said the jew who had entered unseen by oliver it all lies in a nutshell my dearin a nutshell take the dodgers word for it ha hahe understands the catechism of his trade the old man rubbed his hands gleefully together as he corroborated the dodgers reasoning in these terms and chuckled with delight at his pupils proficiency the conversation proceeded no farther at this time for the jew had returned home accompanied by miss betsy and a gentleman whom oliver had never seen before but who was accosted by the dodger as tom chitling and who having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady now made his appearance mr chitling was older in years than the dodger having perhaps numbered eighteen winters but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional acquirements he had small twinkling eyes and a pock marked face wore a fur cap a dark corduroy jacket greasy fustian trousers and an apron his wardrobe was in truth rather out of repair but he excused himself to the company by stating that his time was only out an hour before and that in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes mr chitling added with strong marks of irritation that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional for it burnt holes in them and there was no remedy against the county the same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair which he held to be decidedly unlawful mr chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty two mortal long hard working days and that he wished he might be busted if he wasnt as dry as a lime basket where do you think the gentleman has come from oliver inquired the jew with a grin as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table iidont know sir replied oliver whos that inquired tom chitling casting a contemptuous look at oliver a young friend of mine my dear replied the jew hes in luck then said the young man with a meaning look at fagin never mind where i came from young un youll find your way there soon enough ill bet a crown at this sally the boys laughed and after some more jokes on the same subject exchanged a few short whispers with fagin and withdrew after some words apart between the last comer and fagin they drew their chairs towards the fire and the jew telling oliver to come and sit by him led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers these were the great advantages of the trade the proficiency of the dodger the amiability of charley bates and the liberality of the jew himself at length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted and mr chitling did the same for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two miss betsy accordingly withdrew and left the party to their repose from this day oliver was seldom left alone but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys who played the old game with the jew every daywhether for their own improvement or olivers mr fagin best knew at other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days mixed up with so much that was droll and curious that oliver could not help laughing heartily and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings in short the wily old jew had the boy in his toils and having prepared his mind by solitude and gloom to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it and change its hue for ever chapter xix in which a notable plan is discussed and determined on it was a chill damp windy night when the jew buttoning his great coat tight round his shrivelled body and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face emerged from his den he paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him and having listened while the boys made all secure and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible slunk down the street as quickly as he could the house to which oliver had been conveyed was in the neighbourhood of whitechapel the jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street and glancing suspiciously round crossed the road and struck off in the direction of spitalfields the mud lay thick upon the stones and a black mist hung over the streets the rain fell sluggishly down and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch it seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the jew to be abroad as he glided stealthily along creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved crawling forth by night in search of some rich offal for a meal he kept on his course through many winding and narrow ways until he reached bethnal green then turning suddenly off to the left he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely populated quarter the jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed however to be at all bewildered either by the darkness of the night or the intricacies of the way he hurried through several alleys and streets and at length turned into one lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end at the door of a house in this street he knocked and having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened the door walked up stairs a dog growled as he touched the handle of a door and a mans voice demanded who was there only me bill only me my dear said the jew looking in bring in your body said sikes lie down you stupid brute dont you know the devil when hes got a great coat on apparently the dog had been somewhat deceived by mr fagins outer garment for as the jew unbuttoned it and threw it over the back of a chair he retired to the corner from which he had risen wagging his tail as he went to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be well said sikes well my dear replied the jew ah nancy the latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception for mr fagin and his young friend had not met since she had interfered in behalf of oliver all doubts upon the subject if he had any were speedily removed by the young ladys behaviour she took her feet off the fender pushed back her chair and bade fagin draw up his without saying any more about it for it was a cold night and no mistake it is cold nancy dear said the jew as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire it seems to go right through one added the old man touching his left side it must be a piercer if it finds its way through your heart said mr sikes give him something to drink nancy burn my body make haste its enough to turn a man ill to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard in which there were many which to judge from the diversity of their appearance were filled with several kinds of liquids and sikes pouring out a glass of brandy bade the jew drink it off quite enough quite thankye bill replied the jew putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it what youre afraid of our getting the better of you are you inquired sikes fixing his eyes on the jew ugh with a hoarse grunt of contempt mr sikes seized the glass and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself which he did at once the jew glanced round the room as his companion tossed down the second glassful not in curiosity for he had seen it often before but in a restless and suspicious manner which was habitual to him it was a meanly furnished apartment with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner and a life preserver that hung over the mantelpiece there said sikes smacking his lips now im ready for businesseh inquired the jew for business replied sikes so say what youve got to say about the crib at chertsey bill said the jew drawing his chair forward and speaking in a very low voice yes wot about it inquired sikes ah you know what i mean my dear said the jew he knows what i mean nancy dont he no he dont sneered mr sikes or he wont and thats the same thing speak out and call things by their right names dont sit there winking and blinking and talking to me in hints as if you warnt the very first that thought about the robbery d your eyes wot dye mean hush bill hush said the jew who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation somebody will hear us my dear somebody will hear us let em hear said sikes i dont care but as mr sikes did care upon reflection he dropped his voice as he said the words and grew calmer there there said the jew coaxingly it was only my cautionnothing more now my dear about that crib at chertsey when is it to be done bill ehwhen is it to be done such plate my dears such plate said the jew rubbing his hands and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation not at all replied sikes coldly not to be done at all echoed the jew leaning back in his chair no not at all rejoined sikes at least it cant be a put up job as we expected then it hasnt been properly gone about said the jew turning pale with anger dont tell me but i will tell you retorted sikes who are you thats not to be told i tell you that toby crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight and he cant get one of the servants into a line do you mean to tell me bill said the jew softening as the other grew heated that neither of the two men in the house can be got over yes i do mean to tell you so replied sikes the old lady has had em these twenty year and if you were to give em five hundred pound they wouldnt be in it but do you mean to say my dear remonstrated the jew that the women cant be got over not a bit of it replied sikes not by flash toby crackit said the jew incredulously think what women are bill no not even by flash toby crackit replied sikes he says hes worn sham whiskers and a canary waistcoat the whole blessed time hes been loitering down there and its all of no use he should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers my dear said the jew after a few moments reflection so he did rejoined sikes and they warnt of no more use than the other plant the jew looked very blank at this information and after ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast raised his head and said with a deep sigh that if flash toby crackit reported aright he feared the game was up and yet said the old man dropping his hands on his knees its a sad thing my dear to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it so it is said mr sikes worse luck a long silence ensued during which the jew was plunged in deep thought with his face wrinkled into an expression of villany perfectly demoniacal sikes eyed him furtively from time to time and nancy apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire as if she had been deaf to all that passed fagin said sikes abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed is it worth fifty shiners extra if its safely done from the outside yes said the jew suddenly rousing himself as if from a trance is it a bargain inquired sikes yes my dear yes rejoined the jew grasping the others hand his eyes glistening and every muscle in his face working with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened then said sikes thrusting aside the jews hand with some disdain let it come off as soon as you like toby and i were over the garden wall the night afore last sounding the panels of the door and shutters the cribs barred up at night like a jail but theres one part we can crack safe and softly which is that bill asked the jew eagerly why whispered sikes as you cross the lawn yes yes said the jew bending his head forward with his eyes almost starting out of it umph cried sikes stopping short as the girl scarcely moving her head looked suddenly round and pointed for an instant to the jews face never mind which part it is you cant do it without me i know but its best to be on the safe side when one deals with you as you like my dear as you like replied the jew biting his lip is there no help wanted but yours and tobys none said sikes cept a centre bit and a boy the first weve both got the second you must find us a boy exclaimed the jew oh then it is a panel eh never mind wot it is replied sikes i want a boy and he mustnt be a big un lord said mr sikes reflectively if id only got that young boy of ned the chimbley sweepershe kept him small on purpose and let him out by the job but the father gets lagged and then the juvenile delinquent society comes and takes the boy away from a trade where he was arning money teaches him to read and write and in time makes a prentice of him and so they go on said mr sikes his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongsso they go on and if theyd got money enough which its a providence they have not we shouldnt have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade in a year or two no more we should acquiesced the jew who had been considering during this speech and had only caught the last sentence bill what now inquired sikes the jew nodded his head towards nancy who was still gazing at the fire and intimated by a sign that he would have her told to leave the room sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently as if he thought the precaution unnecessary but complied nevertheless by requesting miss nancy to fetch him a jug of beer you dont want any beer said nancy folding her arms and retaining her seat very composedly i tell you i do replied sikes nonsense rejoined the girl coolly go on fagin i know what hes going to say bill he neednt mind me the jew still hesitated and sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise why you dont mind the old girl do you fagin he asked at length youve known her long enough to trust her or the devils in it she aint one to blab are you nancy i should think not replied the young lady drawing her chair up to the table and putting her elbows upon it no no my deari know youre not said the jew but and again the old man paused but wot inquired sikes i didnt know whether she mightnt praps be out of sorts you know my dear as she was the other night replied the jew at this confession miss nancy burst into a loud laugh and swallowing a glass of brandy shook her head with an air of defiance and burst into sundry exclamations of keep the game a going never say die and the like which seemed at once to have the effect of re assuring both gentlemen for the jew nodded his head with a satisfied air and resumed his seat as did mr sikes likewise now fagin said nancy with a laugh tell bill at once about oliver ah youre a clever one my dear the sharpest girl i ever saw said the jew patting her on the neck it was about oliver i was going to speak sure enough ha ha ha what about him demanded sikes hes the boy for you my dear replied the jew in a hoarse whisper laying his finger on the side of his nose and grinning frightfully he exclaimed sikes have him bill said nancy i would if i was in your place he maynt be so much up as any of the others but thats not what you want if hes only to open a door for you depend upon it hes a safe one bill i know he is rejoined fagin hes been in good training these last few weeks and its time he began to work for his bread besides the others are all too big well he is just the size i want said mr sikes ruminating and will do everything you want bill my dear interposed the jew he cant help himselfthat is if you only frighten him enough frighten him echoed sikes itll be no sham frightening mind you if theres anything queer about him when we once get into the workin for a penny in for a poundyou wont see him alive again fagin think of that before you send him mark my words said the robber poising a heavy crowbar which he had drawn from under the bedstead ive thought of it all said the jew with energy iveive had my eye upon him my dears closeclose once let him feel that he is one of us once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief and hes oursours for his life oho it couldnt have come about better the old man crossed his arms upon his breast and drawing his head and shoulders into a heap literally hugged himself for joy ours said sikes yours you mean perhaps i do my dear said the jew with a shrill chuckle mine if you like bill and wot said sikes scowling fiercely on his agreeable friendwot makes you take so much pains about one chalk faced kid when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about common garden every night as you might pick and choose from because theyre of no use to me my dear replied the jew with some confusion not worth the taking for their looks convict em when they get into trouble and i lose em all with this boy properly managed my dears i could do what i couldnt with twenty of them besides said the jew recovering his self possession he has us now if he could only give us leg bail again and he must be in the same boat with us never mind how he came there its quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery thats all i want now how much better this is than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way which would be dangerous and we should lose by it besides when is it to be done asked nancy stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of mr sikes expressive of the disgust with which he received fagins affectation of humanity ah to be sure said the jew when is it to be done bill i planned with toby the night arter to morrow rejoined sikes in a surly voice if he heard nothing from me to the contrairy good said the jew theres no moon no rejoined sikes its all arranged about bringing off the swaga is it asked the jew sikes nodded and about oh ah its all planned rejoined sikes interrupting him never mind particulars youd better bring the boy here to morrow night i shall get off the stones an hour arter day break then you hold your tongue and keep the melting pot ready and thats all youll have to do after some discussion in which all three took an active part it was decided that nancy should repair to the jews next evening when the night had set in and bring oliver away with her fagin craftily observing that if he evinced any disinclination to the task he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf than anybody else it was also solemnly arranged that poor oliver should for the purposes of the contemplated expedition be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of mr william sikes and further that the said sikes should deal with him as he thought fit and should not be held responsible by the jew for any mischance or evil that might befall the boy or any punishment with which it might be necessary to visit him it being understood that to render the compact in this respect binding any representations made by mr sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated in all important particulars by the testimony of flash toby crackit these preliminaries adjusted mr sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner yelling forth at the same time most unmusical snatches of song mingled with wild execrations at length in a fit of professional enthusiasm he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools which he had no sooner stumbled in with and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained and the peculiar beauties of their construction than he fell over it upon the floor and went to sleep where he fell good night nancy said the jew muffling himself up as before good night their eyes met and the jew scrutinised her narrowly there was no flinching about the girl she was as true and earnest in the matter as toby crackit himself could be the jew again bade her good night and bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of mr sikes while her back was turned groped down stairs always the way muttered the jew to himself as he turned homewards the worst of these women is that a very little thing serves to call up some long forgotten feeling and the best of them is that it never lasts ha ha the man against the child for a bag of gold beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections mr fagin wended his way through mud and mire to his gloomy abode where the dodger was sitting up impatiently awaiting his return is oliver a bed i want to speak to him was his first remark as they descended the stairs hours ago replied the dodger throwing open a door here he is the boy was lying fast asleep on a rude bed upon the floor so pale with anxiety and sadness and the closeness of his prison that he looked like death not death as it shows in shroud and coffin but in the guise it wears when life has just departed when a young and gentle spirit has but an instant fled to heaven and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed not now said the jew turning softly away to morrow to morrow end of the first volume london printed by samuel bentley dorset street fleet street footnote a booty transcribers

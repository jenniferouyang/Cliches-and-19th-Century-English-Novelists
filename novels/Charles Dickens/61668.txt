said to me one day as if between jest and earnest fancy since we last met i have discovered a haunted house in the midst of london really haunted and by whatghosts well i cant answer these questions all i know is this six weeks ago i and my wife were in search of a furnished apartment passing a quiet street we saw on the window of one of the houses a bill apartments furnished the situation suited us we entered the house liked the rooms engaged them by the week and left them the third day no power on earth could have reconciled my wife to stay longer and i dont wonder at it what did you see excuse me i have no desire to be ridiculed as a superstitious dreamer nor on the other hand could i ask you to accept on my affirmation what you would hold to be incredible without the evidence of your own senses let me only say this it was not so much what we saw or heard in which you might fairly suppose that we were the dupes of our own excited fancy or the victims of imposture in others that drove us away as it was an undefinable terror which seized both of us whenever we passed by the door of a certain unfurnished room in which we neither saw nor heard anything and the strangest marvel of all was that for once in my life i agreed with my wife silly woman though she be and allowed after the third night that it was impossible to stay a fourth in that house accordingly on the fourth morning i summoned the woman who kept the house and attended on us and told her that the rooms did not quite suit us and we would not stay out our week she said dryly i know why you have stayed longer than any other lodger few ever stayed a second night none before you a third but i take it they have been very kind to you theywho i asked affecting a smile why they who haunt the house whoever they are i dont mind them i remember them many years ago when i lived in this house not as a servant but i know they will be the death of me some day i dont careim old and must die soon anyhow and then i shall be with them and in this house still the woman spoke with so dreary a calmness that really it was a sort of awe that prevented my conversing with her further i paid for my week and too happy were i and my wife to get off so cheaply you excite my curiosity said i nothing i should like better than to sleep in a haunted house pray give me the address of the one which you left so ignominiously my friend gave me the address and when we parted i walked straight toward the house thus indicated it is situated on the north side of oxford street in a dull but respectable thoroughfare i found the house shut up no bill at the window and no response to my knock as i was turning away a beerboy collecting pewter pots at the neighboring areas said to me do you want any one at that house sir yes i heard it was to be let let why the woman who kept it is dead has been dead these three weeks and no one can be found to stay there though mr j offered ever so much he offered mother who chars for him a week just to open and shut the windows and she would not would not and why the house is haunted and the old woman who kept it was found dead in her bed with her eyes wide open they say the devil strangled her pooh you speak of mr j is he the owner of the house yes where does he live in g street no what is hein any business no sir nothing particular a single gentleman i gave the potboy the gratuity earned by his liberal information and proceeded to mr j in g street which was close by the street that boasted the haunted house i was lucky enough to find mr j at home an elderly man with intelligent countenance and prepossessing manners i communicated my name and my business frankly i said i heard the house was considered to be haunted that i had a strong desire to examine a house with so equivocal a reputation that i should be greatly obliged if he would allow me to hire it though only for a night i was willing to pay for that privilege whatever he might be inclined to ask sir said mr j with great courtesy the house is at your service for as short or as long a time as you please rent is out of the question the obligation will be on my side should you be able to discover the cause of the strange phenomena which at present deprive it of all value i cannot let it for i cannot even get a servant to keep it in order or answer the door unluckily the house is haunted if i may use that expression not only by night but by day though at night the disturbances are of a more unpleasant and sometimes of a more alarming character the poor old woman who died in it three weeks ago was a pauper whom i took out of a workhouse for in her childhood she had been known to some of my family and had once been in such good circumstances that she had rented that house of my uncle she was a woman of superior education and strong mind and was the only person i could ever induce to remain in the house indeed since her death which was sudden and the coroners inquest which gave it a notoriety in the neighborhood i have so despaired of finding any person to take charge of it much more a tenant that i would willingly let it rent free for a year to any one who would pay its rates and taxes how long ago did the house acquire this character that i can scarcely tell you but many years since the old woman i spoke of said it was haunted when she rented it between thirty and forty years ago the fact is that my life has been spent in the east indies and in the civil service of the company i returned to england last year on inheriting the fortune of an uncle amongst whose possessions was the house in question i found it shut up and uninhabited i was told that it was haunted and no one would inhabit it i smiled at what seemed to me so idle a story i spent some money in repainting and roofing it added to its oldfashioned furniture a few modern articles advertised it and obtained a lodger for a year he was a colonel retired on half pay he came in with his family a son and a daughter and four or five servants they all left the house the next day and although they deponed that they had all seen something different that something was equally terrible to all i really could not in conscience sue or even blame the colonel for breach of agreement then i put in the old woman i have spoken of and she was empowered to let the house in apartments i never had one lodger who stayed more than three days i do not tell you their stories to no two lodgers have exactly the same phenomena been repeated it is better that you should judge for yourself than enter the house with an imagination influenced by previous narratives only be prepared to see and to hear something or other and take whatever precautions you yourself please have you never had a curiosity yourself to pass a night in that house yes i passed not a night but three hours in broad daylight alone in that house my curiosity is not satisfied but it is quenched i have no desire to renew the experiment you cannot complain you see sir that i am not sufficiently candid and unless your interest be exceedingly eager and your nerves unusually strong i honestly add that i advise you not to pass a night in that house my interest is exceedingly keen said i and though only a coward will boast of his nerves in situations wholly unfamiliar to him yet my nerves have been seasoned in such variety of danger that i have the right to rely on them even in a haunted house mr j said very little more he took the keys of the house out of his bureau and gave them to me and thanking him cordially for his frankness and his urbane concession to my wish i carried off my prize impatient for the experiment as soon as i reached home i summoned my confidential servanta young man of gay spirits fearless temper and as free from superstitious prejudice as any one i could think of f said i you remember in germany how disappointed we were at not finding a ghost in that old castle which was said to be haunted by a headless apparition well i have heard of a house in london which i have reason to hope is decidedly haunted i mean to sleep there tonight from what i hear there is no doubt that something will allow itself to be seen or to be heardsomething perhaps excessively horrible do you think if i take you with me i may rely on your presence of mind whatever may happen o sir pray trust me said he grinning with delight very well then here are the keys of the house this is the address go now select for me any bedroom you please and since the house has not been inhabited for weeks make up a good fire air the bed well see of course that there are candles as well as fuel take with you my revolver and my daggerso much for my weaponsarm yourself equally well and if we are not a match for a dozen ghosts we shall be but a sorry couple of englishmen i was engaged for the rest of the day on business so urgent that i had not leisure to think much on the nocturnal adventure to which i had plighted my honor i dined alone and very late and while dining read as is my habit the volume i selected was one of macaulays essays i thought to myself that i would take the book with me there was so much of healthfulness in the style and practical life in the subjects that it would serve as an antidote against the influences of superstitious fancy accordingly about half past nine i put the book into my pocket and strolled leisurely towards the haunted house i took with me a favorite dog an exceedingly sharp bold and vigilant bullterrier a dog fond of prowling about strange ghostly corners and passages at night in search of rats a dog of dogs for a ghost it was a summer night but chilly the sky somewhat gloomy and overcast still there was a moonfaint and sickly but still a moon and if the clouds permitted after midnight it would be brighter i reached the house knocked and my servant opened with a cheerful smile all right sir and very comfortable oh said i rather disappointed have you not seen nor heard anything remarkable well sir i must own i have heard something queer whatwhat the sound of feet pattering behind me and once or twice small noises like whispers close at my ear nothing more you are not at all frightened i not a bit of it sir and the mans bold look reassured me on one point namely that happen what might he would not desert me we were in the hall the street door closed and my attention was now drawn to my dog he had at first run in eagerly enough but had sneaked back to the door and was scratching and whining to get out after i had patted him on the head and encouraged him gently the dog seemed to reconcile himself to the situation and followed me and f through the house but keeping close at my heels instead of hurrying inquisitively in advance which was his usual and normal habit in all strange places we first visited the subterranean apartments the kitchen and other offices and especially the cellars in which last were two or three bottles of wine still left in a bin covered with cobwebs and evidently by their appearance undisturbed for many years it was clear that the ghosts were not winebibbers for the rest we discovered nothing of interest there was a gloomy little back yard with very high walls the stones of this yard were very damp and what with the damp and what with the dust and smokegrime on the pavement our feet left a slight impression where we passed and now appeared the first strange phenomenon witnessed by myself in this strange abode i saw just before me the print of a foot suddenly form itself as it were i stopped caught hold of my servant and pointed to it in advance of that footprint as suddenly dropped another we both saw it i advanced quickly to the place the footprint kept advancing before me a small footprintthe foot of a child the impression was too faint thoroughly to distinguish the shape but it seemed to us both that it was the print of a naked foot this phenomenon ceased when we arrived at the opposite wall nor did it repeat itself when we returned we remounted the stairs and entered the rooms on the groundfloora diningparlor a small back parlor and a still smaller third room that had probably been appropriated to a footmanall still as death we then visited the drawingrooms which seemed fresh and new in the front room i seated myself in an armchair f placed on the table the candlestick with which he had lighted us i told him to shut the door as he turned to do so a chair opposite to me moved from the wall quickly and noiselessly and dropped itself about a yard from my own chair immediately fronting it why this is better than the turning tables said i with a halflaugh and as i laughed my dog put back his head and howled f coming back had not observed the movement of the chair he employed himself now in stilling the dog i continued to gaze on the chair and fancied i saw on it a pale blue misty outline of a human figure but an outline so indistinct that i could only distrust my own vision the dog was now quiet put back the chair opposite to me said i to f put it back to the wall f obeyed was that you sir said he turning abruptly iwhat why something struck me i felt it sharply on the shoulder just here no said i but we have jugglers present and though we may not discover their tricks we shall catch them before they frighten us we did not stay long in the drawingrooms in fact they felt so damp and so chilly that i was glad to get to the fire up stairs we locked the doors of the drawingroomsa precaution which i should observe we had taken with all the rooms we had searched below the bedroom my servant had selected for me was the best on the floor a large one with two windows fronting the street the fourposted bed which took up no inconsiderable space was opposite to the fire which burned clear and bright a door in the wall to the left between the bed and the window communicated with the room which my servant appropriated to himself this last was a small room with a sofabed and had no communication with the landingplace no other door but that which conducted to the bedroom i was to occupy on either side of my fireplace was a cupboard without locks flush with the wall and covered with the same dullbrown paper we examined these cupboards only hooks to suspend female dressesnothing else we sounded the walls evidently solidthe outer walls of the building having finished the survey of these apartments warmed myself a few moments and lighted my cigar i then still accompanied by f went forth to complete my reconnoitre in the landingplace there was another door it was closed firmly sir said my servant in surprise i unlocked this door with all the others when i first came it cannot have got locked from the inside for it is a before he had finished his sentence the door which neither of us then was touching opened quietly of itself we looked at each other a single instant the same thought seized both some human agency might be detected here i rushed in first my servant followed a small blank dreary room without furniture a few empty boxes and hampers in a corner a small window the shutters closednot even a fireplaceno other door but that by which we had entered no carpet on the floor and the floor seemed very old uneven wormeaten mended here and there as was shown by the whiter patches on the wood but no living being and no visible place in which a living being could have hidden as we stood gazing round the door by which we had entered closed as quietly as it had before opened we were imprisoned for the first time i felt a creep of undefinable horror not so my servant why they dont think to trap us sir i could break that trumpery door with a kick of my foot try first if it will open to your hand said i shaking off the vague apprehension that had seized me while i open the shutters and see what is without i unbarred the shutters the window looked on the little back yard i have before described there was no ledge without nothing but sheer descent no man getting out of that window would have found any footing till he had fallen on the stones below f meanwhile was vainly attempting to open the door he now turned round to me and asked my permission to use force and i should here state in justice to the servant that far from evincing any superstitious terror his nerve composure and even gayety amidst circumstances so extraordinary compelled my admiration and made me congratulate myself on having secured a companion in every way fitted to the occasion i willingly gave him the permission he required but though he was a remarkably strong man his force was as idle as his milder efforts the door did not even shake to his stoutest kick breathless and panting he desisted i then tried the door myself equally in vain as i ceased from the effort again that creep of horror came over me but this time it was more cold and stubborn i felt as if some strange and ghastly exhalation were rising from the chinks of that rugged floor and filling the atmosphere with a venomous influence hostile to human life the door now very slowly and quietly opened as of its own accord we precipitated ourselves into the landingplace we both saw a large pale lightas large as the human figure but shapeless and unsubstantialmove before us and ascend the stairs that led from the landing into the attics i followed the light and my servant followed me it entered to the right of the landing a small garret of which the door stood open i entered in the same instant the light then collapsed into a small globule exceedingly brilliant and vivid rested a moment on a bed in the corner quivered and vanished we approached the bed and examined ita halftester such as is commonly found in attics devoted to servants on the drawers that stood near it we perceived an old faded silk kerchief with the needle still left in the rent half repaired the kerchief was covered with dust probably it had belonged to the old woman who had last died in that house and this might have been her sleepingroom i had sufficient curiosity to open the drawers there were a few odds and ends of female dress and two letters tied round with a narrow ribbon of faded yellow i took the liberty to possess myself of the letters we found nothing else in the room worth noticing nor did the light reappear but we distinctly heard as we turned to go a pattering footfall on the floor just before us we went through the other attics in all four the footfall still preceding us nothing to be seen nothing but the footfall heard i had the letters in my hand just as i was descending the stairs i distinctly felt my wrist seized and a faint soft effort made to draw the letters from my clasp i only held them the more tightly and the effort ceased we regained the bedchamber appropriated to myself and i then remarked that my dog had not followed us when we had left it he was thrusting himself close to the fire and trembling i was impatient to examine the letters and while i read them my servant opened a little box in which he had deposited the weapons i had ordered him to bring took them out placed them on a table close at my bedhead and then occupied himself in soothing the dog who however seemed to heed him very little the letters were short they were datedthe dates exactly thirtyfive years ago they were evidently from a lover to his mistress or a husband to some young wife not only the terms of expression but a distinct reference to a former voyage indicated the writer to have been a seafarer the spelling and handwriting were those of a man imperfectly educated but still the language itself was forcible in the expressions of endearment there was a kind of rough wild love but here and there were dark unintelligible hints at some secret not of lovesome secret that seemed of crime we ought to love each other was one of the sentences i remember for how every one else would execrate us if all was known again dont let any one be in the same room with you at nightyou talk in your sleep and again whats done cant be undone and i tell you theres nothing against us unless the dead could come to life here was interlined in a better handwriting a females they do at the end of the letter latest in date the same female hand had written these words lost at sea the th of june the same day as i put down the letters and began to muse over their contents fearing however that the train of thought into which i fell might unsteady my nerves i fully determined to keep my mind in a fit state to cope with whatever of marvellous the advancing night might bring forth i roused myself laid the letters on the table stirred up the fire which was still bright and cheering and opened my volume of macaulay i read quietly enough till about half past eleven i then threw myself dressed upon the bed and told my servant he might retire to his own room but must keep himself awake i bade him leave open the doors between the two rooms thus alone i kept two candles burning on the table by my bedhead i placed my watch beside the weapons and calmly resumed my macaulay opposite to me the fire burned clear and on the hearthrug seemingly asleep lay the dog in about twenty minutes i felt an exceedingly cold air pass by my cheek like a sudden draught i fancied the door to my right communicating with the landingplace must have got open but no it was closed i then turned my glance to the left and saw the flame of the candles violently swayed as by a wind at the same moment the watch beside the revolver softly slid from the tablesoftly softlyno visible handit was gone i sprang up seizing the revolver with the one hand the dagger with the other i was not willing that my weapons should share the fate of the watch thus armed i looked round the floor no sign of the watch three slow loud distinct knocks were now heard at the bedhead my servant called out is that you sir no be on your guard the dog now roused himself and sat on his haunches his ears moving quickly backward and forward he kept his eye fixed on me with a look so strange that he concentred all my attention on himself slowly he rose all his hair bristling and stood perfectly rigid and with the same wild stare i had no time however to examine the dog presently my servant emerged from his room and if i ever saw horror in the human face it was then i should not have recognized him had we met in the streets so altered was every lineament he passed by me quickly saying in a whisper that seemed scarcely to come from his lips run run it is after me he gained the door to the landing pulled it open and rushed forth i followed him into the landing involuntarily calling him to stop but without heeding me he bounded down the stairs clinging to the balusters and taking several steps at a time i heard where i stood the street door open heard it again clap to i was left alone in the haunted house it was but for a moment that i remained undecided whether or not to follow my servant pride and curiosity alike forbade so dastardly a flight i reentered my room closing the door after me and proceeded cautiously into the interior chamber i encountered nothing to justify my servants terror i again carefully examined the walls to see if there were any concealed door i could find no trace of onenot even a seam in the dullbrown paper with which the room was hung how then had the thing whatever it was which had so scared him obtained ingress except through my own chamber i returned to my room shut and locked the door that opened upon the interior one and stood on the hearth expectant and prepared i now perceived that the dog had slunk into an angle of the wall and was pressing close against it as if literally striving to force his way into it i approached the animal and spoke to it the poor brute was evidently beside itself with terror it showed all its teeth the slaver dropping from its jaws and would certainly have bitten me if i had touched it it did not seem to recognize me whoever has seen at the zological gardens a rabbit fascinated by a serpent cowering in a corner may form some idea of the anguish which the dog exhibited finding all efforts to soothe the animal in vain and fearing that his bite might be as venomous in that state as if in the madness of hydrophobia i left him alone placed my weapons on the table beside the fire seated myself and recommenced my macaulay perhaps in order not to appear seeking credit for a courage or rather a coolness which the reader may conceive i exaggerate i may be pardoned if i pause to indulge in one or two egotistical remarks as i hold presence of mind or what is called courage to be precisely proportioned to familiarity with the circumstances that lead to it so i should say that i had been long sufficiently familiar with all experiments that appertain to the marvellous i had witnessed many very extraordinary phenomena in various parts of the worldphenomena that would be either totally disbelieved if i stated them or ascribed to supernatural agencies now my theory is that the supernatural is the impossible and that what is called supernatural is only a something in the laws of nature of which we have been hitherto ignorant therefore if a ghost rise before me i have not the right to say so then the supernatural is possible but rather so then the apparition of a ghost is contrary to received opinion within the laws of nature namely not supernatural now in all that i had hitherto witnessed and indeed in all the wonders which the amateurs of mystery in our age record as facts a material living agency is always required on the continent you will find still magicians who assert that they can raise spirits assume for the moment that they assert truly still the living material form of the magician is present and he is the material agency by which from some constitutional peculiarities certain strange phenomena are represented to your natural senses accept again as truthful the tales of spirit manifestation in americamusical or other sounds writings on paper produced by no discernible hand articles of furniture moved without apparent human agency or the actual sight and touch of hands to which no bodies seem to belongstill there must be found the medium or living being with constitutional peculiarities capable of obtaining these signs in fine in all such marvels supposing even that there is no imposture there must be a human being like ourselves by whom or through whom the effects presented to human beings are produced it is so with the now familiar phenomena of mesmerism or electrobiology the mind of the person operated on is affected through a material living agent nor supposing it true that a mesmerized patient can respond to the will or passes of a mesmerizer a hundred miles distant is the response less occasioned by a material being it may be through a material fluid call it electric call it odic call it what you will which has the power of traversing space and passing obstacles that the material effect is communicated from one to the other hence all that i had hitherto witnessed or expected to witness in this strange house i believed to be occasioned through some agency or medium as mortal as myself and this idea necessarily prevented the awe with which those who regard as supernatural things that are not within the ordinary operations of nature might have been impressed by the adventures of that memorable night as then it was my conjecture that all that was presented or would be presented to my senses must originate in some human being gifted by constitution with the power so to present them and having some motive so to do i felt an interest in my theory which in its way was rather philosophical than superstitious and i can sincerely say that i was in as tranquil a temper for observation as any practical experimentalist could be in awaiting the effects of some rare though perhaps perilous chemical combination of course the more i kept my mind detached from fancy the more the temper fitted for observation would be obtained and i therefore riveted eye and thought on the strong daylight sense in the page of my macaulay i now became aware that something interposed between the page and the light the page was overshadowed i looked up and i saw what i shall find it very difficult perhaps impossible to describe it was a darkness shaping itself out of the air in very undefined outline i cannot say it was of a human form and yet it had more of a resemblance to a human form or rather shadow than anything else as it stood wholly apart and distinct from the air and the light around it its dimensions seemed gigantic the summit nearly touched the ceiling while i gazed a feeling of intense cold seized me an iceberg before me could not more have chilled me nor could the cold of an iceberg have been more purely physical i feel convinced that it was not the cold caused by fear as i continued to gaze i thoughtbut this i cannot say with precisionthat i distinguished two eyes looking down on me from the height one moment i seemed to distinguish them clearly the next they seemed gone but two rays of a pale blue light frequently shot through the darkness as from the height on which i half believed half doubted that i had encountered the eyes i strove to speak my voice utterly failed me i could only think to myself is this fear it is not fear i strove to rise in vain i felt as if weighed down by an irresistible force indeed my impression was that of an immense and overwhelming power opposed to my volition that sense of utter inadequacy to cope with a force beyond mens which one may feel physically in a storm at sea in a conflagration or when confronting some terrible wild beast or rather perhaps the shark of the ocean i felt morally opposed to my will was another will as far superior to its strength as storm fire and shark are superior in material force to the force of men and now as this impression grew on me now came at last horrorhorror to a degree that no words can convey still i retained pride if not courage and in my own mind i said this is horror but it is not fear unless i fear i cannot be harmed my reason rejects this thing it is an illusion i do not fear with a violent effort i succeeded at last in stretching out my hand towards the weapon on the table as i did so on the arm and shoulder i received a strange shock and my arm fell to my side powerless and now to add to my horror the light began slowly to wane from the candles they were not as it were extinguished but their flame seemed very gradually withdrawn it was the same with the fire the light was extracted from the fuel in a few minutes the room was in utter darkness the dread that came over me to be thus in the dark with that dark thing whose power was so intensely felt brought a reaction of nerve in fact terror had reached that climax that either my senses must have deserted me or i must have burst through the spell i did burst through it i found voice though the voice was a shriek i remember that i broke forth with words like these i do not fear my soul does not fear and at the same time i found strength to rise still in that profound gloom i rushed to one of the windows tore aside the curtain flung open the shutters my first thought was light and when i saw the moon high clear and calm i felt a joy that almost compensated for the previous terror there was the moon there was also the light from the gaslamps in the deserted slumberous street i turned to look back into the room the moon penetrated its shadow very palely and partially but still there was light the dark thing whatever it might be was gone except that i could yet see a dim shadow which seemed the shadow of that shade against the opposite wall my eye now rested on the table and from under the table which was without cloth or cover an old mahogany round table rose a hand visible as far as the wrist it was a hand seemingly as much of flesh and blood as my own but the hand of an aged person lean wrinkled small too a womans hand that hand very softly closed on the two letters that lay on the table hand and letters both vanished then came the same three loud measured knocks i had heard at the bedhead before this extraordinary drama had commenced as these sounds slowly ceased i felt the whole room vibrate sensibly and at the far end rose as from the floor sparks or globules like bubbles of light manycoloredgreen yellow firered azureup and down to and fro hither thither as tiny willothewisps the sparks moved slow or swift each at its own caprice a chair as in the drawingroom below was now advanced from the wall without apparent agency and placed at the opposite side of the table suddenly as forth from the chair grew a shape a womans shape it was distinct as a shape of life ghastly as a shape of death the face was that of youth with a strange mournful beauty the throat and shoulders were bare the rest of the form in a loose robe of cloudy white it began sleeking its long yellow hair which fell over its shoulders its eyes were not turned toward me but to the door it seemed listening watching waiting the shadow of the shade in the background grew darker and again i thought i beheld the eyes gleaming out from the summit of the shadow eyes fixed upon that shape as if from the door though it did not open grew out another shape equally distinct equally ghastlya mans shape a young mans it was in the dress of the last century or rather in a likeness of such dress for both the male shape and the female though defined were evidently unsubstantial impalpablesimulacra phantasms and there was something incongruous grotesque yet fearful in the contrast between the elaborate finery the courtly precision of that oldfashioned garb with its ruffles and lace and buckles and the corpselike aspect and ghostlike stillness of the flitting wearer just as the male shape approached the female the dark shadow darted from the wall all three for a moment wrapped in darkness when the pale light returned the two phantoms were as if in the grasp of the shadow that towered between them and there was a bloodstain on the breast of the female and the phantom male was leaning on its phantom sword and blood seemed trickling fast from the ruffles from the lace and the darkness of the intermediate shadow swallowed them up they were gone and again the bubbles of light shot and sailed and undulated growing thicker and thicker and more wildly confused in their movements the closet door to the right of the fireplace now opened and from the aperture came the form of a woman aged in her hand she held lettersthe very letters over which i had seen the hand close and behind her i heard a footstep she turned round as if to listen and then she opened the letters and seemed to read and over her shoulder i saw a livid face the face as of a man long drownedbloated bleached seaweed tangled in its dripping hair and at her feet lay a form as of a corpse and beside the corpse cowered a child a miserable squalid child with famine in its cheeks and fear in its eyes and as i looked in the old womans face the wrinkles and lines vanished and it became a face of youthhardeyed stony but still youth and the shadow darted forth and darkened over these phantoms as it had darkened over the last nothing now was left but the shadow and on that my eyes were intently fixed till again eyes grew out of the shadowmalignant serpent eyes and the bubbles of light again rose and fell and in their disordered irregular turbulent maze mingled with the wan moonlight and now from these globules themselves as from the shell of an egg monstrous things burst out the air grew filled with them larv so bloodless and so hideous that i can in no way describe them except to remind the reader of the swarming life which the solar microscope brings before his eyes in a drop of waterthings transparent supple agile chasing each other devouring each otherforms like naught ever beheld by the naked eye as the shapes were without symmetry so their movements were without order in their very vagrancies there was no sport they came round me and round thicker and faster and swifter swarming over my head crawling over my right arm which was outstretched in involuntary command against all evil beings sometimes i felt myself touched but not by them invisible hands touched me once i felt the clutch as of cold soft fingers at my throat i was still equally conscious that if i gave way to fear i should be in bodily peril and i concentred all my faculties in the single focus of resisting stubborn will and i turned my sight from the shadow above all from those strange serpent eyeseyes that had now become distinctly visible for there though in naught else around me i was aware that there was a will and a will of intense creative working evil which might crush down my own the pale atmosphere in the room began now to redden as if in the air of some near conflagration the larv grew lurid as things that live in fire again the room vibrated again were heard the three measured knocks and again all things were swallowed up in the darkness of the dark shadow as if out of that darkness all had come into that darkness all returned as the gloom receded the shadow was wholly gone slowly as it had been withdrawn the flame grew again into the candles on the table again into the fuel in the grate the whole room came once more calmly healthfully into sight the two doors were still closed the door communicating with the servants room still locked in the corner of the wall into which he had convulsively niched himself lay the dog i called to himno movement i approachedthe animal was dead his eyes protruded his tongue out of his mouth the froth gathered round his jaws i took him in my arms i brought him to the fire i felt acute grief for the loss of my poor favorite acute selfreproach i accused myself of his death i imagined he had died of fright but what was my surprise on finding that his neck was actually brokenactually twisted out of the vertebr had this been done in the dark must it not have been done by a hand human as mine must there not have been a human agency all the while in that room good cause to suspect it i cannot tell i cannot do more than state the fact fairly the reader may draw his own inference another surprising circumstancemy watch was restored to the table from which it had been so mysteriously withdrawn but it had stopped at the very moment it was so withdrawn nor despite all the skill of the watchmaker has it ever gone since that is it will go in a strange erratic way for a few hours and then comes to a dead stop it is worthless nothing more chanced for the rest of the night nor indeed had i long to wait before the dawn broke not till it was broad daylight did i quit the haunted house before i did so i revisited the little blind room in which my servant and i had been for a time imprisoned i had a strong impression for which i could not account that from that room had originated the mechanism of the phenomena if i may use the term which had been experienced in my chamber and though i entered it now in the clear day with the sun peering through the filmy window i still felt as i stood on its floor the creep of the horror which i had first experienced there the night before and which had been so aggravated by what had passed in my own chamber i could not indeed bear to stay more than half a minute within those walls i descended the stairs and again i heard the footfall before me and when i opened the street door i thought i could distinguish a very low laugh i gained my own home expecting to find my runaway servant there but he had not presented himself nor did i hear more of him for three days when i received a letter from him dated from liverpool to this effect honored siri humbly entreat your pardon though i can scarcely hope that you will think i deserve it unlesswhich heaven forbidyou saw what i did i feel that it will be years before i can recover myself and as to being fit for service it is out of the question i am therefore going to my brotherinlaw at melbourne the ship sails tomorrow perhaps the long voyage may set me up i do nothing now but start and tremble and fancy it is behind me i humbly beg you honored sir to order my clothes and whatever wages are due to me to be sent to my mothers at walworth john knows her address the letter ended with additional apologies somewhat incoherent and explanatory details as to effects that had been under the writers charge this flight may perhaps warrant a suspicion that the man wished to go to australia and had been somehow or other fraudulently mixed up with the events of the night i say nothing in refutation of that conjecture rather i suggest it as one that would seem to many persons the most probable solution of improbable occurrences my own theory remained unshaken i returned in the evening to the house to bring away in a hack cab the things i had left there with my poor dogs body in this task i was not disturbed nor did any incident worth note befall me except that still on ascending and descending the stairs i heard the same footfall in advance on leaving the house i went to mr js he was at home i returned him the keys told him that my curiosity was sufficiently gratified and was about to relate quickly what had passed when he stopped me and said though with much politeness that he had no longer any interest in a mystery which none had ever solved i determined at least to tell him of the two letters i had read as well as of the extraordinary manner in which they had disappeared and i then inquired if he thought they had been addressed to the woman who had died in the house and if there were anything in her early history which could possibly confirm the dark suspicions to which the letters gave rise mr j seemed startled and after musing a few moments answered i know but little of the womans earlier history except as i before told you that her family were known to mine but you revive some vague reminiscences to her prejudice i will make inquiries and inform you of their result still even if we could admit the popular superstition that a person who had been either the perpetrator or the victim of dark crimes in life could revisit as a restless spirit the scene in which those crimes had been committed i should observe that the house was infested by strange sights and sounds before the old woman died you smile what would you say i would say this that i am convinced if we could get to the bottom of these mysteries we should find a living human agency what you believe it is all an imposture for what object not an imposture in the ordinary sense of the word if suddenly i were to sink into a deep sleep from which you could not awake me but in that deep sleep could answer questions with an accuracy which i could not pretend to when awaketell you what money you had in your pocket nay describe your very thoughtsit is not necessarily an imposture any more than it is necessarily supernatural i should be unconsciously to myself under a mesmeric influence conveyed to me from a distance by a human being who had acquired power over me by previous rapport granting mesmerism so far carried to be a fact you are right and you would infer from this that a mesmerizer might produce the extraordinary effects you and others have witnessed over inanimate objectsfill the air with sights and sounds or impress our senses with the belief in them we never having been en rapport with the person acting on us no what is commonly called mesmerism could not do this but there may be a power akin to mesmerism and superior to itthe power that in the old days was called magic that such a power may extend to all inanimate objects of matter i do not say but if so it would not be against nature only a rare power in nature which might be given to constitutions with certain peculiarities and cultivated by practice to an extraordinary degree that such a power might extend over the deadthat is over certain thoughts and memories that the dead may still retainand compel not that which ought properly to be called the soul and which is far beyond human reach but rather a phantom of what has been most earthstained on earth to make itself apparent to our sensesis a very ancient though obsolete theory upon which i will hazard no opinion but i do not conceive the power would be supernatural let me illustrate what i mean from an experiment which paracelsus describes as not difficult and which the author of the curiosities of literature cites as credible a flower perishes you burn it whatever were the elements of that flower while it lived are gone dispersed you know not whither you can never discover nor recollect them but you can by chemistry out of the burnt dust of that flower raise a spectrum of the flower just as it seemed in life it may be the same with a human being the soul has as much escaped you as the essence or elements of the flower still you may make a spectrum of it and this phantom though in the popular superstition it is held to be the soul of the departed must not be confounded with the true soul it is but the eidolon of the dead form hence like the bestattested stories of ghosts or spirits the thing that most strikes us is the absence of what we hold to be soulthat is of superior emancipated intelligence they come for little or no object they seldom speak if they do come they utter no ideas above those of an ordinary person on earth these american spiritseers have published volumes of communications in prose and verse which they assert to be given in the names of the most illustrious deadshakespeare bacon heaven knows whom those communications taking the best are certainly of not a whit higher order than would be communications from living persons of fair talent and education they are wondrously inferior to what bacon shakespeare and plato said and wrote when on earth nor what is more notable do they ever contain an idea that was not on the earth before wonderful therefore as such phenomena may be granting them to be truthful i see much that philosophy may question nothing that it is incumbent on philosophy to deny namely nothing supernatural they are but ideas conveyed somehow or other we have not yet discovered the means from one mortal brain to another whether in so doing tables walk of their own accord or fiendlike shapes appear in a magic circle or bodiless hands rise and remove material objects or a thing of darkness such as presented itself to me freeze our bloodstill am i persuaded that these are but agencies conveyed as by electric wires to my own brain from the brain of another in some constitutions there is a natural chemistry and those may produce chemic wonders in others a natural fluid call it electricity and these produce electric wonders but they differ in this from normal science they are alike objectless purposeless puerile frivolous they lead on to no grand results and therefore the world does not heed and true sages have not cultivated them but sure i am that of all i saw or heard a man human as myself was the remote originator and i believe unconsciously to himself as to the exact effects produced for this reason no two persons you say have ever told you that they experienced exactly the same thing well observe no two persons ever experience exactly the same dream if this were an ordinary imposture the machinery would be arranged for results that would but little vary if it were a supernatural agency permitted by the almighty it would surely be for some definite end these phenomena belong to neither class my persuasion is that they originate in some brain now far distant that that brain had no distinct volition in anything that occurred that what does occur reflects but its devious motley evershifting halfformed thoughts in short that it has been but the dreams of such a brain put into action and invested with a semisubstance that this brain is of immense power that it can set matter into movement that it is malignant and destructive i believe some material force must have killed my dog it might for aught i know have sufficed to kill myself had i been as subjugated by terror as the doghad my intellect or my spirit given me no countervailing resistance in my will it killed your dog that is fearful indeed it is strange that no animal can be induced to stay in that house not even a cat rats and mice are never found in it the instincts of the brute creation detect influences deadly to their existence mans reason has a sense less subtle because it has a resisting power more supreme but enough do you comprehend my theory yes though imperfectly and i accept any crotchet pardon the word however odd rather than embrace at once the notion of ghosts and hobgoblins we imbibed in our nurseries still to my unfortunate house the evil is the same what on earth can i do with the house i will tell you what i would do i am convinced from my own internal feelings that the small unfurnished room at right angles to the door of the bedroom which i occupied forms a startingpoint or receptacle for the influences which haunt the house and i strongly advise you to have the walls opened the floor removed nay the whole room pulled down i observe that it is detached from the body of the house built over the small back yard and could be removed without injury to the rest of the building and you think if i did that you would cut off the telegraphwires try it i am so persuaded that i am right that i will pay half the expense if you will allow me to direct the operations nay i am well able to afford the cost for the rest allow me to write to you about ten days afterwards i received a letter from mr j telling me that he had visited the house since i had seen him that he had found the two letters i had described replaced in the drawer from which i had taken them that he had read them with misgivings like my own that he had instituted a cautious inquiry about the woman to whom i rightly conjectured they had been written it seemed that thirtysix years ago a year before the date of the letters she had married against the wish of her relatives an american of very suspicious character in fact he was generally believed to have been a pirate she herself was the daughter of very respectable tradespeople and had served in the capacity of nursery governess before her marriage she had a brother a widower who was considered wealthy and who had one child about six years old a month after the marriage the body of this brother was found in the thames near london bridge there seemed some marks of violence about his throat but they were not deemed sufficient to warrant the inquest in any other verdict than that of found drowned the american and his wife took charge of the little boy the deceased brother having by his will left his sister the guardian of his only child and in event of the childs death the sister inherited the child died about six months afterward it was supposed to have been neglected and illtreated the neighbors deposed to have heard it shriek at night the surgeon who had examined it after death said that it was emaciated as if from want of nourishment and the body was covered with livid bruises it seemed that one winter night the child had sought to escape had crept out into the back yard tried to scale the wall fallen back exhausted and had been found at morning on the stones in a dying state but though there was some evidence of cruelty there was none of murder and the aunt and her husband had sought to palliate cruelty by alleging the exceeding stubbornness and perversity of the child who was declared to be halfwitted be that as it may at the orphans death the aunt inherited her brothers fortune before the first wedded year was out the american quitted england abruptly and never returned to it he obtained a cruising vessel which was lost in the atlantic two years afterwards the widow was left in affluence but reverses of various kinds had befallen her a bank broke an investment failed she went into a small business and became insolvent then she entered into service sinking lower and lower from housekeeper down to maidofallwork never long retaining a place though nothing peculiar against her character was ever alleged she was considered sober honest and peculiarly quiet in her ways still nothing prospered with her and so she had dropped into the workhouse from which mr j had taken her to be placed in charge of the very house which she had rented as mistress in the first year of her wedded life mr j added that he had passed an hour alone in the unfurnished room which i had urged him to destroy and that his impressions of dread while there were so great though he had neither heard nor seen anything that he was eager to have the walls bared and the floors removed as i had suggested he had engaged persons for the work and would commence any day i would name the day was accordingly fixed i repaired to the haunted house we went into the blind dreary room took up the skirting and then the floors under the rafters covered with rubbish was found a trapdoor quite large enough to admit a man it was closely nailed down with clamps and rivets of iron on removing these we descended into a room below the existence of which had never been suspected in this room there had been a window and a flue but they had been bricked over evidently for many years by the help of candles we examined this place it still retained some mouldering furniturethree chairs an oak settee a tableall of the fashion of about eighty years ago there was a chest of drawers against the wall in which we found half rotted away oldfashioned articles of a mans dress such as might have been worn eighty or a hundred years ago by a gentleman of some rank costly steel buckles and buttons like those yet worn in courtdresses a handsome courtsword in a waistcoat which had once been rich with goldlace but which was now blackened and foul with damp we found five guineas a few silver coins and an ivory ticket probably for some place of entertainment long since passed away but our main discovery was in a kind of iron safe fixed to the wall the lock of which it cost us much trouble to get picked in this safe were three shelves and two small drawers ranged on the shelves were several small bottles of crystal hermetically stopped they contained colorless volatile essences of what nature i shall say no more than that they were not poisons phosphor and ammonia entered into some of them there were also some very curious glass tubes and a small pointed rod of iron with a large lump of rockcrystal and another of amber also a loadstone of great power in one of the drawers we found a miniature portrait set in gold and retaining the freshness of its colors most remarkably considering the length of time it had probably been there the portrait was that of a man who might be somewhat advanced in middle life perhaps fortyseven or fortyeight it was a most peculiar face a most impressive face if you could fancy some mighty serpent transformed into man preserving in the human lineaments the old serpent type you would have a better idea of that countenance than long descriptions can convey the width and flatness of frontal the tapering elegance of contour disguising the strength of the deadly jaw the long large terrible eye glittering and green as the emerald and withal a certain ruthless calm as if from the consciousness of an immense power the strange thing was this the instant i saw the miniature i recognized a startling likeness to one of the rarest portraits in the world the portrait of a man of rank only below that of royalty who in his own day had made a considerable noise history says little or nothing of him but search the correspondence of his contemporaries and you find reference to his wild daring his bold profligacy his restless spirit his taste for the occult sciences while still in the meridian of life he died and was buried so say the chronicles in a foreign land he died in time to escape the grasp of the law for he was accused of crimes which would have given him to the headsman after his death the portraits of him which had been numerous for he had been a munificent encourager of art were bought up and destroyed it was supposed by his heirs who might have been glad could they have razed his very name from their splendid line he had enjoyed vast wealth a large portion of this was believed to have been embezzled by a favorite astrologer or soothsayer at all events it had unaccountably vanished at the time of his death one portrait alone of him was supposed to have escaped the general destruction i had seen it in the house of a collector some months before it had made on me a wonderful impression as it does on all who behold it a face never to be forgotten and there was that face in the miniature that lay within my hand true that in the miniature the man was a few years older than in the portrait i had seen or than the original was even at the time of his death but a few yearswhy between the date in which flourished that direful noble and the date in which the miniature was evidently painted there was an interval of more than two centuries while i was thus gazing silent and wondering mr j said but is it possible i have known this man how where cried i in india he was high in the confidence of the rajah of and wellnigh drew him into a revolt which would have lost the rajah his dominions the man was a frenchman his name de v clever bold lawless we insisted on his dismissal and banishment it must be the same man no two faces like his yet this miniature seems nearly a hundred years old mechanically i turned round the miniature to examine the back of it and on the back was engraved a pentacle in the middle of the pentacle a ladder and the third step of the ladder was formed by the date examining still more minutely i detected a spring this on being pressed opened the back of the miniature as a lid withinside the lid were engraved mariana to thee be faithful in life and in death to here follows a name that i will not mention but it was not unfamiliar to me i had heard it spoken of by old men in my childhood as the name borne by a dazzling charlatan who had made a great sensation in london for a year or so and had fled the country on the charge of a double murder within his own housethat of his mistress and his rival i said nothing of this to mr j to whom reluctantly i resigned the miniature we had found no difficulty in opening the first drawer within the iron safe we found great difficulty in opening the second it was not locked but it resisted all efforts till we inserted in the chinks the edge of a chisel when we had thus drawn it forth we found a very singular apparatus in the nicest order upon a small thin book or rather tablet was placed a saucer of crystal this saucer was filled with a clear liquid on that liquid floated a kind of compass with a needle shifting rapidly round but instead of the usual points of a compass were seven strange characters not very unlike those used by astrologers to denote the planets a very peculiar but not strong nor displeasing odor came from this drawer which was lined with a wood that we afterward discovered to be hazel whatever the cause of this odor it produced a material effect on the nerves we all felt it even the two workmen who were in the room a creeping tingling sensation from the tips of the fingers to the roots of the hair impatient to examine the tablet i removed the saucer as i did so the needle of the compass went round and round with exceeding swiftness and i felt a shock that ran through my whole frame so that i dropped the saucer on the floor the liquid was spilt the saucer was broken the compass rolled to the end of the room and at that instant the walls shook to and fro as if a giant had swayed and rocked them the two workmen were so frightened that they ran up the ladder by which we had descended from the trapdoor but seeing that nothing more happened they were easily induced to return meanwhile i had opened the tablet it was bound in plain red leather with a silver clasp it contained but one sheet of thick vellum and on that sheet were inscribed within a double pentacle words in old monkish latin which are literally to be translated thus on all that it can reach within these walls sentient or inanimate living or dead as moves the needle so works my will accursed be the house and restless the dwellers therein we found no more mr j burnt the tablet and its anathema he razed to the foundation the part of the building containing the secret room with the chamber over it he had then the courage to inhabit the house himself for a month and a quieter better conditioned house could not be found in all london subsequently he let it to advantage and his tenant has made no complaints but my story is not yet done a few days after mr j had removed into the house i paid him a visit we were standing by the open window and conversing a van containing some articles of furniture which he was moving from his former house was at the door i had just urged on him my theory that all those phenomena regarded as supermundane had emanated from a human brain adducing the charm or rather curse we had found and destroyed in support of my theory mr j was observing in reply that even if mesmerism or whatever analogous power it might be called could really thus work in the absence of the operator and produce effects so extraordinary still could those effects continue when the operator himself was dead and if the spell had been wrought and indeed the room walled up more than seventy years ago the probability was that the operator had long since departed this lifemr j i say was thus answering when i caught hold of his arm and pointed to the street below a welldressed man had crossed from the opposite side and was accosting the carrier in charge of the van his face as he stood was exactly fronting our window it was the face of the miniature we had discovered it was the face of the portrait of the noble three centuries ago good heavens cried mr j that is the face of de v and scarcely a day older than when i saw it in the rajahs court in my youth seized by the same thought we both hastened down stairs i was first in the street but the man had already gone i caught sight of him however not many yards in advance and in another moment i was by his side i had resolved to speak to him but when i looked into his face i felt as if it were impossible to do so that eyethe eye of the serpentfixed and held me spellbound and withal about the mans whole person there was a dignity an air of pride and station and superiority that would have made any one habituated to the usages of the world hesitate long before venturing upon a liberty or impertinence and what could i say what was it i could ask thus ashamed of my first impulse i fell a few paces back still however following the stranger undecided what else to do meanwhile he turned the corner of the street a plain carriage was in waiting with a servant out of livery dressed like a valet de place at the carriage door in another moment he had stepped into the carriage and it drove off i returned to the house mr j was still at the street door he had asked the carrier what the stranger had said to him merely asked whom that house now belonged to the same evening i happened to go with a friend to a place in town called the cosmopolitan club a place open to men of all countries all opinions all degrees one orders ones coffee smokes ones cigar one is always sure to meet agreeable sometimes remarkable persons i had not been two minutes in the room before i beheld at table conversing with an acquaintance of mine whom i will designate by the initial g the man the original of the miniature he was now without his hat and the likeness was yet more startling only i observed that while he was conversing there was less severity in the countenance there was even a smile though a very quiet and very cold one the dignity of mien i had acknowledged in the street was also more striking a dignity akin to that which invests some prince of the east conveying the idea of supreme indifference and habitual indisputable indolent but resistless power g soon after left the stranger who then took up a scientific journal which seemed to absorb his attention i drew g aside who and what is that gentleman that oh a very remarkable man indeed i met him last year amidst the caves of petra the scriptural edom he is the best oriental scholar i know we joined company had an adventure with robbers in which he showed a coolness that saved our lives afterward he invited me to spend a day with him in a house he had bought at damascus a house buried amongst almondblossoms and roses the most beautiful thing he had lived there for some years quite as an oriental in grand style i half suspect he is a renegade immensely rich very odd by the by a great mesmerizer i have seen him with my own eyes produce an effect on inanimate things if you take a letter from your pocket and throw it to the other end of the room he will order it to come to his feet and you will see the letter wriggle itself along the floor till it has obeyed his command pon my honor tis true i have seen him affect even the weather disperse or collect clouds by means of a glass tube or wand but he does not like talking of these matters to strangers he has only just arrived in england says he has not been here for a great many years let me introduce him to you certainly he is english then what is his name oh a very homely onerichards and what is his birthhis family how do i know what does it signify no doubt some parvenu but rich so infernally rich g drew me up to the stranger and the introduction was effected the manners of mr richards were not those of an adventurous traveller travellers are in general gifted with high animal spirits they are talkative eager imperious mr richards was calm and subdued in tone with manners which were made distant by the loftiness of punctilious courtesy the manners of a former age i observed that the english he spoke was not exactly of our day i should even have said that the accent was slightly foreign but then mr richards remarked that he had been little in the habit for many years of speaking in his native tongue the conversation fell upon the changes in the aspect of london since he had last visited our metropolis g then glanced off to the moral changesliterary social politicalthe great men who were removed from the stage within the last twenty years the new great men who were coming on in all this mr richards evinced no interest he had evidently read none of our living authors and seemed scarcely acquainted by name with our younger statesmen once and only once he laughed it was when g asked him whether he had any thoughts of getting into parliament and the laugh was inward sarcastic sinister a sneer raised into a laugh after a few minutes g left us to talk to some other acquaintances who had just lounged into the room and i then said quietly i have seen a miniature of you mr richards in the house you once inhabited and perhaps builtif not wholly at least in partin oxford street you passed by that house this morning not till i had finished did i raise my eyes to his and then his fixed my gaze so steadfastly that i could not withdraw itthose fascinating serpenteyes but involuntarily and as if the words that translated my thought were dragged from me i added in a low whisper i have been a student in the mysteries of life and nature of those mysteries i have known the occult professors i have the right to speak to you thus and i uttered a certain password well i concede the right what would you ask to what extent human will in certain temperaments can extend to what extent can thought extend think and before you draw breath you are in china true but my thought has no power in china give it expression and it may have you may write down a thought which sooner or later may alter the whole condition of china what is a law but a thought therefore thought is infinite therefore thought has power not in proportion to its valuea bad thought may make a bad law as potent as a good thought can make a good one yes what you say confirms my own theory through invisible currents one human brain may transmit its ideas to other human brains with the same rapidity as a thought promulgated by visible means and as thought is imperishable as it leaves its stamp behind it in the natural world even when the thinker has passed out of this world so the thought of the living may have power to rouse up and revive the thoughts of the dead such as those thoughts were in life though the thought of the living cannot reach the thoughts which the dead now may entertain is it not so i decline to answer if in my judgment thought has the limit you would fix to it but proceed you have a special question you wish to put intense malignity in an intense will engendered in a peculiar temperament and aided by natural means within the reach of science may produce effects like those ascribed of old to evil magic it might thus haunt the walls of a human habitation with spectral revivals of all guilty thoughts and guilty deeds once conceived and done within those walls all in short with which the evil will claims rapport and affinityimperfect incoherent fragmentary snatches at the old dramas acted therein years ago thoughts thus crossing each other haphazard as in the nightmare of a vision growing up into phantom sights and sounds and all serving to create horror not because those sights and sounds are really visitations from a world without but that they are ghastly monstrous renewals of what have been in this world itself set into malignant play by a malignant mortal and it is through the material agency of that human brain that these things would acquire even a human power would strike as with the shock of electricity and might kill if the thought of the person assailed did not rise superior to the dignity of the original assailer might kill the most powerful animal if unnerved by fear but not injure the feeblest man if while his flesh crept his mind stood out fearless thus when in old stories we read of a magician rent to pieces by the fiends he had invoked or still more in eastern legends that one magician succeeds by arts in destroying another there may be so far truth that a material being has clothed from his own evil propensities certain elements and fluids usually quiescent or harmless with awful shapes and terrific force just as the lightning that had lain hidden and innocent in the cloud becomes by natural law suddenly risible takes a distinct shape to the eye and can strike destruction on the object to which it is attracted you are not without glimpses of a mighty secret said mr richards composedly according to your view could a mortal obtain the power you speak of he would necessarily be a malignant and evil being if the power were exercised as i have said most malignant and most evil though i believe in the ancient traditions that he could not injure the good his will could only injure those with whom it has established an affinity or over whom it forces unresisted sway i will now imagine an example that may be within the laws of nature yet seem wild as the fables of a bewildered monk you will remember that albertus magnus after describing minutely the process by which spirits may be invoked and commanded adds emphatically that the process will instruct and avail only to the few that a man must be born a magician that is born with a peculiar physical temperament as a man is born a poet rarely are men in whose constitution lurks this occult power of the highest order of intellect usually in the intellect there is some twist perversity or disease but on the other hand they must possess to an astonishing degree the faculty to concentrate thought on a single objectthe energic faculty that we call will therefore though their intellect be not sound it is exceedingly forcible for the attainment of what it desires i will imagine such a person preeminently gifted with this constitution and its concomitant forces i will place him in the loftier grades of society i will suppose his desires emphatically those of the sensualist he has therefore a strong love of life he is an absolute egotist his will is concentred in himself he has fierce passions he knows no enduring no holy affections but he can covet eagerly what for the moment he desires he can hate implacably what opposes itself to his objects he can commit fearful crimes yet feel small remorse he resorts rather to curses upon others than to penitence for his misdeeds circumstances to which his constitution guides him lead him to a rare knowledge of the natural secrets which may serve his egotism he is a close observer where his passions encourage observation he is a minute calculator not from love of truth but where love of self sharpens his faculties therefore he can be a man of science i suppose such a being having by experience learned the power of his arts over others trying what may be the power of will over his own frame and studying all that in natural philosophy may increase that power he loves life he dreads death he wills to live on he cannot restore himself to youth he cannot entirely stay the progress of death he cannot make himself immortal in the flesh and blood but he may arrest for a time so long as to appear incredible if i said it that hardening of the parts which constitutes old age a year may age him no more than an hour ages another his intense will scientifically trained into system operates in short over the wear and tear of his own frame he lives on that he may not seem a portent and a miracle he dies from time to time seemingly to certain persons having schemed the transfer of a wealth that suffices to his wants he disappears from one corner of the world and contrives that his obsequies shall be celebrated he reappears at another corner of the world where he resides undetected and does not visit the scenes of his former career till all who could remember his features are no more he would be profoundly miserable if he had affections he has none but for himself no good man would accept his longevity and to no man good or bad would he or could he communicate its true secret such a man might exist such a man as i have described i see now before meduke of in the court of dividing time between lust and brawl alchemists and wizards again in the last century charlatan and criminal with name less noble domiciled in the house at which you gazed today and flying from the law you had outraged none knew whither traveller once more revisiting london with the same earthly passions which filled your heart when races now no more walked through yonder streets outlaw from the school of all the nobler and diviner mysteries execrable image of life in death and death in life i warn you back from the cities and homes of healthful men back to the ruins of departed empires back to the deserts of nature unredeemed there answered me a whisper so musical so potently musical that it seemed to enter into my whole being and subdue me despite myself thus it said i have sought one like you for the last hundred years now i have found you we part not till i know what i desire the vision that sees through the past and cleaves through the veil of the future is in you at this hournever before never to come again the vision of no puling fantastic girl of no sickbed somnambule but of a strong man with a vigorous brain soar and look forth as he spoke i felt as if i rose out of myself upon eagle wings all the weight seemed gone from air roofless the room roofless the dome of space i was not in the bodywhere i knew not but aloft over time over earth again i heard the melodious whisper you say right i have mastered great secrets by the power of will true by will and by science i can retard the process of years but death comes not by age alone can i frustrate the accidents which bring death upon the young no every accident is a providence before a providence snaps every human will shall i die at last ages and ages hence by the slow though inevitable growth of time or by the cause that i call accident by a cause you call accident is not the end still remote asked the whisper with a slight tremor regarded as my life regards time it is still remote and shall i before then mix with the world of men as i did ere i learned these secrets resume eager interest in their strife and their trouble battle with ambition and use the power of the sage to win the power that belongs to kings you will yet play a part on the earth that will fill earth with commotion and amaze for wondrous designs have you a wonder yourself been permitted to live on through the centuries all the secrets you have stored will then have their uses all that now makes you a stranger amidst the generations will contribute then to make you their lord as the trees and the straws are drawn into a whirlpool as they spin round are sucked to the deep and again tossed aloft by the eddies so shall races and thrones be drawn into your vortex awful destroyer but in destroying made against your own will a constructor and that date too is far off far off when it comes think your end in this world is at hand how and what is the end look east west south and north in the north where you never yet trod toward the point whence your instincts have warned you there a spectre will seize you tis death i see a ship it is haunted tis chased it sails on baffled navies sail after that ship it enters the region of ice it passes a sky red with meteors two moons stand on high over icereefs i see the ship locked between white defiles they are icerocks i see the dead strew the decks stark and livid green mould on their limbs all are dead but one manit is you but years though so slowly they come have then scathed you there is the coming of age on your brow and the will is relaxed in the cells of the brain still that will though enfeebled exceeds all that man knew before you through the will you live on gnawed with famine and nature no longer obeys you in that deathspreading region the sky is a sky of iron and the air has iron clamps and the icerocks wedge in the ship hark how it cracks and groans ice will imbed it as amber imbeds a straw and a man has gone forth living yet from the ship and its dead and he has clambered up the spikes of an iceberg and the two moons gaze down on his form that man is yourself and terror is on youterror and terror has swallowed up your will and i see swarming up the steep icerock gray grizzly things the bears of the north have scented their quarry they come near you and nearer shambling and rolling their bulk and in that day every moment shall seem to you longer than the centuries through which you have passed and heed this after life moments continued make the bliss or the hell of eternity hush said the whisper but the day you assure me is far off very far i go back to the almond and rose of damascus sleep the room swam before my eyes i became insensible when i recovered i found g holding my hand and smiling he said you who have always declared yourself proof against mesmerism have succumbed at last to my friend richards where is mr richards gone when you passed into a trance saying quietly to me your friend will not wake for an hour i asked as collectedly as i could where mr richards lodged at the trafalgar hotel give me your arm said i to g let us call on him i have something to say when we arrived at the hotel we were told that mr richards had returned twenty minutes before paid his bill left directions with his servant a greek to pack his effects and proceed to malta by the steamer that should leave southampton the next day mr richards had merely said of his own movements that he had visits to pay in the neighborhood of london and it was uncertain whether he should be able to reach southampton in time for that steamer if not he should follow in the next one the waiter asked me my name on my informing him he gave me a note that mr richards had left for me in case i called the note was as follows i wished you to utter what was in your mind you obeyed i have therefore established power over you for three months from this day you can communicate to no living man what has passed between us you cannot even show this note to the friend by your side during three months silence complete as to me and mine do you doubt my power to lay on you this command try to disobey me at the end of the third month the spell is raised for the rest i spare you i shall visit your grave a year and a day after it has received you so ends this strange story which i ask no one to believe i write it down exactly three months after i received the above note i could not write it before nor could i show to g in spite of his urgent request the note which i read under the gaslamp by his side illustration text decoration doutre mort by harriet prescott spofford a mountain intervale all velveted in green and half the verdure overlaid with gold by broad rays of sunset falling level through the passthe hills behind a gray and gloomy encampment softened with wreaths of vapor and dim recesses of deepest purple and here and there above the gaps a pale star trembling on the paler blue in spite of the approaching night there was a gay glad strength about the scene so that all who saw it might have felt light at heart as if the rocky rampart shut out the sorrows of the world and made the charmed valley an enchanted place they had been mowing in the intervale halfformed haycocks picturesquely piled along the meadows loaded the air with heavy sweetness in one partly overthrown a lounger lolled luxuriously singing idly to himself that little venetian song of brownings to some tune delightful as the words o which were best to roam or rest the lands lap or the waters breast to sleep on yellow milletsheaves or swim in lucid shallows just eluding waterlily leaves an inch from deaths black fingers thrust to lock you whom release he must which life were best on summer eves the perfumed wind blew softly over the singer like a placid breath the sense of gathering evening hung above him he lay upon the billowy hay as if it were a cloud he was a voluptuary in his pleasures well for him if they were always as innocent a young girl approached the singer swinging her hat as she came and radiant in the low sunshine she was named orienteither because she seemed with her golden locks her fresh fair tints like an impersonation of morning and the east or because when she was born hopes daystar rose again in her mothers forlorn heart such a lovely yet halffantastic creature was she that you hardly believed in her existence when away from her what are you looking for orient said the lounger the fountain of youth answered her silvery tones it should be somewhere in this happy valley you do not need it he replied after a lingering glance she stooped and extricated a long sweetbrier bough from the hay with which it had been bent but not cut down and twisted it still blossoming round and round her head till it made a fragrant diadem of rosy stars do not said reymund take it off or i shall have to do as voltaire did erect my long thin body and stand before you like a point of admiration orient did not reply and fulfilling his threat he went on by her side to the old farmhouse that had been turned into a summer hostelry for guests more stars were beginning to steal forth in the tender firmament the breeze blew down more freshly from the hills and brought the big dews and scattered starbeams with it music was hushed and all the world was still it was summer evening yet an unreal kind of summer as summer might be in a distant dream blown over by cool awakening winds now and then orient stopped to pick up a great butterfly that had fallen benumbed from its perch and lay it gently to rest among the leaves without brushing a speck of dust from its freckled wings after that her fingers worked in a vine by the way and she pulled aside a tendril that kept a sleepy flower from shutting up its petals as she did so a little motherbird upon her eggs stirred and briefly twittered out her secret to orients ear reymund who loitered in waiting for her thought she seemed as much as any of them like a flower a moth a bird herself a beautiful and almost dumb existence of nature he was not a man easily intimidated or of unvaried experience but the thin atmosphere of awe about this girl was something he had never penetrated the ease with which he met another toward her became impertinence gay and careless with many he felt that she was something apart sacred as a passionflower he scarcely dared approach her lightly when he spoke to her he crossed himself in his heart they had never met until a month ago yet their address had been familiar almost from the first on her side through a largeeyed childlike fearlessness on hishe could not have answered why he watched her as one watches a clear planet glow steadily from the soft golden sky but he seemed nevertheless to know all her characteristics without studying themhe imagined that to one weary of trifle and artifice and the hollow way of the world here was the rest divine yet beyond a point he found this cool remote being inaccessibleas though there had been a gulf between them he knew not how to call the blush to her cheek the sparkle to her eye if she had been some alien creature she might have been nearerto enrich her with human love was as fruitless an effort as scattering the pollen of a rose into the heart of a cold white lily and yet reymund knewas if through the same natural operations as those by which his pulse was made to beat his breath to drawthat orients soul needed his for its entireness that his soul required hers all as much as a star needed its atmosphere a flower its fragrance the earth itself its spheral roundness it was not so much that he already loved her passionately as that he felt himself lost without her he had been in orients presence it seemed all the time that he had ever lived how could he then depart from it if that which was a clod suddenly found itself a bed of blossom how could it ever return again to dreary earthiness he watched her now approaching had any one said that she trailed lustre behind her as she walked he would have answered that he had seen it but to speak to her of any grace or charm or perfection that she possessedwhy these things were herself her identity sacred and secret as easily to some skyey messenger of solemn heaven commend his airy flight in what wonderful ways these mountains change their expression said reymund as she joined him again at last yes she replied they are different beings every hour a little while ago he continued they seemed like an army of giants sitting down to besiege the valley now they are a wall between us and mankind death cannot break through it sickness cannot cross it they are more alive than that said orient this old sombre one moved aside just now to make room for the little alp laughing over his shoulder with the rosy vapor streaming high on her face perhaps you hear what they are saying to one another then he asked half jestingly i often do and you will translate no in the first place you would laugh in the last place disbelieve on my soulno i am not certain that you have a soul indeed is it so half sadly they say what the torrents rushing down by chamouni say ah and at other times they talk of the beginning of the earth and conjecture concerning the end of things and do they take any notice of you nature always seems to me careless and indifferent they invite me to come up and lie down on their great sides where the sun has lain all day before me yes they always smile upon me do not goat least until the mamma and i go with you i should not be afraid alone nofear had never found the depths of those liquid lucent eyes he thought the mountains might be civil enough he rejoined and give you their purple berries to eat their wild white brooks to drink but i could not answer for the black bears and snakes i think i could and this of course is only what you interpret the hills to mean sitting there in their grim conclave and affording us such a narrow coronal of sky asked reymund smiling i do not know she answered doubtfully i said things were real to me there must have been those like you who first saw and believed in fairies and all the goblin people he said still smiling my father died before i was born said orient perhaps that gave me some lien upon the spiritual world then you see bogles as well as other thingsas well as the personalities of bud and bird and granite pile uncanny creature what pleasure shall i take in meeting your glance when it rests also on a dead man behind me and on the fetch of one about to join the innumerable caravan beside me i must take my revenge normally and in kindif i die before you you shall surely have a visitation from me how should you like that you would be just as welcome then as now she answered gravely an equivocal compliment nevertheless i accept it as a challenge will you promise its counterpart when i die said orient i shall have other things to do but i would like to see a ghost just to be assured that there are such things as if there could be any doubt you understand then he said as she went in under the low woodbinecurtained door that at some timewhen time shall be no morei will cast my shadow at your feet it was an hour later that while he still strolled in the short wet grass and enjoyed the rich halfdusky atmosphere he heard orient singing gently from her window as she leaned out upon the cool starsown air and the song seemed to belong to her like a natural expression as to the night the nightwind or to the dark the dew in the evening over me leaning often i fancy a waving wing and with the warning of blushing morning softly glimmers the same fair thing o bright being beyond the seeing of aught but the spirit that feels you near your white star leaving and earthward cleaving you break the murk of this mortal sphere still sweet stranger in peace or danger out of the air above me bloom and heavens own sweetness in such completeness drop on my head from your shining plume even while he heard her singing the sense of her remoteness gave reymund a slight shudder if she had been one shade more human if he had ever seen her moved by any sparkle of wit any drollery of humor into a frolicking outburst of laughter by any mischievous vexation into a flash of anger a season of pettishnessbut no such little incidents affected her no more than thistledown affects the wind and recognizing it reymund knew that he loved her yet felt somehow as he felt who had pledged a bridal ring upon the finger of a ghost as that youth felt perchance whose beautiful mistress was after all a ghoul he need not have concerned himself orient had no especial care for him he passed before her busy in her world of dreams like a shadow if she smiled upon him it was as she smiled on everything else about her as she smiled on the pinkwreathed peachbough on the urchin tumbling in grass on the sunbeam overlaying both on blue sky or on rainy weather though indeed for the latter orient had superfluous smiles she was always sunny herself upon a stormy day she used to say that it seemed as if nature had grown so familiar with her that she could afford to receive her and show herself to her in undress perhaps had reymund been more free himself from the soil and stain of earth orient would not have been so intangible they were going one day up the mountain orient her mother the guide and reymund the first two riding reymund and the guide on foot the air was so clear that it seemed like living in the inside of a crystal everything stood with sharp outlines as if drawn with a burin upon the deep substance of the blue far away tender gauzes took up the distance but that was merely on the outside edges of the world after they had exhausted the view from the widereaching summit where the eye seemed to wrest from the creator more than had ever been given to it they went below into the shelter of the great rocks and lunched it was late in the afternoon ere they remounted and sought their way down the long descent the path which had been slight with difficulties in climbing was now full of downward terrors orient bent far back in her seat unable to see where her horse would plant his feet it seemed to her that he was stepping over sheer abysses and just as she herself went sliding and slipping forward over his head and down a strong arm from an unseen form behind the cliff round which she had just wound would grasp her and reymund would hold her firm till the beast stood foursquare again it was to her a thing like the arm of providence made visible to faith suddenly the girth broke and but for that strong arm on the instant outstretched providence itself alone knows what would have become of her reymund caught her then as she reeled from the saddle and placed her on the ground the horse startled by the unexpectedness of the affair fled forward the guide left the bridle he had held behind and pursued him catching the rein with a jerk and oath he dealt such a blow with his boot that the animal lost his balance and fell and would have rolled over the precipice but for a prostrate tree in a moment what reymund had wanted to see was granted him orient sprang forward her face aflame her eyes like balefires the guide amazed as one might be at the sight of an avenger in his path obeyed her single word her vehement gesture and plunged down the way and left them orient what have you done cried her mother well well mamma answered the suddenly convicted and penitent one we can follow his red cap but the guide twice too cunning hid himself in underhung paths that he knew and they had not a sign or signal for aid nevertheless reymund gladly accepted this fate because of the thing that brought it and at which another man would have looked askance this thing this little temper had proved to him that orient was humanand therefore to be won he raised the pony remounted orient and did his best in place of their faithless leader trusting more to the instincts of the animals themselves than to any mountaincraft of his own the sharp outlines of distant peaks began to burn and blacken those of the nearer rock and stunted shrub to grow diffuse the air was keen and chill a reddening sunset smouldered in clouds below them and shut out the world a cold wet mist below threatened to come creeping up around them the horses neighed to each other grew jaded and uncertain stopped masses of impassable rock closed them in on every side save the narrow defile through which they came and the precipice below the atmosphere was purple with shade and clung to them in dew already one star hung out its blue lamp we can go no farther said reymund this spot is more sheltered than any we are likely to find let us do what we can for comfort and wait for the morning the mother bewailed herself but orient made cheer and while reymund corralled the horses she was busy collecting twigs and splinters and bits of wood and dry moss in a pile light them with your matches reymund she said a cigar will keep you warm but we need a bit of blaze perhaps when it is darker he replied you will need it more a little nearer to the witching time do you imagine we shall see witches take care or you will see stars he rode alone through the silent night she swam like a star to his left and right sang orient after all it is not the walpurgis night if we could only have a cup of tea sighed the mamma at a loss for her luxuries in the wilderness it will be so much more refreshing tomorrow said orient and seasoned with romancea dash of dangeryour first adventure little mother but the little mother had no fancy for adventures and while her daughter lost all her serenity and was crazy with delight at the wild beauty of the thing she grew more and more lachrymose and afforded at last a good background of shower for all orients rainbows thereon orient sitting down put her arms round her and comforted her till the mother became herself somewhat alive to the circumstance that one seldom saw such a scene twice in a lifetime they had remained on the rocky platform where they paused a shelf that after a few yards ended in an abrupt fall that led away by a course of stark precipices into the great valley beneath this valley filled with rolling vapor whose volumes smitten by sunset were fused in splendid color made a pavilion of cloud beneath them where billows of fleecy crimson and shining scarlet curdled together into creamy crests here seeming to lash in featherwhite foam against the base of some crag and there letting a late sunbeam plough through spaces of a violetdark drift till they were all inwrought with gold above them the cold and mighty heaven was already faintly but thickly strewn with stars into what awful and glorious region are we translated cried orient we are above the world and the people of the world are we flesh and blood the free spirits of the air have no such liberty as this of ours said reymund it is just as if we were dead shivered the mamma and im sure its cold enough for that orient wrapped the shawls about the doleful little woman while reymund opened his knapsack for any remnants of lunch that might afford them consolation he kindled the fire too for the colors were fading away beneath and the sky was getting gloomy overhead and warmed and enlivened in the genial light of the briefly crackling blaze they forgot that they were lost upon the mountain and all the possible horrors of their fate but to reymund there were few horrors in it for if he died of exposure and starvation there on the bald pitiless mountain it would be with orient in his arms at last while the fire crackled reymund found in his breastpocket a tiny flask of cordial which he divided into three portions drink it he said to them and make it take the place of the tea it is chartreuseoily sunshinedistilled from the cones of some old firtree first cousin to the cedars of lebanon for all i know mark how you taste hemlock in it socrates poisoned with hemlock no no he drank himself to death on chartreuse orient heard him indignantly i do not like it said she when her turn came and left hers in the horn reymund laughed he hesitated a moment then tossed it off himself the fire did not last them long for all the twigs they could collect were scanty the blaze had heated the rock a little they drew closer to it and the mother curling up against it in her shawls composed herself as she could for slumber the voices of orient and reymund from where they still sat and talked together lulled her as the murmur of the waterfall lulled sleep himself orient was repeating jean ingelows dream of her lover fallen and dead among the hills with its vague and awesome imagery i do not understand she said as she ceased this solicitude that my mother and so many others feel concerning their burialplace i love life delicious life but if we die and lie unburied here forever among the lonely precipices it will not matter any more to us than it did to the youth and she repeated again the first hath no advantageit shall not soothe his slumber that a lock of his brown hair his father aye shall keep for the last he nothing grudgeth it shall naught his quiet cumber that in a golden mesh of his callow eaglets sleep reymund quaked at the moment as he thought of any lustrous lock of orients curling out of the fierce beak that should tear it away from the white brow then he said too philosophic by half as for me with the first peep of day in this high meridian i shall be up and doing and find a way to our level again orperish in the attempt resolved to perish any way give you liberty or give you death i do not feel in such a hurry to be gone how silent and solemn it iswhat a clear darknesslisten a moment and catch the sough of that pine forest far beneath like the wings of some great spirit sifting the air i have never been so near heaven i understand now why in the bible they so often withdrew into a high mountain reymund did not answer her say your prayers innocent one was what he thought wherever you are there heaven is near by and by orient crept closer to her mother for mutual comfort wound her own cloak round her like a chrysalis and drowsed and dreamed reymund sat beside her his knees drawn up his hands clasped round them it was very cool the air was so still that he wondered at the absence of a stinging frost and he hugged himself thus for warmth orient stirred in her halfrecumbent sleep and her head fell on his shoulder after that the solid mountain was less immovable than he he let the beautiful head remain watching it with downcast sidelong gaze if he had longed with all his heart to smooth one tress to put his arm over her in a sheltering embrace he dared not touch her something said to him that she was of a grade above as the disembodied is beyond the clay said too that whatever lovely or fine there might be in himself the thickness of the outer wrapping rendered it invisible to her that for orient to read him right he must wait for another life in spite of all that he hopedhoped madly and wildly there in the chill night with the beautiful head fallen on his shoulder and the sweet warm breath stealing gently across his bending brow he had a strange fancy now and then that out of the encircling shadow a great face came and lookedwhether that of some uncreated thing some phantasm of his brain or that of some celestial being some resident of vast spaces or only a wild beast a big brown bear roving on their tracks and coming to peer about their unprotected bivouac whatever it was it retired as often as it came awed in its turn he thought by the sweet innocence of that golden head a late moon rose down over the low side of the earth as he still sat there he knew it by the strange coppery light that began to glow through the vapors that yet filled the gulfs beneath and boil them to a scum of dark dun gold then at last a broad beam parted the tumbling and sulphurous fogs and the bright thin crescent of the waning moon cut itself out on a clear air behind the horn of the hill and as if swinging from its sharp cusp hung the watery diamond of the morning star still reymund did not lift the head from his shoulder he chose rather that the fair apparition of daybreak at this height above the earth might happen to him as if through the imposition of that dear and tender touch by and by she stirred restlesslythe spell of her slumber was breaking he moved away gently and left her the rock for a pillow when the heavens were paling and retreating in a mist of starbreath and when all the world was whitening about her and the great floor of cloud beneath was inwrought by dawn with sparks of fire so that they seemed wrapped in an atmosphere of flame and snow orient awoke no hero in his selfrestraint in one wild forgetful moment of that morning reymund told orient that he loved her she repulsed him so gently that it gave him reason to hope yet so firmly that he could do nothing but despair he urged that she was unconscious of herself that she did not know her own heart nor what it wanted that he had approached her inner life more nearly than another might ever do that give him time and chance he could not fail to win her she only answered that she was not won before in their windings and wanderings they had reached the foot of the mountain that day they met their recusant and repentant guide coming up with others in search of them and all their toil and trouble were over reymunds holiday was over too he was to return next day to his home to engagements previously formed and not to be disregarded at least he said to orient not sadly but with a certain vigor of intention in his tone you will allow me to visit you at your mothers house you could not do a kinder thing answered orient feeling now the gap that he would leave and which nothing could quite fill and willing to grant him anything but what he most desired then you will see me on saturdays every saturday she exclaimed with a bright face that made his heart bound that is too much to ask of you perhaps not of me sunday is a spare day if i use it for gods worship it shall be at what shrine i pleasest orients or anothers and it is such a long ride demurred she remembering the miles on miles of low seacoast country threaded with rivers and inlaid with marshes that he must cross all day flying along through their damp breath and salt winds nine hours i am afraid i ought not to allow it and yetand yet nine or nineteen it shall make no difference orient had hesitated in her last sentence wondering how she could deny herself the sympathy in her little pursuits that through this time she had received from reymund she had not encountered it before it was delightful to her perhaps it only had not taught her love because she did not know what love was she had but little knowledge of human nature almost none at all of her own nature she preferred natural religion before theology natural history with its grandiose revolutions before the petty struggles of warriors and diplomatists which her view was not broad enough to throw into epochs and revolutions more grandiose yet it was reymund who had taught her to look with kindly curiosity upon the lives of those about her in hopes it may be of teaching her at last to look in upon her own of that she was unaware but the interest in the flower never found before today the discovery of the bird whose note had ravished the ear last sunset the hunt up brookside and hill for a fragment of quartz that should have a mountain range and outlying spurs of amethyst crystals or one full of imbedded beryls the shining hexagons like drops of light filtered through seawater or any heap of blooded garnets a blaze of concrete color the search into the age of the old pinetree on the precipice into the mountain strata and the wonderment concerning that day of the earths date on which they were upheaved the tracing out the path of some glacier with all its ancient and icy terrors overgrown by the verdant moss and turf of the moraine the perpetual looking for the makers fingers in his workall this and such as this she would miss and must resign if she forbade those recurring saturdays and then on the other hand a friend to meet with the results of work the choice book the weeks research its thought its fancy she who had had no intimates few friends reymund did not wait for her to balance her ideas the train arrives said he by five oclocka little before every saturday therefore at five oclock i shall be in your drawingroom the thing was settled then without her she began all at once to fear that after all it would not happen so he would let other things creep between when he was fairly at a distance from her he would be angry with her for having quite failed to feel that entire satisfaction in him to give him that love which in a high ideal she believed to be due from every woman to her husband a thousand things would hinder i can hardly believe it she said i am too happy when you doubt it he replied half reading her thoughts it gives me hope for we can easily believe that to which we are indifferent how can i be hindered when i will itand when you wish it the blush that streamed up her temples doubly pleased him do not doubt it he exclaimed with more vivacity than so small a thing appeared to demand for see i swear it i will be with you on each saturday at five oclock with your permission until the day i die so dropping her hand he went down the lane to the coach but looking back he saw her still standing in the doorway hung with such drooping drapery of woodbine round her head the sunlight lying in a glory on her golden hair the downy bloom upon her cheek as though it were a peach a smile upon her lip and heavens own blue within her eyeshe seemed the incarnation of a summer sunrise he saw the riotous wind lift one curl and twine it with the next drop the petal of a rose upon her mouth kiss and kiss again her ivory forehead free and welcome where he dared not ventureand the love in his heart made the blood boil hotly up his veins to cheek and browand for all testimony to his thrilling passion he only cried every saturday at five oclock and was away but before reymund plunged afresh into the exterior world which for these weeks had been shut from his sight he turned aside for one last outlook upon pleasure thus it happened that he left the train at an earlier station than the one near orients home partly to avoid recognition in the future partly for the sake of mounting and subduing a spirited horse which had been brought up to tear himself into a foam at sight of the engine reymund meant to gratify himself that day with a stroll through orients garden and among the haunts of her bright youth no one would have taken him for anything but an apparition who saw him galloping down the long country roads in a cloud of dust when he had conquered the angry temper of the beast he abated his gait and paced slowly along the margin of the twicemown meadows splendid in noon sunshine over the shaven surfaces of rusty reds and browns into which they shaded all their gilded verdure now and then a bittern cried from the bank of a tiny thread of the tide other notes were hushed there was only to be heard through the wide midday air the unbroken treble of the crickets across which the rich horns of the locusts shrilled like the elfin trumpets of a summers state reymund hitched his horse found a penetrable portion of the garden paling and entered it was a large old garden laid out fifty years ago perhaps in a kind of pleasance for in one place a slight hill rose above the rest while paths wandered round it into new and unsuspected regions in another a brook meandered and sang silverly over shining pebbles and among arrowheads and lilypods and dallying went its way at last to empty into some tidestreak and find the sounding sea that called to it all night weeds of course had overgrown the beds the untrained grapes hung heavily from wall and trellis wasps and blackbirds made merry together with the nectar of ripening pears plum and peach dropped ungathered from the bough vine and tendril leaf and spray and branch and blossom all wrought themselves to a delicious tangle of perfume and rustle and color here through the beautiful and envious weeds a gladiolus reared his flames a larkspur absorbed the very blue a carnation scattered spice here honeysuckles still blew out a perfect fragrance while mourningbrides and gillyflowers and spiked lavender and pansies sowed the air with their oldfashioned sweetness the soft lonely sky stretched away over the garden and the meadows to haze itself round low and distant woods and all the empty air seemed sad and desolate betweenthe fulness and richness of life at its high noon touching close upon the anticlimax of desert solitude through the place a light eastwind was blowing that had in it a tonic for the lungs like the sparkle of champagne and somehow through all the spaces of the neglected garden the spell of orient seemed complete there orient must have stood to twine that white rose upon the porch there her fingers must have twinkled among the young vineleaves there on that bank of turf she must many an afternoon have sat at work there in the shallow crystal of the brook she had waded with white feet to set the waterplants these lichencovered appletrees had shed how many a springtime the rosy snow of their petals around her head these gnarled old bergamots had dropped their pulpy globes into her hands this nuttree put out its leaves on the day when she was born her little feet had worn these paths the garden was the shadow of orient herself reduced to dumb and to material things he wondered what it would be by the magic of moonlightthe whole place silvered over with tranquil sheen and raised from every days dull sight into the dreamy and idealfull of cool dew and silence and holy hush as if it waited on her white sleep just under his feet where the seed had been thrown in handfuls he traced written out with blue forgetmenots the name of orient it would not do for him to stay much longer here he should grow wild with hopes and fancies for all he knew tread out that lovely name with his heel she must she should be won he clutched a cluster of the forgetmenots quickly escaped the labyrinth galloped back to the station at a rate that streaked his chafing steedand so away from dreams to life and real work thus reymund returned to his routine bills and lawsuits and politics routes and rides they were not calculated to lift him to any higher level than the old one and orient and her mother came home the mother having made quite as close acquaintance with the mountains as she cared to do saturdays now surely as they came brought reymund under the same roof with orient perhaps in their brief indulgence he found pardon for all the sins of the weekfor the week had its sins its little trivial condoning of misdemeanors as unimportant matters which lower one as steadily and certainly over the great pit as block and tackle might do over another on sunday nights when he glided away in the outward train he felt as if it were an easy thing to maintain the height which by orients side he gained but after a monday morning on the exchange after a tuesday night in the salon after his evening gallop on the horse possessed with the spirit of satan he said to himself it is of no use nature is too crude in me too gross a strain too deep a dye i should be like shelleys rock in the black abyss that has from unimaginable years sustained itself with terror and with toil over a gulf and with the agony with which it clings seems slowly coming down the thing is to abandon yet saturdays sunset shone for him again always over orients garden he had come one evening and found orient among the grapevines playing with a parcel of little children as pretty bright and fresh as a bunch of flowers after the hubbub of business the dust of travel this garden in a far outlying city suburb stretching towards the sea seemed as pure and innocent as eden on sunday morning when the air soared illumined with a stiller lustre when the azure deepened as if freshwashed by sacred rains and dews when the winds bore no murmur but that of ripening leaf and floating petal when the birds themselves seemed to sing in the sabbath and all the wide world to be gladly and tranquilly conscious of the daythey went to church together if orient was rapt in the worship reymund was at an exaltation as high for himrapt in his worship of her by times this very thing lifted him into the upper region his soul rose buoyant on the prayer and praise and floated forward like a waif on the full tide of the organs music when afterward he found himself and his sentience again he said the thing was in himcould he but keep the pitchwere orient forever by him to give him that keynote but alone we come into this world alone we go out of it neither orient nor another could for all eternity give the tone to any soul that discord or that harmony which one shall make must be the result of ones own being he sat with orient in the afternoon on the bank of turf that sloped down to the clear brown brook in whose bed many a diving and dipping sunbeam wrought mosaics of light and shade with the shining pebbles the brook rustled and lilted on its way a bird above it turned its burden into melody now and then a waft of wind rippled all its course till the lily leaves shivered and turned up their crimson linings soft clouds chased one another across the skyeverything around wore the bloom of peace and pleasure i often fear said reymund that i must come here no more the place grows too dear for one that must some day leave it orient turned and looked at him he saw her tremble not come here any more she said ah orient he cried once i declared to you the purpose of my life sometimesnowsometimesit seems to me as if you were almost won he bent above her glowing and passionate and daring she trembled again neither drew away nor surrendered herself to the waiting grasp i do not know she answered him the globy tears suffusing her eyes till each one shone like the great star that hung its blue lamp in the zenith that night when they were lost upon the mountain perhaps i cannot read my heart but does a woman really love that which is less strong than herself i must lean upon my husband not he on me am i so weak asked reymund with some bitterness and a quiver on his lip consider if your own nature had been invested with a coarser flesh left out thereby to coarser temptationssince passions are things of the fleshwhat would have come of it then if thrown in the midst of the revel loving the flash of merriment the excitement of chance and wine and dice were going roundbut no such speech is profanity yet orient under all habit under all action i think there is that in my soul akin to yours made to rule it and absorb it hidden by the body but theremade to be loved by you as you all of you flaws and beauties are loved by me if i could only see your soul said orient half yielding contrite yet uncertain one day perhaps you will answered reymund his repeater giving the hour to his fingerpressure now i must go he rose stooped again and touched her smooth cold forehead with his mouth the touch sent the blood back to his heart with time he murmured o with time she shall yetshe shall good bytill saturday again at five oclock and then was gone all that week reymund walked through his work with an absent mind as if his spirit had half left his body disengaging itself from the automaton of bone and muscle as one might say abstracted and lost in his thoughts his wishes his absolute resolutions old haunts had no attraction for him old faces brought him no satisfaction he sought no pleasure but such as was to be found on the back of that horse possessed by the spirit of satan and so he existed till the sunrise of saturday when before it should be quite time for the train he had the horse brought round for a gallop as if he would ride the wind and tame the whirlwind in the mean time orient pursued her way in what for her was perturbation there seemed to be a riddle in these days beyond her reading penitent over her pride in presuming herself to be stronger than her lover conscious that she could not dispense with him yet full as sure that she felt no perfect passion for him there was nothing to do but marvel what it meant i am drawn to him she said to herself ah i know that well enough but have i any right to be if there were something to confirm me if i thought the good and beautiful part were any abiding principle were anything but love of me if i could only see his soul she was walking that saturday afternoon in the woods that could be seen from her garden across the meadows it was a clear october afternoon the red leaves were dropping round her and leaving the bright blue sky more bare with every gentle gust that brought them to her feet a bracing day of early autumn when the wind fainted with the sweet freight of balsam from the pines and all things only prophesied hope and lightsomeness in spite of this orient could not tell why she had a constant sensation of gray and misty horizons of marshy air and cold seawind all day as she walked now the fitful breeze in the treetops seemed the muffled murmur of waves on the distant beach and once in a while she shivered as if a cold foamwreath were flying by her face she thought at first that all this damp and drear sensation was some sympathy with reymund now travelling along the seacoast on his way to her but what absurdity she said where the track lies the sky is as blue as this one the wind is scarcely more chilly there than here reymund is rolling along comfortable among his cushions and books and not a naked spirit all abroad in the seascented air she went home on the causeway that was laid along the meadowshurrying a little for she judged by the sinking sun that it must be nearly time for the arrival of the train as she went she heard her name called she turned for the voice seemed to come from the woods but seeing no one she fancied the note of some bird had followed her again the sound her name and reymunds voice he has come thought orient with a thrill of unsuspected pleasure and he is calling me from the garden and she made all haste to answer the summons in person going along then with her boughs of bright leaves she wished she had not delayed so long in the woodsher dress so soiled and her hands her hair so disordered she resolved to steal in at the side door and freshen her toilet before greeting him as the door was opened to her mr reymund has come said the maid gleefully i have just let him in he is waiting in the drawingroom very well answered orient tell him i will be there directly she hastened towards the staircase boughs in hand you havent seen your friend asked her aunt passing her on the landing as she sped up no replied orient again have you i just met him in the hall as he was entering the drawingroom said the good woman calling over the balusters and going her way orient hurried at her bath clad herself with all despatch and put on a garment whose airy frills and ruffles made her look like a white rose as she went by her mothers room the mother looked out and said lightly reymund has come did you know it yes mamma she answered why didnt you go and make him welcome o my hair was all down said the other i just caught a glimpse of him passing the foot of the stairs as he went into the drawingroom so orient stepped slowly down adjusting her bracelets as she went she saw reymund a second as the winding way of the stairs for that space allowed her standing in the baywindow and looking out she did not know what made her so hesitate to enter she paused a moment longer in the doorway gazing in the room was very gay with bunches of deepblue and scarlet salvia and drooping clusters of barberry boughs stringing their splendid pendants all along most graceful curves but there was another brightness than that in the room it was where reymund stood in the embrasure of the window with the late sunlight falling all over him she wondered that he did not advance to meet her but as she wondered went up the room toward him something must have happened to make him very happy thought orient i never saw such a smile perhaps it was this smile that so transfigured him a plain man commonly the sunshine now seemed to bring out rich dark tints on the countenance the eyes overflowed with light and whether it were grace of posture overlying sunshine or beaming smile features and face and figure expressed a subtle harmony and the man was beautifulbeautiful as a strong angel pictured in some instant of stooping flight he does not mean to speak till i do thought orient again but as she drew near the smile changed to a look of utter melancholy as a shining cloud melts into raina melancholy gaze that pierced her through and through she put out her hand nevertheless to take his extended grasp and there was nothing there in the same instant with a loud and terrible voice crying orienta voice as if it were the voice of death the tomb and all corruptionthe thing had vanished the place was empty that cry rang through the house that loud and terrible voice maid and mother rushed into the room and they found no one there but orient fallen unconscious to the floor it did not take long to revive the child something has happened to reymund she said upon lifting her head we must go to him at once my love cried her mother the idea of the thing the but expostulations were wasted breath while they were being made orient was calmly getting on her travellinggown and seeing herself powerless the motherwith her heart palpitating in the ends of her fingers through awe and through alarm and interweaving with the ejaculations that escaped her chattering teeth a thousand instructions to her quaking maid and sisterhastened to do likewise and be off with her thus it happened that the telegram from reymunds brother crossed the travellers on their way and they reached his brothers house in the gray of the shivering morning it was just as orients heart had told her reymund had been thrown from his horse on the previous morning striking his head on a curbstones edge he had been taken up senseless and had lain since then in a stupor only broken by his twice calling her name in the afternoon at a little after five oclock he had risen on the pillow and in a loud and terrible voice had called orient again and then had fallen back and whether he were dead or alive there was no one able to say orient threw off her hat and shawl and stole into the apartment where reymund had been placed the white face that fastened her eye was still as a mask of clay and there was stamped upon it that look of unutterable melancholy into which she had seen the smile fade yesterdaythe linen where it lay was less white a marble image had been less still as orient bent there her breath stirred the dark lock of hair on the brow and the slight and airy motion of itself brought into forceful being all the awful immobility and silence of death he does not breathe his heart does not beat will he never open his eyes again she said o reymund reymund i love you she bent nearer as she sighed the words and her lips were sealed to his a quiver ran through all the frozen frame reposing there beside her a pulse of warmth perhaps played in the hand hers clasped the eyelids shook and lifted and unveiled the dark and woful eyes you have seen my soul orient said reymund good by the dark and woful eyes were veiled again and this time reymunds soul was gone beyond recall illustration text decoration illustration text decoration the fall of the house of usher by edgar allan poe son cur est un luth suspendu sitt quon le touche il rsonne de beranger during the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn of the year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens i had been passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract of country and at length found myself as the shades of the evening drew on within view of the melancholy house of usher i know not how it was but with the first glimpse of the building a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit i say insufferable for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that halfpleasurable because poetic sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible i looked upon the scene before meupon the mere house and the simple landscape features of the domainupon the bleak wallsupon the vacant eyelike windowsupon a few rank sedgesand upon a few white trunks of decayed treeswith an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the afterdream of the reveller upon opiumthe bitter lapse into everyday lifethe hideous dropping off of the veil there was an iciness a sinking a sickening of the heartan unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime what was iti paused to thinkwhat was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher it was a mystery all insoluble nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion that while beyond doubt there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth it was possible i reflected that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene of the details of the picture would be sufficient to modify or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression and acting upon this idea i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling and gazed downbut with a shudder even more thrilling than beforeupon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge and the ghastly treestems and the vacant and eyelike windows nevertheless in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks its proprietor roderick usher had been one of my boon companions in boyhood but many years had elapsed since our last meeting a letter however had lately reached me in a distant part of the countrya letter from himwhich in its wildly importunate nature had admitted of no other than a personal reply the manuscript gave evidence of nervous agitation the writer spoke of acute bodily illnessof a mental disorder which oppressed himand of an earnest desire to see me as his best and indeed his only personal friend with a view of attempting by the cheerfulness of my society some alleviation of his malady it was the manner in which all this and much more was saidit was the apparent heart that went with his requestwhich allowed me no room for hesitation and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons although as boys we had been even intimate associates yet i really knew little of my friend his reserve had been always excessive and habitual i was aware however that his very ancient family had been noted time out of mind for a peculiar sensibility of temperament displaying itself through long ages in many works of exalted art and manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties of musical science i had learned too the very remarkable fact that the stem of the usher race all timehonored as it was had put forth at no period any enduring branch in other words that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent and had always with very trifling and very temporary variation so lain it was this deficiency i considered while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one in the long lapse of centuries might have exercised upon the otherit was this deficiency perhaps of collateral issue and the consequent undeviating transmission from sire to son of the patrimony with the name which had at length so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the house of usheran appellation which seemed to include in the minds of the peasantry who used it both the family and the family mansion i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experimentthat of looking down within the tarnhad been to deepen the first singular impression there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstitionfor why should i not so term itserved mainly to accelerate the increase itself such i have long known is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis and it might have been for this reason only that when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself from its image in the pool there grew in my mind a strange fancya fancy so ridiculous indeed that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinityan atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven but which had reeked up from the decayed trees and the gray wall and the silent tarna pestilent and mystic vapor dull sluggish faintly discernible and leadenhued shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity the discoloration of ages had been great minute fungi overspread the whole exterior hanging in a fine tangled webwork from the eaves yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation no portion of the masonry had fallen and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the individual stones in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old woodwork which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault with no disturbance from the breath of the external air beyond this indication of extensive decay however the fabric gave little token of instability perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure which extending from the roof of the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn noticing these things i rode over a short causeway to the house a servant in waiting took my horse and i entered the gothic archway of the hall a valet of stealthy step thence conducted me in silence through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master much that i encountered on the way contributed i know not how to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already spoken while the objects around mewhile the carvings of the ceilings the sombre tapestries of the walls the ebon blackness of the floors and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode were but matters to which or to such as which i had been accustomed from my infancywhile i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this i still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up on one of the staircases i met the physician of the family his countenance i thought wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity he accosted me with trepidation and passed on the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty the windows were long narrow and pointed and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around the eye however struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling dark draperies hung upon the walls the general furniture was profuse comfortless antique and tattered many books and musical instruments lay scattered about but failed to give any vitality to the scene i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow an air of stern deep and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all upon my entrance usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it i at first thought of an overdone cordialityof the constrained effort of the ennuy man of the world a glance however at his countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity we sat down and for some moments while he spoke not i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity half of awe surely man had never before so terribly altered in so brief a period as had roderick usher it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable a cadaverousness of complexion an eye large liquid and luminous beyond comparison lips somewhat thin and very pallid but of a surpassingly beautiful curve a nose of a delicate hebrew model but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations a finely moulded chin speaking in its want of prominence of a want of moral energy hair of a more than weblike softness and tenuitythese features with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features and of the expression they were wont to convey lay so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke the now ghastly pallor of the skin and the now miraculous lustre of the eye above all things startled and even awed me the silken hair too had been suffered to grow all unheeded and as in its wild gossamer texture it floated rather than fell about the face i could not even with effort connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherencean inconsistency and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancyan excessive nervous agitation for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament his action was alternately vivacious and sullen his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance to that species of energetic concisionthat abrupt weighty unhurried and hollowsounding enunciationthat leaden selfbalanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance which may be observed in the lost drunkard or the irreclaimable eater of opium during the periods of his most intense excitement it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit of his earnest desire to see me and of the solace he expected me to afford him he entered at some length into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady it was he said a constitutional and a family evil and one for which he despaired to find a remedya mere nervous affection he immediately added which would undoubtedly soon pass off it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations some of these as he detailed them interested and bewildered me although perhaps the terms and the general manner of the narration had their weight he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses the most insipid food was alone endurable he could wear only garments of certain texture the odors of all flowers were oppressive his eyes were tortured by even a faint light and there were but peculiar sounds and these from stringed instruments which did not inspire him with horror to an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave i shall perish said he i must perish in this deplorable folly thus thus and not otherwise shall i be lost i dread the events of the future not in themselves but in their results i shudder at the thought of any even the most trivial incident which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul i have indeed no abhorrence of danger except in its absolute effectin terror in this unnerved in this pitiable condition i feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together in some struggle with the grim phantasm fear i learned moreover at intervals and through broken and equivocal hints another singular feature of his mental condition he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted and whence for many years he had never ventured forthin regard to an influence whose suposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be restatedan influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had by dint of long sufferance he said obtained over his spiritan effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down had at length brought about upon the morale of his existence he admitted however although with hesitation that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable originto the severe and longcontinued illnessindeed to the evidently approaching dissolutionof a tenderly beloved sisterhis sole companion for long yearshis last and only relative on earth her decease he said with a bitterness which i can never forget would leave him him the hopeless and the frail the last of the ancient race of the ushers while he spoke the lady madeline for so was she called passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment and without having noticed my presence disappeared i regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dreadand yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings a sensation of stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed her retreating steps when a door at length closed upon her my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother but he had buried his face in his hands and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears the disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians a settled apathy a gradual wasting away of the person and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character were the unusual diagnosis hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady and had not betaken herself finally to bed but on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house she succumbed as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation to the prostrating power of the destroyer and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should obtainthat the lady at least while living would be seen by me no more for several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either usher or myself and during this period i was busied in earnest endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend we painted and read together or i listened as if in a dream to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar and thus as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness as if an inherent positive quality poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher yet i should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies or of the occupations in which he involved me or led me the way an excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all his long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears among other things i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded and which grew touch by touch into vaguenesses at which i shuddered the more thrillingly because i shuddered knowing not whyfrom these paintings vivid as their images now are before me i would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words by the utter simplicity by the nakedness of his designs he arrested and overawed attention if ever mortal painted an idea that mortal was roderick usher for me at leastin the circumstances then surrounding mearose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas an intensity of intolerable awe no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of fuseli one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction may be shadowed forth although feebly in words a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel with low walls smooth white and without interruption or device certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent and no torch or other artificial source of light was discernible yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments it was perhaps the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar which gave birth in great measure to the fantastic character of his performances but the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for they must have been and were in the notes as well as in the words of his wild fantasias for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement the words of one of these rhapsodies i have easily remembered i was perhaps the more forcibly impressed with it as he gave it because in the under or mystic current of its meaning i fancied that i perceived and for the first time a full consciousness on the part of usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne the verses which were entitled the haunted palace ran very nearly if not accurately thus in the greenest of our valleys by good angels tenanted once a fair and stately palace palace radiant palacereared its head in the monarch thoughts dominion it stood there never seraph spread a pinion over fabric half so fair banners yellow glorious golden on its roof did float and flow thisall thiswas in the olden time long ago and every gentle air that dallied in that sweet day along the ramparts plumed and pallid a winged odor went away wanderers in that happy valley through two luminous windows saw spirits moving musically to a lutes welltund law round about a throne where sitting porphyrogene in state his glory well befitting the ruler of the realm was seen and all with pearl and ruby glowing was the fair palace door through which came flowing flowing flowing and sparkling evermore a troop of echoes whose sweet duty was but to sing in voices of surpassing beauty the wit and wisdom of their king but evil things in robes of sorrow assailed the monarchs high estate ah let us mourn for never morrow shall dawn upon him desolate and round about his home the glory that blushed and bloomed is but a dimremembered story of the old time entombed and travellers now within that valley through the redlitten windows see vast forms that move fantastically to a discordant melody while like a rapid ghastly river through the pale door a hideous throng rush out forever and laughbut smile no more i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein became manifest an opinion of ushers which i mention not so much on account of its novelty for other men have thought thus as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it this opinion in its general form was that of the sentience of all vegetable things but in his disordered fancy the idea had assumed a more daring character and trespassed under certain conditions upon the kingdom of inorganization i lack words to express the full extent or the earnest abandon of his persuasion the belief however was connected as i have previously hinted with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers the conditions of the sentience had been here he imagined fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stonesin the order of their arrangement as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them and of the decayed trees which stood aroundabove all in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn its evidencethe evidence of the sentiencewas to be seen he said and i here started as he spoke in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls the result was discoverable he added in that silent yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family and which made him what i now saw himwhat he was such opinions need no comment and i will make none our booksthe books which for years had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalidwere as might be supposed in strict keeping with this character of phantasm we pored together over such works as the ververt et chartreuse of gresset the belphegor of machiavelli the heaven and hell of swedenborg the subterranean voyage of nicholas klimm by holberg the chiromancy of robert flud of jean dindagin and of de la chambre the journey into the blue distance of tieck and the city of the sun of campanella one favorite volume was a small octavo edition of the directorium inquisitorium by the dominican eymeric de gironne and there were passages in pomponius mela about the old african satyrs and gipans over which usher would sit dreaming for hours his chief delight however was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothicthe manual of a forgotten churchthe vigili mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesi maguntin i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac when one evening having informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight previously to its final interment in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building the worldly reason however assigned for this singular proceeding was one which i did not feel at liberty to dispute the brother had been led to his resolution so he told me by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men and of the remote and exposed situation of the burialground of the family i will not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase on the day of my arrival at the house i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless and by no means an unnatural precaution at the request of usher i personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment the body having been encoffined we two alone bore it to its rest the vault in which we placed it and which had been so long unopened that our torches half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere gave us little opportunity for investigation was small damp and entirely without means of admission for light lying at great depth immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleepingapartment it had been used apparently in remote feudal times for the worst purposes of a donjonkeep and in later days as a place of deposit for powder or some other highly combustible substance as a portion of its floor and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it were carefully sheathed with copper the door of massive iron had been also similarly protected its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound as it moved upon its hinges having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin and looked upon the face of the tenant a striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention and usher divining perhaps my thoughts murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them our glances however rested not long upon the deadfor we could not regard her unawed the disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth had left as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death we replaced and screwed down the lid and having secured the door of iron made our way with toil into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house and now some days of bitter grief having elapsed an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend his ordinary manner had vanished his ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried unequal and objectless step the pallor of his countenance had assumed if possible a more ghastly huebut the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out the once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more and a tremulous quaver as if of extreme terror habitually characterized his utterance there were times indeed when i thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage at times again i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours in an attitude of the profoundest attention as if listening to some imaginary sound it was no wonder that his condition terrified that it infected me i felt creeping upon me by slow yet certain degrees the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions it was especially upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline within the donjon that i experienced the full power of such feelings sleep came not near my couchwhile the hours waned and waned away i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me i endeavored to believe that much if not all of what i felt was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the roomof the dark and tattered draperies which tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed but my efforts were fruitless an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame and at length upon my very heart sat an incubus of utterly causeless alarm shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle i uplifted myself on the pillows and peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber hearkenedi know not why except that an instinctive spirit prompted meto certain low and indefinite sounds which came through the pauses of the storm at long intervals i knew not whence overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror unaccountable yet unendurable i threw on my clothes with haste for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment i had taken but few turns in this manner when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention i presently recognized it as that of usher in an instant afterward he rapped with a gentle touch at my door and entered bearing a lamp his countenance was as usual cadaverously wan but moreover there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyesan evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor his air appalled me but anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long endured and i even welcomed his presence as a relief and you have not seen it he said abruptly after having stared about him for some moments in silenceyou have not then seen itbut stay you shall thus speaking and having carefully shaded his lamp he hurried to one of the casements and threw it freely open to the storm the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet it was indeed a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind and the exceeding density of the clouds which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house did not prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other without passing away into the distance i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion you must not you shall not behold this said i shudderingly to usher as i led him with a gentle violence from the window to a seat these appearances which bewilder you are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn let us close this casement the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame here is one of your favorite romances i will read and you shall listen and so we will pass away this terrible night together the antique volume which i had taken up was the mad trist of sir launcelot canning but i had called it a favorite of ushers more in sad jest than in earnest for in truth there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend it was however the only book immediately at hand and i indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies even in the extremeness of the folly which i should read could i have judged indeed by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he hearkened or apparently hearkened to the words of the tale i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design i had arrived at that wellknown portion of the story where ethelred the hero of the trist having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit proceeds to make good an entrance by force here it will be remembered the words of the narrative run thus and ethelred who was by nature of a doughty heart and who was now mighty withal on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit who in sooth was of an obstinate and maliceful turn but feeling the rain upon his shoulders and fearing the rising of the tempest uplifted his mace outright and with blows made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand and now pulling therewith sturdily he so cracked and ripped and tore all asunder that the noise of the dry and hollowsounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest at the termination of this sentence i started and for a moment paused for it appeared to me although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived meit appeared to me that from some very remote portion of the mansion came indistinctly to my ears what might have been in its exact similarity of character the echo but a stifled and dull one certainly of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described it was beyond doubt the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention for amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm the sound in itself had nothing surely which should have interested or disturbed me i continued the story but the good champion ethelred now entering within the door was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit but in the stead thereof a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor and of a fiery tongue which sate in guard before a palace of gold with a floor of silver and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten who entereth herein a conqueror hath bin who slayeth the dragon the shield he shall win and ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head of the dragon which fell before him and gave up his pesty breath with a shriek so horrid and harsh and withal so piercing that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it the like whereof was never before heard here again i paused abruptly and now with a feeling of wild amazement for there could be no doubt whatever that in this instance i did actually hear although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say a low and apparently distant but harsh protracted and most unusual screaming or grating soundthe exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragons unnatural shriek as described by the romancer oppressed as i certainly was upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence by a thousand conflicting sensations in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting by any observation the sensitive nervousness of my companion i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question although assuredly a strange alteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his demeanor from a position fronting my own he had gradually brought round his chair so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber and thus i could but partially perceive his features although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly his head had dropped upon his breast yet i knew that he was not asleep from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile the motion of his body too was at variance with this idea for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway having rapidly taken notice of all this i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot which thus proceeded and now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon bethinking himself of the brazen shield and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it removed the carcass from out of the way before him and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall which in sooth tarried not for his full coming but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound no sooner had these syllables passed my lips thanas if a shield of brass had indeed at the moment fallen heavily upon a floor of silveri became aware of a distinct hollow metallic and clangorous yet apparently muffled reverberation completely unnerved i leaped to my feet but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed i rushed to the chair in which he sat his eyes were bent fixedly before him and throughout his whole countenance reigned a stony rigidity but as i placed my hand upon his shoulder there came a strong shudder over his whole person a sickly smile quivered about his lips and i saw that he spoke in a low hurried and gibbering murmur as if unconscious of my presence bending closely over him i at length drank in the hideous import of his words not hear ityes i hear it and have heard it longlonglongmany minutes many hours many days have i heard ityet i dared noto pity me miserable wretch that i ami dared noti dared not speak we have put her living in the tomb said i not that my senses were acute i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin i heard themmany many days agoyet i dared noti dared not speak and nowtonightethelredha hathe breaking of the hermits door and the deathcry of the dragon and the clangor of the shieldsay rather the rending of her coffin and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault o whither shall i fly will she not be here anon is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste have i not heard her footstep on the stair do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart madmanhere he sprang furiously to his feet and shrieked out his syllables as if in the effort he were giving up his soulmadman i tell you that she now stands without the door as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance had been found the potency of a spell the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed threw slowly back upon the instant their ponderous and ebony jaws it was the work of the rushing gust but then without those doors did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline of usher there was blood upon her white robes and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold then with a low moaning cry fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother and in her violent and now final deathagonies bore him to the floor a corpse and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated from that chamber and from that mansion i fled aghast the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway suddenly there shot along the path a wild light and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me the radiance was that of the full setting and bloodred moon which now shone vividly through that once barely discernible fissure of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building in a zigzag direction to the base while i gazed this fissure rapidly widenedthere came a fierce breath of the whirlwindthe entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sightmy brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunderthere was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand watersand the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the house of usher illustration text decoration illustration text decoration chops the dwarf by charles dickens at one period of its reverses the house to let fell into the hands of a showman he was found registered as its occupier on the parish books of the time when he rented the house and there was therefore no need of any clew to his name but he himself was less easy to be found for he had led a wandering life and settled people had lost sight of him and people who plumed themselves on being respectable were shy of admitting that they had ever known anything of him at last among the marsh lands near the rivers level that lie about deptford and the neighboring marketgardens a grizzled personage in velveteen with a face so cut up by varieties of weather that he looked as if he had been tattooed was found smoking a pipe at the door of a wooden house on wheels the wooden house was laid up in ordinary for the winter near the mouth of a muddy creek and everything near itthe foggy river the misty marshes and the steaming marketgardenssmoked in company with the grizzled man in the midst of the smoking party the funnelchimney of the wooden house on wheels was not remiss but took its pipe with the rest in a companionable manner on being asked if it were he who had once rented the house to let grizzled velveteen looked surprised and said yes then his name was magsman that was it toby magsmanwhich was lawfully christened robert but called in the line from an infant toby there was nothing agin toby magsman he believed if there was suspicion of such mention it there was no suspicion of such he might rest assured but some inquiries were making about that house and would he object to say why he left it not at all why should he he left it along of a dwarf along of a dwarf mr magsman repeated deliberately and emphatically along of a dwarf might it be compatible with mr magsmans inclination and convenience to enter as a favor into a few particulars mr magsman entered into the following particulars it was a long time ago to begin withafore lotteries and a deal more was done away with mr magsman was looking around for a good pitch and he see that house and he says to himself ill have you if you are to be had if moneyll get you ill have you the neighbors cut up rough and made complaints but mr magsman dont know what they all would have had it was a lovely thing first of all there was the canvas representin the pictur of the giant in spanish trunks and a ruff who was half the height of the house and was run up with a line and pulley to a pole of the roof so that his ed was coeval with the parapet then there was the canvas representin the pictur of the albina lady showin her white air to the army and navy in correct uniform then there was the canvas representin the pictur of the wild indian scalpin a member of some foreign nation then there was the canvas representin the pictur of a child of a british planter seized by two boaconstrictorsnot that we never had no child nor no constrictors neither similarly there was the canvas representin the pictur of the wild ass of the prairiesnot that we never had no wild asses nor wouldnt have had em as a gift last there was the canvas representin the pictur of the dwarf and like him too considerin with george the fourth in such a state of astonishment at him as his majesty couldnt with his utmost politeness and stoutness express the front of the house was so covered with canvases that there wasnt a spark of daylight ever visible on that side magsmans amusements fifteen foot long by two foot high ran over the front door and parlor winders the passage was a arbor of green baize and garden stuff a barrelorgan performed there unceasing and as to respectabilityif threepence aint respectable what is but the dwarf is the principal article at present and he was worth money he was wrote up as major tpschoffki of the imperial bulgraderian brigade nobody couldnt pronounce the name and it never was intended anybody should the public always turned it as a regular rule into chopski in the line he was called chops partly on that account and partly because his real name if he ever had any real name which was very dubious was stakes he was an uncommon small man he really was certainly not so small as he was made out to be but wheres your dwarf as is he was a most uncommon small man with a most uncommon large ed and what he had inside that ed nobody never knowed but himself even supposin himself to have ever took stock of it which it would have been a stiff job for him to do the kindest little man as never growedspirited but not proud when he travelled with the spotted baby though he knowed himself to be a natral dwarf and knowed the babys spots to be put onto him artificial he nursed that baby like a mother you never heard him give a ill name to a giant he did allow himself to break out into strong language respectin the fat lady from norfolk but that was an affair of the art and when a mans art has been trifled with by a lady and the preference giv to a indian he aint master of his actions he was always in love of course every human natral phenomenon is and he was always in love with a large woman i never knowed the dwarf as could be got to love a small one which helps to keep em the curiosities they are one singlar idea he had in that ed of his which must have meant something or it wouldnt have been there it was always his opinion that he was entitled to property he never put his name to anything he had been taught to write by a young man without any arms who got his living with his toes quite a writingmaster he was and taught scores in the line but chops would have starved to death afore hed gained a bit of bread by putting his hand to a paper this is the more curious to bear in mind because he had no property except his house and a sarser when i say his house i mean the box painted and got up outside like a regler sixroomer that he used to creep into with a diamond ring or quite as good to look at on his forefinger and ring a little bell out of what the public believed to be the drawingroom winder and when i say a sarser i mean a cheney sarser in which he made a collection for himself at the end of every entertainment his cue for that he took from me ladies and gentlemen the little man will now walk three times round the cairawan and retire behind the curtain when he said anything important in private life he mostly wound it up with this form of words and they was generally the last thing he said to me afore he went to bed he had what i consider a fine minda poetic mind his ideas respectin his property never come upon him so strong as when he sat upon a barrelorgan and had the handle turned arter the wibration had run through him a little time he would screech out toby i feel my property cominggrind away im counting my guineas by thousands tobygrind away toby i shall be a man of fortun i feel the mint a jingling in me toby and im swelling out into the bank of england such is the influence of music on the poetic mind not that he was partial to any other music but a barrelorgan on the contrairy he hated it he had a kind of everlasting grudge agin the public which is a thing you may notice in many phenomenons that get their living out of it what riled him most in the nater of his occupation was that it kep him out of society he was continiwally sayin toby my ambition is to go into society the curse of my position towards the public is that it keeps me hout of society this dont signify to a low beast of a indian he aint formed for society this dont signify to a spotted baby he aint formed for societyi am nobody never could make out what chops done with his money he had a good salary down on the drum every saturday as the day came round besides having the run of his teethand he was a woodpecker to eatbut all dwarfs are the sarser was a little income bringing him in so many halfpence that hed carry em for a week together tied up in a pockethandkercher and yet he never had money and it couldnt be the fat lady from norfolk as was once supposed because it stands to reason that when you have a animosity towards a indian which makes you grind your teeth at him to his face and which can hardly hold you from goosing him audible when hes going through his wardanceit stands to reason you wouldnt under them circumstances deprive yourself to support that indian in the lap of luxury most unexpected the mystery came out one day at egham races the public was shy of bein pulled in and chops was ringin his little bell out of his drawinroom winder and was snarlin to me over his shoulder as he kneeled down with his legs out at the back doorfor he couldnt be shoved into his house without kneeling down and the premises wouldnt accommodate his legswas snarlin heres a precious public for you why the devil dont they tumble up when a man in the crowd holds up a carrierpigeon and cries out if theres any person here as has got a ticket the lotterys just drawd and the number as has come up for the great prize is three seven fortytwo three seven fortytwo i was givin the man to the furies myself for calling of the publics attentionfor the public will turn away at any time to look at anything in preference to the thing showed em and if you doubt it get em together for any individual purpose on the face of the earth and send only two people in late and see if the whole company aint far more interested in taking particular notice of them two than youi say i wasnt best pleased with the man for callin out wasnt blessin him in my own mind when i see chopss little bell fly out of the winder at a old lady and he gets up and kicks his box over exposin the whole secret and he catches hold of the calves of my legs and he says to me carry me into the wan toby and throw a pail of water over me or im a dead man for im come into my property twelve thousand odd hundred pounds was chopss winnins he had bought a halfticket for the twentyfive thousand prize and it had come up the first use he made of his property was to offer to fight the wild indian for five hundred pound a side him with a poisoned darninneedle and the indian with a club but the indian being in want of backers to that amount it went no further arter he had been mad for a weekin a state of mind in short in which if i had let him sit on the organ for only two minutes i believe he would have bustbut we kept the organ from himmr chops come round and behaved liberal and beautiful to all he then sent for a young man he knowed as had a wery genteel appearance and was a bonnet at a gamingbooth most respectable brought up father havin been imminent in the liverystable line but unfortnate in a commercial crisis through paintin a old gray gingerbay and sellin him with a pedigree and mr chops said this to bonnet who said his name was normandy which it wasnt normandy im going into society will you go with me says normandy do i understand you mr chops to hintimate that the ole of the expenses of that move will be borne by yourself correct says mr chops and you shall have a princely allowance too the bonnet lifted mr chops upon a chair to shake hands with him and replied in poetry his eyes seemingly full of tears my boat is on the shore and my bark is on the sea and i do not ask for more but ill goalong with thee they went into society in a chaise and four grays with silk jackets they took lodgings in pall mall london and they blazed away in consequence of a note that was brought to bartlemy fair in the autumn of next year by a servant most wonderful got up in milkwhite cords and tops i cleaned myself and went to pall mall one evening appinted the gentlemen was at their wine arter dinner and mr chopss eyes was more fixed in that ed of his than i thought good for him there was three of em in company i mean and i knowed the third well when last met he had on a white roman shirt and a bishops mitre covered with leopardskin and played the clarionet all wrong in a band at a wildbeast show this gent took on not to know me and mr chops said gentlemen this is an old friend of former days and normandy looked at me through a eyeglass and said magsman glad to see ye which ill take my oath he wasnt mr chops to get him convenient to the table had his chair on a throne much of the form of george fourths in the canvas but he hardly appeared to me to be king there in any other pint of view for his two gentlemen ordered about like emperors they was all dressed like maydaygorgeousand as to wine they swam in all sorts i made the round of the bottles first separate to say i had done it and then tried two of em as halfandhalf then tother two altogether i passed a pleasant evenin but with a tendency to feel muddled until i considered it good manners to get up and say mr chops the best of friends must part i thank you for the wariety of foreign drains you have stood so ansome i looks towards you in red wine and i takes my leave mr chops replied if youll just hitch me out of this over your right arm magsman and carry me down stairs ill see you out i said i couldnt think of such a thing but he would have it so i lifted him off his throne he smelt strong of madeary and i couldnt help thinking as i carried him down that it was like carrying a large bottle full of wine with a rayther ugly stopper a good deal out of proportion when i set him on the doormat in the hall he kept me close to him by holding on to my coatcollar and he whispers i aint appy magsman whats on your mind mr chops they dont use me well they aint graceful to me they puts me on the mantelpiece when i wont have in more champagnewine and they locks me in the sideboard when i wont give up my property git rid of em mr chops i cant were in society together and what would society say come out of society says i i cant you dont know what youre talking about when you have once got into society you mustnt come out of it then if youll excuse the freedom mr chops was my remark shaking my ed grave i think its a pity you ever went in mr chops shook that deep ed of his to a surprisin extent and slapped it half a dozen times with his hand and with more wice than i thought were in him then he says youre a good feller but you dont understand good night go long magsman the little man will now walk three times around the cairawan and retire behind the curtain the last i see of him on that occasion was his tryin on the extremest werge of insensibility to climb up the stairs one by one with his hands and knees theyd have been much too steep for him if he had been sober but he wouldnt be helped it warnt long after that that i read in the newspaper of mr chopss being presented at court it was printed it will be recollectedand ive noticed in my life that it is sure to be printed that it will be recollected whenever it wontthat mr chops is the individual of small stature whose brilliant success in the last state lottery attracted so much attention well i said to myself such is life he has been and done it in earnest at last he has astonished george the fourth on account of which i had that canvas new painted him with a bag of money in his hand a presentin it to george the fourth and a lady in ostrich feathers fallin in love with him in a bagwig sword and buckles correct i took the house as is the subject of present inquiriesthough not the honor of being acquaintedand i run magsmans amusements in it thirteen monthssometimes one thing sometimes another sometimes nothin particular but always all the canvases outside one night when we had played the last company out which was a shy company through its raining heavens hard i was takin a pipe in the one pair back along with the young man with the toes which i had taken on for a month though he never drawedexcept on paper and i heard a kickin at the street door halloa i says to the young man whats up he rubs his eyebrows with his toes and he says i cant imagine mr magsmanwhich he never could imagine nothin and was monotonous company the noise not leavin off i laid down my pipe and i took up a candle and i went down and opened the door i looked out into the street but nothin could i see and nothin was i aware of until i turned round quick because some creeter run between my legs into the passage there was mr chops magsman he says take me on the hold terms and youve got me if its done say done i was all of a maze but i said done sir done to your done and double done says he have you got a bit of supper in the house bearin in mind them sparklin warieties of foreign drains as wed guzzled away at in pall mall i was ashamed to offer him cold sassages and ginandwater but he took em both and took em free havin a chair for his table and sittin down at it on a stool like hold timesi all of a maze all the while it was arter he had made a clean sweep of the sassages beef and to the best of my calculations two pounds and a quarter that the wisdom as was in that little man began to come out of him like perspiration magsman he says look upon meyou see afore you one as has both gone into society and come out o you are out of it mr chops how did you get out sir sold out says he you never saw the like of the wisdom as his ed expressed when he made use of them two words my friend magsman ill impart to you a discovery ive made its wallable its cost twelve thousand five hundred pound it may do you good in life the secret of this matter is that it aint so much that a person goes into society as that society goes into a person not exactly keeping up with his meanin i shook my ed put on a deep look and said youre right there mr chops magsman he says twitchin me by the leg society has gone into me to the tune of every penny of my property i felt that i went pale and though not naturally a bold speaker i couldnt hardly say wheres normandy boltedwith the plate said mr chops and tother onemeaning him as formerly wore the bishops mitre boltedwith the jewels said mr chops i sat down and looked at him and he stood up and looked at me magsman he says and he seemed to myself to get wiser as he got hoarser society taken in the lump is all dwarfs at the court of saint james they was all a doin my bisnessall a goin three times round the cairawan in the hold court suits and properties elsewhere they was most of em ringing their little bells out of makebelieves everywheres the sarser was a goin roundmagsman the sarser is the universal institution i perceived you understand that he was soured by his misfortuns and i felt for mr chops as to fat ladies says he giving his ed a tremendious one agin the wall theres lots of them in society and worse than the original hers was a outrage upon tastesimply a outrage upon tasteawakin contemptcarryin its own punishment in the form of a indian here he giv himself another tremendious one but theirs magsman theirs is mercenary outrages lay in cashmere shawls buy bracelets strew em and a lot of andsome fans and things about your rooms let it be known that you give away like water to all as come to admire and the fat ladies that dont exhibit for so much down upon the drum will come from all the pints of the compass to flock about you whatever you are theyll drill holes in your art magsman like a cullender and when youve no more left to give theyll laugh at you to your face and leave you to have your bones picked dry by wulturs like the dead wild ass of the prayries that you deserve to be here he giv himself the most tremendious one of all and dropped i thought he was gone his ed was so heavy and he knocked it so hard and he fell so stony and the sassagereal disturbance in him must have been so immense that i thought he was gone but he soon come round with care and he sat up on the floor and he said to me with wisdom comin out of his eyes if ever it come magsman the most material difference between the two states of existence through which your unappy friend has passedhe reached out his poor little hand and his tears dropped down on the mustache which it was a credit to him to have done his best to grow but it is not in mortals to command successthe difference is this when i was out of society i was paid light for being seen when i went into society i paid heavy for being seen i prefer the former even if i wasnt forced upon it give me out through the trumpet in the hold way tomorrow after that he slid into the line again as easy as if he had been iled all over but the organ was kep from him and no allusions was ever made when a company was in to his property he got wiser every day his views of society and the public was luminous bewilderin awful and his ed got bigger and bigger as his wisdom expanded it he took well and pulled em in most excellent for nine weeks at the expiration of that period when his ed was a sight he expressed one evening the last company havin been turned out and the doors shut a wish to have a little music mr chops i said i never dropped the mr with him the world might do it but not memr chops are you sure as you are in a state of mind and body to sit upon the organ his answer was this toby when next met with on the tramp i forgive her and the indian and i am it was with fear and tremblin that i began to turn the handle but he sat like a lamb it will be my belief to my dying day that i see his ed expand as he sat you may therefore judge how great his thoughts was he sat out all the changes and then he come off toby he says with a quiet smile the little man will now walk three times round the cairawan and then retire behind the curtain when we called him in the mornin we found he had gone into much better society than mine or pall malls i give mr chops as comfortable a funeral as lay in my power followed myself as chief and had the george the fourth canvas carried first in the form of a banner but the house was so dismal afterwards that i give it up and took to the wan again illustration text decoration illustration text decoration wakefield by nathaniel hawthorne in some old magazine or newspaper i recollect a story told as truth of a manlet us call him wakefieldwho absented himself for a long time from his wife the fact thus abstractedly stated is not very uncommon norwithout a proper distinction of circumstancesto be condemned either as naughty or nonsensical howbeit this though far from the most aggravated is perhaps the strangest instance on record of marital delinquency and moreover as remarkable a freak as may be found in the whole list of human oddities the wedded couple lived in london the man under pretence of going a journey took lodgings in the next street to his own house and there unheard of by his wife or friends and without the shadow of a reason for such selfbanishment dwelt upward of twenty years during that period he beheld his home every day and frequently the forlorn mrs wakefield and after so great a gap in his matrimonial felicitywhen his death was reckoned certain his estate settled his name dismissed from memory and his wife long long ago resigned to her autumnal widowhoodhe entered the door one evening quietly as from a days absence and became a loving spouse till death this outline is all that i remember but the incident though of the purest originality unexampled and probably never to be repeated is one i think which appeals to the generous sympathies of mankind we know each for himself that none of us would perpetrate such a folly yet feel as if some other might to my own contemplations at least it has often recurred always exciting wonder but with a sense that the story must be true and a conception of its heros character whenever any subject so forcibly affects the mind time is well spent in thinking of it if the reader choose let him do his own meditation or if he prefer to ramble with me through the twenty years of wakefields vagary i bid him welcome trusting that there will be a pervading spirit and a moral even should we fail to find them done up neatly and condensed into the final sentence thought has always its efficacy and every striking incident its moral what sort of man was wakefield we are free to shape out our own idea and call it by his name he was now in the meridian of life his matrimonial affections never violent were sobered into a calm habitual sentiment of all husbands he was likely to be the most constant because a certain sluggishness would keep his heart at rest wherever it might be placed he was intellectual but not actively so his mind occupied itself in long and lazy musings that tended to no purpose or had not vigor to attain it his thoughts were seldom so energetic as to seize hold of words imagination in the proper meaning of the term made no part of wakefields gifts with a cold but not depraved nor wandering heart and a mind never feverish with riotous thoughts nor perplexed with originality who could have anticipated that our friend would entitle himself to a foremost place among the doers of eccentric deeds had his acquaintances been asked who was the man in london the surest to perform nothing today which should be remembered on the morrow they would have thought of wakefield only the wife of his bosom might have hesitated she without having analyzed his character was partly aware of a quiet selfishness that had rusted into his inactive mindof a peculiar sort of vanity the most uneasy attribute about himof a disposition to craft which had seldom produced more positive effects than the keeping of petty secrets hardly worth revealingand lastly of what she called a little strangeness sometimes in the good man this latter quality is indefinable and perhaps nonexistent let us now imagine wakefield bidding adieu to his wife it is the dusk of an october evening his equipment is a drab greatcoat a hat covered with an oilcloth top boots an umbrella in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other he has informed mrs wakefield that he is to take the night coach into the country she would fain inquire the length of his journey its object and the probable time of his return but indulgent to his harmless love of mystery interrogates him only by a look he tells her not to expect him positively by the return coach nor to be alarmed should he tarry three or four days but at all events to look for him at supper on friday evening wakefield himself be it considered has no suspicion of what is before him he holds out his hand she gives her own and meets his parting kiss in the matterofcourse way of a ten years matrimony and forth goes the middleaged mr wakefield almost resolved to perplex his good lady by a whole weeks absence after the door has closed behind him she perceives it thrust partly open and a vision of her husbands face through the aperture smiling on her and gone in a moment for the time this little incident is dismissed without a thought but long afterward when she has been more years a widow than a wife that smile recurs and flickers across all her reminiscences of wakefields visage in her many musings she surrounds the original smile with a multitude of fantasies which make it strange and awful as for instance if she imagines him in a coffin that parting look is frozen on his pale features or if she dreams of him in heaven still his blessed spirit wears a quiet and crafty smile yet for its sake when all others have given him up for dead she sometimes doubts whether she is a widow but our business is with the husband we must hurry after him along the street ere he lose his individuality and melt into the great mass of london life it would be vain searching for him there let us follow close at his heels therefore until after several superfluous turns and doublings we find him comfortably established by the fireside of a small apartment previously bespoken he is in the next street to his own and at his journeys end he can scarcely trust his good fortune in having got thither unperceivedrecollecting that at one time he was delayed by the throng in the very focus of a lighted lantern and again there were footsteps that seemed to tread behind his own distinct from the multitudinous tramp around him and anon he heard a voice shouting afar and fancied that it called his name doubtless a dozen busybodies had been watching him and told his wife the whole affair poor wakefield little knowest thou thine own insignificance in this great world no mortal eye but mine has traced thee go quietly to thy bed foolish man and on the morrow if thou wilt be wise get thee home to good mrs wakefield and tell her the truth remove not thyself even for a little week from thy place in her chaste bosom were she for a single moment to deem thee dead or lost or lastingly divided from her thou wouldst be woefully conscious of a change in thy true wife forever after it is perilous to make a chasm in human affections not that they gape so long and wide but so quickly close again almost repenting of his frolic or whatever it may be termed wakefield lies down betimes and starting from his first nap spreads forth his arms into the wide and solitary waste of the unaccustomed bed no thinks he gathering the bedclothes about him i will not sleep alone another night in the morning he rises earlier than usual and sets himself to consider what he really means to do such are his loose and rambling modes of thought that he has taken this very singular step with the consciousness of a purpose indeed but without being able to define it sufficiently for his own contemplation the vagueness of the project and the convulsive effort with which he plunges into the execution of it are equally characteristic of a feebleminded man wakefield sifts his ideas however as minutely as he may and finds himself curious to know the progress of matters at homehow his exemplary wife will endure her widowhood of a week and briefly how the little sphere of creatures and circumstances in which he was a central object will be affected by his removal a morbid vanity therefore lies nearest the bottom of the affair but how is he to attain his ends not certainly by keeping close in this comfortable lodging where though he slept and awoke in the next street to his home he is as effectually abroad as if the stagecoach had been whirling him away all night yet should he reappear the whole project is knocked in the head his poor brains being hopelessly puzzled with this dilemma he at length ventures out partly resolving to cross the head of the street and send one hasty glance toward his forsaken domicile habitfor he is a man of habitstakes him by the hand and guides him wholly unaware to his own door where just at the critical moment he is aroused by the scraping of his foot upon the step wakefield whither are you going at that instant his fate was turning on the pivot little dreaming of the doom to which his first backward step devotes him he hurries away breathless with agitation hitherto unfelt and hardly dares turn his head at the distant corner can it be that nobody caught sight of him will not the whole householdthe decent mrs wakefield the smart maidservant and the dirty little footboyraise a hue and cry through london streets in pursuit of their fugitive lord and master wonderful escape he gathers courage to pause and look homeward but is perplexed with a sense of change about the familiar edifice such as affects us all when after a separation of months or years we again see some hill or lake or work of art with which we were friends of old in ordinary cases this indescribable impression is caused by the comparison and contrast between our imperfect reminiscences and the reality in wakefield the magic of a single night has wrought a similar transformation because in that brief period a great moral change has been effected but this is a secret from himself before leaving the spot he catches a far and momentary glimpse of his wife passing athwart the front window with her face turned toward the head of the street the crafty nincompoop takes to his heels scared with the idea that among a thousand such atoms of mortality her eye must have detected him right glad is his heart though his brain be somewhat dizzy when he finds himself by the coal fire of his lodgings so much for the commencement of this long whimwham after the initial conception and the stirring up of the mans sluggish temperament to put it in practice the whole matter evolves itself in a natural train we may suppose him as the result of deep deliberation buying a new wig of reddish hair and selecting sundry garments in a fashion unlike his customary suit of brown from a jews oldclothes bag it is accomplished wakefield is another man the new system being now established a retrograde movement to the old would be almost as difficult as the step that placed him in his unparalleled position furthermore he is rendered obstinate by a sulkiness occasionally incident to his temper and brought on at present by the inadequate sensation which he conceives to have been produced in the bosom of mrs wakefield he will not go back until she be frightened half to death well twice or thrice has she passed before his sight each time with a heavier step a paler cheek and a more anxious brow and in the third week of his nonappearance he detects a portent of evil entering the house in the guise of an apothecary next day the knocker is muffled toward nightfall comes the chariot of a physician and deposits its bigwigged and solemn burden at wakefields door whence after a quarter of an hours visit he emerges perchance the herald of a funeral dear woman will she die by this time wakefield is excited to something like energy of feeling but still lingers away from his wifes bedside pleading with his conscience that she must not be disturbed at such a juncture if aught else restrains him he does not know it in the course of a few weeks she gradually recovers the crisis is over her heart is sad perhaps but quiet and let him return soon or late it will never be feverish for him again such ideas glimmer through the mist of wakefields mind and render him indistinctly conscious that an almost impassable gulf divides his hired apartment from his former home it is but in the next street he sometimes says fool it is in another world hitherto he has put off his return from one particular day to another henceforward he leaves the precise time undetermined not tomorrowprobably next weekpretty soon poor man the dead have nearly as much chance of revisiting their earthly homes as the selfbanished wakefield would that i had a folio to write instead of an article of a dozen pages then might i exemplify how an influence beyond our control lays its strong hand on every deed which we do and weaves its consequences into an iron tissue of necessity wakefield is spellbound we must leave him for ten years or so to haunt around his house without once crossing the threshold and to be faithful to his wife with all the affection of which his heart is capable while he is slowly fading out of hers long since it must be remarked he has lost the perception of singularity in his conduct now for a scene amid the throng of a london street we distinguish a man now waxing elderly with few characteristics to attract careless observers yet bearing in his whole aspect the handwriting of no common fate for such as have the skill to read it he is meagre his low and narrow forehead is deeply wrinkled his eyes small and lustreless sometimes wander apprehensively about him but oftener seem to look inward he bends his head and moves with an indescribable obliquity of gait as if unwilling to display his full front to the world watch him long enough to see what we have described and you will allow that circumstances which often produce remarkable men from natures ordinary handiwork have produced one such here next leaving him to sidle along the footwalk cast your eyes in the opposite direction where a portly female considerably in the wane of life with a prayerbook in her hand is proceeding to yonder church she has the placid mien of settled widowhood her regrets have either died away or have become so essential to her heart that they would be poorly exchanged for joy just as the lean man and the wellconditioned woman are passing a slight obstruction occurs and brings these two figures directly in contact their hands touch the pressure of the crowd forces her bosom against his shoulder they stand face to face staring into each others eyes after a ten years separation thus wakefield meets his wife the throng eddies away and carries them asunder the sober widow resuming her former pace proceeds to church but pauses in the portal and throws a perplexed glance along the street she passes in however opening her prayerbook as she goes and the man with so wild a face that busy and selfish london stands to gaze after him he hurries to his lodgings bolts the door and throws himself upon the bed the latent feelings of years break out his feeble mind acquires a brief energy from their strength all the miserable strangeness of his life is revealed to him at a glance and he cries out passionately wakefield wakefield you are mad perhaps he was so the singularity of his situation must have so moulded him to himself that considered in regard to his fellowcreatures and the business of life he could not be said to possess his right mind he had contrived or rather he had happened to dissever himself from the worldto vanishto give up his place and privileges with living men without being admitted among the dead the life of a hermit is nowise parallel to his he was in the bustle of the city as of old but the crowd swept by and saw him not he was we may figuratively say always beside his wife and at his hearth yet must never feel the warmth of the one nor the affection of the other it was wakefields unprecedented fate to retain his original share of human sympathies and to be still involved in human interests while he had lost his reciprocal influence on them it would be a most curious speculation to trace out the effect of such circumstances on his heart and intellect separately and in unison yet changed as he was he would seldom be conscious of it but deem himself the same man as ever glimpses of the truth indeed would come but only for the moment and still he would keep saying i shall soon go backnor reflect that he had been saying so for twenty years i conceive also that these twenty years would appear in the retrospect scarcely longer than the week to which wakefield had at first limited his absence he would look on the affair as no more than an interlude in the main business of his life when after a little while more he should deem it time to reenter his parlor his wife would clap her hands for joy on beholding the middleaged mr wakefield alas what a mistake would time but await the close of our favorite follies we should be young men all of us and till doomsday one evening in the twentieth year since he vanished wakefield is taking his customary walk toward the dwelling which he still calls his own it is a gusty night of autumn with frequent showers that patter down upon the pavement and are gone before a man can put up his umbrella pausing near the house wakefield discerns through the parlor windows of the second floor the red glow and the glimmer and fitful flash of a comfortable fire on the ceiling appears a grotesque shadow of good mrs wakefield the cap the nose and chin and the broad waist form an admirable caricature which dances moreover with the upflickering and downsinking blaze almost too merrily for the shade of an elderly widow at this instant a shower chances to fall and is driven by the unmannerly gust full into wakefields face and bosom he is quite penetrated with its autumnal chill shall he stand wet and shivering here when his own hearth has a good fire to warm him and his own wife will run to fetch the gray coat and smallclothes which doubtless she has kept carefully in the closet of their bedchamber no wakefield is no such fool he ascends the stepsheavilyfor twenty years have stiffened his legs since he came downbut he knows it not stay wakefield would you go to the sole home that is left you then step into your grave the door opens as he passes in we have a parting glimpse of his visage and recognize the crafty smile which was the precursor of the little joke that he has ever since been playing off at his wifes expense how unmercifully has he quizzed the poor woman well a good nights rest to wakefield this happy eventsupposing it to be suchcould only have occurred at an unpremeditated moment we will not follow our friend across the threshold he has left us much food for thought a portion of which shall lend its wisdom to a moral and be shaped into a figure amid the seeming confusion of our mysterious world individuals are so nicely adjusted to a system and systems to one another and to a whole that by stepping aside for a moment a man exposes himself to a fearful risk of losing his place forever like wakefield he may become as it were the outcast of the universe illustration text decoration illustration text decoration murder considered as one of the fine arts by thomas de quincey we have all heard of a society for the promotion of vice of the hellfire club etc at brighton i think it was that a society was formed for the suppression of virtue that society was itself suppressed but i am sorry to say that another exists in london of a character still more atrocious in tendency it may be denominated a society for the encouragement of murder but according to their own delicate it is styled the society of connoisseurs in murder they profess to be curious in homicide amateurs and dilettanti in the various modes of bloodshed and in short murderfanciers every fresh atrocity of that class which the police annals of europe bring up they meet and criticise as they would a picture statue or other work of art but i need not trouble myself with any attempt to describe the spirit of their proceedings as you will collect that much better from one of the monthly lectures read before the society last year this has fallen into my hands accidentally in spite of all the vigilance exercised to keep their transactions from the public eye the publication of it will alarm them and my purpose is that it should for i would much rather put them down quietly by an appeal to public opinion than by such an exposure of names as would follow an appeal to bow street which last appeal however if this should fail i must positively resort to lecture gentlemeni have had the honor to be appointed by your committee to the trying task of reading the williams lecture on murder considered as one of the fine arts a task which might be easy enough three or four centuries ago when the art was little understood and few great models had been exhibited but in this age when masterpieces of excellence have been executed by professional men it must be evident that in the style of criticism applied to them the public will look for something of a corresponding improvement practice and theory must advance pari passu people begin to see that something more goes to the composition of a fine murder than two blockheads to kill and be killeda knifea purseand a dark lane design gentlemen grouping light and shade poetry sentiment are now deemed indispensable to attempts of this nature mr williams has exalted the ideal of murder to all of us and to me therefore in particular has deepened the arduousness of my task like schylus or milton in poetry like michael angelo in painting he has carried his art to a point of colossal sublimity and as mr wordsworth observes has in a manner created the taste by which he is to be enjoyed to sketch the history of the art and to examine its principles critically now remains as a duty for the connoisseur and for judges of quite another stamp from his majestys judges of assize before i begin let me say a word or two to certain prigs who affect to speak of our society as if it were in some degree immoral in its tendency immoral god bless my soul gentlemen what is it that people mean i am for morality and always shall be and for virtue and all that and i do affirm and always shall let what will come of it that murder is an improper line of conduct highly improper and i do not stick to assert that any man who deals in murder must have very incorrect ways of thinking and truly inaccurate principles and so far from aiding and abetting him by pointing out his victims hidingplace as a great moralista of germany declared it to be every good mans duty to do i would subscribe one shilling and sixpence to have him apprehended which is more by eighteenpence than the most eminent moralists have subscribed for that purpose but what then everything in this world has two handles murder for instance may be laid hold of by its moral handle as it generally is in the pulpit and at the old bailey and that i confess is its weak side or it may also be treated sthetically as the germans call it that is in relation to good taste to illustrate this i will urge the authority of three eminent persons namely s t coleridge aristotle and mr howship the surgeon to begin with s t c one night many years ago i was drinking tea with him in berners street which by the way for a short street has been uncommonly fruitful in men of genius others were there besides myself and amidst some carnal considerations of tea and toast we were all imbibing a dissertation on plotinus from the attic lips of s t c suddenly a cry arose of firefire upon which all of us master and disciples plato and rushed out eager for the spectacle the fire was in oxford street at a pianoforte makers and as it promised to be a conflagration of merit i was sorry that my engagements forced me away from mr coleridges party before matters were come to a crisis some days after meeting with my platonic host i reminded him of the case and begged to know how that very promising exhibition had terminated o sir said he it turned out so ill that we damned it unanimously now does any man suppose that mr coleridgewho for all he is too fat to be a person of active virtue is undoubtedly a worthy christianthat this good s t c i say was an incendiary or capable of wishing any ill to the poor man and his pianofortes many of them doubtless with the additional keys on the contrary i know him to be that sort of man that i durst stake my life upon it he would have worked an engine in a case of necessity although rather of the fattest for such fiery trials of his virtue but how stood the case virtue was in no request on the arrival of the fireengines morality had devolved wholly on the insurance office this being the case he had a right to gratify his taste he had left his tea was he to have nothing in return i contend that the most virtuous man under the premises stated was entitled to make a luxury of the fire and to hiss it as he would any other performance that raised expectations in the public mind which afterwards it disappointed again to cite another great authority what says the stagyrite he in the fifth book i think it is of his metaphysics describes what he calls ie a perfect thief and as to mr howship in a work of his on indigestion he makes no scruple to talk with admiration of a certain ulcer which he had seen and which he styles a beautiful ulcer now will any man pretend that abstractly considered a thief could appear to aristotle a perfect character or that mr howship could be enamored of an ulcer aristotle it is well known was himself so very moral a character that not content with writing his nichomachan ethics in one volume octavo he also wrote another system called magna moralia or big ethics now it is impossible that a man who composes any ethics at all big or little should admire a thief per se and as to mr howship it is well known that he makes war upon all ulcers and without suffering himself to be seduced by their charms endeavors to banish them from the county of middlesex but the truth is that however objectionable per se yet relatively to others of their class both a thief and an ulcer may have infinite degrees of merit they are both imperfections it is true but to be imperfect being their essence the very greatness of their imperfection becomes their perfection spartam nactus es hanc exorna a thief like autolycus or mr barrington and a grim phagednic ulcer superbly defined and running regularly through all its natural stages may no less justly be regarded as ideals after their kind than the most faultless mossrose amongst flowers in its progress from bud to bright consummate flower or amongst human flowers the most magnificent young female apparelled in the pomp of womanhood and thus not only the ideal of an inkstand may be imagined as mr coleridge demonstrated in his celebrated correspondence with mr blackwood in which by the way there is not so much because an inkstand is a laudable sort of thing and a valuable member of society but even imperfection itself may have its ideal or perfect state really gentlemen i beg pardon for so much philosophy at one time and now let me apply it when a murder is in the paulopostfuturum tense and a rumor of it comes to our ears by all means let us treat it morally but suppose it over and done and that you can say of it or in that adamantine molossus of medea suppose the poor murdered man to be out of his pain and the rascal that did it off like a shot nobody knows whither suppose lastly that we have done our best by putting out our legs to trip up the fellow in his flight but all to no purposeabiit evasit etcwhy then i say whats the use of any more virtue enough has been given to morality now comes the turn of taste and the fine arts a sad thing it was no doubt very sad but we cant mend it therefore let us make the best of a bad matter and as it is impossible to hammer anything out of it for moral purposes let us treat it sthetically and see if it will turn to account in that way such is the logic of a sensible man and what follows we dry up our tears and have the satisfaction perhaps to discover that a transaction which morally considered was shocking and without a leg to stand upon when tried by principles of taste turns out to be a very meritorious performance thus all the world is pleased the old proverb is justified that it is an ill wind which blows nobody good the amateur from looking bilious and sulky by too close an attention to virtue begins to pick up his crumbs and general hilarity prevails virtue has had her day and henceforward vertu and connoisseurship have leave to provide for themselves upon this principle gentlemen i propose to guide your studies from cain to mr thurtell through this great gallery of murder therefore together let us wander hand in hand in delighted admiration while i endeavor to point your attention to the objects of profitable criticism the first murder is familiar to you all as the inventor of murder and the father of the art cain must have been a man of firstrate genius all the cains were men of genius tubal cain invented tubes i think or some such thing but whatever were the originality and genius of the artist every art was then in its infancy and the works must be criticised with a recollection of that fact even tubals work would probably be little approved at this day in sheffield and therefore of cain cain senior i mean it is no disparagement to say that his performance was but so so milton however is supposed to have thought differently by his way of relating the case it should seem to have been rather a pet murder with him for he retouches it with an apparent anxiety for its picturesque effect whereat he inly raged and as they talkd smote him into the midriff with a stone that beat out life he fell and deadly pale groand out his soul with gushing blood effusd par lost b xi upon this richardson the painter who had an eye for effect remarks as follows in his notes on paradise lost p it has been thought says he that cain beat as the common saying is the breath out of his brothers body with a great stone milton gives in to this with the addition however of a large wound in this place it was a judicious addition for the rudeness of the weapon unless raised and enriched by a warm sanguinary coloring has too much of the naked air of the savage school as if the deed were perpetrated by a polypheme without science premeditation or anything but a mutton bone however i am chiefly pleased with the improvement as it implies that milton was an amateur as to shakespeare there never was a better as his description of the murdered duke of gloucester in henry vi of duncans banquos etc sufficiently proves the foundation of the art having been once laid it is pitiable to see how it slumbered without improvement for ages in fact i shall now be obliged to leap over all murders sacred and profane as utterly unworthy of notice until long after the christian era greece even in the age of pericles produced no murder of the slightest merit and rome had too little originality of genius in any of the arts to succeed where her model failed her in fact the latin language sinks under the very idea of murder the man was murderedhow will this sound in latin interfectus est interemptus estwhich simply expresses a homicide and hence the christian latinity of the middle ages was obliged to introduce a new word such as the feebleness of classic conceptions never ascended to murdratus est says the sublimer dialect of gothic ages meantime the jewish school of murder kept alive whatever was yet known in the art and gradually transferred it to the western world indeed the jewish school was always respectable even in the dark ages as the case of hugh of lincoln shows which was honored with the approbation of chaucer on occasion of another performance from the same school which he puts into the mouth of the lady abbess recurring however for one moment to classical antiquity i cannot but think that catiline clodius and some of that coterie would have made firstrate artists and it is on all accounts to be regretted that the priggism of cicero robbed his country of the only chance she had for distinction in this line as the subject of a murder no person could have answered better than himself lord how he would have howled with panic if he had heard cethegus under his bed it would have been truly diverting to have listened to him and satisfied i am gentlemen that he would have preferred the utile of creeping into a closet or even into a cloaca to the honestum of facing the bold artist to come now to the dark ages by which we that speak with precision mean par excellence the tenth century and the times immediately before and after these ages ought naturally to be favorable to the art of murder as they were to church architecture to stained glass etc and accordingly about the latter end of this period there arose a great character in our art i mean the old man of the mountains he was a shining light indeed and i need not tell you that the very word assassin is deduced from him so keen an amateur was he that on one occasion when his own life was attempted by a favorite assassin he was so much pleased with the talent shown that notwithstanding the failure of the artist he created him a duke upon the spot with remainder to the female line and settled a pension on him for three lives assassination is a branch of the art which demands a separate notice and i shall devote an entire lecture to it meantime i shall only observe how odd it is that this branch of the art has flourished by fits it never rains but it pours our own age can boast of some fine specimens and about two centuries ago there was a most brilliant constellation of murders in this class i need hardly say that i allude especially to those five splendid worksthe assassinations of william i of orange of henry iv of france of the duke of buckingham which you will find excellently described in the letters published by mr ellis of the british museum of gustavus adolphus and of wallenstein the king of swedens assassination by the by is doubted by many writers harte amongst others but they are wrong he was murdered and i consider his murder unique in its excellence for he was murdered at noonday and on the field of battlea feature of original conception which occurs in no other work of art that i remember indeed all of these assassinations may be studied with profit by the advanced connoisseur they are all of them exemplaria of which one may say nocturna versata manu versate diurne especially nocturna in these assassinations of princes and statesmen there is nothing to excite our wonder important changes often depend on their deaths and from the eminence on which they stand they are peculiarly exposed to the aim of every artist who happens to be possessed by the craving for scenical effect but there is another class of assassinations which has prevailed from an early period of the seventeenth century that really does surprise me i mean the assassination of philosophers for gentlemen it is a fact that every philosopher of eminence for the two last centuries has either been murdered or at the least been very near it insomuch that if a man calls himself a philosopher and never had his life attempted rest assured there is nothing in him and against lockes philosophy in particular i think it an unanswerable objection if we needed any that although he carried his throat about with him in this world for seventytwo years no man ever condescended to cut it as these cases of philosophers are not much known and are generally good and well composed in their circumstances i shall here read an excursus on that subject chiefly by way of showing my own learning the first great philosopher of the seventeenth century if we except galileo was des cartes and if ever one could say of a man that he was all but murderedmurdered within an inchone must say it of him the case was this as reported by baillet in his vie de m des cartes tom i pp in the year when des cartes might be about twentysix years old he was touring about as usual for he was as restless as a hyena and coming to the elbe either at gluckstadt or at hamburg he took shipping for east friezland what he could want in east friezland no man has ever discovered and perhaps he took this into consideration himself for on reaching embden he resolved to sail instantly for west friezland and being very impatient of delay he hired a bark with a few mariners to navigate it no sooner had he got out to sea than he made a pleasing discovery namely that he had shut himself up in a den of murderers his crew says m baillet he soon found out to be des sclratsnot amateurs gentlemen as we are but professional menthe height of whose ambition at that moment was to cut his throat but the story is too pleasing to be abridged i shall give it therefore accurately from the french of his biographer m des cartes had no company but that of his servant with whom he was conversing in french the sailors who took him for a foreign merchant rather than a cavalier concluded that he must have money about him accordingly they came to a resolution by no means advantageous to his purse there is this difference however between searobbers and the robbers in forests that the latter may without hazard spare the lives of their victims whereas the other cannot put a passenger on shore in such a case without running the risk of being apprehended the crew of m des cartes arranged their measures with a view to evade any danger of that sort they observed that he was a stranger from a distance without acquaintance in the country and that nobody would take any trouble to inquire about him in case he should never come to hand quand il viendroit manquer think gentlemen of these friezland dogs discussing a philosopher as if he were a puncheon of rum his temper they remarked was very mild and patient and judging from the gentleness of his deportment and the courtesy with which he treated themselves that he could be nothing more than some green young man they concluded that they should have all the easier task in disposing of his life they made no scruple to discuss the whole matter in his presence as not supposing that he understood any other language than that in which he conversed with his servant and the amount of their deliberation wasto murder him then to throw him into the sea and to divide his spoils excuse my laughing gentlemen but the fact is i always do laugh when i think of this casetwo things about it seem so droll one is the horrid panic or funk as the men of eton call it in which des cartes must have found himself upon hearing this regular drama sketched for his own deathfuneralsuccession and administration to his effects but another thing which seems to me still more funny about this affair is that if these friezland hounds had been game we should have no cartesian philosophy and how we could have done without that considering the world of books it has produced i leave to any respectable trunkmaker to declare however to go on spite of his enormous funk des cartes showed fight and by that means awed these anticartesian rascals finding says m baillet that the matter was no joke m des cartes leaped upon his feet in a trice assumed a stern countenance that these cravens had never looked for and addressing them in their own language threatened to run them through on the spot if they dared to offer him any insult certainly gentlemen this would have been an honor far above the merits of such inconsiderable rascalsto be spitted like larks upon a cartesian sword and therefore i am glad m des cartes did not rob the gallows by executing his threat especially as he could not possibly have brought his vessel to port after he had murdered his crew so that he must have continued to cruise forever in the zuyder zee and would probably have been mistaken by sailors for the flying dutchman homeward bound the spirit which m des cartes manifested says his biographer had the effect of magic on these wretches the suddenness of their consternation struck their minds with a confusion which blinded them to their advantage and they conveyed him to his destination as peaceably as he could desire possibly gentlemen you may fancy that on the model of csars address to his poor ferrymancsarem vehis et fortunas ejusm des cartes needed only to have said dogs you cannot cut my throat for you carry des cartes and his philosophy and might safely have defied them to do their worst a german emperor had the same notion when being cautioned to keep out of the way of a cannonading he replied tut man did you ever hear of a cannonball that killed an emperor as to an emperor i cannot say but a less thing has sufficed to smash a philosopher and the next great philosopher of europe undoubtedly was murdered this was spinosa i know very well the common opinion about him is that he died in his bed perhaps he did but he was murdered for all that and this i shall prove by a book published at brussels in the year entitled la vie de spinosa par m jean colerus with many additions from a manuscript life by one of his friends spinosa died on the st february being then little more than fortyfour years old this of itself looks suspicious and m jean admits that a certain expression in the manuscript life of him would warrant the conclusion que sa mort na pas t toutfait naturelle living in a damp country and a sailors country like holland he may be thought to have indulged a good deal in grog especially in punchb which was then newly discovered undoubtedly he might have done so but the fact is that he did not m jean calls him extrmement sobre en son boire et en son manger and though some wild stories were afloat about his using the juice of mandragora p and opium p yet neither of these articles appeared in his druggists bill living therefore with such sobriety how was it possible that he should die a natural death at fortyfour hear his biographers account sunday morning the st of february before it was church time spinosa came down stairs and conversed with the master and mistress of the house at this time therefore perhaps ten oclock on sunday morning you see that spinosa was alive and pretty well but it seems he had summoned from amsterdam a certain physician whom says the biographer i shall not otherwise point out to notice than by these two letters l m this l m had directed the people of the house to purchase an ancient cock and to have him boiled forthwith in order that spinosa might take some broth about noon which in fact he did and ate some of the old cock with a good appetite after the landlord and his wife had returned from church in the afternoon l m stayed alone with spinosa the people of the house having returned to church on coming out from which they learnt with much surprise that spinosa had died about three oclock in the presence of l m who took his departure for amsterdam the same evening by the night boat without paying the least attention to the deceased no doubt he was the readier to dispense with these duties as he had possessed himself of a ducatoon and a small quantity of silver together with a silverhafted knife and had absconded with his pillage here you see gentlemen the murder is plain and the manner of it it was l m who murdered spinosa for his money poor s was an invalid meagre and weak as no blood was observed l m no doubt threw him down and smothered him with pillowsthe poor man being already half suffocated by his infernal dinner but who was l m it surely never could be lindley murray for i saw him at york in and besides i do not think he would do such a thing at least not to a brother grammarian for you know gentlemen that spinosa wrote a very respectable hebrew grammar hobbes but why or on what principle i never could understand was not murdered this was a capital oversight of the professional men in the seventeenth century because in every light he was a fine subject for murder except indeed that he was lean and skinny for i can prove that he had money and what is very funny he had no right to make the least resistance for according to himself irresistible power creates the very highest species of right so that it is rebellion of the blackest dye to refuse to be murdered when a competent force appears to murder you however gentlemen though he was not murdered i am happy to assure you that by his own account he was three times very near being murdered the first time was in the spring of when he pretends to have circulated a little manuscript on the kings behalf against the parliament he never could produce this manuscript by the by but he says that had not his majesty dissolved the parliament in may it had brought him into danger of his life dissolving the parliament however was of no use for in november of the same year the long parliament assembled and hobbes a second time fearing he should be murdered ran away to france this looks like the madness of john dennis who thought that louis xiv would never make peace with queen anne unless he were given up to his vengeance and actually ran away from the seacoast in that belief in france hobbes managed to take care of his throat pretty well for ten years but at the end of that time by way of paying court to cromwell he published his leviathan the old coward now began to funk horribly for the third time he fancied the swords of the cavaliers were constantly at his throat recollecting how they had served the parliament ambassadors at the hague and madrid tum says he in his doglatin life of himself tum venit in mentem mihi dorislaus et ascham tanquam proscripto terror ubique aderat and accordingly he ran home to england now certainly it is very true that a man deserved a cudgelling for writing leviathan and two or three cudgellings for writing a pentameter ending so villanously as terror ubique aderat but no man ever thought him worthy of anything beyond cudgelling and in fact the whole story is a bounce of his own for in a most abusive letter which he wrote to a learned person meaning wallis the mathematician he gives quite another account of the matter and says p he ran home because he would not trust his safety with the french clergy insinuating that he was likely to be murdered for his religion which would have been a high joke indeedtoms being brought to the stake for religion bounce or not bounce however certain it is that hobbes to the end of his life feared that somebody would murder him this is proved by the story i am going to tell you it is not from a manuscript but as mr coleridge says it is as good as manuscript for it comes from a book now entirely forgotten namely the creed of mr hobbes examined in a conference between him and a student in divinity published about ten years before hobbess death the book is anonymous but it was written by tennison the same who about thirty years after succeeded tillotson as archbishop of canterbury the introductory anecdote is as follows a certain divine it seems no doubt tennison himself took an annual tour of one month to different parts of the island in one of these excursions he visited the peak in derbyshire partly in consequence of hobbess description of it being in that neighborhood he could not but pay a visit to buxton and at the very moment of his arrival he was fortunate enough to find a party of gentlemen dismounting at the inn door amongst whom was a long thin fellow who turned out to be no less a person than mr hobbes who probably had ridden over from chatsworth meeting so great a lion a tourist in search of the picturesque could do no less than present himself in the character of bore and luckily for this scheme two of mr hobbess companions were suddenly summoned away by express so that for the rest of his stay at buxton he had leviathan entirely to himself and had the honor of bowsing with him in the evening hobbes it seems at first showed a good deal of stiffness for he was shy of divines but this wore off and he became very sociable and funny and they agreed to go into the bath together how tennison could venture to gambol in the same water with leviathan i cannot explain but so it was they frolicked about like two dolphins though hobbes must have been as old as the hills and in those intervals wherein they abstained from swimming and plunging themselves i e diving they discoursed of many things relating to the baths of the ancients and the origine of springs when they had in this manner passed away an hour they stepped out of the bath and having dried and cloathed themselves they sate down in expectation of such a supper as the place afforded designing to refresh themselves like the deipnosophil and rather to reason than to drink profoundly but in this innocent intention they were interrupted by the disturbance arising from a little quarrel in which some of the ruder people in the house were for a short time engaged at this mr hobbes seemed much concerned though he was at some distance from the persons and why was he concerned gentlemen no doubt you fancy from some benign and disinterested love of peace and harmony worthy of an old man and a philosopher but listenfor a while he was not composed but related it once or twice as to himself with a low and careful tone how sextus roscius was murthered after supper by the balne palatin of such general extent is that remark of cicero in relation to epicurus the atheist of whom he observed that he of all men dreaded most those things which he contemneddeath and the gods merely because it was suppertime and in the neighborhood of a bath mr hobbes must have the fate of sextus roscius what logic was there in this unless to a man who was always dreaming of murder here was leviathan no longer afraid of the daggers of english cavaliers or french clergy but frightened from his propriety by a row in an alehouse between some honest clodhoppers of derbyshire whom his own gaunt scarecrow of a person that belonged to quite another century would have frightened out of their wits malebranche it will give you pleasure to hear was murdered the man who murdered him is well known it was bishop berkeley the story is familiar though hitherto not put in a proper light berkeley when a young man went to paris and called on pre malebranche he found him in his cell cooking cooks have ever been a genus irritabile authors still more so malebranche was both a dispute arose the old father warm already became warmer culinary and metaphysical irritations united to derange his liver he took to his bed and died such is the common version of the story so the whole ear of denmark is abused the fact is that the matter was hushed up out of consideration for berkeley who as pope remarked had every virtue under heaven else it was well known that berkeley feeling himself nettled by the waspishness of the old frenchman squared at him a turnup was the consequence malebranche was floored in the first round the conceit was wholly taken out of him and he would perhaps have given in but berkeleys blood was now up and he insisted on the old frenchmans retracting his doctrine of occasional causes the vanity of the man was too great for this and he fell a sacrifice to the impetuosity of irish youth combined with his own absurd obstinacy leibnitz being every way superior to malebranche one might a fortiori have counted on his being murdered which however was not the case i believe he was nettled at this neglect and felt himself insulted by the security in which he passed his days in no other way can i explain his conduct at the latter end of his life when he chose to grow very avaricious and to hoard up large sums of gold which he kept in his own house this was at vienna where he died and letters are still in existence describing the immeasurable anxiety which he entertained for his throat still his ambition for being attempted at least was so great that he would not forego the danger a late english pedagogue of birmingham manufacture namely dr parr took a more selfish course under the same circumstances he had amassed a considerable quantity of gold and silver plate which was for some time deposited in his bedroom at his parsonage house hatton but growing every day more afraid of being murdered which he knew that he could not stand and to which indeed he never had the slightest pretension he transferred the whole to the hatton blacksmith conceiving no doubt that the murder of a blacksmith would fall more lightly on the salus reipublic than that of a pedagogue but i have heard this greatly disputed and it seems now generally agreed that one good horseshoe is worth about two and one fourth spital sermons as leibnitz though not murdered may be said to have died partly of the fear that he should be murdered and partly of vexation that he was notkant on the other hand who had no ambition in that way had a narrower escape from a murderer than any man we read of except des cartes so absurdly does fortune throw about her favors the case is told i think in an anonymous life of this very great man for healths sake kant imposed upon himself at one time a walk of six miles every day along a highroad this fact becoming known to a man who had his private reasons for committing murder at the third milestone from konigsberg he waited for his intended who came up to time as duly as a mailcoach but for an accident kant was a dead man however on considerations of morality it happened that the murderer preferred a little child whom he saw playing in the road to the old transcendentalist this child he murdered and thus it happened that kant escaped such is the german account of the matter but my opinion is that the murderer was an amateur who felt how little would be gained to the cause of good taste by murdering an old arid and adust metaphysician there was no room for display as the man could not possibly look more like a mummy when dead than he had done alive thus gentlemen i have traced the connection between philosophy and our art until insensibly i find that i have wandered into our own era this i shall not take any pains to characterize apart from that which preceded it for in fact they have no distinct character the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries together with so much of the nineteenth as we have yet seen jointly compose the augustan age of murder the finest work of the seventeenth century is unquestionably the murder of sir edmondbury godfrey which has my entire approbation at the same time it must be observed that the quantity of murder was not great in this century at least amongst our own artists which perhaps is attributable to the want of enlightened patronage sint mcenates non deerunt flacce marones consulting grants observations on the bills of mortality th edition oxford i find that out of who died in london during one period of twenty years in the seventeenth century not more than eightysix were murdered that is about four and three tenths per annum a small number this gentlemen to found an academy upon and certainly where the quantity is so small we have a right to expect that the quality should be firstrate perhaps it was yet still i am of opinion that the best artist in this century was not equal to the best in that which followed for instance however praiseworthy the case of sir edmondbury godfrey may be and nobody can be more sensible of its merits than i am still i cannot consent to place it on a level with that of mrs ruscombe of bristol either as to originality of design or boldness and breadth of style this good ladys murder took place early in the reign of george iii a reign which was notoriously favorable to the arts generally she lived in college green with a single maidservant neither of them having any pretension to the notice of history but what they derived from the great artist whose workmanship i am recording one fine morning when all bristol was alive and in motion some suspicion arising the neighbors forced an entrance into the house and found mrs ruscombe murdered in her bedroom and the servant murdered on the stairs this was at noon and not more than two hours before both mistress and servant had been seen alive to the best of my remembrance this was in upwards of sixty years therefore have now elapsed and yet the artist is still undiscovered the suspicions of posterity have settled upon two pretendersa baker and a chimneysweeper but posterity is wrong no unpractised artist could have conceived so bold an idea as that of a noonday murder in the heart of a great city it was no obscure baker gentlemen or anonymous chimneysweeper be assured that executed this work i know who it was here there was a general buzz which at length broke out into open applause upon which the lecturer blushed and went on with much earnestness for heavens sake gentlemen do not mistake me it was not i that did it i have not the vanity to think myself equal to any such achievement be assured that you greatly overrate my poor talents mrs ruscombes affair was far beyond my slender abilities but i came to know who the artist was from a celebrated surgeon who assisted at his dissection this gentleman had a private museum in the way of his profession one corner of which was occupied by a cast from a man of remarkably fine proportions that said the surgeon is a cast from the celebrated lancashire highwayman who concealed his profession for some time from his neighbors by drawing woollen stockings over his horses legs and in that way muffling the clatter which he must else have made in riding up a flagged alley that led to his stable at the time of his execution for highway robbery i was studying under cruickshank and the mans figure was so uncommonly fine that no money or exertion was spared to get into possession of him with the least possible delay by the connivance of the undersheriff he was cut down within the legal time and instantly put into a chaise and four so that when he reached cruickshanks he was positively not dead mr a young student at that time had the honor of giving him the coup de grace and finishing the sentence of the law this remarkable anecdote which seemed to imply that all the gentlemen in the dissectingroom were amateurs of our class struck me a good deal and i was repeating it one day to a lancashire lady who thereupon informed me that she had herself lived in the neighborhood of that highwayman and well remembered two circumstances which combined in the opinion of all his neighbors to fix upon him the credit of mrs ruscombes affair one was the fact of his absence for a whole fortnight at the period of that murder the other that within a very little time after the neighborhood of this highwayman was deluged with dollars now mrs ruscombe was known to have hoarded about two thousand of that coin be the artist however who he might the affair remains a durable monument of his genius for such was the impression of awe and the sense of power left behind by the strength of conception manifested in this murder that no tenant as i was told in had been found up to that time for mrs ruscombes house but whilst i thus eulogize the ruscombian case let me not be supposed to overlook the many other specimens of extraordinary merit spread over the face of this century such cases indeed as that of miss bland or of captain donnellan and sir theophilus boughton shall never have any countenance from me fie on these dealers in poison say i can they not keep to the old honest way of cutting throats without introducing such abominable innovations from italy i consider all these poisoning cases compared with the legitimate style as no better than waxwork by the side of sculpture or a lithographic print by the side of a fine volpato but dismissing these there remain many excellent works of art in a pure style such as nobody need be ashamed to own as every candid connoisseur will admit candid observe i say for great allowances must be made in these cases no artist can ever be sure of carrying through his own fine preconception awkward disturbances will arise people will not submit to have their throats cut quietly they will run they will kick they will bite and whilst the portraitpainter often has to complain of too much torpor in his subject the artist in our line is generally embarrassed by too much animation at the same time however disagreeable to the artist this tendency in murder to excite and irritate the subject is certainly one of its advantages to the world in general which we ought not to overlook since it favors the development of latent talent jeremy taylor notices with admiration the extraordinary leaps which people will take under the influence of fear there was a striking instance of this in the recent case of the mkeands the boy cleared a height such as he will never clear again to his dying day talents also of the most brilliant description for thumping and indeed for all the gymnastic exercises have sometimes been developed by the panic which accompanies our artists talents else buried and hid under a bushel to the possessors as much as to their friends i remember an interesting illustration of this fact in a case which i learned in germany riding one day in the neighborhood of munich i overtook a distinguished amateur of our society whose name i shall conceal this gentleman informed me that finding himself wearied with the frigid pleasures so he called them of mere amateurship he had quitted england for the continentmeaning to practise a little professionally for this purpose he resorted to germany conceiving the police in that part of europe to be more heavy and drowsy than elsewhere his dbut as a practitioner took place at mannheim and knowing me to be a brother amateur he freely communicated the whole of his maiden adventure opposite to my lodging said he lived a baker he was somewhat of a miser and lived quite alone whether it were his great expanse of chalky face or what else i know not but the fact was i fancied him and resolved to commence business upon his throat which by the way he always carried barea fashion which is very irritating to my desires precisely at eight oclock in the evening i observed that he regularly shut up his windows one night i watched him when thus engagedbolted in after himlocked the doorand addressing him with great suavity acquainted him with the nature of my errand at the same time advising him to make no resistance which would be mutually unpleasant so saying i drew out my tools and was proceeding to operate but at this spectacle the baker who seemed to have been struck by catalepsy at my first announce awoke into tremendous agitation i will not be murdered he shrieked aloud what for will i lose my precious throat what for said i if for no other reason for thisthat you put alum into your bread but no matter alum or no alum for i was resolved to forestall any argument on that point know that i am a virtuoso in the art of murder am desirous of improving myself in its details and am enamored of your vast surface of throat to which i am determined to be a customer is it so said he but ill find you a customer in another line and so saying he threw himself into a boxing attitude the very idea of his boxing struck me as ludicrous it is true a london baker had distinguished himself in the ring and became known to fame under the title of the master of the rolls but he was young and unspoiled whereas this man was a monstrous featherbed in person fifty years old and totally out of condition spite of all this however and contending against me who am a master in the art he made so desperate a defence that many times i feared he might turn the tables upon me and that i an amateur might be murdered by a rascally baker what a situation minds of sensibility will sympathize with my anxiety how severe it was you may understand by this that for the first thirteen rounds the baker had the advantage round the fourteenth i received a blow on the right eye which closed it up in the end i believe this was my salvation for the anger it roused in me was so great that in this and every one of the three following rounds i floored the baker round th the baker came up piping and manifestly the worse for wear his geometrical exploits in the four last rounds had done him no good however he showed some skill in stopping a message which i was sending to his cadaverous mug in delivering which my foot slipped and i went down round th surveying the baker i became ashamed of having been so much bothered by a shapeless mass of dough and i went in fiercely and administered some severe punishment a rally took placeboth went downbaker undermostten to three on amateur round th the baker jumped up with surprising agility indeed he managed his pins capitally and fought wonderfully considering that he was drenched in perspiration but the shine was now taken out of him and his game was the mere effect of panic it was now clear that he could not last much longer in the course of this round we tried the weaving system in which i had greatly the advantage and hit him repeatedly on the conk my reason for this was that his conk was covered with carbuncles and i thought i should vex him by taking such liberties with his conk which in fact i did the three next rounds the master of the rolls staggered about like a cow on the ice seeing how matters stood in round twentyfourth i whispered something into his ear which sent him down like a shot it was nothing more than my private opinion of the value of his throat at an annuity office this little confidential whisker affected him greatly the very perspiration was frozen on his face and for the next two rounds i had it all my own way and when i called time for the twentyseventh round he lay like a log on the floor after which said i to the amateur it may be presumed that you accomplished your purpose you are right said he mildly i did and a great satisfaction you know it was to my mind for by this means i killed two birds with one stone meaning that he had both thumped the baker and murdered him now for the life of me i could not see that for on the contrary to my mind it appeared that he had taken two stones to kill one bird having been obliged to take the conceit out of him first with his fist and then with his tools but no matter for his logic the moral of his story was good for it showed what an astonishing stimulus to latent talent is contained in any reasonable prospect of being murdered a pursy unwieldy halfcataleptic baker of mannheim had absolutely fought sixandtwenty rounds with an accomplished english boxer merely upon this inspiration so greatly was natural genius exalted and sublimed by the genial presence of his murderer really gentlemen when one hears of such things as these it becomes a duty perhaps a little to soften that extreme asperity with which most men speak of murder to hear people talk you would suppose that all the disadvantages and inconveniences were on the side of being murdered and that there were none at all in not being murdered but considerate men think otherwise certainly says jeremy taylor it is a less temporal evil to fall by the rudeness of a sword than the violence of a fever and the axe to which he might have added the shipcarpenters mallet and the crowbar is a much less affliction than a strangury very true the bishop talks like a wise man and an amateur as he is and another great philosopher marcus aurelius was equally above the vulgar prejudices on this subject he declares it to be one of the noblest functions of reason to know whether it is time to walk out of the world or not book iii collerss translation no sort of knowledge being rarer than this surely that man must be a most philanthropic character who undertakes to instruct people in this branch of knowledge gratis and at no little hazard to himself all this however i throw out only in the way of speculation to future moralists declaring in the mean time my own private conviction that very few men commit murder upon philanthropic or patriotic principles and repeating what i have already said once at leastthat as to the majority of murderers they are very incorrect characters with respect to williamss murders the sublimest and most entire in their excellence that ever were committed i shall not allow myself to speak incidentally nothing less than an entire lecture or even an entire course of lectures would suffice to expound their merits but one curious fact connected with his case i shall mention because it seems to imply that the blaze of his genius absolutely dazzled the eye of criminal justice you all remember i doubt not that the instruments with which he executed his first great work the murder of the marrs were a shipcarpenters mallet and a knife now the mallet belonged to an old swede one john peterson and bore his initials this instrument williams left behind him in marrs house and it fell into the hands of the magistrates now gentlemen it is a fact that the publication of this circumstance of the initials led immediately to the apprehension of williams and if made earlier would have prevented his second great work the murder of the williamsons which took place precisely twelve days after but the magistrates kept back this fact from the public for the entire twelve days and until that second work was accomplished that finished they published it apparently feeling that williams had now done enough for his fame and that his glory was at length placed beyond the reach of accident as to mr thurtells case i know not what to say naturally i have every disposition to think highly of my predecessor in the chair of this society and i acknowledge that his lectures were unexceptionable but speaking ingenuously i do really think that his principal performance as an artist has been much overrated i admit that at first i was myself carried away by the general enthusiasm on the morning when the murder was made known in london there was the fullest meeting of amateurs that i have ever known since the days of williams old bedridden connoisseurs who had got into a peevish way of sneering and complaining that there was nothing doing now hobbled down to our clubroom such hilarity such benign expression of general satisfaction i have rarely witnessed on every side you saw people shaking hands congratulating each other and forming dinnerparties for the evening and nothing was to be heard but triumphant challenges of well will this do is this the right thing are you satisfied at last but in the midst of this i remember we all grew silent on hearing the old cynical amateur l s that laudator temporis acti stumping along with his wooden leg he entered the room with his usual scowl and as he advanced he continued to growl and stutter the whole way not an original idea in the whole piecemere plagiarismbase plagiarism from hints that i threw out besides his style is as hard as albert durer and as coarse as fuseli many thought that this was mere jealousy and general waspishness but i confess that when the first glow of enthusiasm had subsided i have found most judicious critics to agree that there was something falsetto in the style of thurtell the fact is he was a member of our society which naturally gave a friendly bias to our judgments and his person was universally familiar to the cockneys which gave him with the whole london public a temporary popularity that his pretensions are not capable of supporting for opinionum commenta delet dies natur judicia confirmat there was however an unfinished design of thurtells for the murder of a man with a pair of dumbbells which i admired greatly it was a mere outline that he never completed but to my mind it seemed every way superior to his chief work i remember that there was great regret expressed by some amateurs that this sketch should have been left in an unfinished state but there i cannot agree with them for the fragments and first bold outlines of original artists have often a felicity about them which is apt to vanish in the management of the details the case of the mkeands i consider far beyond the vaunted performance of thurtellindeed above all praise and bearing that relation in fact to the immortal works of williams which the neid bears to the iliad but it is now time that i should say a few words about the principles of murder not with a view to regulate your practice but your judgment as to old women and the mob of newspaper readers they are pleased with anything provided it is bloody enough but the mind of sensibility requires something more first then let us speak of the kind of person who is adapted to the purpose of the murderer secondly of the place where thirdly of the time when and other little circumstances as to the person i suppose it is evident that he ought to be a good man because if he were not he might himself by possibility be contemplating murder at the very time and such diamondcutdiamond tussles though pleasant enough where nothing better is stirring are really not what a critic can allow himself to call murders i could mention some people i name no names who have been murdered by other people in a dark lane and so far all seemed correct enough but on looking further into the matter the public have become aware that the murdered party was himself at the moment planning to rob his murderer at the least and possibly to murder him if he had been strong enough whenever that is the case or may be thought to be the case farewell to all the genuine effects of the art for the final purpose of murder considered as a fine art is precisely the same as that of tragedy in aristotles account of it namely to cleanse the heart by means of pity and terror now terror there may be but how can there be any pity for one tiger destroyed by another tiger it is also evident that the person selected ought not to be a public character for instance no judicious artist would have attempted to murder abraham newland for the case was this everybody read so much about abraham newland and so few people ever saw him that there was a fixed belief that he was an abstract idea and i remember that once when i happened to mention that i had dined at a coffeehouse in company with abraham newland everybody looked scornfully at me as though i had pretended to have played at billiards with prester john or to have had an affair of honor with the pope and by the way the pope would be a very improper person to murder for he has such a virtual ubiquity as the father of christendom and like the cuckoo is so often heard but never seen that i suspect most people regard him also as an abstract idea where indeed a public character is in the habit of giving dinners with every delicacy of the season the case is very different every person is satisfied that he is no abstract idea and therefore there can be no impropriety in murdering him only that his murder will fall into the class of assassinations which i have not yet treated thirdly the subject chosen ought to be in good health for it is absolutely barbarous to murder a sick person who is usually quite unable to bear it on this principle no cockney ought to be chosen who is above twentyfive for after that age he is sure to be dyspeptic or at least if a man will hunt in that warren he ought to murder a couple at one time if the cockneys chosen should be tailors he will of course think it his duty on the oldestablished equation to murder eighteen and here in this attention to the comfort of sick people you will observe the usual effect of a fine art to soften and refine the feelings the world in general gentlemen are very bloodyminded and all they want in a murder is a copious effusion of blood gaudy display in this point is enough for them but the enlightened connoisseur is more refined in his taste and from our art as from all the other liberal arts when thoroughly cultivated the result is to improve and to humanize the heart so true is it that ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes emollit mores nec sinit esse feros a philosophic friend well known for his philanthropy and general benignity suggests that the subject chosen ought also to have a family of young children wholly dependent on his exertions by way of deepening the pathos and undoubtedly this is a judicious caution yet i would not insist too keenly on this condition severe good taste unquestionably demands it but still where the man was otherwise unobjectionable in point of morals and health i would not look with too curious a jealousy to a restriction which might have the effect of narrowing the artists sphere so much for the person as to the time the place and the tools i have many things to say which at present i have no room for the good sense of the practitioner has usually directed him to night and privacy yet there have not been wanting cases where this rule was departed from with excellent effect in respect to time mrs ruscombes case is a beautiful exception which i have already noticed and in respect both to time and place there is a fine exception in the annals of edinburgh year familiar to every child in edinburgh but which has unaccountably been defrauded of its due portion of fame amongst english amateurs the case i mean is that of a porter to one of the banks who was murdered whilst carrying a bag of money in broad daylight on turning out of the high street one of the most public streets in europe and the murderer is to this hour undiscovered sed fugit interea fugit irreparabile tempus singula dum capti circumvectamur amore and now gentlemen in conclusion let me again solemnly disclaim all pretensions on my own part to the character of a professional man i never attempted any murder in my life except in the year upon the body of a tomcat and that turned out differently from my intention my purpose i own was downright murder semper ego auditor tantum said i nunquamne reponam and i went down stairs in search of tom at one oclock on a dark night with the animus and no doubt with the fiendish looks of a murderer but when i found him he was in the act of plundering the pantry of bread and other things now this gave a new turn to the affair for the time being one of general scarcity when even christians were reduced to the use of potatobread ricebread and all sorts of things it was downright treason in a tomcat to be wasting good wheatenbread in the way he was doing it instantly became a patriotic duty to put him to death and as i raised aloft and shook the glittering steel i fancied myself rising like brutus effulgent from a crowd of patriots and as i stabbed him i called aloud on tullys name and bade the father of his country hail since then what wandering thoughts i may have had of attempting the life of an ancient ewe of a superannuated hen and such small deer are locked up in the secrets of my own breast but for the higher departments of the art i confess myself to be utterly unfit my ambition does not rise so high no gentlemen in the words of horace fungar vice cotis acutum reddere qu ferrum valet exsors ipsa secandi illustration text decoration illustration text decoration the captains story by rebecca harding davis i have been asked to tell what i know of the case of joseph c wylie whose mysterious disappearance caused so much excitement in cincinnati when it occurred that was in however before the war and i had supposed all trace of the affair had been swept from the public mind by the events which followed indeed i see no reason for reviving it now except that it bears more fully than any evidence i have ever heard upon the curious matter called spiritualism and i have thought though i am only a plain man not used to dealing in such whimseys it offers a key to unlock the riddle wylie was a riverhand ran the ohio and lower mississippi as clerk and captain on several sternwheelers so came to be known pretty generally along shore he was with me as second clerk when the thing happened i was running the jacob strader one of the largest steamboats on the mississippi i took little account of the fellow he was a small redheaded weakeyed man shambling lazily about whose legs and arms seemed scarcely to have gristle enough in them to hold them firmly together the only noteworthy trait about him was that he never touched liquor or a card but found his amusement instead in sitting with some of the deck hands below telling long pointless yarns i had to stop it at last that runs contrary to my notions of discipline it was in april that he disappeared like a flea under my very eyes the strader lay at the wharf at cincinnati it was sunday about noon she was to get up steam at seven oclock next morning i walked up the levee and just off the cobblestones met wylie he had a drum of figs in his hand which he had just bought from some pedler on the david swan and was going to take home to his little joe in cairo he said as he walked alongside of me i met john fordyce and stopped to get a light of him wylie went into a shanty fitted up as a shop for the sale of cigars newspapers and the like he wanted a despatch he said the shop was but a single room opening front and back on the wide and at that hour on sunday morning empty wharf a square plankbuilt affair made to hold the two counters and a stove in the middle wylie went into it as i said but out of it he was never seen to come alive i stood talking with fordyce for some minutes then called the clerk and when he did not answer went in search of him but found only the boy who tended the shop asleep under the counter wylie was not there nor on the boat nor on the wharf he was nowhere so far as the sharpest eyes of the cincinnati police could discover the thing staggered me when i had time to take it home and realize that the man was actually gone spirited away in broad daylight before my face it was absurd impossible yet it struck me with a sort of horror that did not belong to midnight murder they called it murder in the papers there was a great outcry but where was the foul play the boy a child of ten had heard or seen nothing it was impossible that wylie could have been foully dealt with and no sound or cry reach fordyce or me half a dozen feet off it was just as impossible that he could have left the shop unseen by us on the wide open levee that he could have gone voluntarily nobody hinted the poor fellow had but few ideas beyond his wife and boy joe his trunk on board was found filled with cheap summer clothes for them both some tinware a japanned teatray a china mug trifles which he had gathered up at auctions and was taking to cairo to make their little home comfortable he had made an engagement to go out with the first clerk that afternoon his clean shirt collar and shaving apparatus were all laid out in his stateroom but that was the last of him it only remained to gather up these things and carry them with the news to his wife i shirked that i cannot face a woman in trouble i ordered stein who had been a sort of crony of his to do it stein was the steward and was leaving the boat he had a good berth offered to him in st louis he said so that i knew he had time to see wylies widow and break it gently to her if widow she was if wylie had died naturally i would have dismissed him from my mind but the matter rankled there as i might say from its very doubt and mystery about two years afterward therefore when warrick brought a little boy on board as the boat lay at cairo and told me it was wylies son i found myself going again and again to the part of the deck where the child was playing feeling pained to notice how coarsely dressed it was and how pinched even hungerbitten the little honest face is it going so badly with her i asked warrick nodded saying aloud joes shaken with the whoopingcough captain hes the deuce of a boy for sniffing up all the ailments that are going up and down the river joe looked up and laughed he had better shake them down into the river again then i said let him and his mother come aboard for a trip or two nothing like air off of water for that whoop the old women say i sent warrick to urge the plan on mrs wylie i knew it was not the air that was needed so much as good wholesome food warrick set apart the best stateroom for her and i dropped in myself to see that it was all in order in the evening before we started warrick brought her aboard and into the cabin where i was i found that she had some exaggerated notions about one or two good turns i had done her husband and a trifle which i had sent to her when he was lost so after that i held aloof from her i hate philandering i kept an eye though to see how she faredon the little body in her rusty black gown shying round with joe in the corners out of the way of the ladies who went sweeping their long dresses up and down i soon found however that all the men on board who had known wylie from warrick down vied with each other in treating her with a sort of patronizing respect even jake the black cook was continually sending up little messes for her and joe she was but a poor mouse of a woman who had made a god of that stupid little weakeyed fellow and of his boy after he was gone take her on politics or even gossip anything outside of wylie and her child and there was nothing in her warrick told me that she had never been outside of cairo before and the near village of blandville where she had been a sempstress before her marriage this journey was like a glimpse of a new world to her i used to see her sitting in a dark corner on deck until late in the night her eyes strained over the long stretch of shore as we floated by and i could understand how the heavy wooded hills crouching like sullen beasts along the waters edge or the miles and miles of yellow canebrake lying flat and barren in the desolate homesick twilight of a winters day might have a different meaning to the lonely woman and to us who counted them only as a run of so many hours she was sitting this way one evening on our back trip when the boat stopped to wood at a place called by the boatmen dead mans riffle warrick was near me watching her she wears black he said at last now for me cutting off a quid of tobacco i never believed joe wylie was dead no it was a bad bit of work dead or alivebad it is work i would give much to see cleared up before i die i said warrick and i were walking up and down the hurricanedeck would you he said slowly chewing and glancing up at mewould you theres a way but no matter stopping short and looking ashamed i said nothing i never urge a man to speak if he has ever so little mind to hold his tongue quiet but warrick had some notion that troubled him he walked nearer at each turn to the place where a stout short young woman was sitting dressed in brown linsey there was nothing remarkable about her face which was heavy and dull if we except a pair of thick dead fishy gray eyes do you see that girl he jerked out many of the men aboard would say that she could tell you anything you want to know the dead are about her all the time they say i dont say it captain mind im not such a fool i should hope not warrick i said gravely and began to talk of something else but somehow the matter stuck in my mind the next day we stopped for freight at natchez i went up into the city with one of the passengers old jimmy a it wasanybody on the western waters will know who i mean for strangers i will only say that a was one of the most thorough misers i ever knew he was an extensive stockbroker and speculator in western lands when his wife lived he had always consulted her and abode by her advice in his business i believe he mourned for the old woman sincerely though when she died he had taken the ribbon away with which the women had bound her chin and put twine instead to save a penny a was my companion as i said coming down into the old town a sudden idea struck me these lots are cheap mr a i said buy them and put up good dwellings on them and your fortune is made real estate is going up here daily the old man seized on the plan eagerly and held me by the coat while he went about the lots calculating muttering chuckling to himself its a good notion very good this swamp could be drainedit would bring in eleven per cent eleven and a halfand a half i wish i knew what ann would think of it poor ann ive a great mind to go into it i have indeed it was with difficulty i got the old fellow away and on board in time before the boat put off it was growing dusk as we stepped off the plank on deck a still clung to me following me up and down charging me to say nothing of the plan until he had well considered it as we went up to the outer cabin we met the woman to whom warrick had directed my notice the day before she was pacing up and down with heavy masculine steps she stood still as we came up her dead gray eyes fell on a and rested there with a curious absorbing look which perhaps i should not have seen but for warricks warning she remained quite quiet until we had passed and returned then stooping suddenly to a table before her wrote on a scrap of paper and handed it to the old man walking away after she had done so every motion lifeless mechanical like a clumsy machine of wood set in action a had not seen her i think until she thrust the paper into his hand he stared pulled at his ragged gray beard and then peered at it through his spectacles there was a queer scared little noise in his throat like the crow of a chicken why captain look here this isis holding out the dirty scrap of paper it was a message from his wife do not touch real estate except to mortgage she said the drainage of the swamp would eat up four years profits i thought of that he interrupted quickly do not withdraw your money from p c that is all i said who is this woman mr a god knows but no human being alive knew of that p c money ann did his face was colorless and his teeth chattered we went to the woman she was apparently stolid and but half educated i saw no sign of cunning even shrewdness about her the message had been given to her she said how she did not know from a spirit she could not say that she supposed so they called her a writing medium afterward she said this thing would ruin her crying in a feeble stupid way she had been an operative in some mill in cincinnati we were told and was discharged in consequence of it the manifestations were followed by attacks of something resembling paralysis which would soon leave her helpless i left the old man talking to her warrick came to me that evening he had heard of the affair captain he said im going to try if no tidings can be had from joe wylie have i your permission i nodded shortly warricks broad face was pale and anxious i sat for a while looking at the closed door of the little office into which they had gone then i got up and followed them the woman lusk was her name was there warrick and the wife of the carpentera shrewd sensible womanwho had been a friend of wylies as most women were she and the girl sat facing each other at a table on which flared a dirty oil lamp warrick leaned on the back of a chair with both hands watching the girls face she knows what shes got to do captain vigorously chewing and spitting but not lifting his eyes i told her to consult her familiar spirit or whatever it is lets have him up lets know whats become of joe good or bad i had seen warrick cool and grave when a burning boat was drifting with all aboard right into the rapids but now he was a coward in every bone of his body his very voice grew piping and boisterous as the woman turned her square heavy face toward him and the gray eyes which they said saw the dead fell on his for the girl i observed that she had the appearance of extreme nervous dejection her breath was uncertain and feeble her lips blue i touched her and found that the blood had almost ceased to circulate her temples were hot hands icy cold the pupils of the eyes contracted the look was fastened into warrick i can describe it in no other way i shook her but could not loosen the hold of it it was as if she drew the life out of his burly big body with her dull eyes bring up the spirit of wylie my woman he said with a loud uneasy laugh that suddenly died into profound silence she shook her head raised her forefinger slowly pointing into the shadow behind him what do you see i see a shipthreemasteda bark warrick started nodding his head with a muttered oath the sea is frozen the ship is wedged between masses of ice the sky is like a bronze plane above there is neither sun nor wind on a whaler burst in warrick i always knew it i was in just such a scrape offgo on go on there are two men on deck one is heavily built grayheaded the other is spare short with red hair there is a bloodmark on his chin wylie alive alive his clothes are gray he wore gray the day he left said warrick but come to think of it now he wouldnt i was wrong he wears a sailors dress she got up hastily putting her hand to her forehead her face was covered with a cold sweat nothingnothing i am sick stopno more she gasped mrs pallet the carpenters wife put her arm about her ill take her to her room captain looking at me theres no cheating in her at any rate as she led her out its my belief its the devils work warrick straightened himself and drew a long breath do you think it is the devils work sir god knows it is the truth whether or no wylie always had a hankering for a sea life he used to listen to my old whaling yarns twenty times over and ive heard lately captain that poor joe was deep in debt when he disappeared some old matters before he came aboard the strader he had a reason for going but ellen thinks him deadthinks him dead stroking his whiskers would you tell her of this now eh captain looking up yes i would after a pause it can do no harm but gently warrick gently it did do harm however gently it was told the next day wylies wife came to me where i stood alone near the texas her nose was red from crying and her eyes angry which made the rest of her face more hungernipped and pale she touched my sleeve and then drew off holding her little boy by the hand captain roberts she said in a low steady voice there is a woman on the boat who pretends to have seen my husband alive if he is alive he has deserted me he is dead be calm madam he is dead you shall not think ill of joe she was silent a moment holding her throat with one hand if he is alive he has deserted me andill tell you captain roberts but i never meant to tell any living man when you brought me and joe on the boat i hadnt touched meat for four months it took all i could make to keep life in the boy and barely that i went out scrubbing when sewing failed me i scrubbed and whitewashed i didnt beg do you think joe would have left me to that and him alive hes dead theres some days ive went throughif joe had been on the face of the earth hed have come to me them days hes dead hes waiting somewheres she held little joe tighter by the hand looking beyond megod knows whereinto the place where old joe waited for her i suppose the somewheres where the poor starved soul hoped to find the comfort and love of her married life again i hesitated would you like to see this woman i will not say that i credit her assertions but there is a curious she drew herself up growing pale i sir no i only wished that you should do my husband justice for the womanno matter i will not detain you captain roberts and so scarcely waiting for me to speak to the boy she drew him away with her that cut ellen hard warrick saidhard these women would rather a man should die any day than cease to care for them but its true joe wylie went on a whaler sir the girl lusk went ashore at new albany and i saw her no more she became afterward a noted medium i believe and old a by the way used to consult her in all of his undertakings or rather his wife through her the matter puzzled me i did not believe the spirits of the dead had anything to do with it though the woman before she went off the boat brought me a message from one who has been gone from me this many a year i will say no more of this since she died i have not named her name i did not believe the words came from her i did not believe the girl lusk was an impostor i thought as every impartial cool observer must that there was a somethingnot charlatanismin this matter and i think in the end i got the key to it but of that you must judge the matter puzzled and troubled me so much that i determined to try an experiment which perhaps was cruel i took ellen to a medium without warning her of my intention warrick told me of hershe has never showed herself in public he said she takes no pay that makes me trust her shes miserably poor too a huckster in the cincinnati market it was early dawn when i took ellen to her she occupied a corner of the market as a fruit and vegetable stall and as we came near was hanging nets of apples and oranges in front of it i remember a skinny sourvisaged middleaged woman dressed in a sluttish gown and calico sunbonnet i noticed the same peculiarity in the eye as in the girl lusk they were opaque gray dead the markethouse was nearly empty a few butchers were arranging their meat at some distance inside or swallowing their coffee at the eatingstalls by the light of a few candles this womans stall was out on the solitary street however and the pleasant morning light shone about it i made a pretence of buying some fruit this is the business for which i brought you ashore i said to ellen it was impossible that the woman could have heard me yet she turned sharply eying ellen as she came forward it was for no oranges you come why didnt ye say what you come for if theres any dead belonging to ye ill bring ye word from them theres spirits all about me theres spirits at yer back theres spirits fillin the street whatll you have my young man to a boy who stopped eight and ten cents them is ellen drew back let us go let us go she said at that moment a series of soft doubleknocks as if made by two knuckles of a gloved hand sounded all about usunder the pavement on the roof on the stall theres yer changeive a message for you suddenly facing ellen theres a spirit here to speak to you he is dead then catching both hands together as if to support herself the woman took down a greasy card on which the alphabet was printed from a nail where it hung and ran her pencil lightly along it as the raps continued in swift soft succession she spelled out this message i think of you here of you and joe you will come to me wherehow was it done i cried the woman glanced at ellen who leaned against the edge of the block i was murdered drugged and murdered was the answer he is dead there is no chance any more that was all she said with a strange inconsistency forgetting her anger of the other day there is no chance no chance i heard her mutter as we went back to the boat hes gone now the blow was as hard as if it had struck her for the first time i told warrick the story without comment it goes dead against the other he exclaimed and yet where did either woman get their knowledge of the business we wanted cleared the bloodmark on the chin the possibility that the dead man had been drugged and murdered theres truth in it in all the muddle i said nothing but the matter had taken a hold on me which i could not shake off i determined to look through the absurdity and mystery of this socalled spiritualism until i had discovered the truth which warrick believed lay in it i could not divest myself either of an unaccountable impression that at last we were upon the track of the missing man i induced mrs wylie to remain on the boat during its next run for the boys sake who grew stronger and more rugged every day there was the making of a man in the little fellow he had a hearty straightforward look in his puny face that made a friend of everybody for the woman from the day when the message came to her from her husband dead she gave way in mind or body as if some sinew had been snapped which had held her up i fancied that unconsciously she had been keeping some vague hope alive which was gone now forever she crept out now to the hurricanedeck and sat all day where her look settled or her hands fell on her lap there they rested immovable as i knew her better i discovered why the men held her in such a pitying aspect she was a simplehearted credulous creature such as everybody feels bound and anxious to take care of when they are left drifting about the world so we made our way up to the headwaters of the ohio it was late in october i rememberwarm yellow sunshine by day and cold nights the fields nipped brown and red in the early frosts i used to think if anything could take the poor womans thoughts off the dead the cheerful sights and sounds along shore ought to do it the water was unusually clear and curdled and bubbled back from the edge of the boat all day filled with a frothed green light the hills on both sides kept rising back and back to the sky beyond mottled with purple and crimson and blackish greens we passed thousands of little islands shying out of the current which were mere beds of feathery moss and goldenrod then there were pretty new little villages and the busy larger towns and farms at long intervals and when these were passed we floated into the deep solitude again i noticed it the more because we were out of our usual run the strader plied then between louisville and new orleans but the woman saw nothing of it i think when we reached pittsburg and had discharged cargo i determined with warrick to make a final test of the matter f was then in the city just back from england the most successful medium next to home who ever left the states he was willing for a consideration to hold a private sance and bring us in contact with any of the dead he was hardly the person to whom one would think st peter would have lent his keys for ever so short a time an oily bloated sensualist with thick lips and thicker eyelids half closed over a dull sleepy eye he was dressed like an orleans blackleg gaudy with purple velvet waistcoat and flash jewelry but if there was any truth in spiritualism here was its interpreter i engaged him to come on board on saturday evening no one was to be present but warrick ellen and myself the boat was empty at the time with the exception of its regular crew below there was but little persuasion needed to induce ellen to consent he may bring me another message with a light flickering into her eyes joe will be glad to find the way it is people like ellen who are always sure converts of spiritualism it seems so natural to them that their dead should come back that they are blind to any absurd discrepancies in the manner on saturday morning on the wharf i met stein who had left the boat some two years before and remembering his old liking for joe told him what we were about to do stein was a hardheaded shrewd little yankee i was surprised therefore to see how discomposed and startled he appeared at the first mention of the affair he denounced f as a humbug with a great deal of heat and tried to persuade and chaff me out of it but finding he could not asked leave to come himself to the sance youre bitten captain he said it will be easy to persuade you that you see ghosts yourself you had better let me bring a little daylight with me i told warrick of my meeting with stein and he having nothing else to do sauntered off in the afternoon to bring him down i told ellen also who to my surprise reddened and grew pale when i named him he is a man whom i have no reason to like she said but it does not matter in the evening f came on board stopping in the outer cabin where we were soon joined by stein we waited an hour for warrick who did not return and then entered the saloon where ellen was seated i noticed that stein drew back muttering you did not tell me that woman was here and that no greeting passed between them the sance proceeded according to the usual formula we sat around a bare table on which were placed by stein and myself the names of those whom we wished to appear written on scraps of paper rolled up in pellets and laid in a small heap ellen wrote none he will come she said simply but few raps were heard f delivered the messages by writing his fat lumpy hand moving spasmodically over the sheets of paper from several of the names written on the pellets came communications vague and meaningless any one of which might have been exchanged for the other without loss of force f glanced shrewdly around from time to time fixing his strange introverted gaze oftenest on ellen and little joe who had crept in and stood looking him boldly in the face he turned to me one whom you desire to appear has not yet come so far the sance has failedfor you he said i nodded his face heightened in color as if the blood slowly rose to his head the veins swelled drops of sweat oozed out on his neck and forehead he peered sharply about the room as if out of the dark shadows he expected visible spirits to rise he is coming said ellen with a gasp stein became ghastly pale at the words and looked terrified over his shoulder recovering himself with a feeble laugh the table where we sat was under the chandelier two of the lamps of which barely sufficed to light that end of the cabin the remainder stretched long and narrow and black to the far upper deck the medium looking at stein as if he saw through him into this outer darkness sat motionless there was a long silence then he raised his hand made a slow beckoning movement into the shadow ellen and stein turned their pale faces breathlessly they are coming they are here he said they tell me all you would know the man you seek is not dead he was cheated deceived carried off to caraccas that another man might marry his wife as his voice rose stein rose with it stood facing him with a look of terror and ferocity like a wild animal whose lair has suddenly been uncovered sudden light flashed on me i sprang up ellen cowered with a cry but above all sounded fs sharp monotonous sentences he is not dead he has returned he ishere as stein with an oath pointed into the shadow where warrick appeared and leaped back as though the ghost of his victim confronted him it was no ghost a little redheaded weakeyed fellow had his arms about ellens neck holding her to his breast as if he had the strength of a lion warrick the medium and i exclaimed and swore choking for words but he was silent he only held her as close as if he had indeed come back from the grave to find her putting back her head now and then and looking at her with a wonderful love in his puny insignificant face ellen ellen he said at last they told me you were deadyou and the boy this my joelittle joe picking up the boy handling his legs and arms and looking into his face his own contorted and wet with tears we men moved off down into the lower cabin leaving them alone but i saw joe a long time after still sitting there with his wife clinging to him and the boy on his knees and i could not help it i went in and held out my hand i congratulate you old fellow god has been good to you but he only looked up with a bewildered smile yes god has been good this is ellen captain and my little son my little son wylies story is soon told stein had persuaded him to give his creditors the slip and make for california promising to join him shortly and that they would speedily make their fortunes wylie was a man easily led and consented he was concealed under a trapdoor in the cigarshop and escaped while fordyce and i sought the police stein had intercepted his letters to his wife until such time as he could send him word of her death in his own plans upon her he was disappointed i am glad to say that joe brought back enough yellow dust to keep the wolf from the door for many a day he and his wife are living somewhere in indiana joe their son was a drummerboy in the thirtysixth ohio under captain saunders and ill venture to say no braver heart kept time to his rattattoo than that which beat under his own little jacket i consented to write down these facts as i said because of their bearing upon the matter of spiritualism in this case as in every other of which i have become cognizant the mediums have only put into shape the thoughts of those who question them to admit that certain persons can at will become possessed of the secret movements in the mind of another will solve the whole mystery in this case of wylie the mediums lusk the woman at cincinnati and finally f simply reproduced the surmises or knowledge of warrick ellen and stein it is not agreeable to think that an animal so gross as f should have power to decipher our inmost thoughts better that however than to believe that those we have lost should hold out their hands to us through such a messenger footnotes a kant who carried his demands of unconditional veracity to so extravagant a length as to affirm that if a man were to see an innocent person escape from a murderer it would be his duty on being questioned by the murderer to tell the truth and to point out the retreat of the innocent person under any certainty of causing murder lest this doctrine should be supposed to have escaped him in any heat of dispute on being taxed with it

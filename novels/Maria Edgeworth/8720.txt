and the online distributed proofreading team tales and novels volume ii of x popular tales by maria edgeworth preface some author says that a good book needs no apology and as a preface is usually an apology a book enters into the world with a better grace without one i however appeal to those readers who are not gluttons but epicures in literature whether they do not wish to see the bill of fare i appeal to monthly critics whether a preface that gives a view of the pretensions of the writer is not a good thing the author may overvalue his subject and very naturally may overrate the manner in which it is treated but still he will explain his views and facilitate the useful and necessary art which the french call reading with the thumb we call this hunting a book a term certainly invented by a sportsman i leave the reader to choose which he pleases whilst i lay before him the contents and design of these volumes burke supposes that there are eighty thousand readers in great britain nearly one hundredth part of its inhabitants out of these we may calculate that ten thousand are nobility clergy or gentlemen of the learned professions of seventy thousand readers which remain there are many who might be amused and instructed by books which were not professedly adapted to the classes that have been enumerated with this view the following volumes have been composed the title of popular tales has been chosen not as a presumptuous and premature claim to popularity but from the wish that they may be current beyond circles which are sometimes exclusively considered as polite the art of printing has opened to all classes of people various new channels of entertainment and informationamongst the ancients wisdom required austere manners and a length of beard to command attention but in our days instruction in the dress of innocent amusement is not denied admittance amongst the wise and good of all ranks it is therefore hoped that a succession of stories adapted to different ages sexes and situations in life will not be rejected by the public unless they offend against morality tire by their sameness or disgust by their imitation of other writers richard lovell edgeworth

contrast the grateful negro tomorrow lame jervas chapter i some years ago a lad of the name of william jervas or as he was called from his lameness lame jervas whose business it was to tend the horses in one of the cornwall tinmines was missing he was left one night in a little hut at one end of the mine where he always slept but in the morning he could no where be found and this his sudden disappearance gave rise to a number of strange and ridiculous stories among the miners the most rational however concluded that the lad tired of his situation had made his escape during the night it was certainly rather surprising that he could no where be traced but after the neighbours had wondered and talked for some time about it the circumstance was by degrees forgotten the name of william jervas was scarcely remembered by any except two or three of the oldest miners when twenty years afterward there came a party of gentlemen and ladies to see the mines and as the guide was showing the curiosities of the place one among the company a gentleman of about sixandthirty years of age pointed to some letters that were carved on the rock and asked whose name was written there only the name of one william jervas answered the guide a poor lad who ran away from the mines a great long while ago are you sure that he ran away said the gentleman yes answered the guide sure and certain i am of that not at all sure and certain of any such thing cried one of the oldest of the miners who interrupted the guide and then related all that he knew all that he had heard and all that he imagined and believed concerning the sudden disappearance of jervas concluding by positively assuring the stranger that the ghost of the said jervas was often seen to walk slowly in the long west gallery of the mine with a blue taper in his handi will take my bible oath added the man that about a month after he was missing i saw the ghost just as the clock struck twelve walking slowly with the light in one hand and a chain dragging after him in tother and he was coming straight towards me and i ran away into the stables to the horses and from that time forth ive taken special good care never to go late in the evening to that there gallery or near it for i never was so frightened above or under ground in all my born days the stranger upon hearing this story burst into a loud fit of laughter and on recovering himself he desired the ghostseer to look stedfastly in his face and to tell whether he bore any resemblance to the ghost that walked with the blue taper in the west gallery the miner stared for some minutes and answered no he that walks in the gallery is clear another guess sort of a person in a white jacket a leather apron and ragged cap like what jervas used to wear in his lifetime and moreover he limps in his gait as lame jervas always did i remember well the gentleman walked on and the miners observed what had before escaped their notice that he limped a little and when he came again to the light the guide after considering him very attentively said if i was not afraid of affronting the like of a gentleman such as your honour i should make bold for to say that you be very muchonly a deal darker complexionedyou be very much of the same sort of person as our lame jervas used for to be not at all like our lame jervas cried the old miner who professed to have seen the ghost no more like to him than black jack to blue john the bystanders laughed at this comparison and the guide provoked at being laughed at sturdily maintained that not a man that wore a head in cornwall should laugh him out of his senses each party now growing violent in support of his opinion from words they were just coming to blows when the stranger at once put an end to the dispute by declaring that he was the very man jervas exclaimed they all at once jervas aliveour lame jervas turned gentleman the miners could scarcely believe their eyes or their ears especially when upon following him out of the mine they saw him get into a handsome coach and drive toward the mansion of one of the principal gentlemen of the neighbourhood who was a proprietor of the mine the next day all the head miners were invited to dine in tents pitched in a field near this gentlemans house it was fine weather and harvest time the guests assembled and in the tents found abundance of good cheer provided for them after dinner mr r the master of the house appeared accompanied by lame jervas dressed in his miners old jacket and cap even the ghostseer acknowledged that he now looked wonderful like himself mr r the master of the house filled a glass and drankwelcome home to our friend mr jervas and may good faith always meet with good fortune the toast went round each drank and repeated welcome home to our friend mr jervas and may good faith always meet good fortune indeed what was meant by the good faith or the good fortune none could guess and many in whispers and some aloud made bold to ask for an explanation of the toast mr jervas on whom all eyes were fixed after thanking the company for their welcome home took his seat at the table and in compliance with mr rs request and the wishes of all present related to them his story nearly in the following manner where i was born or who were my parents i do not well know myself nor can i recollect who was my nurse or whether i was ever nursed at all but luckily these circumstances are not of much importance to the world the first thing which i can distinctly remember is the being set along with a number of children of my own age to pick and wash loose ore of tin mixed with the earth which in those days we used to call shoad or squadi dont know what you call it now we call it squad to this day master interrupted one of the miners i might be at this time i suppose continued the gentleman about five or six years old and from that time till i was thirteen i worked in the mine where we were yesterday from the bottom of my heart i rejoice that the times are bettered for youngsters since then for i know i had a hard life of it my good master here never knew any thing of the matter but i was cruelly used by those under him first the old womanbetty morgan i think was her namewho set us our tasks of picking and washing the squad was as cross as the rheumatism could make her she never picked an ounce herself but made us do her heap for her among us and i being the youngest it was shoved down to me often and often my days wages were kept back not having done this womans task and i did not dare to tell my master the truth lest she should beat me but god rest her soul she was an angel of light in comparison with the trapdoor keeper who was my next tyrant it was our business to open and shut certain doors that were placed in the mine for letting in air to the different galleries but my young tyrant left them every one to me to take care of and i was made to run to and fro till i had scarcely breath in my body while every miner in turn was swearing at me for the idlest little fellow upon the surface of the earth though the surface of the earth alas was a place on which i had never yet to my knowledge set my foot in my own defence i made all the excuses i could think of and from excuses i went on to all kinds of deceit for tyranny and injustice always produce cunning and falsehood one day having shut all the doors on my side of the mine i left three open on my companions side the men i thought would not go to work on that side of the mine for a day or two but in this i was mistaken and about noon i was alarmed by the report of a man having been killed in one of the galleries for want of fresh air the doorkeepers were summoned before the overseer or as you call him the viewer i was the youngest and the blame was all laid upon me the man who had only swooned recovered but i was thrashed and thrashed for the neglect of another person till the viewer was tired a weary life i led afterwards with my friend the doorkeeper who was enraged against me for having told the truth in process of time as i grew stronger and bigger i was set to other work first i was employed at the barrow and then a pickaxe and a gadfootnote a gad is a tool used in mines it resembles a smiths punch were put into my hands and i thought myself a great manit was my fate to fall among the idlest set in the mine i observed that those men who worked by task and who had the luck to hit upon easy beds of the rock were not obliged to work more than three or four hours a day they got high wages with little labour and they spent their money jollily aboveground in the alehouses as i heard i did not know that these jolly fellows often left their wives and families starving while they were getting drunk i longed for the time when i should be a man and do as i saw others do i longed for the days when i should be able to drink and be idle and in the mean time i set all my wits to work to baffle and overreach the viewer i was now about fourteen and had i grown up with these notions and habits i must have spent my life in wretchedness and i should probably have ended my days in a workhouse but fortunately for me an accident happened which made as great a change in my mind as in my body one of my companions bribed me with a strong dram to go down into a hole in the mine to search for his gad which he being half intoxicated had dropped my head could not stand the strength of the dram which he made me swallow to give me courage and being quite insensible to the danger i took a leap down a precipice which i should have shuddered to look at if i had not lost my recollection i soon came to my senses for i broke my leg and it is wonderful i did not break my neck by my fall i was drawn up by cords and was carried to a hut in the mine near the stables where i lay in great pain my master was in the mine at the time the accident happened and hearing where i was he had the goodness to come directly to me himself to let me know that he had sent for a surgeon the surgeon who lived in the neighbourhood was not at home but there was then upon a visit at my masters a mr y an old gentleman who had been a surgeon and though he had for many years left off practice he no sooner heard of the accident that had happened to me than he had the goodness to come down into the mine to set my leg after the operation was over my master returned to tell me that i should want for nothing never shall i forget the humanity with which he treated me i do not remember that i had ever heard him speak to me before this time but now his voice and manner were so full of compassion and kindness that i looked up to him as to a new sort of being his goodness wakened and warmed me to a sense of gratitudethe first virtuous emotion i was conscious of having ever felt i was attended with the greatest care during my illness by the benevolent surgeon mr y the circumstance of my having been intoxicated when i took the leap had been concealed by the man who gave me the dram who declared that i had fallen by accident as i was looking down the hole for a gad that i had dropped i did not join in this falsehood for the moment my master spoke to me with so much goodness about my mishap my heart opened to him and i told him just how the thing happened mr y also heard the truth from me and i had no reason to repent having told it for this gave him as he said hopes that i might turn out well and was the cause of his taking some pains to instruct me he observed to me that it was a pity a lad like me should so early in my days take to dramdrinking and he explained the consequences of intemperance of which i had never before heard or thought while i was confined to my bed i had leisure for many reflections the drunken and brutal among the miners with whom i formerly associated never came near me in my illness but the better sort used to come and see me often and i began to take a liking to their ways and to wish to imitate them as they stood talking over their own affairs in my hut i learned how they laid out their time and their money and i now began to desire to have as they had a little garden and property of my own for which i knew i must work hard so i rose from my bed with very different views from those which i had when i was laid down upon it and from this time forward i kept company with the sober and industrious as much as i could i saw things with different eyes formerly i used like my companions to be ready enough to take any advantage that lay in my way of my employer but my gratitude to him who had befriended me in my helpless state wrought such a change in me that i now took part with my master on all occasions and could not bear to see him wrongedso gratitude first made me honest my master would not let the viewer turn me out of the work as he wanted to do because i was lame and weak and not able to do muchlet him have the care of my horses in the stable said my master he can do something i dont want to make money of poor lame jervas so as long as he is willing to work he shall not be turned out to starvethese were his very words and when i heard them i said in my heart god bless him and from that time forth i could as i thought have fought with the stoutest man in the mine that said a word to his disparagement perhaps my feeling of attachment to him was the stronger because he was i may say the first person then in the world who had ever shown me any tenderness and the only one from whom i felt sure of meeting with justice about this time as i was busied in the stable unperceived by them i saw through a window a party of the miners amongst whom were several of my old associates at work opposite to me suddenly one of them gave a shoutthen all was hushedthey threw down their tools huddled together and i judged by the keenness of their looks that they knew they had made some valuable discovery i further observed that instead of beginning to work the vein they covered it up immediately with rubbish and defaced the country with their pickaxes so that to look at no one could have suspected there was any load to be found near i also saw them secrete a lump of spar in which they had reason to guess there were cornish diamonds as they call them and they carefully hid the bits of kellusfootnote kellus is the miners name for a substance like a white soft stone which lies above the floor or spar near to a vein which they had picked out lest the viewer should notice them and suspect the truth from all this the whispering that went on and the pains they took to chase or entice the overseer away from this spot i conjectured they meant to keep their discovery a secret that they might turn it to their own advantage there was a passage out of the mine known only to themselves as they thought through which they intended to convey all the newlyfound ore this passage i should observe led through an old gallery in the mine along the side of the mountain immediately up to the surface of the earth so that you could by this way come in and out of the mine without the assistance of the gin by which people and ore are usually let down or drawn up i made myself sure of my facts by searching this passage in which i found plenty of their purloined treasure i then went up to one of the party whose name was clarke and drawing him aside ventured to expostulate with him clarke cursed me for a spy and then knocked me down and returned to tell his associates what i had been saying and how he had served me they one and all swore that they would be revenged upon me if i gave the least hint of what i had seen to our master from this time they watched me whenever he came down amongst us lest i should have an opportunity of speaking to him and they never on any account would suffer me to go out of the mine under pretence that the horses must be looked after and that no one tended them so well as i did they contrived to keep me prisoner night and day hinting to me pretty plainly that if i ever again complained of being thus shut up i should not long be buried alive whether they would have gone the lengths they threatened i know not perhaps they threw out these hints only with a design to intimidate me and so to preserve their secret i confess i was alarmed but there was something in the thought of showing my good master how much i was attached to his interests that continually prevailed over my fears and my spirits rose with the reflection that i a poor insignificant lad i that was often the scoff and laughingstock of the miners i that went by the name of lame jervas i who they thought could be bullied to any thing by their threats might do a nobler action than any man amongst them would have the courage to do in my place then the kindness of my master and the words he said about me to the viewer came into my memory and i was so worked up that i resolved let the consequence be what it might i would living or dying be faithful to my benefactor i now waited anxiously for an opportunity to speak to him and if i did but hear the sound of his voice at a distance my heart beat violently you little know thought i that there is one here whom perhaps you quite forget who is ready to hazard his life to do you a service one day as he was coming near the place where i was at work rubbing down a horse he took notice that i fixed my eyes very earnestly upon him and he came closer to me saying i am glad to see you better jervasdo you want any thing i want for nothing thank you sirbutand as i said but i looked round to see who was near instantly clarke one of the gang who had his eyes upon us called me and despatched me on some errand to a distant part of the mine as i was coming back however it was my good fortune to meet my master by himself in one of the galleries i told him my secret and my fears he answered me only with a nod and these words thank youtrust to memake haste back to those that sent you i did so but i fancy there was something unusual in my manner or countenance which gave alarm for at the close of the day i saw clarke and the gang whispering together and i observed that they refrained from going to their secret treasure the whole of the day i was in great fear that they suspected me and that they would take immediate and perhaps bloody revenge these fears increased when i found myself left alone in my hut at night and as i lay quite still but broad awake in my bed i listened to every sound and once or twice started up on hearing some noise near me but it was only the horses moving in the stable which was close to my hut i lay down again laughing at my own fears and endeavoured to compose myself to sleep reflecting that i had never in my life more reason to sleep with a safe conscience i then turned round and fell into a sweet sound sleep but from this i was suddenly roused by a noise at the door of my hut it is only the horses again thought i but opening my eyes i saw a light under the door i rubbed my eyes hoping i had been in a dream the light disappeared and i thought it was my fancy as i kept my eyes however turned towards the door i saw the light again through the keyhole and the latch was pulled up the door was then softly pushed inwards and i saw on the wall the large shadow of a man with a pistol in his hand my heart sunk within me and i gave myself up for lost the man came in he was muffled up in a thick coat his hat was slouched and a lantern in his hand which of the gang it was i did not know but i took it for granted that it was one of them come with intent to murder me terror at this instant left me and starting upright in my bed i exclaimedim ready to die i die in a good cause give me five minutes to say my prayers and i fell upon my knees the man standing silent beside the bed with one hand upon me as if afraid i should escape from him when i had finished my short prayer i looked up towards my murderer expecting the stroke but what was my surprise and joy when as he held the lantern up to his face i beheldthe countenance of my master smiling upon me with the most encouraging benevolence awake jervas said he and try if you can find out the difference between a friend and an enemy put on your clothes as fast as you can and show me the way to this new vein no one ever was sooner dressed than i was i led the way to the spot which was covered up with rubbish so that i was some time clearing out an opening my master assisting me all the while for as he said he was impatient to get me out of the mine safe as he did not think my apprehensions wholly without foundation the light of our lantern was scarcely sufficient for our purpose but when we came to the vein my master saw enough to be certain that i was in the right we covered up the place as before and he noted the situation so that he could be sure to find it again then i showed him the way to the secret passage but this passage he knew already for by it he had descended into the mine this night as we passed along i pointed out the heaps of ore which lay ready to be carried off it is enough jervas said he clapping his hand upon my shoulder you have given me proof sufficient of your fidelity since you were so ready to die in a good cause and that cause mine it is my business to take care you shall live by it so follow me out of this place directly and i will take good care of you my honest lad i followed him with quick steps and a joyful heart he took me home with him to his own house where he said i might sleep for the rest of the night secure from all fear of murderers and so showing me into a small closet within his own bedchamber he wished me a good night desiring me if i waked early not to open the windowshutters of my room nor go to the window lest some of his people should see me i lay down for the first time in my life upon a featherbed but whether it was from the unusual feeling of the soft bed or from the hurry of mind in which i had been kept and the sudden change of my circumstances i could not sleep a wink all the remainder of the night before daybreak my master came into my room and bid me rise put on the clothes which he brought me and follow him without making any noise i followed him out of the house before any body else was awake and he took me across the fields towards the high road at this place we waited till we heard the tinkling of the bells of a team of horses here comes the waggon said he in which you are to go i have taken every possible precaution to prevent any of the miners or people in the neighbourhood from tracing you and you will be in safety at exeter with my friend mr y to whom i am going to send you take this continued he putting a letter directed to mr y into my hand and here are five guineas for you i shall desire mr y to pay you an annuity of ten guineas out of the profits of the new vein provided it turns out well and you do not turn out ill so fare you well jervas i shall hear how you go on and i only hope you will serve your next master whoever he may be as faithfully as you have served me i shall never find so good a master was all i could say for the soul of me for i was quite overcome by his goodness and by sorrow at parting with him as i then thought for ever chapter ii the morning clouds began to clear away i could see my master at some distance and i kept looking after him as the waggon went on slowly and as he walked fast away over the fields but when i had lost sight of him my thoughts were forcibly turned to other things i seemed to awake to quite a new scene and new feelings buried underground in a mine as i had been from my infancy the face of nature was totally unknown to me we shall have a brave fine day of it i hope and trust said the waggoner pointing with his long whip to the rising sun he went on whistling whilst i to whom the rising sun was a spectacle wholly surprising started up in astonishment i know not what exclamations i uttered as i gazed upon it but i remember the waggoner burst out into a loud laugh lud a marcy said he holding his sides to hear un and look at un a body would think the oaf had never seen the sun rise afore in all his born days upon this hint which was nearer the truth than he imagined recollecting that we were still in cornwall and not out of the reach of my enemies i drew myself back into the waggon lest any of the miners passing the road to their mornings work might chance to spy me out it was well for me that i took this precaution for we had not gone much farther when we met a party of the miners and as i sat wedged up in a corner behind a heap of parcels i heard the voice of clarke who asked the waggoner as he passed us what oclock it might be i kept myself quite snug till he was out of sight nay long afterwards i was content to sit within the waggon rather than venture out and i amused myself with listening to the bells of the team which jingled continually on our second days journey however i ventured out of my hidingplace i walked with the waggoner up and down the hills enjoying the fresh air the singing of the birds and the delightful smell of the honeysuckles and the dogroses in the hedges all these wild flowers and even the weeds on the banks by the wayside were to me matters of wonder and admiration at every step almost i paused to observe something that was new to me and i could not help feeling surprised at the insensibility of my fellowtraveller who plodded on seldom interrupting his whistling except to cry gee blackbird aw woa or how now smiler and certain other words or sounds of menace and encouragement addressed to his horses in a language which seemed intelligible to them and to him though utterly incomprehensible to me once as i was in admiration of a plant whose stem was about two feet high and which had a round shining pale purple beautiful flower the waggoner with a look of extreme scorn exclaimed help thee lad does not thee know tis a common thistle didst thee not know that a thistle would prick thee continued he laughing at the face i made when i touched the prickly leaves why my horse dobbin has more sense by half he is not like an ass hunting for thistles after this the waggoner seemed to look upon me as very nearly an idiot just as we were going into the town of plymouth he eyed me from head to foot and muttered the lads beside himself sure enough in truth i believe i was a droll figure for my hat was stuck full of weeds and of all sorts of wild flowers and both my coat and waistcoat pockets were stuffed out with pebbles and funguses such an effect however had the waggoners contemptuous look upon me that i pulled the weeds out of my hat and threw down all my treasure of pebbles before we entered the town nay so much was i overawed and in such dread was i of passing for an idiot that when we came within view of the sea in the fine harbour of plymouth i did not utter a single exclamation although i was struck prodigiously at this my first sight of the ocean as much almost as i had been at the spectacle of the rising sun i just ventured however to ask my companion some questions about the vessels which i beheld sailing on the sea and the shipping with which the bay was filled but he answered coldly they be nothing in life but the boats and ships man them that see them for the first time are often struck all on a heap as ive noticed in passing by here but ive seen it all a many and a many times so he turned away went on chewing a straw and seemed not a whit more moved with admiration than he had been at the sight of my thistle i conceived a high opinion of a man who had seen so much that he could admire nothing and he preserved and increased my respect for him by the profound silence which he maintained during the five succeeding days of our journey he seldom or never opened his lips except to inform me of the names of the towns through which we passed i have since reflected that it was fortunate for me that i had such a supercilious fellowtraveller on my first journey for he made me at once thoroughly sensible of my own ignorance and extremely anxious to supply my deficiencies and to find one who would give some other answer to my questions than a smile of contempt or i do na knaw i say we arrived at exeter at last and with much ado i found my way to mr ys house it was evening when i got there and the servant to whom i gave the letter said he supposed mr y would not see me that night as he liked to have his evenings to himself but he took the letter and in a few minutes returned desiring me to follow him up stairs i found the good old gentleman and some of his friends in his study with his grandchildren about him one little chap on his knee another climbing on the arm of his chair and two bigger lads were busy looking at a glass tube which he was showing them when i came in it does not become me to repeat the handsome things he said to me upon reading over my good masters letter but he was very gracious to me and told me that he would look out for some place or employment that would suit me and in the mean time that i should be welcome to stay in his house where i should meet with the good treatment which he was pleased to say i deserved then observing that i was overcome with bashfulness at being looked at by so many strangers he kindly dismissed me the next day he sent for me again to his study when he was alone and asked me several questions seeming pleased with the openness and simplicity of my answers he saw that i gazed with vast curiosity at several objects in the room which were new to me and pointing to the glass tube which he had been showing the boys when i first came in he asked me if they had such things as that in our mines and if i knew the use of it i told him i had seen something like it in our overseers hands but that i had never known its use it was a thermometer mr y took great pains to show me how and on what occasions this instrument might be useful i saw i had now to do with a person who was somewhat different from my friend the waggoner and i cannot express the surprise and gratitude i felt when i found that he did not think me quite a fool instead of looking at me with scorn as one very nearly an idiot he answered my questions with condescension and sometimes was so good as to add thats a sensible question my lad while we were looking at the thermometer he found out that i could not read the words temperate freezing point boiling water heat c which were written upon the ivory scale in small characters he took that occasion to point out to me the use and advantages of knowing how to read and write and he told me that as i wished to learn he would desire the writingmaster who came to attend his young grandson to teach me i shall not detain you with a journal of my progress through my spellingbook and copybooks it is enough to say that i applied with diligence and soon could write my name in rather more intelligible characters than those in which the name of jervas is cut on the rock that we were looking at yesterday my eagerness to read the books which he put into my hands and the attention which i paid to his lessons pleased my writingmaster so much that he took a pride as he said in bringing me forward as fast as possible and here i must confess he was rather imprudent in the warmth of his commendations my head could not stand them as much as i was humbled and mortified by the waggoners calling me an idiot so much was i elated by my writingmasters calling me a genius i wrote some very bad lines in praise of a thistle which i thought prodigiously fine because my writingmaster looked surprised when i showed them to him and because he told me that having given a copy of them to some gentlemen in exeter they agreed that the rhymes were wonderful for me i was at this period very nearly spoiled for life but fortunately my friend mr y saw my danger and cured me of my conceit without damping my ardour to acquire knowledge he took me to the books in his study and showed me many volumes of fine poems pointing out some passages to me that greatly diminished my admiration of my own lines on the thistle the vast distance which i perceived between myself and these writers threw me into despair mr y seeing me thoroughly abashed observed that he was glad to find i saw the difference between bad and good poetry and pointed out to me it was not likely if i turned my industry to writing verses that i should ever either earn my bread or equal those who had enjoyed greater advantages of leisure and education but jervas continued he i commend you for your application and quickness in learning to write and read in so short a time you will find both these qualifications of great advantage to you now i advise you turn your thoughts to something that may make you useful to other people you have your bread to earn and this you can only do by making yourself useful in some way or other look about you and you will see that i tell you truth you may perceive that the servants in my house are all useful to me and that i pay them for their services the cook who can dress my dinner the baker who bakes bread for me the smith who knows how to shoe my horses the writingmaster who undertakes to teach my children to write can all earn money for themselves and make themselves independentand you may remark that of all those i have mentioned the writingmaster is the most respected and the best paid there are some kinds of knowledge and some kinds of labour that are more highly paid for than others but i have said enough to you jervas for the present i do not want to lecture you but to serve youyou are a young lad and have had no experience i am an old man and have had a great deal so perhaps my advice may be of some use to you his advice was indeed of the greatest use to me every word he said sunk into my mind i wish those who give advice to young people especially to those in a lower station than themselves would follow this gentlemans example and instead of haranguing with the haughtiness of superior knowledge would speak with such kindness as to persuade at the same time that they convince the very day that mr y spoke to me in this manner he called me in that i might tell his eldest grandson the names which we miners give to certain fossils that had been sent him from cornwall and after observing to the boy that this knowledge would be useful to him he begged me to tell him exactly how the mine in which i had been employed was worked this i did as well as i was able and imperfect as my description was it entertained the boys so much that i determined to try to make a sort of model of the tinmine for their amusement but this i found no easy task my remembrance even of the place in which i had lived all my life was not sufficiently exact to serve me as to the length height breadth c of the different parts and though mr y had a good collection of fossils i was at a loss for want of materials to represent properly the different strata and veins or as we call it the country my temper naturally enthusiastic was not on this occasion to be daunted by any difficulties i was roused by the notion that i should be able to complete something that would be really useful to my kind benefactors family and i anticipated with rapture the moment when i should produce my model complete and justify mr ys opinion of my diligence and capacity i thought of nothing else from the moment these ideas came into my head the measures plans and specimens of earths and ore which were wanting i knew could only be obtained from the mine and such was my ardour to accomplish my little project that i determined at all hazards to return into cornwall and to ask my good masters permission to revisit the mine in the night time accordingly without a moments delay i set out upon this expedition part of the journey i performed on foot but wherever i could i got a set down because i was impatient to get near the lands end i concluded that the wonder excited by my sudden disappearance had subsided by this time that i was too insignificant to make it worth while to continue a search after me for more than a few days and that in all likelihood my master had dismissed from his work the gang who had been concerned in the plot and who were the only persons whose revenge i had reason to fear however as i drew near the mine i had the prudence not to expose myself unnecessarily and i watched my opportunity so well that i contrived to meet my master in his walk homeward when no one was with him i hastily gave him a letter from mr y as a certificate of my good conduct since my leaving him then explained the reason of my return and asked permission to examine the mines that night he expressed a good deal of surprise but no displeasure at my boldness in returning he willingly granted my request but at the same time warned me that some of my enemies were still in the neighbourhood and that though he had dismissed them from his works and though several had left the country in search of employment elsewhere yet he was informed that two or three of the gang and clarke among the number were seen lurking about the country that they had sworn vengeance against me for betraying them as they called it and had been indefatigably active in their search after me my master consequently advised me to stay only the ensuing night and to depart before daybreak he also cautioned me not to wake the man who now slept in my hut in the mine i did not like to spoil the only good suit of clothes of which i was possessed so before i went down into the mine i got from my master my old jacket apron and cap in which being equipped and furnished with a lantern and rod for measuring i descended into the mine i went to work as quietly as possible surveyed the place exactly and remembered what i had heard mr y observe that people can never make their knowledge useful if they have not been at the pains to make it exact i was determined to give him a proof of my exactness accordingly i measured and minuted down every thing with the most cautious accuracy and so intent was my mind upon my work the thoughts of clarke and his associates never came across me for a moment nay i absolutely forgot the man in the hut and am astonished he was not sooner waked what roused him at last was i believe the noise i made in loosening some earth and stones for specimens a great stone came tumbling down and immediately afterwards i heard one of the horses neigh which showed me i had waked them at least and i betook myself to a hidingplace in the western gallery where i kept quiet for i believe a quarter of an hour in order to give the horses and the man if he were awake time to go to sleep again i ventured out of my hidingplace too soon for just as i left my nook i saw the man at the end of the gallery instantly upon the sight of me he put both his hands before his face gave a loud shriek turned his back and took to his heels with the greatest precipitation i guessed that as he said yesterday he took me for the ghost of myself and that his terror made him mistake my lantern for a blue taper i had no chain but that i had a rod in my hand is most certain and it is also true that i took advantage of his fears to drive him out of my way for the moment he began to run i shook my rod as fast and as loud as i could against the tin top of my lantern and i trampled with my feet as if i was pursuing him as soon as the coast was clear i hastened back for my specimens which i packed up in my basket and then decamped as fast as i could this is the only time i ever walked in the western gallery with a blue taper in my hand dragging a chain after me whatever the ghostseer may report to the contrary i was heartily glad to get away and to have thus happily accomplished the object of my journey i carried my basket on my back for some miles till i got to the place where a waggon put up and in this i travelled safely back to exeter i determined not to show my model to mr y or the boys till it should be as complete as i could make it i got a good ingenious carpenter who had been in the habit of working for the toyshops to help me and laid out the best part of my worldly treasure upon this my grand first project i had new models made of the sieves for lueing the box and trough the buddle wreck and tool footnote the names of vessels and machines used in the cornish tinmines beside some dozen of wooden workmen wheelbarrows c with which the carpenter by my directions furnished my mine i paid a smith and tinman moreover for models of our stamps and blowinghouse and an iron grate for my box besides i had a lion rampant footnote a lion rampant is stamped on the block tin which is brought thence and other small matters from the pewterer also a pair of bellows finished by the glover for all which articles as they were out of the common way i was charged high it was some time even when all this was ready before we could contrive to make our puppets do their business properly but patience accomplishes every thing at last we got our wooden miners to obey us and to perform their several tasks at the word of command that is to say at the pulling of certain strings and wires which we fastened to their legs arms heads and shoulders which wires being slender and black were at a little distance invisible to the spectators when the skeletons were perfect we fell to work to dress and paint them and i never shall forget the delight with which i contemplated our whole company of puppets men women and children fresh painted and dizened out all in their proper colours the carpenter could scarcely prevent me from spoiling them i was so impatient to set them at work that i could not wait till their clothes were dry and i was every half hour rubbing my fingers upon their cheeks to try whether the red paint was yet hard enough with some pride i announced my intended exhibition to mr y and he appointed that evening for seeing it saying that none but his own boys should be present at the first representation it was for them alone it was originally designed but i was so charmed with my newlyfinished work that i would gladly have had all exeter present at the exhibition however before night i was convinced of my friend mr ys superior prudence the whole thing as the carpenter said went off pretty well but several disasters happened which i had not foreseen there was one stiff old fellow whose arms twitch them which way i would i could never get to bend and an obstinate old woman who would never do any thing else but curtsy when i wanted her to kneel down and to do her work my children sorted their heaps of rubbish and ore very dexterously excepting one unlucky little chap who from the beginning had his head somehow or other turned the wrong way upon his shoulders and i could never manage all the night to set it right again it was in vain i flattered myself that his wry neck would escape observation for as he was one of the wheelbarrow boys he was a conspicuous figure in the piece and whenever he appeared wheeling or emptying his barrow i to my mortification heard repeated peals of laughter from the spectators in which even my patron notwithstanding his goodnatured struggles against it for some time was at last compelled to join i all the while was wiping my forehead behind my showbox for i never was in such a bath of heat in my life not the hardest days work i ever wrought in the mine made me one half so hot as setting these puppets to work when my exhibition was over good mr y came to me and consoled me for all disasters by the praises he bestowed upon my patience and ingenuity he showed me that he knew the difficulties with which i had to contend and he mentioned the defects to me in the kindest manner and how they might be remedied i see said he smiling that you have endeavoured to make something useful for the entertainment of my boys and i will take pains to make it turn out advantageously to you the next morning i went to look at my showbox which mr y had desired me to leave in his study and i was surprised to see the front of the box which i had left open for the spectators filled up with boards and having a circular glass in the middle the eldest boy who stood by enjoying my surprise bid me look in and tell him what i saw what was my astonishment when i first looked through this glassas large as the lifeas large as the life cried i in admirationi see the puppets the wheelbarrows every thing as large as life mr y then told me that it was by his grandsons directions that this glass which he said was called a magnifyingglass or convexlens was added to my showbox he makes you a present of it and now added he smiling get all your little performers into order and prepare for a second representation i will send for a clockmaker in this town who is an ingenious man and will show you how to manage properly the motions of your puppets and then we will get a good painter to paint them for you there was at this time in exeter a society of literary gentlemen who met once a week at each others houses mr y was one of these and several of the principal families in exeter especially those who had children came on the appointed evening to see the model of the cornwall tinmine which with the assistance of the clockmaker and painter was now become really a show worth looking at i made but few blunders this time and the company were indulgent enough to pardon these and to express themselves well pleased with my little exhibition they gave me indeed solid marks of their satisfaction which were quite unexpected after the exhibition mr ys youngest grandchild in the name of the rest of the company presented me with a purse containing the contributions which had been made for me after repaying all my expenses for my journey and machinery i found i had six guineas and a crown to spare so i thought myself a rich man and having never seen so much money together in my life before as six golden guineas and a crown i should most probably like the generality of people who come into the possession of unexpected wealth have become extravagant had it not been for the timely advice of my kind monitor mr y when i showed him a pair of chinese tumblers which i had bought from a pedlar for twice as much as they were worth merely because they pleased my fancy he shook his head and observed that i might before my death want this very money to buy a loaf of bread if you spend your money as fast as you get it jervas said he no matter how ingenious or industrious you are you will always be poor remember the good proverb that says industry is fortunes right hand and frugality her left a proverb which has been worth ten times more to me than all my little purse contained so true it is that those do not always give most who give money chapter iii i had soon reason to rejoice at having thrown away no more money on baubles as i had occasion for my whole stock to fit myself out for a new way of life jervas said mr y to me i have at last found an occupation which i hope will suit youunknown to me he had been ever since he first saw my little model intent upon turning it to my lasting advantage among the gentlemen of the society which i have before mentioned there was one who had formed a design of sending some wellinformed lecturer through england to exhibit models of the machines used in manufactories mr y purposely invited this gentleman the evening that i exhibited my tinmine and proposed to him that i should be permitted to accompany his lecturer to this he agreed mr y told me that although the person who was fixed upon as lecturer was not exactly the sort of man he should have chosen yet as he was a relation of the gentleman who set the business on foot no objection could well be made to him i was rather daunted by the cold and haughty look with which my new master the lecturer received me when i was presented to him mr y observing this whispered to me at parting make yourself useful and you will soon be agreeable to him we must not expect to find friends ready made wherever we go in the world we often have to make friends for ourselves with great pains and care it cost me both pains and care i know to make this lecturer my friend he was what is called born a gentleman and he began by treating me as a lowborn upstart who being perfectly ignorant wanted to pass for a selftaught genius that i was lowborn i did not attempt to conceal nor did i perceive that i had any reason to be ashamed of my birth or of having raised myself by honest means to a station above that in which i was born i was proud of this circumstance and therefore it was no torment to me to hear the continual hints which my wellborn master threw out upon this subject i moreover never pretended to any knowledge which i had not so that by degrees notwithstanding his prejudices he began to feel that i had neither the presumption of an upstart nor of a selftaught genius i kept in mind the counsel given to me by mr y to endeavour to make myself useful to my employer but it was no easy matter to do this at first because he had such a dread of my awkwardness that he would never let me touch any of his apparatus i was always left to stand like a cipher beside him whilst he lectured and i had regularly the mortification of hearing him conclude his lecture with now gentlemen and ladies i will not detain you any longer from what i am sensible is much better worth your attention than any thing i can offermr jervass puppetshow it happened one day that he sent me with a shilling as he thought to pay a hostler for the feeding of his horse as i rubbed the money between my finger and thumb i perceived that the white surface came off and the piece looked yellow i recollected that my master had the day before been showing some experiments with quicksilver and gold and that he had covered a guinea with quicksilver so i immediately took the money back and my master for the first time in his life thanked me very cordially for this was in reality a guinea and not a shilling he was also surprised at my directly mentioning the experiment he had shown the next day that he lectured he omitted the offensive conclusion about mr jervass puppetshow i observed farther to my infinite satisfaction that after this affair of the guinea he was not so suspicious of my honesty as he used to appear to be he now yielded more to his natural indolence and suffered me to pack up his things for him and to do a hundred little services which formerly he used roughly to refuse at my hands saying i had rather do it myself sir or i dont like to have any body meddle with my things mr jervas but his tone changed and it was now jervas ill leave you to put up these things whilst i go and reador jervas will you see that i leave none of my goods behind me theres a good ladin truth he was rather apt to leave his goods behind him he was the most absent and forgetful man alive during the first half year we travelled together whilst he attempted to take care of his own things i counted that he lost two pair and a half of slippers one boot three nightcaps one shirt and fifteen pockethandkerchiefs many of these losses i make no doubt were set down in his imagination to my account whilst he had no opinion of my honesty but i am satisfied that he was afterwards thoroughly convinced of the injustice of his suspicions as from the time that i had the charge of his goods as he called them to the day we parted including a space of above four years and a half he never lost any thing but one red nightcap which to the best of my belief he sent in his wig one sunday morning to the barbers but which never came back again and an old ragged blue pockethandkerchief which he said he put under his pillow or into his boot when he went to bed at night he had an odd way of sticking his pockethandkerchief into his boot that he might be sure to find it in the morning i suspect the handkerchief was carried down in the boot when it was taken to be cleaned he was however perfectly certain that these two losses were not to be imputed to any carelessness of mine he often said he was obliged to me for the attention i paid to his interests he treated me now very civilly and would sometimes condescend to explain to me in private what i did not understand in his public lectures i was presently advanced to the dignity of his secretary he wrote a miserably bad hand and his manuscripts were so scratched and interlined that it was with the utmost difficulty he could decipher his own writing when he was obliged to have recourse to his notes in lecturing he was moreover extremely nearsighted and he had a strange trick of wrinkling up the skin on the bridge of his nose when he was perplexed altogether his look was so comical when he began to pore over these papers of his that few of the younger part of our audiences could resist their inclination to laugh this disconcerted him beyond measure and he was truly glad to accept my offer of copying out his scrawls fairly in a good bold round hand i could now write if i may say it without vanity an excellent hand and could go over his calculations as far as the first four rules of arithmetic were concerned so that i became quite his factotum and i thought myself rewarded for all my pains by having opportunities of gaining every day some fresh piece of knowledge from the perusal of the notes which i transcribed it was now that i felt most thoroughly the advantage of having learned to read and write stores of useful information were opened to me and my curiosity and desire to inform myself were insatiable i often sat up half the night reading and writing i had free access now to all my fellowtravellers books and i thought i could never study them enough at the commencement of my studies my master often praised my diligence and would show me where to look for what i wanted in his books or explain difficulties i looked up to him as a miracle of science and learning nay i was actually growing fond of him but this did not last long in process of time he grew shy of explaining things to me he scolded me for thumbing his books though god knows my thumbs were always cleaner than his own and he thwarted me continually upon some pretence or other i could not for some time conceive the cause of this change in my masters behaviour indeed it was hard for me to guess or believe that he was become jealous of the talents and knowledge of a poor lad whose ignorance he but a few years before had so much despised and derided i was the more surprised at this new turn of his mind because i was conscious that instead of becoming more conceited i had of late become more humble but this humility was by my suspicious master attributed to artifice and tended more than any thing to confirm him in his notion that i had formed a plan to supplant him in his office of lecturer a scheme which had never entered into my head i was thunderstruck when he one day said to me you need not study so hard mr jervas for i promise you that even with mr ys assistance and all your art you will not be able to supplant me clever as with all affected humility you think yourself the truth lightened upon me at once had he been a judge of the human countenance he must have seen my innocence in my looks but he was so fixed in his opinion that i knew any protestations i could make of my never having thought of the scheme he imputed to me would serve only to confirm him in his idea of my dissimulation i contented myself with returning to him his books and his manuscripts and thenceforward withdrew my attention from his lectures to which i had always till now been one of the most eager auditors by these proceedings i hoped to quiet his suspicions i no longer applied myself to any studies in which he was engaged to show him that all competition with him was far from my thoughts and i have since reflected that this fit of jealousy of his which i at the time looked upon as a misfortune because it stopped me short in pursuits which were highly agreeable to my taste was in fact of essential service to me my reading had been too general and i had endeavoured to master so many things that i was not likely to make myself thoroughly skilled in any as a blacksmith said once to me when he was asked why he was not both blacksmith and whitesmith the smith that will meddle with all things may go shoe the goslings an old proverb which from its mixture of drollery and good sense became ever after a favourite of mine having returned my masters books i had only such to read as i could purchase or borrow for myself and i became very careful in my choice i also took every opportunity of learning all i could from the conversation of sensible people wherever we went and i found that one piece of knowledge helped me to another often when i least expected it and this i may add for the encouragement of others that every thing which i learned accurately was at some time or other of my life of use to me after having made a progress through england my fellowtraveller determined to try his fortune in the metropolis and to give lectures there to young people during the winter season accordingly we proceeded towards london taking woolwich in our way where we exhibited before the young gentlemen of the military academy my master who since he had withdrawn his notes from my hands had no one to copy them fairly found himself during his lecture in some perplexity and as he exhibited his usual odd contortions upon this occasion the young gentlemen could not restrain their laughter he also prolonged his lecture more than his audience liked and several yawned terribly and made signs of an impatient desire to see what was in my box as a relief from their fatigue this my master quickly perceived and being extremely provoked he spoke to me with a degree of harshness and insolence which as i bore it with temper prepossessed the young company in my favour he concluded his lecture with the old sentence gentlemen i shall no longer detain you from what i am sure is much better worthy of your attention than any thing i can offer viz mr jervass puppetshow this was an unlucky speech on the present occasion for it happened that every body after having seen what he called my puppetshow was precisely of this opinion my master grew more and more impatient and wanted to hurry me away but one spirited young man most warmly took me and my tinmine under his protection i stood my ground insisting upon my right to finish my exhibition as my master had been allowed full time to finish his the young gentleman who supported me was as well pleased by my present firmness as he had been by my former patience at parting he made a handsome collection for me which i refused to accept taking only the regular price well said he you shall be no loser by this you are going to town my father is in london here is his direction ill mention you to him the next time i write home and youll not be the worse for that as soon as we got to london i went according to my direction the young gentleman had been more punctual in writing home than young gentlemen sometimes are i was appointed to come with my models the next evening when a number of young people were collected beside the children of the family the young spectators gathered round me at one end of a large saloon asking me innumerable questions after the exhibition was over whilst the master of the house who was an east india director was walking up and down the room conversing with a gentleman in an officers uniform they were as i afterwards understood talking about the casting of some guns at woolwich for the east india company charles said the director coming to the place where we were standing and tapping one of his sons on the shoulder do you recollect what your brother told us about the proportion of tin which is used in casting brass cannon at woolwich the young gentleman answered that he could not recollect but referred his father to me adding that his brother told him i was the person from whom he had the information my memory served me exactly and i had reason to rejoice that i had not neglected the opportunity of gaining this knowledge during our short stay at woolwich the east india director pleased with my answering his first question accurately condescended in compliance with his childrens entreaties to examine my models and questioned me upon a variety of subjects at length he observed to the gentleman with whom he had been conversing that i explained myself well that i knew all i did know accurately and that i had the art of captivating the attention of young people i do think concluded he that he would answer dr bells description better than any person i have seen he then inquired particularly into my history and connexions all of which i told him exactly he took down the direction to mr y and my good master as i shall always call mr r and to several other gentlemen at whose houses i had been during the last three or four years telling me that he would write to them about me and that if he found my accounts of myself were as exact as my knowledge upon other subjects he thought he could place me in a very eligible situation the answers to these letters were all perfectly satisfactory he gave me the letter from mr r saying you had better keep this letter and take care of it for it will be a recommendation to you in any part of the world where courage and fidelity are held in esteem upon looking into this letter i found that my good master had related in the handsomest manner the whole of my conduct about the discovery of the vein in his mine the director now informed me that if i had no objection to go to india i should be appointed to go out to madras as an assistant to dr bell one of the directors of the asylum for the instruction of orphans an establishment which is immediately under the auspices of the east india company and which does them honour footnote vide a small pamphlet printed for cadell and davies entitled an experiment in education made at the male asylum of madras by the rev dr a bell the salary which was offered me was munificent beyond my utmost expectations and the account of the institution which was put into my hands charmed me i speedily settled all my concerns with the lecturer who was in great astonishment that this appointment had not fallen upon him to console him for the last time i showed him a passage in dr bells pamphlet in which it is said that the doctor prefers to all others for teaching at his school youths who have no fixed habits as tutors and who will implicitly follow his directions i was at this time but nineteen my master was somewhat appeased by this view of the affair and we parted as i wished upon civil terms though i could not feel much regret at leaving him i had no pleasure in living with one who would not let me become attached to him for having early met with two excellent friends and masters the agreeable feelings of gratitude and affection were in a manner necessary to my happiness before i left england i received new proofs of mr rs goodness he wrote to me to say that as i was going to a distant country to which a small annuity of ten guineas a year could not easily be remitted he had determined to lay out a sum equal to the value of the annuity he had promised me in a manner which he hoped would be advantageous he further said that as the vein of the mine with which i had made him acquainted turned out better than he expected he had added the value of fifty guineas more than my annuity and that if i would go to mr ramsdens mathematical instrument maker in piccadilly i should receive all he had ordered to be ready for me at mr ramsdens i found ready to be packed up for me two small globes siphons prisms an airgun and an airpump a speaking trumpet a small apparatus for showing the gases and an apparatus for freezing water mr ramsden informed me that these were not all the things mr r had bespoken that he had ordered a small balloon and a portable telegraph in form of an umbrella which would be sent home as he expected in the course of the next week mr ramsden also had directions to furnish me with a set of mathematical instruments of his own making but added he with a smile you will be lucky if you get them soon enough out of my hands in fact i believe i called a hundred times in the course of a fortnight upon ramsden and it was only the day before the fleet sailed that they were finished and delivered to me i cannot here omit to mention an incident that happened in one of my walks to ramsdens i was rather late and was pushing my way hastily through a crowd that was gathered at the turning of a street when a hawker by accident flapped a bundle of wet handbills in my eyes and at the same instant screamed in my ears the last dying speech and confession of jonathan clarke who was executed on monday the th instantjonathan clarke the name struck my ears suddenly and the words i shocked me so much that i stood fixed to the spot and it was i not till the hawker had passed by me some yards and was beginning with the last dying speech and confession of jonathan clarke the cornwall miner that i recollected myself enough to speak i called after the hawker in vain he was bawling too loud to hear me and i was forced to run the whole length of the street before i could overtake him and get one of the handbills on reading it i could have no doubt that it was really the last dying speech of my old enemy clarke his birth parentage and every circumstance convinced me of the truth amongst other things in his confession i came to a plan he had laid to murder a poor lad in the tinmine where he formerly worked and he thanked god that this plan was never executed as the boy providentially disappeared the very night on which the murder was to have been perpetrated he further set forth that after being turned away by his master and obliged to fly from cornwall he came up to london and worked as a coalheaver for a little while but soon became what is called a mudlark that is a plunderer of the ships cargoes that unload in the thames he plied this abominable trade for some time drinking every day to the value of what he stole till in a quarrel at an alehouse about the division of some articles to be sold to a receiver of stolen goods he struck the woman of the house a blow of which she died and as it was proved that he had longborne her malice for some old dispute clarke was on his trial brought in guilty of wilful murder and sentenced to be hanged i shuddered whilst i read all thisto such an end after the utmost his cunning could do was this villain brought at last how thankful i was that i did not continue his associate in my boyish days my gratitude to my good master increased upon the reflection that it was his humanity which had raised me from vice and misery to virtue and happiness we sailed from the downs the th of march one thousand seven hundred and but why i tell you this i do not know except it be in compliance with the custom of all voyagers who think that it is important to the world to know on what day they sailed from this or that port i shall not however imitate them in giving you a journal of the wind or a copy of the ships logbook suffice it to say that we arrived safely at madras after a voyage of about the usual number of months and days during all which i am sorry that i have not for your entertainment any escape or imminent danger of shipwreck to relate nor even any description of a storm or a waterspout you will i am afraid be much disappointed to find that upon my arrival in india where doubtless you expected that i should like others have wonderful adventures i began to live at dr bells asylum in madras a quiet regular life in which for years i may safely say that every day in the week was extremely like that which preceded it this regularity was nowise irksome to me notwithstanding that i had for some years in england been so much used to a roving way of life i had never any taste for rambling and under dr bell who treated me with strict justice as far as the business of the asylum was concerned and with distinguished kindness in all other circumstances i enjoyed as much freedom as i desired i never had those absurd vague notions of liberty which render men uneasy under the necessary restraints of all civilized society and which do not make them the more fit to live with savages the young people who were under my care gradually became attached to me and i to them i obeyed dr bells directions exactly in all things and he was pleased to say after i had been with him for some time that he never had any assistant who was so entirely agreeable to him when the business of the day was over i often amused myself and the elder boys with my apparatus for preparing the gases my speakingtrumpet airgun c one day i think it was in the fourth year of my residence at madras dr bell sent for me into his closet and asked me if i had ever heard of a scholar of his of the name of william smith a youth of seventeen years of age who in the year attended the embassy to tippoo sultan when the hostage princes were restored and who went through a course of experiments in natural philosophy in the presence of the sultan i answered dr bell that before i left england i had read in his account of the asylum extracts from this william smiths letters whilst he was at the sultans court and that i remembered all the experiments he had exhibited perfectly well and also that he was detained by the sultans order nineteen days after the embassy had taken leave for the purpose of instructing two aruzbegs or lords in the use of an extensive and elegant mathematical apparatus presented to tippoo by the government at madras footnote extracts from william smiths letters to dr bell vide the pamphlet before mentioned devanelli fort april reverend sir i take the liberty of informing you that we arrived here the th ult without any particular occurrence in the way the day after our arrival we made our first visit to the sultan and he entertained us at his court for upwards of three hours on the st instant captain dovetoun sent me an order to open the boxes and lay out the machines to show them to the sultan accordingly on the third i was sent for and i exhibited the following experiments viz head and wig dancing images electric stool cotton fired small receiver and stand hemispheres archimedes screw siphon tantaluss cup waterpump condensing engine c captain dovetoun was present and explained as i went on to the sultan who has given us an instance of his being acquainted with some of these experiments he has shown us a condensing engine made by himself which spouted water higher than ours he desired me to teach two men his aruzbegs i can assure you that tippoo sultan was mightily pleased with the electric machine he was prepared for every experiment i exhibited except the firing of the inflammable air it did cost me several minutes before the firing of the inflammable air proved successful during which time he was in a very impatient emotion and when that was done it did indeed surprise him he desired me to go over it three times i take the liberty to write for your information the familiar discourse tippoo sultan was pleased to enter into with me that took place at the close of the experiments there were some silver trumpets newly made brought in to him for his inspection and which he desired the trumpeters to sound hauw and jauw ie come and go after which he asked me if they were like those i saw at madras i answered yes but those at madras are made of copper he asked me again whether the tune was any thing like what i had ever heard i answered no how then says he and presently ordering the instrument to be put into my hands desired me to blow i told him very civilly that i could not blow no says he you could what are you afraid of i told him again that i spoke truth and that i was brought up in a school where my master informed me what lying was and always punished those boys that spoke untruths june th after this the sultan arose five hours being elapsed to quit the court and desired the present of a hundred rupees to be delivered into my hands with these words this is given you as a present for the trouble you took in performing those experiments which verily pleased me and a command that i am to stay in the fort ten days after which he continued i will send you to kistnagherry with two hircarrahs in order to conduct you safely through my country i returned the compliment with a salam in the manner i was instructed saying that i thankfully accepted his present and am willing to obey his commands the language which the sultan used was the carnatic malabar mine very little differed from his poornbia was the interpreter of such terms as the sultan did not understand well said dr bell since that time tippoo sultan has been at war and has had no leisure i suppose for the study of philosophy or mathematics but now that he has just made peace and wants something to amuse him he has sent to the government at madras to request that i will permit some of my scholars to pay a second visit at his court to refresh the memory of the aruzbegs and i presume to exhibit some new wonders for tippoos entertainment dr b proposed to me to go on this embassy accordingly i prepared all my apparatus and having carefully remarked what experiments tippoo had already seen i selected such as would be new to him i packed up my speakingtrumpet my apparatus for freezing water and that for exhibiting the gases my balloon and telegraph and with these and my model of the tinmine which i took by dr bells advice i set out with two of his eldest scholars upon our expedition we were met on the entrance of tippoos dominions by four hircarrahs or soldiers whom the sultan sent as a guard to conduct us safely through his dominions he received us at court the day after our arrival unaccustomed as i was to asiatic magnificence i confess that my eyes were at first so dazzled by the display of oriental pomp that as i prostrated myself at the foot of the sultans throne i considered him as a personage high as human veneration could look upon after having made my salam or salutation according to the custom of his court as i was instructed to do the sultan commanded me by his interpreter to display my knowledge of the arts and sciences for the instruction and amusement of his court my boxes and machines had all been previously opened and laid out i was prepared to show my apparatus for freezing but tippoos eye was fixed upon the painted silk balloon and with prodigious eagerness he interrupted me several times with questions about that great empty bag i endeavoured to make him understand as well as i could by my interpreter and his own that this great empty bag was to be filled with a species of air lighter than the common air and that when filled the bag which i informed him was in our country called a balloon would mount far above his palace no sooner was this repeated to him by the interpreter than the sultan commanded me instantly to fill the balloon and when i replied that it could not be done instantly and that i was not prepared to exhibit it on this day tippoo gave signs of the most childish impatience he signified to me that since i could not show him what he wanted to see the sultan would not see what i wanted to show i replied through his interpreter in the most respectful but firm manner that no one would be so presumptuous as to show to tippoo sultan in his own court any thing which he did not desire to see that it was in compliance with his wishes that i came to his court from which in obedience to his commands i should at any time be ready to withdraw a youth who stood at the right hand of tippoos throne seemed much to approve of this answer and the sultan assuming a more composed and dignified aspect signified to me that he was satisfied to await for the sight of the filling of the great bag till the next day and that he should in the mean time be well pleased to see what i was now prepared to show the apparatus for freezing which we then exhibited seemed to please him but i observed that he was during a great part of the time whilst i was explaining it intent upon something else and no sooner had i done speaking than he caused to be produced the condensing engines made by himself which he formerly showed to william smith and which he said spouted water higher than any of ours the sultan i perceived was much more intent upon displaying his small stock of mechanical knowledge than upon increasing it and the mixture of vanity and ignorance which he displayed upon this and many subsequent occasions considerably lessened the awe which his external magnificence at first excited in my mind sometimes he would put himself in competition with me to show his courtiers his superiority but failing in these attempts he would then treat me as a species of mechanic juggler who was fit only to exhibit for the amusement of his court when he saw my speakingtrumpet which was made of copper he at first looked at it with great scorn and ordered his trumpeters to show me theirs which were made of silver as he had formerly done when my predecessor was at his court he desired his trumpeters to sound through these trumpets the words hauw and jauw ie come and go but upon trial mine was found to be far superior to the sultans and i received intimation through one of his courtiers that it would be prudent to offer it immediately to tippoo this i accordingly did and he accepted it with the eagerness of a child who has begged and obtained a new plaything chapter iv the next day tippoo and his whole court assembled to see my balloon tippoo was seated in a splendid pavilion and his principal courtiers stood in a semicircle on each side of him the youth whom i formerly observed was again on his right hand and his eyes were immovably fixed upon my balloon which had been previously filled and fastened down by cords i had the curiosity to ask who this youth was i was informed he was the sultans eldest son prince abdul calie i had not time to make any farther inquiries for tippoo now ordered a signal to be given as had been previously agreed upon i instantly cut the cords which held the balloon and it ascended with a rapid but graceful motion to the unspeakable astonishment and delight of all the spectators some clapped their hands and shouted others looked up in speechless ecstasy and in the general emotion all ranks for an instant were confounded even tippoo sultan seemed at this interval to be forgotten and to forget himself in the admiration of this new wonder as soon as the balloon was out of sight the court returned to their usual places the noise subsided and the sultan as if desirous to fix the public attention upon himself and to show his own superior magnificence issued orders immediately to his treasurer to present me as a token of his royal approbation with two hundred star pagodas when i approached to make my salam and compliment of thanks as i was instructed the sultan who observed that some of the courtiers already began to regard me with envy as if my reward had been too great determined to divert himself with their spleen and to astonish me with his generosity he took from his finger a diamond ring which he presented to me by one of his officers the young prince abdul calie whispered to his father whilst i was withdrawing and i soon afterwards received a message from the sultan requesting or in other words ordering me to remain some time at his court to instruct the young prince his son in the use of my european machines for which they had in their language no names this command proved a source of real pleasure to me for i found prince abdul calie not only a youth of quick apprehension but of a most amiable disposition unlike the imperious and capricious temper which i had remarked in his father prince abdul calie had been when he was about twelve years old one of the hostage princes left with lord cornwallis at seringapatam with that politeness which is seldom to be found in the sons of eastern despots this prince after my first introduction ordered the magnificent palanquin given to him by lord cornwallis to be shown to me then pointing to the enamelled snakes which support the panels and on which the sun at that instant happened to shine prince abdul calie was pleased to say the remembrance of your noble countrymans kindness to me is as fresh and lively in my soul as those colours now appear to my eye another thing gave me a good opinion of this young prince he did not seem to value presents merely by their costliness whether he gave or received he considered the feelings of others and i know that he often excited in my mind more gratitude by the gift of a mere trifle by a word or a look than his ostentatious father could by the most valuable donations tippoo though he ordered his treasurer to pay me fifty rupees per day whilst i was in his service yet treated me with a species of insolence which having some of the feelings of a freeborn briton about me i found it difficult to endure with patience his son on the contrary showed that he felt obliged to me for the little instruction i was able to give him and never appeared to think that as a prince he could pay for all the kindness as well as the service of his inferiors by pagodas or rupees so true it is that attachment cannot be bought and those who wish to have friends as well as servants should keep this truth constantly in mind my english spirit of independence induced me to make these and many more such reflections whilst i was at tippoos court every day afforded me fresh occasion to form comparisons between the sultan and his son and my attachment to my pupil every day increased my pupil it was with astonishment i sometimes reflected that a young prince was actually my pupil thus an obscure individual in a country like england where arts sciences and literature are open to all ranks may obtain a degree of knowledge which an eastern despot in all his pride would gladly purchase with ingots of his purest gold one evening after the business of the day was over tippoo sultan came into his sons apartment whilst i was explaining to the young prince the use of some of the mathematical instruments in my pocketcase we are well acquainted with these things said the sultan in a haughty tone the government of madras sent us such things as those with others which are now in the possession of some of my aruzbegs who have doubtless explained them sufficiently to the prince my son prince abdul calie modestly replied that he had never before been made to understand them for that the aruzbeg who had formerly attempted to explain them had not the art of making things so clear to him as i had done i felt a glow of pleasure at this compliment and at the consciousness that i deserved it how little did i imagine when i used to sit up at nights studying my old masters books that one of them would be the means of procuring me such honour footnote jervas here alludes to a book entitled a description of pocket and magazine cases of drawing instruments in which is explained the use of each instrument and particularly of the sector and plain scale gunters scale c by j barrow private teacher of mathematics what is contained in that box said the sultan pointing to the box which held the model of the tinmine i do not remember to have seen it opened in my presence i replied that it had not been opened because i feared that it was not worthy to be shown to him but he commanded that it should instantly be exhibited and to my great surprise it seemed to delight him excessively he examined every part moved the wires of the puppets and asked innumerable questions concerning our tinmines i was the more astonished at this because i had imagined he would have considered every object of commerce as beneath the notice of a sultan nor could i guess why he should be peculiarly interested in this subject but he soon explained this to me by saying that he had in his dominions certain mines of tin which he had a notion would if properly managed bring a considerable revenue to the royal treasury but that at present through negligence or fraud these mines were rather burdensome than profitable he inquired from me how my model came into my possession and when his interpreter told him that i made it myself he caused the question and answer to be repeated twice before he would believe that he understood me rightly he next inquired whether i was acquainted with the art of mining and how i came by my information in short he commanded me to relate my history i replied that it was a long story concerning only an obscure individual and unworthy the attention of a great monarch but he seemed this evening to have nothing to do but to gratify his curiosity which my apology only served to increase he again commanded me to relate my adventures and i then told him the history of my early life i was much flattered by the interest which the young prince took in my escape from the mine and by the praises he bestowed on my fidelity to my master the sultan on the contrary heard me at first with curiosity but afterwards with an air of incredulity upon observing this i produced the letter from my good master to the east india director which gave a full account of the whole affair i put this letter into the hands of the interpreter and with some difficulty he translated it into the carnatic malabar which was the language the sultan used in speaking to me the letter which had the countersignatures of some of the east india companys servants resident at madras whose names were well known to tippoo failed not to make a great impression in favour of my integrity of my knowledge he had before a high opinion he stood musing for some time with his eyes fixed upon the model of the tinmine and after consulting with the young prince as i guessed by their tones and looks he bade his interpreter tell me that if i would undertake to visit the tinmines in his dominions to instruct his miners how to work them and to manage the ore according to the english fashion i should receive from the royal treasury a reward more than proportioned to my services and suitable to the generosity of a sultan some days were given me to consider of this proposal though tempted by the idea that i might realize in a short time a sum that would make me independent for the rest of my life yet my suspicions of the capricious and tyrannical temper of tippoo made me dread to have him for a master and above all i resolved to do nothing without the express permission of dr bell to whom i immediately wrote he seemed by his answer to think that such an opportunity of making my fortune was not to be neglected my hopes therefore prevailed over my fears and i accepted the proposal the presents which he had made me and the salary allowed me during six weeks that i had attended the young prince amounted to a considerable sum star pagodas and rupees all which i left together with my ring in the care of a great gentoo merchant of the name of omychund who had shown me many civilities with proper guides and full powers from the sultan i proceeded on my journey and devoted myself with the greatest ardour to my undertaking a very laborious and difficult undertaking it proved for in no country are prejudices in favour of their own customs more inveterate amongst workmen of every description than in india and although i was empowered to inflict what punishment i thought proper on those who disobeyed or even hesitated to fulfil my orders yet thank god i could never bring myself to have a poor slave tortured or put to death because he roasted ore in a manner which i did not think so good as my own method nor even because he was not so well convinced as i was of the advantages of our cornwall smeltingfurnace my moderation was of more service to me in the minds of the people than the utmost violence i could have employed to enforce obedience as i got by degrees some little knowledge of their language i grew more and more acceptable to them and some few who tried methods of my proposing and found that they succeeded were by my directions rewarded with the entire possession of the difference of profit between the old and new modes this bounty enticed others and in time that change was accomplished by gentle means which i had at first almost despaired of ever effecting when the works were in proper train i despatched a messenger to the sultans court to request that he would be pleased to appoint some confidential person to visit the mines in order to be an eyewitness of what had been done and i further begged as i had now accomplished the object of the sultans wishes that i might be recalled after deputing whomsoever he should think proper to superintend and manage the mines in my stead i moreover offered before i withdrew to instruct the person who should be appointed my messenger after a long delay returned to me with a command from tippoo sultan to remain where i was till his further orders for these i waited three months and then concluding that i was forgotten i determined to set out to refresh tippoos memory i found him at devanelli fort thinking of nothing less than of me or my tinmines he was busily engaged in making preparations for a war with some soubha or other whose name i forget and all his ideas were bent on conquests and vengeance he scarcely deigned to see much less to listen to me his treasurer gave me to understand that too much had already been lavished upon me a stranger as i was and that tippoos resources at all events would be now employed in carrying on schemes of war not petty projects of commerce thus insulted and denied all my promised reward i could not but reflect upon the hard fate of those who attempt to serve capricious despots i prepared as fast as possible to depart from tippoos court the hindoo merchant with whom i had lodged the pagodas and rupees promised to transmit them to me at madras and he delivered to me the diamond ring which tippoo had given to me during his fit of generosity or of ostentation the sultan who cared no more what became of me made no opposition to my departure but i was obliged to wait a day or two for a guard as the hircarrahs who formerly conducted me were now out upon some expedition whilst i waited impatiently for their return prince abdul calie who had not been during all this time at devanelli fort arrived and when i went to take leave of him he inquired into the reason of my sudden departure in language as respectful as i could use and with as much delicacy as i thought myself bound to observe in speaking to a son of his father i related the truth the princes countenance showed what he felt he paused and seemed to be lost in thought for a few minutes he then said to me the sultan my father is at this time so intent upon preparations for war that even i should despair of being listened to on any other subject but you have in your possession as i recollect what might be useful to him either in war or peace and if you desire it i will speak of this machine to the sultan i did not immediately know to what machine of mine the prince alluded but he explained to me that he meant my portable telegraph which would be of infinite use to tippoo in conveying orders of intelligence across the deserts i left the matter entirely to the prince after returning him my very sincere thanks for being thus interested in my concerns a few hours after this conversation i was summoned into the sultans presence his impatience to make trial of the telegraphs was excessive and i who but the day before had been almost trampled upon by the officers and lords of his court instantly became a person of the greatest importance the trial of the telegraphs succeeded beyond even my expectations and the sultan was in a species of ecstasy on the occasion i cannot omit to notice an instance of the violence of his temper and its sudden changes from joy to rage one of his blacks a gentle hindoo lad of the name of saheb was set to manage a telegraph at one of the stations a few yards distant from the sultan i had previously instructed saheb in what he was to do but from want of practice he made some mistake which threw tippoo into such a transport of passion that he instantly ordered the slaves head to be cut off a sentence which would infallibly have been executed if i had not represented that it would be expedient to suffer his head to remain on his shoulders till the message was delivered by his telegraph because there was no one present who could immediately supply his place saheb then read off his message without making any new blunder and the moment the exhibition was over i threw myself at the feet of the sultan and implored him to pardon saheb i was not likely at this moment to be refused such a trifle saheb was pardoned an order upon the treasurer for five hundred star pagodas to reward my services at the royal tinmines was given to me and upon my presenting to tippoo sultan the portable telegraphs on which his ardent wishes were fixed he exclaimed ask any favour in the wideextended power of tippoo sultan to confer and it shall be granted i concluded that this was merely an oriental figure of speech but i resolved to run the hazard of a refusal i did not ask for a province though this was in the wideextended power of tippoo sultan to confer but as i had a great curiosity to see the diamond mines of golconda of which both in europe and in india i had heard so much i requested the sultans permission to visit those which belonged to him he hesitated but after saying some words to an officer near him he bade his interpreter tell me that he granted my request accordingly after lodging my pagodas and rupees along with the rest in the hands of omychund the gentoo merchant who was a man of great wealth and credit i set out in company with some diamond merchants who were going to golconda my curiosity was amply gratified by the sight of these celebrated mines and i determined that when i returned to europe i would write a description of them this description however i shall spare you for the present and proceed with my story the diamond merchants with whom i travelled had a great deal of business to transact at various places and this was the cause of much delay to me which i could scarcely bear with patience for now that i had gratified my curiosity i was extremely desirous to return to madras with my little treasure the five years salary due to me by the east india company which i had never used i had put out at interest at madras where sometimes the rate was as high as twelve per cent and if you knew said mr jervas addressing himself to the miners at mr rs table any thing of the nature of compound interest you would perceive that i was in a fair way to get rich for in the course of fourteen or fifteen years any sum that is put out at compound interest even in england where the rate of legal interest is five per cent becomes double that is one hundred pounds put out at compound interest in fourteen years becomes two hundred but few people have the patience or the prudence to make this use of their money i was however determined to employ all my capital in this manner and i calculated that in seven years i should have accumulated a sum fully sufficient to support me all the rest of my life in ease and affluence full of these hopes and calculations i pursued my journey along with the merchants arrived at devanelli fort i learned that the soubha with whom the sultan had been going to war had given up the territory in dispute and had pacified tippoo by submissions and presents whether he chose peace or war was indifferent to me i was intent on my private affairs and i went immediately to omychund my banker to settle them i had taken my diamond ring with me to the mines that i might compare it with others and learn its value and i found that it was worth nearly treble what i had been offered for it omychund congratulated me upon this discovery and we were just going to settle our accounts when an officer came in and after asking whether i was not the young englishman who had lately visited the mines of golconda summoned me immediately to appear before the sultan i was terrified for i imagined i was perhaps suspected of having purloined some of the diamonds but i followed the officer without hesitation conscious of my innocence tippoo sultan contrary to my expectations received me with a smiling countenance and pointing to the officer who accompanied me asked me whether i recollected to have ever seen his face before i replied no but the sultan then informed me that this officer who was one of his own guards had attended me in disguise during my whole visit to the diamond mines and that he was perfectly satisfied of my honourable conduct then after making a signal to the officer and all present to withdraw he bade me approach nearer to him paid some compliments to my abilities and proceeded to explain to me that he stood in farther need of my services and that if i served him with fidelity i should have no reason to complain on my return to my own country of his want of generosity all thoughts of war being now as he told me out of his mind he had leisure for other projects to enrich himself and he was determined to begin by reforming certain abuses which had long tended to impoverish the royal treasury i was at a loss to know whither this preamble would lead at length having exhausted his oriental pomp of words he concluded by informing me that he had reason to believe he was terribly cheated in the management of his mines at golconda that they were rented from him by a feulinga brahmin as he called him whose agreement with the adventurers in the mines was that all the stones they found under a pago in weight were to be their own and all above this weight were to be his for the sultans use now it seems that this agreement was never honestly fulfilled by any of the parties the slaves cheating the merchants the merchants cheating the feulinga brahmin and he in his turn defrauding the sultan so that tippoo assured me he had often purchased from diamond merchants stones of a larger spread and finer water than any he could get directly from his own mines and that he had been frequently obliged to reward these merchants with rich vests or fine horses in order to encourage others to offer their diamonds footnote philosophical transactions vol ii p for sale i could not but observe whilst tippoo related all this the great agitation of his looks and voice which showed me the strong hold the passion for diamonds had upon his soul on which i should perhaps have made some wise reflections but that people have seldom leisure or inclination to make wise reflections when standing in the presence of a prince as powerful and as despotic as tippoo sultan the service that he required from me was a very dangerous one no less than to visit the mines secretly by night to search those small cisterns in which the workmen leave the diamonds mixed with the sand gravelly stuff and red earth to sink and drain off during their absence i by no means relished this undertaking besides that it would expose me to imminent danger it was odious to my feelings to become a spy and an informer this i stated to the sultan but he gave no credit to this motive and attributing my reluctance wholly to fear he promised that he would take effectual measures to secure my safety and that after i had executed this commission he would immediately send a guard with me to madras i saw that a dark frown lowered on his brow when i persisted in declining this office but i fortunately bethought myself at this moment of a method of escaping the effects of his anger without giving up my own principles i represented to him that the seizure of the diamonds in the cisterns which he proposed even should it afford him any convincing proofs of the dishonesty of the slaves and diamond merchants and even if he could in future take effectual precautions to secure himself from their frauds would not be a source of wealth to him equal to one which i could propose his avarice fixed his attention and he eagerly commanded me to proceed i then explained to him that one of his richest diamondmines had been for some time abandoned because the workmen having dug till they came to water were then forced to stop for want of engines such as are known in europe now having observed that there was a rapid current at the foot of the mountain on which i could erect a watermill i offered to clear this valuable mine chapter v the sultan was pleased with the proposal but recollecting how apt he was to change his humour and how ill he received me when i returned from his tinmines i had the precaution to represent that as this undertaking would be attended with considerable expense it would be necessary that a years salary should be advanced to me before my departure for golconda and that if the payments were not in future regularly made i should be at liberty to resign my employment and return to madras prince abdul calie was present when the sultan pledged his word to this and gave me full powers to employ certain of his artificers and workmen i shall not trouble you with a history of all my difficulties delays and disappointments in the execution of my undertaking however interesting they were to me the relation would be tiresome to those who have no diamondmines to drain it is enough for you to know that at length my engines were set agoing properly and did their business so effectually that the place was by degrees cleared of water and the workmen were able to open fresh and valuable veins during all this time including a period of three years my salary was regularly paid to the gentoo merchant omychund in whose hands i left all my money upon his promising to pay me as high interest as what i could obtain at madras i drew upon him only for such small sums as were absolutely necessary as i was resolved to live with the utmost economy that i might the sooner be enabled to return in affluence to my native country and here i must pause to praise myself or rather to rejoice from the bottom of my soul that i did not when power was in my hands make use of it for the purposes of extortion the condition of the poor slaves who were employed by me was envied by all the others and i have reason to know that even in the most debased and miserable state of existence the human heart can be wakened by kind treatment to feelings of affection and gratitude these slaves became so much attached to me that although the governor of the mines and certain diamond merchants were lying in wait continually to get rid of me some way or other they never could effect their purposes i was always apprised of my danger in time by some of these trusty slaves who with astonishing sagacity and fidelity guarded me while i lived amongst them a life of daily suspicion and danger was however terrible and my influence extended but a little way in making others happy i might for a short season lessen the suffering of these slaves but still they were slaves and most of them were treated scarcely as if they were human beings by the rapacious adventurers for whom they laboured these poor wretches generally work almost naked they dare not wear a coat lest the governor should say they have thriven much are rich and so increase his demands upon them the wisest when they find a great stone conceal it till they have an opportunity and then with wife and children run all away into the visiapore country where they are secure and well used footnote philosophical transactions my heart sickened at the daily sight of so much misery and nothing but my hopes of finally prevailing on the sultan to better their condition by showing him how much he would be the gainer by it could have induced me to remain so long in this situation repeatedly tippoo promised me that the first diamond of twenty pagos weight which i should bring to him he would grant me all i asked in favour of the slaves under my care i imparted to them this promise which excited them to great exertions at last we were fortunate enough to find a diamond above the weight required it was a wellspread stone of a beautiful pale rosecolour and of an adamantine hardness i am sure that the sight of that famous stone which is known by the name of the pitt diamond never gave its possessor such heartfelt joy as i experienced when i beheld this i looked upon it as the pledge of future happiness not only to myself but to hundreds of my fellowcreatures i set out immediately for tippoo sultans court it was too late in the evening when i arrived to see the sultan that night so i went to omychund the hindoo merchant to settle my affairs with him he received me with open arms saying that he had thriven much upon my pagodas and rupees and that he was ready to account with me for my salary also for the interest which he owed me for all which he gave me an order upon an english merchant at madras with whom i was well acquainted this being settled to my satisfaction i told him the business which now brought me to tippoos court and showed him my rosecoloured diamond his eyes opened at the sight with a prodigious expression of avaricious eagerness trust me said he keep this diamond i know tippoo better than you do he will not grant those privileges to the slaves that you talk about and after all what concern are they of yours they are used to the life they lead they are not europeans what concern are they of yours once in your native country you will dream of them no more you will think only of enjoying the wealth you shall have brought from india trust me keep the diamond fly this night towards madras i have a slave who perfectly knows the road across the country you will be in no danger of pursuit for the sultan will suppose you to be still at golconda no one could inform him of the truth but myself and you must see by the advice i now give you that i am your firm friend as he finished these words he clapped his hands to summon one of his slaves as he said to give instant orders for my flight he looked upon me with incredulous surprise when i coolly told him that the flight which he proposed was far from my thoughts and that it was my determination to give the sultan the diamond that belonged to him seeing that i was in earnest omychund suddenly changed his countenance and in a tone of raillery asked me whether i could believe that his proposal was serious indeed i was left in doubt whether he had been in earnest or not and at all events i gave him to understand that i was incapable of betraying him to the sultan the next morning as early as i could i presented myself before the sultan who singled me from the crowd and took me with him into the apartment of prince abdul calie i proceeded cautiously tippoo was all impatience to hear news of his diamond mine and repeatedly interrupted me in my account of what had been done there by asking whether we had yet come to any diamonds i produced first one of a violet colour which i had reserved as a present for prince abdul calie it was a fine stone but nothing equal to our rosecoloured diamond tippoo admired this however so much that i was certain he would be in raptures with that which i had in store for him before i showed it to him in speaking of the weight of that which i had designed to present to the prince i reminded him of his royal promise with respect to the slaves true cried the sultan but is this diamond twenty pagos weight when you bring me one of that value you may depend upon having all you ask i instantly produced the rosecoloured diamond weighed it in his presence and as the scale in which it was put descended tippoo burst forth into an exclamation of joy i seized the favourable moment he nodded as i knelt before him and bade me rise saying my request was granted though why i should ask favours for a parcel of mean slaves he observed was incomprehensible prince abdul calie did not appear to be of this opinion he at this instant cast upon me a look full of benevolence and whilst his father was absorbed in the contemplation of his rosecoloured diamond which he weighed i believe a hundred times the generous young prince presented to me that violetcoloured diamond which i brought for him a princely gift made in a princely manner tippoos secretary made out for me the necessary order to the governor of the mines by which a certain share of the profits of his labour was by the sultans command to belong to each slave and all those who had been employed in my service were as a reward for their good conduct to be emancipated a number of petty exactions were by this order abolished and the property acquired in land dress c by the slaves was secured to them most gladly did i see the sultans signet affixed to this paper and when it was delivered into my hands my heart bounded with joy i resolved to be the bearer of these good tidings myself although my passport was made out for madras and two hircarrahs by the sultans orders were actually ready to attend me thither yet i could not refuse myself the pleasure of beholding the joy of the slaves at this change in their condition and to the latest hour of my life i shall rejoice that i returned to golconda the messenger of happiness never shall i forget the scene to which i was there a witness never will the expressions of joy and gratitude be effaced from my memory which lighted up the dark faces of these poor creatures who say what we will have as much sensibility perhaps more than we have ourselves no sooner was i awake the morning after my arrival than i heard them singing songs under my window in which my own name was frequently repeated they received me with a shout of joy when i went out amongst them and crowding round me they pressed me to accept of some little tokens of their gratitude and goodwill which i had not the heart to refuse the very children by their caresses seemed to beg me not to reject these little offerings i determined if ever i reached europe to give all of them to you sir my good master as the best present i could make to one of your way of thinking the day after my arrival was spent in rejoicings all the slaves who had worked under my inspection had saved some little matters with which they had purchased for their wives and for themselves coloured cottons and handkerchiefs for their heads now that they were not in dread of being robbed or persecuted by the governor of the mines they ventured to produce them in open day these cottons of malabar are dyed of remarkably bright and gaudy colours and when the slaves appeared decked in them it was to me one of the gayest spectacles i ever beheld they were dancing with a degree of animation of which till then i never had an idea i stood under the shade of a large banyan tree enjoying the sight when suddenly i felt from behind a blow on my head which stunned me i fell to the ground and when i came to my senses found myself in the hands of four armed soldiers and a hindoo who was pulling my diamond ring from my finger they were carrying me away amid the cries and lamentations of the slaves who followed us stand off it is in vain you shriek said one of the soldiers to the surrounding crowd what we do is by order of the sultan thus he punishes traitors without further explanation i was thrown into a dungeon belonging to the governor of the mines who stood by with insulting joy to see me chained to a large stone in my horrid prison i knew him to be my enemy but what was my astonishment when i recollected in the countenance of the hindoo who was fastening my chains and loading me with curses that very saheb whose life i had formerly saved to all my questions no answer was given but it is the will of the sultan or thus the sultan avenges himself upon traitors the door of my dungeon was then locked and barred and i was left alone in perfect darkness is this thought i the reward of all my faithful services bitterly did i regret that i was not in my native country where no man at the will of a sultan can be thrown into a dungeon without knowing his crime or his accusers i cannot attempt to describe to you what i felt during this most miserable day of my existence feeble at last for want of food i stretched myself out as well as my chains would allow me and tried to compose myself to sleep i sunk into a state of insensibility in which i must have remained for several hours for it was midnight when i was roused by the unbarring of my prison door it was saheb who entered carrying in one hand a torch and in the other some food which he set before me in silence i cast upon him a look of scorn and was about to reproach him with his ingratitude when he threw himself at my feet and burst into tears is it possible said he to me that you are not sure of the heart of saheb you saved my life i am come to save yours but eat master continued he eat whilst i speak for we have no time to lose tomorrows sun must see us far from hence you cannot support the fatigues you have to undergo without taking food i yielded to his entreaties and whilst i ate saheb informed me that my imprisonment was owing to the treacherous hindoo merchant omychund who in hopes i suppose of possessing himself in quiet of all the wealth which i had intrusted to his care went to the sultan and accused me of having secreted certain diamonds of great value which he pretended i had shown to him in confidence tippoo enraged at this despatched immediate orders to four of his soldiers to go in search of me seize imprison and torture me till i should confess where these diamonds were concealed saheb was in the sultans apartment when this order was given and immediately hastened to prince abdul calie whom he knew to be my friend and informed him of what had happened the prince sent for omychund and after carefully questioning him was convinced by his contradictory answers and by his confusion that the charge against me was wholly unfounded he dismissed omychund however without letting him know his opinion and then sent saheb for the four soldiers who were setting out in search of me in their presence he gave saheb orders aloud to take charge of me the moment i should be found and secretly commissioned him to favour my escape the soldiers thought that in obeying the prince they obeyed the sultan and consequently when i was taken and lodged in my dungeon the keys of it were delivered to saheb when he had finished telling me all this he restored to me my ring which he said he snatched from my finger as soon as i was seized that i might not be robbed of it by the governor or some of the soldiers the grateful saheb now struck off my chains and my own anxiety for my escape was scarcely equal to his he had swift horses belonging to the soldiers in readiness and we pursued our course all night without interruption he was well acquainted with the country having accompanied the sultan on several expeditions when we thought ourselves beyond the reach of all pursuers saheb permitted me to rest but i never rested at my ease till i was out of tippoo sultans dominions and once more in safety at madras dr bell received me with great kindness heard my story and congratulated me on my escape from tippoos power i was now rich beyond my hopes for i had omychunds order upon the madras merchant safe in my pocket and the whole sum was punctually paid to me my ring i sold to the governor of madras for more even than i expected i had the satisfaction to learn before i left madras that omychunds treachery was made known to the sultan by means of prince abdul calie whose memory will ever be dear to me tippoo as i have been informed in speaking of me was heard to regret that he could not recall to his service such an honest englishman i was eager to reward the faithful saheb but he absolutely refused the money which i offered him saying that he would not be paid for saving the life of one who had saved his he expressed a great desire to accompany me to my native country from the moment that i told him we had no slaves there and that as soon as any slave touched the english shore by our laws he obtained his freedom he pressed me so earnestly to take him along with me as my servant that i could not refuse so he sailed with me for europe as the wind filled the sails of our vessel much did i rejoice that the gales which blew me from the shores of india were not tainted with the curses of any of my fellowcreatures here i am thank heaven once more in free and happy england with a good fortune clean hands and a pure conscience not unworthy to present myself to my first good master to him whose humanity and generosity were the cause of here mr r interrupted his own praises by saying to those of the miners who had not fallen fast asleep my good friends you now know the meaning of the toast which you all drank after dinner let us drink it again before we part welcome home to our friend mr jervas and may good faith always meet with good fortune october the will chapter i mr pearson a wealthy lincolnshire farmer who had always been esteemed a prudent sensible man though something of a humourist made the following will i john pearson of the wold in lincolnshire farmer being of sound mind and body do make this my last will and testament c i give and bequeath my farm of west woldland to my eldest nephew grimes goodenough my farm of holland fen to my dear nephew john wright and my farm of cloverhill to my youngest nephew pierce marvel i farther will and desire that the sum of ten thousand pounds which is now in the hands of william constantine gentleman my executor may by him immediately after my decease be put out to interest for ten years and i will and desire that at the end of the said ten years the said sum of ten thousand pounds and the interest so accumulated thereon be given to whichsoever of my aforesaid nephews shall at that time be the richest and i trust that the said william constantine gentleman my executor and very good friend being a clearheaded honest man will understand and execute this my last will and testament according to the plain meaning of my words though it should happen that this my will should not be drawn up in due legal form of which i know little or nothing mr constantine the executor being as described a clearheaded honest man found no difficulty either in understanding or executing this trust the ten thousand pounds were immediately upon pearsons decease placed out upon interest and the three nephews were put into possession of their farms these were of very different value goodenoughs wanted improvement but would pay richly for any that should be judiciously made wrights farm was by far the worst of the three and marvels the best the lincolnshire world was much divided in opinion concerning these young men and many bets were laid relating to the legacy people judged according to their own characters the enterprising declared for marvel the prudent for wright the timid for goodenough the nephews had scarcely been in possession of their farms a week when one evening as they were all supping together at wrights house marvel suddenly turned to goodenough and exclaimed when do you begin your improvements cousin goodenough never cousin marvel then youll never touch the ten thousand my boy what will you do nothing to your marsh nothing to your common nothing to your plantations do not you mean ever to make any improvements i mean not to make any improvements well youll let me make some for you not i no wont you let me cut down some of those trees for you that are spoiling one another in your wood not a tree shall be cut down not a stick shall be stirred not a change shall be made i say not a change for the better cousin goodenough said wright not a change can be for the better to my mind i shall plough and sow and reap as our forefathers did and thats enough for me what will you not even try the new plough said marvel not i no new ploughs for me no plough can be so good as the old one how do you know as you never tried it or would see it tried said wright i find it better than the old one no matter the old one will do well enough for me as it did for my father before me after having repeated these words in precisely the same tone several times he went on slowly eating his supper whilst marvel in detestation of his obstinate stupidity turned his back upon him and began to enumerate to wright sundry of his own ingenious projects my dear wright said he you are worth talking to and you shall hear all my schemes willingly but i do not promise to approve of them all oh you will you will the moment you hear them and i will let you have a share in some of them in the first place theres that fine rabbitwarren near cloverhill the true silver grey rabbitssilver sprigs they call themdo you know that the skins of those silver sprigs are worth any money any money what money pooh i dont know exactly but i mean to buy that warren before you know what it is worth let us consider each dozen of skins is worth say from ten to fifteen shillings you need not trouble yourself to calculate now interrupted marvel for i have determined to have the warren with the money that i shall get for my silver sprigs i will next year make a decoy and supply the london market with wildfowl dont you remember the day that we met simon stubbs the carrier loaded with game and wildfowl he said that a decoy in lincolnshire must be a fortune to any man ill have the best decoy not only in lincolnshire but in all england bythebye theres another thing i must do wright ill exchange any part of cloverhill you please with you for as much land in holland fen take him at his word cousin wright said goodenough no no replied wright i know the value of land and the difference between cloverhill and holland fen better than he does i would not take him at his word for that would be taking him in i would not take anybody in said goodenough but if another man is a fool thats no reason i should be one now if a man offers me a good bargain why should not i close with him and saydone then say done cried marvel and you shall have the bargain goodenough you have an undrained marsh of your own ill exchange with you and welcome ten acres of the marsh for five of cloverhill done said goodenough done i shall stock it with geese and youll see what the quills and feathers alone will bring me in ive engaged with one already to sell them for me but wright heres another scheme i have wildmore common you know is covered with those huge thistles which prick the noses of the sheep so as to hinder them from feeding and fattening i will take that common into my own hands ay said goodenough exchange the rest of cloverhill for itthats like you and i will mow the thistles pursued marvel without deigning to reply to goodenough i will mow the thistles their down i can contrive to work up into cotton and the stalks into cordage and with the profit i shall make of these thistles and of my decoy and of my goosequills and feathers and of my silver sprig rabbits i will buy jackets for my sheep for my sheep shall all have jackets after shearing why should not lincolnshire sheep if they have jackets become as valuable as the leicestershire breed youll see my sheep will be the finest in the whole county and with the profit i shall make of them i will set up a fishery in fenlake and with the profits of the fisherynow comes my grand schemei shall be the richest of you all with the profits of the fishery and the decoy and the sheep and the silver sprigs and the quills and feathers geese and thistles i will purchase that fine heronry near spalding at these words goodenough laid down his knife and fork and sticking his arms akimbo laughed contemptuously if not heartily so then the end of all this turmoil is to purchase a heronry much good may it do you cousin marvel you understand your own affair best you will make great improvements i grant and no doubt will be the richest of us all the ten thousand pounds will be yours for certain for as we all know cousin marvel you are a geniusbut why a genius should set his fancy upon a heronry of all things in this mortal world is more than i can pretend to tell being no genius myself look here wright continued marvel still without vouchsafing any direct reply to goodenough heres a description in this last newspaper of the fine present that the grand seignior has made to his majesty the plume of herons feathers alone is estimated at a thousand guineas think of what i shall make by my heronry at the end of ten years i shall be so rich that it will hardly be worth my while said marvel laughing to accept of my uncles legacy i will give it to you wright for you are a generous fellow and i am sure you will deserve it in return for this liberal promise wright endeavoured to convince marvel that if he attempted such a variety of schemes at once they would probably all fail and that to ensure success it would be necessary to calculate and to make himself master of the business before he should undertake to conduct it marvel however was of too sanguine and presumptuous a temper to listen to this sage advice he was piqued by the sneers of his cousin goodenough and determined to prove the superiority of his own spirit and intellect he plunged at once into the midst of a business which he did not understand he took a rabbitwarren of two hundred and fifty acres into his hands stocked ten acres of marsh land with geese and exchanged some of the best part of cloverhill for a share in a common covered with thistles he planted a considerable tract of land with a degree of expedition that astonished all the neighbourhood but it was remarked that the fences were not quite sufficient especially as the young trees were in a dangerous situation being surrounded by land stocked with sheep and horned cattle wright warned him of the danger but he had no time this year he said to complete the fences the men who tended his sheep might easily keep them from the plantation for this season and the next spring he purposed to dig such a ditch round the whole as should secure it for ever he was now extremely busy making jackets for his sheep providing willows for his decoy and gorse and corn for his geese the geese of which he had a prodigious flock were not yet turned into their fen because a new scheme had occurred to marvel relative to some reeds with which a part of this fen was covered on these reeds myriads of starlings were accustomed to roost who broke them down with their weight now marvel knew that such reeds would be valuable for thatching and with this view he determined to drive away the starlings but the measures necessary for this purpose would frighten his friends the geese and therefore he was obliged to protect and feed them in his farmyard at a considerable expense whilst he was carrying on the war with the starlings he fired guns at them morning and evening he sent up rockets and kites with fiery tails and at last he banished them but half his geese in the mean time died for want of food and the women and children who plucked them stole one quarter of the feathers and one half of the quills whilst marvel was absent letting up rockets in the fen the rabbitwarren was however to make up for all other losses a furrier had engaged to take as many silver sprigs from him as he pleased at sixteen shillings a dozen provided he should send them properly dressed and in time to be shipped for china where these silver grey rabbit skins sold to the best advantage as winter came on it was necessary to supply the warren with winter food and marvel was much astonished at the multitude of unforeseen expenses into which his rabbits led him the banks of the warren wanted repair and the warreners house was not habitable in bad weather these appeared but slight circumstances when marvel made the purchase but alas he had reason to change his opinion in the course of a few months the first week in november there was a heavy fall of snow and the warren walls should have been immediately cleared of snow to have kept the rabbits within their bounds but marvel happened this week to be on a visit in yorkshire and he was obliged to leave the care of the warren entirely to the warrener who was obliged to quit his house during the snow and to take shelter with a neighbour he neglected to clear the walls and marvel upon his return home found that his silver sprigs had strayed into a neighbouring warren the second week in november is the time when the rabbits are usually killed as the skins are then in full prime it was in vain that marvel raised a hue and cry after his silver sprigs a fortnight passed away before onethird of them could be recovered the season was lost and the furrier sued him for breach of contract and what was worse goodenough laughed at his misfortunes the next year he expected to retrieve his loss he repaired the warreners house new faced the banks and capped them with furze but the common grey rabbit had been introduced into the warren by the stragglers of the preceding year and as these grey rabbits are of a much more hardy race than the silver sprigs they soon obtained and kept possession of the land marvel now pronounced rabbits to be the most useless and vexatious animals upon earth and in one quarter of an hour thoroughly convinced himself that tillage was far more profitable than rabbits he ploughed up his warren and sowed it with corn but unluckily his attention had been so much taken up by the fishery the decoy the geese the thistles and the hopes of the heronry that he totally forgot his intention of making the best of all possible ditches round his plantation when he went to visit this plantation he beheld a miserable spectacle the rabbits which had strayed beyond their bounds during the great snow and those which had been hunted from their burrows when the warren was ploughed up had all taken shelter in this spot and these refugees supported themselves for some months upon the bark and roots of the finest young trees marvels loss was great but his mortification still greater for his cousin goodenough laughed at him without mercy something must be done he saw to retrieve his credit ad the heronry was his resource what will signify a few trees more or less thought he or the loss of a few silver sprigs or the death of a few geese or the waste of a few quills and feathers my sheep will sell well my thistles will bring me up again and as soon as i have sold my sheep at partney fair and manufactured my thistles i will set out with my money in my pocket for spalding and make my bargain for the heronry a plume of herons feathers is worth a thousand guineas my fortune will be made when i get possession of the spalding heronry so intent was marvel upon the thoughts of the spalding heronry that he neglected every thing else about a week before the fair of partney he bethought himself of his sheep which he had left to the care of a shepherd boy he now ordered the boy to drive them home that he might see them their jackets hung upon them like bags the poor animals had fallen away in the most deplorable manner marvel could scarcely believe that these were his sheep or that these were the sheep which he had expected to be the pride of lincolnshire and which he had hoped would set the fashion of jackets behold they were dying of the rot what an unfortunate man i am exclaimed marvel turning to his cousin wright whom he had summoned along with goodenough in the pride of his heart to view value and admire his sheep all your sheep wright are fat and sound mine were finer than yours when i bought them how comes it that i am so unlucky jack of all trades and master of none said goodenough with a sneer you forgot i am afraid what i told you when first you bought these sheep said wright that you should always keep them in fold every morning till the dew was off if you had done so they would now be as well and thriving as mine do not you remember my telling you that yes and i charged this boy always to keep them in fold till the dew was off replied marvel turning with an angry countenance to the shepherd boy i never heard nothing of it till this minute i am sure master said the boy marvel now recollected that at the very moment when he was going to give this order to the boy his attention had been drawn away by the sight of a new decoy in the fields adjoining to his sheep pasture in his haste to examine the decoy he forgot to give that order to his shepherd on which the safety of his fine flock of sheep depended footnote a general view of the agriculture of the county of lincoln p it well deserves noting that a shepherd who when young was shepherds boy to an old man who lived at netlam near lincoln a place famous for the rot told mr neve that he was persuaded sheep took the rot only of a morning before the dew was well off at that time they folded being open field his masters shepherd kept his flock in fold always till the dew was gone and with no other attention his sheep were kept sound when all the neighbours lost their flocks such are the negligences and blunders of those who endeavour to do half a dozen things at once the failure of one undertaking never discouraged marvel from beginning another and it is a pity that with so much spirit and activity he had so little steadiness and prudence his sheep died and he set out for spalding full of the thoughts of the heronry now this heronry belonged to sir plantagenet mowbray an elderly gentleman who was almost distracted with family pride he valued himself upon never having parted with one inch of the landed property that had descended to him through a long line of ancestors from the plantagenets he looked down upon the whole race of farmers and traders as beings of a different species from himself and the indignation with which he heard from a lincolnshire farmer a proposal to purchase his heronry may perhaps be imagined but cannot be described it was in vain that marvel rose in his offers it was in vain that he declared he was ready to give any price that sir plantagenet would set upon the heronry sir plantagenet sent word by his steward that not a feather of his birds should be touched that he was astonished at the insolence of such a proposal and that he advised marvel to keep out of the way of his people lest they should revenge the insult that had been offered to their master this haughty answer and the disappointment of all his hopes and schemes respecting the heronry threw marvel into a degree of rage scarcely inferior to what was felt by sir plantagenet as he was galloping down the avenue from plantagenethall he overtook a young man of a shabby appearance who was mounted upon a very fine horse at first marvel took it for granted that he was one of sir plantagenets people and he was riding past him when he heard the stranger say in a friendly tone your horse gallops well sir but have a care theres a carrion a little way farther on that may startle him marvel pulled in his horse the stranger rode up beside him and they entered into conversation that carrion sir said he pointing to the dead horse which had just been shot for the baronets sons hounds that carrion sir was in my opinion the best horse sir plantagenet or his son either were possessed of tis a shame for any man who pretends to be a gentleman and who talks this way and that so high of his family should be so stingy in the article of horseflesh marvel was not unwilling at this instant to hear the haughty baronet blamed and ridiculed and his companion exactly fell in with his humour by telling a variety of anecdotes to prove sir plantagenet to be every thing that was odious and contemptible the history of his insolence about the heronry was now related by marvel and the stranger seemed to sympathize so much in his feelings that from a stranger he began to consider him as a friend insensibly the conversation returned to the point at which it commenced and his new friend observed that it was in vain to expect any thing good from any gentleman or indeed from any man who was stingy in the article of horseflesh a new sense of honour and of shame began to rise in our heros mind and he sat uneasy in his saddle whilst he reflected that the horse upon which he was mounted was perhaps as deservedly an object of contempt as any of sir plantagenets stud his new friend without seeming to notice his embarrassment continued his conversation and drew a tempting picture of the pleasures and glories of a horserace he said he was just training a horse for the york races and a finer animal never was crossed sir plantagenets eldest son would have been the proudest and happiest of men if his father would but have bought the horse for him but he had refused and the youth himself had not the price or half the price at his command our hero was no judge of horses but he was ambitious to prove that his spirit was superior to that of the haughty baronet and that something good might be expected from him as he was not stingy in horseflesh besides he was worked up to a high degree of curiosity to see the york races and his companion assured him that he could not appear there without being well mounted in short the hour was not at an end before he had offered a hundred guineas for the finest horse that ever was crossed he was charmed with the idea that he should meet sir plantagenet mowbrays son and heir at the york races and should show him that he was able and willing to pay for the horse which his arrogant father could not afford to purchase from the anecdote of the heronry his companion perceived that marvel was a man fond of projects and he proposed to him a scheme which caught his fancy so much that it consoled him for his disappointment it was the fault of our enterprizing heros character always to think the last scheme for making a fortune the best as soon as he reached home he was in haste to abandon some of his old projects which now appeared to him flat stale and unprofitable about a score of his flock though tainted with the rot were not yet dead he was eager to sell them but no one would buy sheep of such a wretched appearance at last wright took them off his hands i will throw the threescore jackets into the bargain said marvel for you are a generous fellow to offer so handsomely for my poor sheep and you deserve to be treated as you treat others if i come in at the end of the ten years for the legacy i shall remember you as i told you before as to my cousin goodenough here he thinks so much of himself that there is no occasion for others to think of him i asked him to join me in a bond yesterday for a hundred pounds just to try him and he refused me when i come in for the legacy i will cut him off with a shillingi will give him fair notice cut me off with what you will said goodenough sullenly not a farthing of my money shall ever be lent to one that has a project for every day in the year get into what difficulties you may i will never join you in any bond i promise you it is enough for me to take care of myself dont flatter yourself that i am getting into any difficulties replied marvel i wanted the hundred guineas only to pay for a horse and the friend who sold him to me will wait my convenience the friend said wright do you mean that man who rode home with you from spaldingi advise you not to make a friend of him for he is a notorious jockey he will not take me in though said marvel i am as sharp as he is and he sees that so we understand one another very well to my certain knowledge a hundred and twenty guineas could be had tomorrow for the horse i bought from him yet he let me have him for a hundred and how can a man of your sense cousin marvel said wright believe that a person who never saw you till within these three days would be so much your friend as to make you a present of twenty guineas a present yes if he lets you have a horse for a hundred which you can sell for a hundred and twenty does not he make you a present of twenty guineas well but i can tell you the reason for all that he wants me to enter into a scheme with him for breeding horses on the common here and so he would not at first setting out stand to higgle with me for the price of a horse and would you for twenty guineas cousin marvel run the hazard of joining in any scheme with a man of his character pray inquire in the country and in york where you are going what sort of a character this man bears take my advice pay him for his horse and have nothing more to do with him but i have not the ready cash to pay him for his horse thats one thing said marvel let that be no difficulty replied wright for i have a hundred guineas here just brought home from partney fair and they are heartily at your service goodenough twitched wrights elbow three times as he uttered these words but wright finished his sentence and put the money into marvels hands immediately upon his promising to pay for the horse break off all connexion with his friend the jockey if he should find upon inquiry that he was not a person of good character and at all events to suspend any treaty with him till after his return from york whilst you are gone said wright i will make inquiries about the profit of breeding of horses on the commons i have an acquaintance a sensible old man who has kept accounts of what he has done in that way himself and he will show us his accounts from which we shall be able to judge chapter ii wright heard nothing more of him for about a fortnight he then received the following letter dear cousin wright it is a very great pity that you could not be persuaded to come along with me to york races where i have seen more of life and of the world in a week than ever i did in all my life beforeyork is a surprising fine town and has a handsome cathedral and assemblyroom but i am not in the humour just now to describe them so i shall proceed to what is much better worth thinking of you must know cousin wright that i am in love and never was i so happy or so miserable in my days if i was not a farmer there would be some hopes for me but to be sure it is not to be expected that such a lady as she is should think of a mere country booby in which light indeed she was pleased to say as i heard from good authority she did not consider me though my manners wanted polish these were her own words i shall spare nothing to please her if possible and am not wholly without hope though i have a powerful rival no less a person than the eldest son and heir of sir plantagenet mowbray bart but her virtue will never i am persuaded suffer her to listen to such addresses as his now mine are honourable and pure as her soul the purity of which no one could doubt who had seen her last night as i did in the character of the fair penitent she was universally admired and another night sung and danced like an angel but i can give you no idea of her by pen and ink so i beseech you to come and see her and give your advice to me candidly for i have the highest opinion of your judgment and goodnature i find you were quite right about that scoundrel who rode with me from spalding he has arrested me for a hundred guineas and is without exception the shabbiest dog i ever met with but i am out of his clutches and have better friends i will tell you the whole story when we meet and pay you your hundred with many thanks pray set out as soon as you receive this for every moment is an age to me and i wont declare myself more than i have done if possible till you come for i have a great opinion of your judgment yet hope you wont put on your severe face nor be prejudiced against her because of her being on the stage leave such illiberality to cousin goodenough it would be quite beneath you pray bring with you that volume of old plays that is at the top of my bed under the bag of thistles or in the basket of reeds that i was making or in the outhouse where i keep the goosequills and feathers i dont find my memory so clear since my head is so full of this charming alicia barton pray make no delay as you value the peace of mind of your affectionate cousin and friend pierce marvel p s mr barton her brother is the most generous of men and the cleverest he is not averse to the match sir plantagenet mowbrays son and heir who is as insolent as his father may find that a lincolnshire farmer is not a person to be despised i have thoughts of selling my farm of cloverhill and of going into another way of life for which as mr barton said and alicia hinted nay as i am inclined to believe too i am much better suited than for farming of this more when we meet pray set out as soon as you receive this alicia has dark eyes and yet a fair complexion i am sure you will like her far from feeling sure that he should like miss alicia barton wright was so much alarmed for his cousin on the perusal of this letter that he resolved to set out immediately for york lest the sale of cloverhill should be concluded before his arrival a new project and a new love were indeed powerful temptations to one of marvels character as goodenough was plodding at his accustomed pace in his mornings work he met wright on horseback who asked him if he had any commissions that he could execute in york whither he was going none thank heaven said goodenough so i see it is as i always knew it would be marvel is ticing you into his own ways and will make you just such another as his self ay you must go to york races well so much the better for me much pleasure to you at the races i am not going to the races i am going to do marvel a service charity begins at home thats my maxim replied goodenough it is quite fitting that charity should begin at home said wright but then it should not end at home for those that help nobody will find none to help them in time of need those that help nobody will not be so apt to come to need replied goodenough but yonders my men standing idle if i but turn my head thats the way of them good morrow to you cousin wright i cant stand argufying here about charity which wont plough my ground nor bring me a jot nearer to the ten thousand pounds legacy so good morrow to you my service to cousin marvel goodenough proceeded to his men who were in truth standing idle as it was their custom to do when their masters eye was not as they thought upon them for he kept them so hard at work when he was present that not a labouring man in the country would hire himself to goodenough when he could get employment elsewhere goodenoughs partizans however observed that he got his moneys worth out of every man he employed and that this was the way to grow rich the question said they is not which of the three nephews will be the best beloved but which will be the richest at the end of ten years and on this ground who can dispute that goodenoughs maxim is the best charity begins at home wrights friends looked rather alarmed when they heard of this journey to york and marvels advocates though they put a good face upon the matter heartily wished him safe home upon wrights arrival in york he found it no easy matter to discover his cousin marvel for he had forgotten to date his letter and no direction was given to inn or lodging at last after inquiring at all the publichouses without success wright bethought himself of asking where miss alicia barton the actress lodged for there he would probably meet her lover mr harrison an eminent dyer to whom he applied for information very civilly offered to show him to the house wright had gained this dyers good opinion by the punctuality with which he had for three years past supplied him at the day and hour appointed with the quantity of woad for which he had agreed punctuality never fails to gain the good opinion of men of business as the dyer walked with wright to miss bartons lodgings they entered into conversation about her and wright asked what character she bore i know nothing of her character for my own share said harrison not being in that line of business but i think i could put you into a way of seeing her in her true colours whatever they may be for she is very intimate with a milliner whom my wife though not with my goodwill entirely visits in return for which i shall be glad that you will do my business along with your own and let me know if any thing is going wrong the dyer introduced wright to the milliner as a gentleman farmer who wanted to take home with him a fashionable cap and bonnet or two for some ladies in lincolnshire the milliner ordered down some dusty bandboxes which she protested and vowed were just arrived from london with the newest fashions and whilst she was displaying these wright talked of the races and the players and miss alicia barton is she as handsome as they say i have a huge curosity to see her said wright feigning more rusticity of manner and more simplicity than was natural to him i have truly a woundy curosity to see her ive heard so much of her even down in lincolnshire if you go to see the play sir you cant fail to have your curiosity gratified for miss barton plays tonightjenny reach me a playbillfor her own benefit and appears in her very best character the romp the rompodds is that her best character why now to my notion bads the best if that be the best of her characters the rompodds so what would our grandmothers say to that oh sir times are changed as well as fashions since our grandmothers days said the milliner put up this bonnet for the gentleman jennyi am sure i dont pretend to say any thing in favour of the times whatever i may of the fashions but as to fashion to be sure no one can be more fashionable here in york than miss barton all our gentlemen are dying for her odds my life ill keep out of her way and yet ive a huge curosity to set my eyes upon her pray now could i any way get to the sight or speech of her in a room or so for seeing a woman on the stage is one thing and seeing her off as i take it is another i take it so too sir jenny put up the cap for the gentleman and make out a bill no no the bonnets all i want which ill pay for on the nail wright took out a long purse full of guineas then put it up again and opened a pocketbook full of banknotes the milliners respect for him obviously increased jenny do run and see whos within there miss barton was trying on her dress i think half an hour ago may be shell pass through this way and the gentleman may have a sight of her since it weighs so much upon his mind let me put up the cap too sir its quite the fashion you may assure the lincolnshire ladiesoh heres miss barton miss barton made her appearance with all her most bewitching smiles and graces without seeming to notice wright she seated herself in a charming attitude and leaning pensively on the counter addressed her conversation to her friend the milliner but at every convenient pause she cast an inquiring glance at wright who stood with his long purse of guineas in his hand and his open pocketbook of banknotes before him as if he had been so much astonished by the ladys appearance that he could not recover his recollection now wright was a remarkably wellshaped handsome man and miss barton was in reality as much struck by his appearance as he feigned to be by hers no forbidding reserve condemned him to silence and as if inspired by the hope of pleasing he soon grew talkative this is the most rare town this your town of york said he i do not well know how i shall ever be able to get myself out of it so many fine sights my eyes be quite dazzled and pray sir which of all the fine sights do you like the best said the milliner oh the ladies be the finest of all the fine sights and i know who i think the finest lady i ever beheldbut will never tellnever never sir said the milliner whilst miss barton modestly cast down her eyes nevers a bold word sir ive a notion youll live to break that rash resolution miss barton sighed and involuntarily looked at the glass why wheres the use pursued wright of being laughed at wheres the sense of being scoffed at as a man might be that would go for to pay a compliment not well knowing how to a lady that is used to have court made to her by the first gentlemen in all york those that think they dont know how to pay a compliment often pay the best to my fancy said the milliner what says miss barton miss barton sighed and blushed or looked as if she meant to blush and then raising her wellpractised eyes exclaimed with theatrical tones and gestures ye sacred powrs whose gracious providence is watchful for our good guard me from men from their deceitful tongues their vows and flatteries still let me pass neglected by their eyes let my bloom wither and my form decay that none may think it worth their while to ruin me and fatal love may never be my bane scarcely had she concluded her speech when pierce marvel came breathless into the shop wright was standing so as to be completely hidden by the door and marvel not seeing his friend addressed himself as soon as he had breath to his mistressthe ladys manner changed and wright had an opportunity of seeing and admiring her powers of acting to marvel she was coy and disdainful i expect my friend and relation in town every hour said he to her in a low voice and then i shall be able to settle with your brother about the sale of cloverhill you half promised that you would walk with me this morning not without my brother excuse me sir said the coy lady withdrawing with the dignity of a princess when your friend arrives for whose advice i presume you wait you will be able to decide your heart mine cannot be influenced by base lucre or mercenary considerationsunhand me sir i will run immediately to the inn to see whether my friend is come cried marvel believe me i am as much above mercenary considerations as yourself but i have promised not to conclude upon the sale till he comes and he would take it ill to be sent for and then to be made a fool ofill run to the green man again immediately to see if he is come marvel darted out of the shop wright during this parley which lasted but a few seconds had kept himself snug in his hidingplace and appeared to the milliner to be wholly absorbed in casting up his bill in which there was a shilling wrong he came from behind the door as soon as marvel departed and saying that he would call for his purchases in an hours time left the milliners took a hackney coach and drove to the green man where he was now sure of meeting his cousin thank heaven you are come at last cried marvel the moment he saw him thank heaven you are come do not let us lose a moment if you are not tired if you are not hungry come along with me and ill introduce you to my charming alicia barton i am both tired and hungry replied wright so let us have a hot beefsteak and let me sit down and rest myself it was the utmost stretch of marvels patience to wait for the beefsteak and he could scarcely conceive how any one could prefer eating it to seeing his charming alicia he did not eat a morsel himself but walked up and down the room with quick steps oh my dear wright cried he it is a sign youve never seen her or you would eat a little faster does every body eat fast who has seen miss barton said wright then to be sure i should for i have seen her within this half hour seen her seen alicia seen her within this half hour thats impossiblehow could you see her where could you see her i saw her in your company rejoined wright coolly in my company how could that be without my seeing youyou are making a jest of me not at all only take care that you do not make a jest of yourself i assure you that i say nothing but truth ive seen you and your miss barton this very morning nay ill tell you what you said to her you told her that you could not sell cloverhill till i came to town marvel stared and stood in silent astonishment ay continued wright you see by this how many things may pass before a mans eyes and ears when he is in love without his seeing or hearing them why man i was in the milliners shop just now standing in the corner behind the door but you could see nothing but your charming miss barton i beg your pardon for being so blind said marvel laughing but you are too goodnatured to take offence though you dont know what it is to be in love there you are mistaken for i am as much in love as yourself at this instant then im undone cried marvel turning as pale as death why so said wright will you allow nobody man to be in love but yourself i dont see why i have not as good a right to fall in love as you have to be sure you have said marvel trying to recover himself and i cant say but what you deal fairly by me to tell me so honestly at once more fool i to send for you i might have foreseen this blockhead as i am but you deal fairly by me wright so i cannot complain and will not happen what may let him who can win her wear her we start fair for though i have had the advantage of a first acquaintance you are much the handsomer man of the two and that goes for a great deal with some ladies though not perhaps with alicia barton there perhaps you may find yourself mistaken replied wright with a significant look you dont say so you dont think so cried marvel with great emotion i say what i think and if i may trust a womans looks ive some reason for my thoughts marvel took up the tankard which stood on the table and swallowed down a hasty draught and then said though with an altered voice cousin wright let him who can win her wear her as i said before i shant quarrel with you if you deal fairly by me so tell me honestly did you never see her before this morning never as i am an honest man said wright then heres my hand for you said marvel alls fair and handsome on your part happen what may as i said before i will not quarrel with you if she was decreed to fall in love with you at first sight why thats no fault of yours and if she tells me so fairly why no great fault of hers she has encouraged me a little but still women will change their minds and i shall not call her a jilt if she speaks handsomely to me it will go a little to my heart at first no doubt but i shall bear it like a man i hope and i shall not quarrel with you cousin wright whatever else i do marvel shook wrights hand heartily but turned away directly afterwards to hide his agitation why now cousin marvel you are a good fellow thats the truth of it said wright trust to me and if the girl is what you think her you shall have her that i promise you thats more than you can promise being as you say as much in love as i am i say im more in love than you are but what then i ask you what then why we cannot both have alicia barton very true i would not have her if you would give her to me would not have her cried marvel with a look of joyous astonishment but did not you tell me you were in love with her not i you told it to yourself i said i was in love but cannot a man be in love with any woman in this whole world but miss barton marvel capered about the room with the most lively expressions of delight shook hands with his cousin as if he would have pulled his arm off and then suddenly stopping said but what do you think of my alicia though you are not in love with her i hope you think well of her i must see more of her before i am qualified to speak nay nay no drawbacks out with it i must know what you think of her at this time being at this time being then i think she is what they call acoquette oh there you are out indeed cousin wright shes more of what they call a prude than a coquette to you perhaps but not to me cousin let every one speak of her as they find replied wright marvel grew warm in defence of miss bartons prudery and at last ended by saying that hed stake his life upon it she was no jilt if she had taken a fancy to you wright she would honestly tell me so im convinced and when she finds you are thinking of another woman her pride would soon make her think no more of you tis but little she could have thought in the few minutes you were in her company and it is my opinion she never thought of you at allno offence no offence i promise you said wright but let us put her to the trial do you keep your own counsel go on courting her your own way and let me go mine dont you say one word of my being here in york but put her off about the sale of cloverhill till such time as you are sure of her heart to this proposal marvel joyfully agreed and as to the time of trial wright asked only one week his cousin then told him the new scheme from which he expected to make so much it had been suggested by alicias brother i am to sell cloverhill and with the money that i get for it barton and i are to build and fit up a theatre in lincoln and be the managers ourselves i assure you he says and they all say i should make a figure on the stage and miss barton whispered in my hearing that i should make a capital lothario added marvel throwing himself into a stage attitude and reciting in a voice that made wright start earth heavn and fair calista judge the combat very fine no doubt said wright but i am no judge of these matters only this i am sure of that with respect to selling cloverhill you had best go slowly to work and see what the sister is before you trust to the brother it is not for my interest i very well know to advise you against this scheme because if i wanted to make certain of your not coming in for my uncles legacy i could not take a better way than to urge you to follow your fancy for say that you lay out all you have in the world on the building of this playhouse and say that bartons as honest a man as yourself observe your playhouse cannot be built in less than a couple of years and the interest of your money must be dead all that time and pray how are you to bring yourself up by the end of the ten years consider there are but seven years of the time to come marvel gave his cousin hearty thanks for his disinterested advice but observed that actors and managers of playhouses were of all men they who were most likely to grow rich in a trice that they often cleared many hundreds in one night for their benefits that even if he should fail to hit the public taste himself as an actor he was sure at least if he married the charming alicia that she would be a source of inexhaustible wealth not added he that i think of her in that light for my soul is as much superior to mercenary considerations as her own more perhaps said wright but seeing fire flash in his cousins eyes at this insinuation he contented himself for the present with the promise he had obtained that nothing should be concluded till the end of one week that no mention should be made to miss barton or her brother of his arrival in town and that he should have free liberty to make trial of the ladys truth and constancy in any way he should think proper back to his friend the milliners he posted directly miss barton was gone out upon the raceground in captain mowbrays curricle in her absence wright was received very graciously by the milliner who had lodgings to let and who readily agreed to let them to him for a week as he offered half a guinea more than she could get from anybody else she fancied that he was deeply smitten with miss bartons charms and encouraged his passion by pretty broad hints that it was reciprocal miss barton drank tea this evening with the milliner wright was of the party and he was made to understand that others had been excluded for miss barton her friend observed was very nice as to her company many dexterous efforts were made to induce wright to lay open his heart for the dyers lady had been crossquestioned as to his property in lincolnshire and she being a lover of the marvellous had indulged herself in a little exaggeration so that he was considered as a prize and miss bartons imagination settled the matter so rapidly that she had actually agreed to make the milliner a handsome present on the weddingday upon this hint the milliner became anxious to push forward the affair marvel she observed hung back about the sale of his estate and as to sir plantagenet mowbrays son he was bound hand and foot by his father so could do nothing genteel besides honourable matrimony was out of the question there all these things considered the milliners decision was on perfectly prudential and virtuous motives in favour of wright miss bartons heart to use her own misapplied term spoke warmly in his favour for he was without any comparison the handsomest of her lovers and his simplicity and apparent ignorance of the world were rather recommendations than objections upon her second interview with him she had however some reason to suspect that his simplicity was not so great as she had imagined she was surprised to observe that notwithstanding all their artful hints wright came to nothing like a positive proposal nor even to any declaration of his passion the next day she was yet more astonished for wright though he knew she was a full hour in the milliners shop never made the slightest attempt to see her nay in the evening he met her on the public walk and passed without more notice than a formal bow and without turning his head back to look after her though she was flirting with a party of gentlemen expressly for the purpose of exciting his jealousy another consultation was held with her friend the milliner these men are terrible creatures to deal with said her confidant do you know my dear creature this man simple as he looks has been very near taking us in would you believe it he is absolutely courting a lincolnshire lady for a wife he wrote a letter to her my dear alicia this morning and begged me to let my boy run with it to the postoffice i winded and winded saying he was mighty anxious about the letter and so on till at the last out comes the truth then i touched him about you but he said an actress was not fit for a farmers wife and that you had too many admirers already you see my dear creature that he has none of the thoughts we built upon depend upon it he is a shrewd man and knows what he is about so as we cannot do better than marvel my advice your advice interrupted miss barton i shall follow no advice but my own she walked up and down the small parlour in great agitation do as you please my dear but remember i cannot afford to lay out of my money to all eternity the account between us has run up to a great sum the dresses were such as never were made up before in york and must be paid for accordingly as you must be sensible miss barton and when you have an opportunity of establishing yourself so handsomely and getting all your debts paid and when your brother who was here an hour ago presses the match with mr marvel so much it is very strange and unaccountable of you to say you will take nobodys advice but your own and to fall in love maam as you are doing as fast as you can with a person who has no serious intentions and is going to be married to another woman for shame miss barton is this behaving with proper propriety besides ive really great regard for that poor young man that you have been making a fool of im sure he is desperately in love with you then let him show it and sell cloverhill said miss barton her mind balanced between avarice and what she called love she had taken a fancy to wright and his present coldness rather increased than diminished her passion he played his part so well that she could not tell how to decide in the mean time the milliner pressed for her money and alicias brother bullied loudly in favour of marvel he had engaged the milliner whom he was courting to support his opinion marvel though with much difficulty stood his ground and refused to sell cloverhill till he should be perfectly sure that miss barton would marry him and till his relation should arrive in town and give his consent chapter iii mr barton and the milliner now agreed that if fair means would not bring the charming alicia to reason others must be used and it was settled that she should be arrested for her debt to the milliner which was upwards of fifty pounds she knows said this considerate brother that i have neither the power nor the will to pay the money sir plantagenets son is as poor as job so she must have recourse to marvel and if she gives him proper encouragement hell pay the money in a trice as to this man who lodges with you let her apply to him if she likes it she will soon see how he will answer her by your account he is a shrewd fellow and not like our friend marvel on friday morning the charming alicia was arrested at the suit of her dear friend and confidant the milliner the arrest was made in the milliners shop alicia would doubtless have screamed and fainted with every becoming spirit and grace if any spectators had been present but there was no one in the shop to admire or pity she rushed with dishevelled hair and all the stage show of distraction into wrights apartment but alas he was not to be found she then composed herself and wrote the following note to marvel to marvel esq c at the green man much as it hurts the delicacy and wounds the pride of alicia she is compelled by the perfidy of a bosom friend of her own sex to apply for assistance and protection to one who will feel for the indignity that has been shown her how will his generous nature shudder when he hears that she is on the point of being dragged to a loathsome dungeon for want of the paltry sum of fifty pounds retrospection may convince the man of her heart that her soul is superior to mercenary considerations else she would not now be reduced so low in the power of her enemies she scarcely knows what she writesher heart bleedsher brain is on fire celestial sounds peace dawns upon my soul and every pain grows less oh gentle altamont think not too hardly of me when im gone but pity me had i but early known thy wondrous worth thou excellent young man we had been happier both now tis too late and yet my eyes take pleasure to behold thee thou art their last dear objectmercy heavn your affectionate and shall i confess it too affectionate alicia marvel was settling some accounts with wright when this note was put into his hands scarcely had he glanced his eye over it when he started up seized a parcel of bank notes which lay on the table and was rushing out of the room wright caught hold of his arm and stopped him by force where now what now marvel said he do not stop me wright i will not be stopped she has been barbarously used they are dragging her to prisonthey have driven her almost out of her senses i must go to her this instant well well dont go without your hat man for the people in the street will take you for a lunatic may a friend see this letter that has driven you out of your senses marvel put it into wrights hands who read it with wonderful composure and when he came to the end of it only saidhum hum repeated marvel provoked beyond measure you have no humanity you are most strangely prejudiced you are worse than goodenough why do you follow me continued he observing that wright was coming after him across the innyard into the street i follow you to take care of you said wright calmly and though you do stride on at such a rate ill be bound to keep up with you he suffered marvel to walk on at his own pace for the length of two streets without saying another word but just as they were turning the corner into the square where the milliner lived he again caught hold of his cousins arm and said to him hark you marvel will you trust me with those bank notes that you have in your pocket and will you let me step on to the milliners and settle this business for you i see it will cost you fifty pounds but that i cannot help you may think yourself well off fifty pounds what are fifty pounds cried marvel hurrying forwards you see that my alicia must be superior to mercenary considerations for though she knows i have a good fortune that could not decide her in my favour no because she fancies that have a better fortune and besides for there are times when a man must speak plainly ive a notion she would at this minute sooner be my mistress than your wife if the thing were fairly tried shell take your money as fast as you please and i may take her as fast as i please incensed at these words marvel could scarcely restrain his passion within bounds but wright without being moved continued to speak nay then cousin if you dont believe me put it to the testill wait here at this woollendrapers where i am to dine do you go on to your milliners and say what you please only let me have my turn for half an hour this evening and if i am mistaken in the lady ill freely own it and make all due apology in the afternoon marvel came to wright with a face full of joy and triumph go to my alicia now cousin wright said he i defy you she is at her lodgingshe has promised to marry me i am the happiest man in the world wright said not a word but departed now he had in his pocket an unanswered billetdoux which had been laid upon his table the preceding night the billetdoux had no name to it but from all he had remarked of the ladys manners towards him he could not doubt that it was the charming alicias he was determined to have positive proof however to satisfy marvels mind completely the note which he had received was as follows what can be the cause of your cruel and sudden change towards one of whom you lately appeared to think so partially a certain female friend may deceive you by false representations do not trust to her but learn the real sentiments of a fond heart from one who knows not how to feign spare the delicacy of your victim and guess her name to this note from one who knew not how to feign wright sent the following reply if miss barton knows any thing of a letter that was left at mrs stokess the milliners last night she may receive an answer to her questions from the bearer who being no scholar hopes she will not take no offence at the shortness of these lines but satisfy him in the honour of drinking tea with her who waits below stairs for an answer the charming alicia allowed him the honour of drinking tea with her and was delighted with the thought that she had at last caught him in her snares the moment she had hopes of him she resolved to break her promise to marvel and by making a merit of sacrificing to wright all his rivals she had no doubt that she should work so successfully upon his vanity as to induce him to break off his treaty with the lincolnshire lady wright quickly let her go on with the notion that she had the game in her own hands at length he assumed a very serious look like one upon the point of forming some grand resolution and turning half away from her said but now look ye miss barton i am not a sort of man who would like to be made a fool of here im told half the gentlemen of york are dying for you and as your friend mrs stokes informed mrs stokes is not my friend but the basest and most barbarous of enemies cried alicia why now this is strange she was your friend yesterday and how do i know but a woman may change as quick and as short about her lovers as about her friends i never can change fear nothing said alicia tenderly but let me finish what i was saying about mrs stokes she told me something about one mr marvel i think they call him now what is all that nothing he is a foolish young man who was desperately in love with me thats all and offered to marry me but as i told him i am superior to mercenary considerations and is the affair broke off then said wright looking her full in the face thats in one word what i must be sure of for i am not a man that would choose to be jilted sit you down and pen me a farewell to that same foolish young fellow i am a plainspoken man and now you have my mind miss barton was now persuaded that all wrights coldness had proceeded from jealousy blinded by her passions and alarmed by the idea that this was the moment in which she must either secure or for ever abandon wright and his fortune she consented to his proposal and wrote the following tender adieu to marvel tomarvel esq c at the green man sir circumstances have occurred since i had last the honour of seeing you which make it impossible that i should ever think of you more alicia barton wright said he was perfectly satisfied with this note and all that he now desired was to be himself the bearer of it to marvel he is a hotheaded young man said alicia he will perhaps quarrel with you let me send the letter by a messenger of my own you dont know him you will not be able to find him out besides why will you deprive me of your company cannot another carry this note as well as you none shall carry it but myself said wright holding fast his prize she was apprehensive of losing him for ever if she opposed what she thought his jealous humour so she struggled no longer to hold him but bade him make haste to return to his alicia he returned no more but the next morning she received from him the following note to miss alicia barton c madam circumstances have occurred since i had last the honour of seeing you which make it impossible that i should ever think of you more john wright ps my cousin marvel thanks you for your note before you receive this he will have left york wiser than he came into it by fifty guineas and more wiser by more than fifty guineas i hope said marvel as he rode out of town early in the morning i have been on the point of being finely taken in im sure this will be a lesson to me as long as i live i shall never forget your goodnature and steadiness to me wright now if it had not been for you i might have been married to this jade and have given her and her brother every thing im worth in the world well well this is a lesson i shall remember ive felt it sharply enough now ill turn my head to my business again if i can how goodenough would laugh at me if he knew this story but ill make up for all the foolish things i have done yet before i die and i hope before i die i may be able to show you cousin wright how much i am obliged to you that would be greater joy to me even than getting by my own ingenuity my uncle pearsons ten thousand pound legacy do wright find out something i can do for you to make amends for all the trouble ive given you and all the time i have made you waste do theres a good fellow well then said wright i dont want to saddle you with an obligation you shall pay me in kind directly since you are so desirous of it i told you i was in love you shall come with me and see my mistress to give me your opinion of her every man can be prudent for his neighbour even you no doubt can added wright laughing wrights mistress was a miss banks only daughter to a gentleman who had set up an apparatus for manufacturing woad mr bankss house was in their way home and they called there they knocked several times at the door before any one answered at last a boy came to hold their horses who told them that mr banks was dead and that nobody could be let into the house the boy knew nothing of the matter except that his master died he believed of a sort of a fit and that his young mistress was in great grief which im mortal sorry for added he for she bes kind hearted and civil spoken and moreover did give me the very shoes i have on my feet i wish i could see her said wright i might be some comfort to her might ye so master if that the thing be so said the boy looking earnestly in wrights face ill do my best endeavours he ran off at full speed through the back yard but returned to learn the gentlemans name which he had forgotten to ask and presently afterwards he brought his answer it was written with a pencil and with a trembling hand my dear mr wright i cannot see you now but you shall hear from me as soon as i am able to give an answer to your last s banks the words my dear were half rubbed out but they were visible enough to his eyes wright turned his horses head homewards and marvel and he rode away his heart was so full that he could not speak and he did not hear what marvel said to comfort him as they were thus riding on slowly they heard a great noise of horsemen behind them and looking back they saw a number of farmers who were riding after them as they drew near wrights attention was roused by hearing the name of banks frequently repeated what news neighbour said marvel the news is that mr banks is dead he died of an apoplectic fit and has left his daughter a power o money they say happy the man who gets her good morrow to you gentlemen were in haste home after receiving this intelligence wright read his mistresss note over again and observed that he was not quite pleased to see the words my dear half rubbed out marvel exclaimed have nothing more to do with her thats my advice to you for i would not marry any woman for her fortune especially if she thought she was doing me a favour if she loved you she would not have rubbed out those words at such a time as this stay a bit said wright we shall be better able to judge by and by a week passed away and wright heard nothing from miss banks nor did he attempt to see her but waited as patiently as he could for her promised letter at last it came the first word was sir that was enough for marvel who threw it down with indignation when his cousin showed it to him nay but read it at least said wright sir my poor fathers affairs have been left in great disorder and instead of the fortune which you might have expected with me i shall have little or nothing the creditors have been very kind to me and i hope in time to pay all just debts i have been much hurried with business or should have written sooner indeed it is no pleasant task to me to write at all on this occasion i cannot unsay what i have said to you in former times for i think the same of you as ever i did but i know that i am not now a fit match for you as to fortune and would not hold any man to his word nor could value any man enough to marry him who would break it therefore it will be no grief for me to break off with you if such should be your desire and no blame shall be thrown upon you by my friends for i will take the refusal upon myself i know the terms of your uncles will and the great reason you have to wish for a good fortune with your wife so it is very naturali mean very likely you may not choose to be burdened with a woman who has none pray speak your mind freely to sir your humble servant s banks marvel had no sooner read this letter than he advised his friend wright to marry miss banks directly that is what i have determined to do said wright for i dont think money the first thing in the world and i would sooner give up my uncle pearsons legacy this minute than break my word to any woman much less to one that i love as i do miss banks better now than ever i have just heard from the steward who brought this letter how handsomely and prudently she has behaved to other people as well as to myself by which i can judge most safely she has paid all the debts that were justly due and has sold even the gig which i know she wished to keep but seeing that it was not suited to her present circumstances her good sense has got the better now to my mind a prudent wife even as to money matters may turn out a greater treasure to a man than what they call a great fortune with these sentiments wright married miss banks who was indeed a very prudent amiable girl goodenough sneered at this match and observed that he had always foretold wright would be taken in sooner or later goodenough was now in his thirtysecond year and as he had always determined to marry precisely at this age he began to look about for a wife he chose a widow said to be of a very close saving temper she was neither young handsome nor agreeable but then she was rich and it was goodenoughs notion that the main chance should be first considered in matrimony as in every thing else now this notable dame was precisely of his way of thinking but she had more shrewdness than her lover and she overreached him in the bargain her fortune did not turn out to be above one half of what report had represented it her temper was worse than even her enemies said it was and the time that was daily wasted in trifling disputes between this wellmatched pair was worth more than all the petty savings made by her avaricious habits goodenough cursed himself ten times a day during the honeymoon but as he did not like to let the neighbours know how far he had been outwitted he held his tongue with the fortitude of a martyr and his partisans all commended him for making so prudent a match ah ay said they theres wright who might have had this very woman has gone and married a girl without a shilling with all his prudence and as to marvel he will surely be bit there they were mistaken marvel was a person capable of learning from experience and he never forgot the lesson that he had received from the charming alicia it seemed to have sobered him completely chapter iv about this time mr james harrison an eminent dyer uncle to wrights friend of that name at york came to settle near cloverhill and as marvel was always inclined to be hospitable he assisted his new neighbour with many of those little conveniences which money cannot always command at the moment they are wanted the dyer was grateful and in return for marvels civilities let him into many of the mysteries of the dyeing business which he was anxious to understand scarcely a day passed without his calling on mr james harrison now mr harrison had a daughter lucy who was young and pretty and marvel thought her more and more agreeable every time he saw her but as he told wright he was determined not to fall in love with her until he was quite sure that she was good for something a few weeks after he had been acquainted with her he had an opportunity of seeing her tried mrs isaac harrison the dyer of yorks lady came to spend some time miss millicent or as she was commonly called milly harrison accompanied her mother she having a more fashionable air than lucy and having learned to dance from a london dancingmaster thought herself so much her superior that she ought to direct her in all things miss milly the sunday after her arrival appeared at church in a bonnet that charmed half the congregation and a crowd of farmers wives and daughters the moment church was over begged the favour of miss milly to tell them where and how such a bonnet could be got and how much it would cost it was extravagantly dear and those mothers who had any prudence were frightened at the price but the daughters were of opinion that it was the cheapest as well as prettiest thing that ever was seen or heard of and miss milly was commissioned to write immediately to york to bespeak fifteen bonnets exactly like her own this transaction was settled before they had left the churchyard and miss milly was leaning upon a tombstone to write down the names of those who were most eager to have their bonnets before the next sunday when wright and marvel came up to the place where the crowd was gathered and they saw what was going forward miss barber miss cotton miss lamb miss dishley miss trotter miss hull miss parker miss bury miss oxley c c c c c c c c c c c c all in their turn peeped anxiously over miss millys shoulder to make themselves sure that their names were in the happy list lucy harrison alone stood with a composed countenance in the midst of the agitated group well cousin lucy what say you now shall i bespeak a bonnet for you heydo you know cried miss milly turning to the admirers of her bonnet do you know that i offered to bespeak one yesterday for lucy and she was so stingy she would not let me because it was too dear too dear could ye conceive it repeated the young ladies joining in a scornful titter all eyes were now fixed upon lucy who blushed deeply but answered with gentle steadiness that she really could not afford to lay out so much money upon a bonnet and that she would rather not have her name put down in the list shes a good prudent girl whispered wright to marvel and very pretty i am sure i never saw her look so pretty as at this instant replied marvel in a low voice please yourself child said miss milly throwing back her head with much disdain but im sure youll please nobody else with such a dowdy thing as that you have on lord i should like to see her walk the streets of york on a sunday that figure lord how mrs stokes would laugh here she paused and several of her fair audience were struck with the terrible idea of being laughed at by a person whom they had never seen and whom they were never likely to see and transporting themselves in imagination into the streets of york felt all the horror of being stared at in an unfashionable bonnet by mrs stokes gracious me miss milly do pray be sure to have mine sent from york afore next sunday cried one of the country belles and gracious me dont forget mine miss mill was reiterated by every voice but lucys as the crowd followed miss harrison out of the churchyard great was the contempt felt for her by the company but she was proof against their ridicule and calmly ended as she began with saying i cannot afford it she is a very prudent girl repeated wright in a low voice to marvel but i hope this is not stinginess whispered marvel i would not marry such a stingy animal as goodenough has taken to wife for all the world do you know she has half starved the servant boy that lived with them there he is yonder getting over the stile did you ever see such a miserablelooking creaturehe can tell you fifty stories of dame goodenoughs stinginess i would not marry a stingy woman for the whole world i hope lucy harrison is not stingy pray mrs wright said marvels friend turning to his wife who had been standing beside him and who had not yet said one word what may your opinion be my opinion is that she is as generous a girl as any upon earth said mrs wright and i have good reason to say so how what said marvel eagerly her father lent my poor father five hundred pounds and at the meeting of the creditors after his death mr harrison was very earnest to have the money paid because it was his daughters fortune when he found that it could not be had immediately he grew extremely angry but lucy pacified him and told him that she was sure i should pay the money honestly as soon as i could and that she would willingly wait to have it paid at a hundred pounds a year for my convenience i am more obliged to her for the handsome way in which she trusted to me than if she had given me half the money i shall never forget it i hope you forgive her for not buying the bonnet said wright to marvel forgive her ay now i love her for it said marvel now i know that she is not stingy from this day forward marvels attachment to lucy rapidly increased one evening he was walking in the fields with lucy and miss milly who played off her finest york airs to attract his admiration when the following dialogue passed between them la cousin lucy said miss millicent when shall we get you to york i long to show you a little of the world and to introduce you to my friend mrs stokes the milliner my father says that he does not wish that i should be acquainted with mrs stokes said lucy your father nonsense child your father has lived all his life in the country the lord knows where he has not lived in york as i have so how can he know any thing upon earth of the worldwhat we call the world i mean i do not know cousin milly what you call the world but i think that he knows more of mrs stokes than i do and i shall trust to his opinion for i never knew him speak ill of any body without having good reason for it besides it is my duty to obey my father duty la gracious me she talks as if she was a baby in leadingstrings cried miss milly laughing but she was mortified at observing that marvel did not join as she had expected in the laugh so she added in a scornful tone perhaps im in the wrong box and that mr marvel is one of them that admires pretty babes in leadingstrings i am one of those that admire a good daughter i confess said marvel and said he lowering his voice that love her too miss milly coloured with anger and lucy with an emotion that she had never felt before as they returned home they met mr harrison and the moment marvel espied him he quitted the ladies ive something to say to you mr harrison i should be glad to speak a few words to you in private if you please cried he seizing his arm and leading him down a bylane mr harrison was all attention but marvel began to gather primroses instead of speaking well said mr harrison did you bring me here to see you gather primroses after smelling the flowers twenty times and placing them in twenty different forms marvel at last threw them on the bank and with a sudden effort exclaimed you have a daughter mr james harrison i know i have and i thank god for it so you have reason to do for a more lovely girl and a better in my opinion never existed one must not praise ones own or i should agree with you said the proud father again there was silence and again marvel picked up his primroses in short said he mr harrison would you like me for a soninlaw would lucy like you for a husband i must know that first said the good father that is what i do not know replied marvel but if i was to ask her she would ask you i am sure whether you would like me for a soninlaw at this rate we shall never get forwards said harrison go you back to miss milly and send my lucy here to me we shall not tell how lucy picked up the flowers which had been her lovers grand resource nor how often she blushed upon the occasion she acknowledged that she thought mr marvel very agreeable but that she was afraid to marry a person who had so little steadiness that she had heard of a great number of schemes undertaken by him which had failed or which he had given up as hastily as he had begun them besides said she may be he might change his mind about me as well as about other things for ive heard from my cousin millyive heardthathe was in love not very long since with an actress in york do you think this is all true yes i know it is all true said mr harrison for he told me so himself he is an honest openhearted young man but i think as you do child that we cannot be sure of his steadiness when marvel heard from mr harrison the result of this conversation he was inspired with the strongest desire to convince lucy that he was capable of perseverance to the astonishment of all who knew him or who thought that they knew him he settled steadily to business and for a whole twelvemonth no one heard him speak of any new scheme at the end of this time he renewed his proposal to lucy saying that he hoped she would now have some dependence upon his constancy to her since she had seen the power she had over his mind lucy was artless and affectionate as well as prudent now that her only real objection to the match was lessened she did not torment him to try her power but acknowledged her attachment to him and they were married sir plantagenet mowbrays agent was much astonished that lucy did not prefer him because he was a much richer man than pierce marvel and miss milly harrison was also astonished that mr marvel did not prefer her to such a country girl as lucy especially when she had a thousand pounds more to her fortune but notwithstanding all this astonishment marvel and his wife were perfectly happy it was now the fifth year after old mr pearsons death wright was at this time the richest of the three nephews for the money that he had laid out in draining holland fen began to bring him in twenty per cent as to marvel he had exchanged some of his finest acres for the warren of silver sprigs the common full of thistles and the marsh full of reeds he had lost many guineas by his sheep and their jackets and many more by his illfenced plantations so that counting all the losses from the failure of his schemes and the waste of his time he was a thousand pounds poorer than when he first came into possession of cloverhill goodenough was not according to the most accurate calculations one shilling richer or poorer than when he first began the world slow and sure said his friends fair and softly goes far in a day what he has hell hold fast thats more than marvel ever did and may be more than wright will do in the end he dabbles a little in experiments as he calls them this he has learned from his friend marvel and this will come to no good about this time there was some appearance of a scarcity in england and many farmers set an unusual quantity of potatoes in hopes that they would bear a high price the ensuing season goodenough who feared and hated every thing that was called a speculation declared that for his part he would not set a drill more than he used to do what had always done for him and his should do for him still with this resolution he began to set his potatoes marvel said to him whilst he was at work cousin goodenough i would advise you not to set the shoots that are at the bottom of these potatoes for if you do they wont be good for any thing this is a secret i learned last harvest home from one of my irish haymakers i made the experiment last year and found the poor fellow was quite right i have given him a guinea for his information and it will be worth a great deal more to me and my neighbours may be so said goodenough but i shall set my own potatoes my own way i thank you cousin marvel for i take it the old ways best and ill never follow any other marvel saw that it was in vain to attempt to convince goodenough therefore he left him to his old ways the consequence was that goodenongh and his family ate the worst potatoes in the whole country this year and marvel cleared above two hundred pounds by twenty acres of potatoes set according to his friend the irishmans directions this was the first speculation of marvels which succeeded because it was the first which had been begun with prudence and pursued with steadiness his information in the first instance was good it came from a person who had actually tried the experiment and who had seen it made by others and when he was convinced of the fact he applied his knowledge at the proper time boldly extended his experiment and succeeded this success raised him in the opinion even of his enemies his friend wright heartily rejoiced at it but goodenough sneered and said to wright what marvel has gained this year hell lose by some scheme the next i dare to say now he has some new scheme or another brewing in his brains at this very moment aylook here he comes with two bits of rags in his handnow for it marvel came up to them with great eagerness in his looks and showing two freshlydyed patterns of cloth said which of these two blues is the brightest that in your left hand said wright it is a beautiful blue marvel rubbed his hands with an air of triumph but restraining his joy he addressed himself to wright in a composed voice my dear wright i have many obligations to you and if i have any good fortune you shall be the first to share it with me as for you cousin goodenough i dont bear malice against you for laughing at me and my herons feathers and my silver sprigs and my sheeps jackets and my thistles shake hands man you shall have a share in our scheme if you please i dont please to have no share at all in none of your schemes cousin marvel i thank you kindly said goodenough had not you better hear what it is before you decide against it said wright marvel explained himself further some time ago said he i was with my fatherinlaw who was dyeing some cloth with woad i observed that one corner of the cloth was of much brighter blue than any of the rest and upon examining what could be the cause of this i found that the corner of the cloth had fallen upon the ground as it was taken out of the dyeing vat and had trailed through a mixture of colours which i had accidentally spilled on the floor i carefully recollected of what this mixture was composed i found that woad was the principal ingredient the otheris a secret i have repeated my experiments several times and i find that they have always succeeded i was determined not to speak of my discovery till i was sure of the facts now im sure of them my fatherinlaw tells me that he and his brother at york could ensure to me an advantageous sale for as much blue cloth as i can prepare and he advised me to take out a patent for the dye goodenough had not patience to listen any longer but exclaimed join in a patent thats more than i would do im sure cousin marvel so dont think to take me in ill end as i began without having any thing to do with any of your newfangled schemesgood morning to you i hope wright said marvel proudly that you do not suspect me of any design to take you in and that you will have some confidence in this scheme when you find that my experiments have been accurately tried wright assured marvel that he had the utmost confidence in his integrity and that he would carefully go over with him any experiments he chose to show him i do not want to worm your secret from you said he but we must make ourselves sure of success before we go to take out a patent which will be an expensive business you are exactly the sort of man i should wish to have for my partner cried marvel for you have all the coolness and prudence that i want and you have all the quickness and ingenuity that i want replied wright so between us we should indeed as you say make good partners a partnership was soon established between wright and marvel the woad apparatus which belonged to wrights fatherinlaw was given up to the creditors to pay the debts but none of these creditors understood the management of it or were willing to engage in it lest they should ruin themselves marvel prevailed upon wright to keep it in his own hands and the creditors who had been well satisfied by his wifes conduct towards them and who had great confidence in his character for prudence relinquished their claims upon the property and trusted to wrights promise that they should be gradually paid by instalments see what it is to have chosen a good wife said wright good character is often better than good fortune the wife returned the husbands compliment but we must pass over such unfashionable conversation and proceed with our story the reader may recollect our mentioning a little boy who carried a message from wright to miss banks the day that he called upon her on his return from york she had been very good to this boy and he was of a grateful temper after he left her fathers service he was hired by a gentleman who lived near spalding and for some time she had heard nothing of him but about a year after she was married his master paid a visit in lincolnshire and the lad early one morning came to see his old young mistress he came so very early that none of the family were stirring except marvel who had risen by daybreak to finish some repairs that he was making in the woad apparatus he recognized the boy the moment he saw him and welcomed him with his usual goodnature ah sir said the lad i bes glad to see things going on here again i bes main glad to hear how young mistress is happy but i must be back afore my own present master bes up so will you be pleased to give my sarvice and duty and heres a little sort of a teachest for her that i made with the help of a fellowsarvant of mine if so be shell think well of taking it i should be very proud it has a lock and key and all marvel was astonished at the workmanship of this teachest and when he expressed his admiration the boy said oh sir all the difficultest parts were done by my fellowsarvant who is more handy like than i am ten to one though he is a frenchman he was one of them french prisoners and is a curious man he would have liked of all things to have come here along with me this morning to get a sight of whats going on here because that they have woad mills and the like in his own country he says but then he would not come spying without leave being a civil honest man marvel told the boy that his fellowservant should be heartily welcome to satisfy his curiosity and the next morning the frenchman came he was a native of languedoc where woad is cultivated he had been engaged in the manufacture of it and marvel soon found by his conversation that he was a wellinformed intelligent man he told marvel that there were many natives of languedoc at this time prisoners in england who understood the business as well as he did and would be glad to be employed or to sell their knowledge at a reasonable price marvel was not too proud to learn even from a frenchman with wrights consent he employed several of these workmen and he carried by their means the manufacture of woad to a high pitch of perfection how success changes the opinion of men the lincolnshire farmers who had formerly sneered at marvel as a genius and a projector began to look up to him as to a very wise and knowing man when they saw this manufactory continue to thrive and those who had blamed wright for entering into partnership with him now changed their minds neither of them could have done separately what they both effected by their union at the end of the ten years goodenough was precisely where he was when he began neither richer nor poorer neither wiser nor happier all that he had added to his stock was a cross wife and two cross children he to the very last moment persisted in the belief that he should be the richest of the three and that wright and marvel would finish by being bankrupts he was in unutterable astonishment when upon the appointed day they produced their accountbooks to mr constantine the executor and it was found that they were many thousand pounds better in the world than himself now gentlemen said mr constantine to which of you am i to give your uncles legacy i must know which of the partners has the greatest share in the manufactory wright has the greatest share cried marvel for without his prudence i should have been ruined marvel has the greatest share cried wright for without his ingenuity i should never have succeeded in the business nor indeed should i have undertaken it then gentlemen you must divide the legacy between you said mr constantine and i give you joy of your happy partnership what can be more advantageous than a partnership between prudence and justice on the one side and generosity and abilities on the other june the limerick gloves chapter i it was sunday morning and a fine day in autumn the bells of hereford cathedral rang and all the world smartly dressed were flocking to church mrs hill mrs hillphoebe phoebe theres the cathedral bell i say and neither of you ready for church and i a verger cried mr hill the tanner as he stood at the bottom of his own staircase im ready papa replied phoebe and down she came looking so clean so fresh and so gay that her stern fathers brows unbent and he could only say to her as she was drawing on a new pair of gloves child you ought to have had those gloves on before this time of day before this time of day cried mrs hill who was now coming down stairs completely equipped before this time of day she should know better i say than to put on those gloves at all more especially when going to the cathedral the gloves are very good gloves as far as i see replied mr hill but no matter now it is more fitting that we should be in proper time in our pew to set an example as becomes us than to stand here talking of gloves and nonsense he offered his wife and daughter each an arm and set out for the cathedral but phoebe was too busy in drawing on her new gloves and her mother was too angry at the sight of them to accept of mr hills courtesy what i say is always nonsense i know mr hill resumed the matron but i can see as far into a millstone as other folks was it not i that first gave you a hint of what became of the great dog that we lost out of our tanyard last winter and was it not i who first took notice to you mr hill verger as you are of the hole under the foundation of the cathedral was it not i ask you mr hill but my dear mrs hill what has all this to do with phoebes gloves are you blind mr hill dont you see that they are limerick gloves what of that said mr hill still preserving his composure as it was his custom to do as long as he could when he saw his wife was ruffled what of that mr hill why dont you know that limerick is in ireland mr hill with all my heart my dear yes and with all your heart i suppose mr hill you would see our cathedral blown up some fair day or other and your own daughter married to the person that did it and you a verger mr hill god forbid cried mr hill and he stopped short and settled his wig presently recovering himself he added but mrs hill the cathedral is not yet blown up and our phoebe is not yet married no but what of that mr hill forewarned is forearmed as i told you before your dog was gone but you would not believe me and you see how it turned out in that case and so it will in this case youll see mr hill but you puzzle and frighten me out of my wits mrs hill said the verger again settling his wig in that case and in this case i cant understand a syllable of what youve been saying to me this half hour in plain english what is there the matter about phoebes gloves in plain english then mr hill since you can understand nothing else please to ask your daughter phoebe who gave her those gloves phoebe who gave you those gloves i wish they were burnt said the husband whose patience could endure no longer who gave you those cursed gloves phoebe papa answered phoebe in a low voice they were a present from mr brian oneill the irish glover cried mr hill with a look of terror yes resumed the mother very true mr hill i assure you now you see i had my reasons take off the gloves directly i order you phoebe said her father in his most peremptory tone i took a mortal dislike to that mr brian oneill the first time i ever saw him hes an irishman and thats enough and too much for me off with the gloves phoebe when i order a thing it must be done phoebe seemed to find some difficulty in getting off the gloves and gently urged that she could not well go into the cathedral without them this objection was immediately removed by her mothers pulling from her pocket a pair of mittens which had once been brown and once been whole but which were now rent in sundry places and which having been long stretched by one who was twice the size of phoebe now hung in huge wrinkles upon her wellturned arms but papa said phoebe why should we take a dislike to him because he is an irishman cannot an irishman be a good man the verger made no answer to this question but a few seconds after it was put to him observed that the cathedral bell had just done ringing and as they were now got to the church door mrs hill with a significant look at phoebe remarked that it was no proper time to talk or think of good men or bad men or irishmen or any men especially for a vergers daughter we pass over in silence the many conjectures that were made by several of the congregation concerning the reason why miss phoebe hill should appear in such a shameful shabby pair of gloves on a sunday after service was ended the verger went with great mystery to examine the hole under the foundation of the cathedral and mrs hill repaired with the grocers and the stationers ladies to take a walk in the close where she boasted to all her female acquaintance whom she called her friends of her maternal discretion in prevailing upon mr hill to forbid her daughter phoebe to wear the limerick gloves in the mean time phoebe walked pensively homewards endeavouring to discover why her father should take a mortal dislike to a man at first sight merely because he was an irishman and why her mother had talked so much of the great dog which had been lost last year out of the tanyard and of the hole under the foundation of the cathedral what has all this to do with my limerick gloves thought she the more she thought the less connexion she could perceive between these things for as she had not taken a dislike to mr brian oneill at first sight because he was an irishman she could not think it quite reasonable to suspect him of making away with her fathers dog nor yet of a design to blow up hereford cathedral as she was pondering upon these matters she came within sight of the ruins of a poor womans house which a few months before this time had been burnt down she recollected that her first acquaintance with her lover began at the time of this fire and she thought that the courage and humanity he showed in exerting himself to save this unfortunate woman and her children justified her notion of the possibility that an irishman might be a good man the name of the poor woman whose house had been burnt down was smith she was a widow and she now lived at the extremity of a narrow lane in a wretched habitation why phoebe thought of her with more concern than usual at this instant we need not examine but she did and reproaching herself for having neglected it for some weeks past she resolved to go directly to see the widow smith and to give her a crown which she had long had in her pocket with which she had intended to have bought play tickets it happened that the first person she saw in the poor widows kitchen was the identical mr oneill i did not expect to see any body here but you mrs smith said phoebe blushing so much the greater the pleasure of the meeting to me i mean miss hill said oneill rising and putting down a little boy with whom he had been playing phoebe went on talking to the poor woman and after slipping the crown into her hand said she would call again oneill surprised at the change in her manner followed her when she left the house and said it would be a great misfortune to me to have done any thing to offend miss hill especially if i could not conceive how or what it was which is my case at this present speaking and as the spruce glover spoke he fixed his eyes upon phoebes ragged gloves she drew them up in vain and then said with her natural simplicity and gentleness you have not done any thing to offend me mr oneill but you are some way or other displeasing to my father and mother and they have forbid me to wear the limerick gloves and sure miss hill would not be after changing her opinion of her humble servant for no reason in life but because her father and mother who have taken a prejudice against him are a little contrary no replied phoebe i should not change my opinion without any reason but i have not yet had time to fix my opinion of you mr oneill to let you know a piece of my mind then my dear miss hill resumed he the more contrary they are the more pride and joy it would give me to win and wear you in spite of em all and if without a farthing in your pocket so much the more i should rejoice in the opportunity of proving to your dear self and all else whom it may consarn that brian oneill is no fortunehunter and scorns them that are so narrowminded as to think that no other kind of cattle but them there fortunehunters can come out of all ireland so my dear phoebe now we understand one another i hope you will not be paining my eyes any longer with the sight of these odious brown bags which are not fit to be worn by any christian arms to say nothing of miss hills which are the handsomest without any compliment that ever i saw and to my mind would become a pair of limerick gloves beyond any thing and i expect shell show her generosity and proper spirit by putting them on immediately you expect sir repeated miss hill with a look of more indignation than her gentle countenance had ever before been seen to assume expect if he had said hope thought she it would have been another thing but expect what right has he to expect now miss hill unfortunately was not sufficiently acquainted with the irish idiom to know that to expect in ireland is the same thing as to hope in england and when her irish admirer said i expect he meant only in plain english i hope but thus it is that a poor irishman often for want of understanding the niceties of the english language says the rudest when he means to say the civillest things imaginable miss hills feelings were so much hurt by this unlucky i expect that the whole of his speech which had before made some favourable impression upon her now lost its effect and she replied with proper spirit as she thought you expect a great deal too much mr oneill and more than ever i gave you reason to do it would be neither pleasure nor pride to me to be won and worn as you were pleased to say in spite of them all and to be thrown without a farthing in my pocket upon the protection of one who expects so much at first setting outso i assure you sir whatever you may expect i shall not put on the limerick gloves mr oneill was not without his share of pride and proper spirit nay he had it must be confessed in common with some others of his countrymen an improper share of pride and spirit fired by the ladys coldness he poured forth a volley of reproaches and ended by wishing as he said a good morning for ever and ever to one who could change her opinion point blank like the weathercock i am miss your most obedient and i expect youll never think no more of poor brian oneill and the limerick gloves if he had not been in too great a passion to observe any thing poor brian oneill would have found out that phoebe was not a weathercock but he left her abruptly and hurried away imagining all the while that it was phoebe and not himself who was in a rage thus to the horseman who is galloping at full speed the hedges trees and houses seem rapidly to recede whilst in reality they never move from their places it is he that flies from them and not they from him on monday morning miss jenny brown the perfumers daughter came to pay phoebe a morning visit with face of busy joy so my dear said she fine doings in hereford but what makes you look so downcast to be sure you are invited as well as the rest of us invited where cried mrs hill who was present and who could never endure to hear of an invitation in which she was not included invited where pray miss jenny la have not you heard why we all took it for granted that you and miss phoebe would have been the first and foremost to have been asked to mr oneills ball ball cried mrs hill and luckily saved phoebe who was in some agitation the trouble of speaking why this is a mighty sudden thing i never heard a tittle of it before well this is really extraordinary and phoebe have you not received a pair of limerick gloves yes i have said phoebe but what then what have my limerick gloves to do with the ball a great deal replied jenny dont you know that a pair of limerick gloves is as one may say a ticket to this ball for every lady that has been asked has had a pair sent to her along with the card and i believe as many as twenty besides myself have been asked this morning jenny then produced her new pair of limerick gloves and as she tried them on and showed how well they fitted she counted up the names of the ladies who to her knowledge were to be at this ball when she had finished the catalogue she expatiated upon the grand preparations which it was said the widow oneill mr oneills mother was making for the supper and concluded by condoling with mrs hill for her misfortune in not having been invited jenny took her leave to get her dress in readiness for added she mr oneill has engaged me to open the ball in case phoebe does not go but i suppose she will cheer up and go as she has a pair of limerick gloves as well as the rest of us there was a silence for some minutes after jennys departure which was broken by phoebe who told her mother that early in the morning a note had been brought to her which she had returned unopened because she knew from the handwriting of the direction that it came from mr oneill we must observe that phoebe had already told her mother of her meeting with this gentleman at the poor widows and of all that had passed between them afterwards this openness on her part had softened the heart of mrs hill who was really inclined to be goodnatured provided people would allow that she had more penetration than any one else in hereford she was moreover a good deal piqued and alarmed by the idea that the perfumers daughter might rival and outshine her own whilst she had thought herself sure of mr oneills attachment to phoebe she had looked higher especially as she was persuaded by the perfumers lady to think that an irishman could not be a bad match but now she began to suspect that the perfumers lady had changed her opinion of irishmen since she did not object to her own jennys leading up the ball at mr oneills all these thoughts passed rapidly in the mothers mind and with her fear of losing an admirer for her phoebe the value of that admirer suddenly rose in her estimation thus at an auction if a lot is going to be knocked down to a lady who is the only person that has bid for it even she feels discontented and despises that which nobody covets but if as the hammer is falling many voices answer to the question who bids more then her anxiety to secure the prize suddenly rises and rather than be outbid she will give far beyond its value why child said mrs hill since you have a pair of limerick gloves and since certainly that note was an invitation to us to this ball and since it is much more fitting that you should open the ball than jenny brown and since after all it was very handsome and genteel of the young man to say he would take you without a farthing in your pocket which shows that those were misinformed who talked of him as an irish adventurer and since we are not certain twas he made away with the dog although he said its barking was a great nuisance there is no great reason to suppose he was the person who made the hole under the foundation of the cathedral or that he could have such a wicked thought as to blow it up and since he must be in a very good way of business to be able to afford giving away four or five guineas worth of limerick gloves and balls and suppers and since after all it is no fault of his to be an irishman i give it as my vote and opinion my dear that you put on your limerick gloves and go to this ball and ill go and speak to your father and bring him round to our opinion and then ill pay the morning visit i owe to the widow oneill and make up your quarrel with brian love quarrels are easy to make up you know and then we shall have things all upon velvet again and jenny brown need not come with her hypocritical condoling face to us anymore after running this speech glibly off mrs hill without waiting to hear a syllable from poor phoebe trotted off in search of her consort it was not however quite so easy a task as his wife expected to bring mr hill round to her opinion he was slow in declaring himself of any opinion but when once he had said a thing there was but little chance of altering his notions on this occasion mr hill was doubly bound to his prejudice against our unlucky irishman for he had mentioned with great solemnity at the club which he frequented the grand affair of the hole under the foundation of the cathedral and his suspicions that there was a design to blow it up several of the club had laughed at this idea others who supposed that mr oneill was a roman catholic and who had a confused notion that a roman catholic must be a very wicked dangerous being thought that there might be a great deal in the vergers suggestions and observed that a very watchful eye ought to be kept upon this irish glover who had come to settle at hereford nobody knew why and who seemed to have money at command nobody knew how the news of this ball sounded to mr hills prejudiced imagination like the news of a conspiracy ay ay thought he the irishman is cunning enough but we shall be too many for him he wants to throw all the good sober folks of hereford off their guard by feasting and dancing and carousing i take it and so to perpetrate his evil designs when it is least suspected but we shall be prepared for him fools as he takes us plain englishmen to be i warrant in consequence of these most shrewd cogitations our verger silenced his wife with a peremptory nod when she came to persuade him to let phoebe put on the limerick gloves and go to the ball to this ball she shall not go and i charge her not to put on those limerick gloves as she values my blessing said mr hill please to tell her so mrs hill and trust to my judgment and discretion in all things mrs hill strange work may be in hereford yet but ill say no more i must go and consult with knowing men who are of my opinion he sallied forth and mrs hill was left in a state which only those who are troubled with the disease of excessive curiosity can rightly comprehend or compassionate she hied her back to phoebe to whom she announced her fathers answer and then went gossipping to all her female acquaintance in hereford to tell them all that she knew and all that she did not know and to endeavour to find out a secret where there was none to be found there are trials of temper in all conditions and no lady in high or low life could endure them with a better grace than phoebe whilst mr and mrs hill were busied abroad there came to see phoebe one of the widow smiths children with artless expressions of gratitude to phoebe this little girl mixed the praises of oneill who she said had been the constant friend of her mother and had given her money every week since the fire happened mammy loves him dearly for being so goodnatured continued the child and he has been good to other people as well as to us to whom said phoebe to a poor man who has lodged for these few days past next door to us replied the child i dont know his name rightly but he is an irishman and he goes out ahaymaking in the daytime along with a number of others he knew mr oneill in his own country and he told mammy a great deal about his goodness as the child finished these words phoebe took out of a drawer some clothes which she had made for the poor womans children and gave them to the little girl it happened that the limerick gloves had been thrown into this drawer and phoebes favourable sentiments of the giver of those gloves were revived by what she had just heard and by the confession mrs hill had made that she had no reasons and but vague suspicions for thinking ill of him she laid the gloves perfectly smooth and strewed over them whilst the little girl went on talking of mr oneill the leaves of a rose which she had worn on sunday mr hill was all this time in deep conference with those prudent men of hereford who were of his own opinion about the perilous hole under the cathedral the ominous circumstance of this ball was also considered the great expense at which the irish glover lived and his giving away gloves which was a sure sign he was not under any necessity to sell them and consequently a proof that though he pretended to be a glover he was something wrong in disguise upon putting all these things together it was resolved by these overwise politicians that the best thing that could be done for hereford and the only possible means of preventing the immediate destruction of its cathedral would be to take mr oneill into custody upon recollection however it was perceived that there was no legal ground on which he could be attacked at length after consulting an attorney they devised what they thought an admirable mode of proceeding our irish hero had not that punctuality which english tradesmen usually observe in the payment of bills he had the preceding year run up a long bill with a grocer in hereford and as he had not at christmas cash in hand to pay it he had given a note payable six months after date the grocer at mr hills request made over the note to him and it was determined that the money should be demanded as it was now due and that if it was not paid directly oneill should be that night arrested how mr hill made the discovery of this debt to the grocer agree with his former notion that the irish glover had always money at command we cannot well conceive but anger and prejudice will swallow down the grossest contradictions without difficulty when mr hills clerk went to demand payment of the note oneills head was full of the ball which he was to give that evening he was much surprised at the unexpected appearance of the note he had not ready money by him to pay it and after swearing a good deal at the clerk and complaining of this ungenerous and ungentlemanlike behaviour in the grocer and the tanner he told the clerk to be gone and not to be bothering him at such an unseasonable time that he could not have the money then and did not deserve to have it at all this language and conduct were rather new to the english clerks mercantile ears we cannot wonder that it should seem to him as he said to his master more the language of a madman than a man of business this want of punctuality in money transactions and this mode of treating contracts as matters of favour and affection might not have damned the fame of our hero in his own country where such conduct is alas too common but he was now in a kingdom where the manners and customs are so directly opposite that he could meet with no allowance for his national faults it would be well for his countrymen if they were made even by a few mortifications somewhat sensible of this important difference in the habits of irish and english traders before they come to settle in england but to proceed with our story on the night of mr oneills grand ball as he was seeing his fair partner the perfumers daughter safe home he felt himself tapped on the shoulder by no friendly hand when he was told that he was the kings prisoner he vociferated with sundry strange oaths which we forbear to repeat no i am not the kings prisoner i am the prisoner of that shabby rascally tanner jonathan hill none but he would arrest a gentleman in this way for a trifle not worth mentioning miss jenny brown screamed when she found herself under the protection of a man who was arrested and what between her screams and his oaths there was such a disturbance that a mob gathered among this mob there was a party of irish haymakers who after returning late from a hard days work had been drinking in a neighbouring alehouse with one accord they took part with their countryman and would have rescued him from the civil officers with all the pleasure in life if he had not fortunately possessed just sufficient sense and command of himself to restrain their party spirit and to forbid them as they valued his life and reputation to interfere by word or deed in his defence he then despatched one of the haymakers home to his mother to inform her of what had happened and to request that she would get somebody to be bail for him as soon as possible as the officers said they could not let him out of their sight till he was bailed by substantial people or till the debt was discharged the widow oneill was just putting out the candles in the ballroom when this news of her sons arrest was brought to her we pass over hibernian exclamations she consoled her pride by reflecting that it would certainly be the most easy thing imaginable to procure bail for mr oneill in hereford where he had so many friends who had just been dancing at his house but to dance at his house she found was one thing and to be bail for him quite another each guest sent excuses and the widow oneill was astonished at what never fails to astonish every body when it happens to themselves rather than let my son be detained in this manner for a paltry debt cried she id sell all i have within half an hour to a pawnbroker it was well no pawnbroker heard this declaration she was too warm to consider economy she sent for a pawnbroker who lived in the same street and after pledging goods to treble the amount of the debt she obtained ready money for her sons release oneill after being in custody for about an hour and a half was set at liberty upon the payment of his debt as he passed by the cathedral in his way home he heard the clock strike and he called to a man who was walking backwards and forwards in the churchyard to ask whether it was two or three that the clock struck three answered the man and as yet all is safe oneill whose head was full of other things did not stop to inquire the meaning of these last words he little suspected that this man was a watchman whom the overvigilant verger had stationed there to guard the hereford cathedral from his attacks oneill little guessed that he had been arrested merely to keep him from blowing up the cathedral this night the arrest had an excellent effect upon his mind for he was a young man of good sense it made him resolve to retrench his expenses in time to live more like a glover and less like a gentleman and to aim more at establishing credit and less at gaining popularity he found from experience that good friends will not pay bad debts chapter ii on thursday morning our verger rose in unusually good spirits congratulating himself upon the eminent service he had done to the city of hereford by his sagacity in discovering the foreign plot to blow up the cathedral and by his dexterity in having the enemy held in custody at the very hour when the dreadful deed was to have been perpetrated mr hills knowing friends farther agreed it would be necessary to have a guard that should sit up every night in the churchyard and that as soon as they could by constantly watching the enemys motions procure any information which the attorney should deem sufficient grounds for a legal proceeding they should lay the whole business before the mayor after arranging all this most judiciously and mysteriously with friends who were exactly of his own opinion mr hill laid aside his dignity of verger and assuming his other character of a tanner proceeded to his tanyard what was his surprise and consternation when he beheld his great rick of oak bark levelled to the ground the pieces of bark were scattered far and wide some over the close some over the fields and some were seen swimming upon the water no tongue no pen no muse can describe the feelings of our tanner at this spectacle feelings which became the more violent from the absolute silence which he imposed on himself upon this occasion he instantly decided in his own mind that this injury was perpetrated by oneill in revenge for his arrest and went privately to the attorney to inquire what was to be done on his part to secure legal vengeance the attorney unluckily or at least as mr hill thought unluckily had been sent for half an hour before by a gentleman at some distance from hereford to draw up a will so that our tanner was obliged to postpone his legal operations we forbear to recount his return and how many times he walked up and down the close to view his scattered bark and to estimate the damage that had been done to him at length that hour came which usually suspends all passions by the more imperious power of appetitethe hour of dinner an hour of which it was never needful to remind mr hill by watch clock or dial for he was blessed with a punctual appetite and powerful as punctual so powerful indeed that it often excited the spleen of his more genteel or less hungry wifebless my stars mr hill she would oftentimes say i am really downright ashamed to see you eat so much and when company is to dine with us i do wish you would take a snack by way of a damper before dinner that you may not look so prodigious famishing and ungenteel upon this hint mr hill commenced a practice to which he ever afterwards religiously adhered of going whether there was to be company or no company into the kitchen regularly every day half an hour before dinner to take a slice from the roast or the boiled before it went up to table as he was this day according to his custom in the kitchen taking his snack by way of a damper he heard the housemaid and the cook talking about some wonderful fortuneteller whom the housemaid had been consulting this fortuneteller was no less a personage than the successor to bampfylde moore carew king of the gipsies whose life and adventures are probably in many too many of our readers hands bampfylde the second king of the gipsies assumed this title in hopes of becoming as famous or as infamous as his predecessor he was now holding his court in a wood near the town of hereford and numbers of servantmaids and prentices went to consult himnay it was whispered that he was resorted to secretly by some whose education might have taught them better sense numberless were the instances which our verger heard in his kitchen of the supernatural skill of this cunning man and whilst mr hill ate his snack with his wonted gravity he revolved great designs in his secret soul mrs hill was surprised several times during dinner to see her consort put down his knife and fork and meditate gracious me mr hill what can have happened to you this day what can you be thinking of mr hill that can make you forget what you have upon your plate mrs hill replied the thoughtful verger our grandmother eve had too much curiosity and we all know it did not lead to good what i am thinking of will be known to you in due time but not now mrs hill therefore pray no questions or teasing or pumping what i think i think what i say i say what i know i know and that is enough for you to know at present only this phoebe you did very well not to put on the limerick gloves child what i know i know things will turn out just as i said from the first what i say i say and what i think i think and this is enough for you to know at present having finished dinner with this solemn speech mr hill settled himself in his armchair to take his afterdinners nap and he dreamed of blowing up cathedrals and of oak bark floating upon the waters and the cathedral was he thought blown up by a man dressed in a pair of womans limerick gloves and the oak bark turned into mutton steaks after which his great dog jowler was swimming when all on a sudden as he was going to beat jowler for eating the bark transformed into mutton steaks jowler became bampfylde the second king of the gipsies and putting a horsewhip with a silver handle into hills hand commanded him three times in a voice as loud as the town criers to have oneill whipped through the marketplace of hereford but just as he was going to the window to see this whipping his wig fell off and he awoke it was difficult even for mr hills sagacity to make sense of this dream but he had the wise art of always finding in his dreams something that confirmed his waking determinations before he went to sleep he had half resolved to consult the king of the gipsies in the absence of the attorney and his dream made him now wholly determined upon this prudent step from bampfylde the second thought he i shall learn for certain who made the hole under the cathedral who pulled down my rick of bark and who made away with my dog jowler and then i shall swear examinations against oneill without waiting for attorneys i will follow my own way in this business i have always found my own way best so when the dusk of the evening increased our wise man set out towards the wood to consult the cunning man bampfylde the second king of the gipsies resided in a sort of hut made of the branches of trees the verger stooped but did not stoop low enough as he entered this temporary palace and whilst his body was almost bent double his peruke was caught upon a twig from this awkward situation he was relieved by the consort of the king and he now beheld by the light of some embers the person of his gipsy majesty to whose sublime appearance this dim light was so favourable that it struck a secret awe into our wise mans soul and forgetting hereford cathedral and oak bark and limerick gloves he stood for some seconds speechless during this time the queen very dexterously disencumbered his pocket of all superfluous articles when he recovered his recollection he put with great solemnity the following queries to the king of the gipsies and received the following answers do you know a dangerous irishman of the name of oneill who has come for purposes best known to himself to settle at hereford yes we know him well indeed and what do you know of him that he is a dangerous irishman right and it was he was it not that pulled down or caused to be pulled down my rick of oak bark it was and who was it that made away with my dog jowler that used to guard the tanyard it was the person that you suspect and was it the person whom i suspect that made the hole under the foundation of our cathedral the same and no other and for what purpose did he make that hole for a purpose that must not be named replied the king of the gipsies nodding his head in a mysterious manner but it may be named to me cried the verger for i have found it out and i am one of the vergers and is it not fit that a plot to blow up the hereford cathedral should be known to me and through me now take my word wise men of hereford none in safety may be till the bad man doth flee these oracular verses pronounced by bampfylde with all the enthusiasm of one who was inspired had the desired effect upon our wise man and he left the presence of the king of the gipsies with a prodigiously high opinion of his majestys judgment and of his own fully resolved to impart the next morning to the mayor of hereford his important discoveries now it happened that during the time mr hill was putting the foregoing queries to bampfylde the second there came to the door or entrance of the audience chamber an irish haymaker who wanted to consult the cunning man about a little leathern purse which he had lost whilst he was making hay in a field near hereford this haymaker was the same person who as we have related spoke so advantageously of our hero oneill to the widow smith as this man whose name was paddy mcormack stood at the entrance of the gipsies hut his attention was caught by the name of oneill and he lost not a word of all that passed he had reason to be somewhat surprised at hearing bampfylde assert it was oneill who had pulled down the rick of bark by the holy poker said he to himself the old fellow now is out there i know more o that matter than he doesno offence to his majesty he knows no more of my purse ill engage now than he does of this mans rick of bark and his dog so ill keep my tester in my pocket and not be giving it to this king o the gipsies as they call him who as near as i can guess is no better than a cheat but there is one secret which i can be telling this conjuror himself he shall not find it such an easy matter to do all what he thinks he shall not be after ruining an innocent countryman of my own whilst paddy mcormack has a tongue and brains now paddy mcormack had the best reason possible for knowing that mr oneill did not pull down mr hills rick of bark it was mcormack himself who in the heat of his resentment for the insulting arrest of his countryman in the streets of hereford had instigated his fellow haymakers to this mischief he headed them and thought he was doing a clever spirited action there is a strange mixture of virtue and vice in the minds of the lower class of irish or rather a strange confusion in their ideas of right and wrong from want of proper education as soon as poor paddy found out that his spirited action of pulling down the rick of bark was likely to be the ruin of his countryman he resolved to make all the amends in his power for his folly he went to collect his fellow haymakers and persuaded them to assist him this night in rebuilding what they had pulled down they went to this work when every body except themselves as they thought was asleep in hereford they had just completed the stack and were all going away except paddy who was seated at the very top finishing the pile when they heard a loud voice cry out here they are watch watch immediately all the haymakers who could ran off as fast as possible it was the watch who had been sitting up at the cathedral who gave the alarm paddy was taken from the top of the rick and lodged in the watchhouse till morning since im to be rewarded this way for doing a good action sorrow take me said he if they catch me doing another the longest day ever i live happy they who have in their neighbourhood such a magistrate as mr marshal he was a man who to an exact knowledge of the duties of his office joined the power of discovering truth from the midst of contradictory evidence and the happy art of soothing or laughing the angry passions into goodhumour it was a common saying in herefordthat no one ever came out of justice marshals house as angry as he went into it mr marshal had scarcely breakfasted when he was informed that mr hill the verger wanted to speak to him on business of the utmost importance mr hill the verger was ushered in and with gloomy solemnity took a seat opposite to mr marshal sad doings in hereford mr marshal sad doings sir sad doings why i was told we had merry doings in hereford a ball the night before last as i heard so much the worse mr marshal so much the worse as those think with reason that see as far into things as i do so much the better mr hill said mr marshal laughing so much the better as those think with reason that see no farther into things than i do but sir said the verger still more solemnly this is no laughing matter nor time for laughing begging your pardon why sir the night of that there diabolical ball our hereford cathedral sir would have been blown upblown up from the foundation if it had not been for me sir indeed mr verger and pray how and by whom was the cathedral to be blown up and what was there diabolical in this ball here mr hill let mr marshal into the whole history of his early dislike to oneill and his shrewd suspicions of him the first moment he saw him in hereford related in the most prolix manner all that the reader knows already and concluded by saying that as he was now certain of his facts he was come to swear examinations against this villanous irishman who he hoped would be speedily brought to justice as he deserved to justice he shall be brought as he deserves said mr marshal but before i write and before you swear will you have the goodness to inform me how you have made yourself as certain as you evidently are of what you call your facts sir that is a secret replied our wise man which i shall trust to you alone and he whispered into mr marshals ear that his information came from bampfylde the second king of the gipsies mr marshal instantly burst into laughter then composing himself said my good sir i am really glad that you have proceeded no farther in this business and that no one in hereford beside myself knows that you were on the point of swearing examinations against a man on the evidence of bampfylde the second king of the gipsies my dear sir it would be a standing joke against you to the end of your days a grave man like mr hill and a verger too why you would be the laughingstock of hereford now mr marshal well knew the character of the man to whom he was talking who above all things on earth dreaded to be laughed at mr hill coloured all over his face and pushing back his wig by way of settling it showed that he blushed not only all over his face but all over his head footnote the following passage is an extract from colquhoun on the police of the metropolis page an instance of mischievous credulity occasioned by consulting this impostor a man calling himself an astrologer who practised long in the curtainroad shoreditch london and who is said in conjunction with his associates to have made near l a year by practising on the credulity of the lower order of the people fell lately under the review of a police magistrate a person having property stolen from him went to consult the conjuror respecting the thief who having described something like the person of a man whom he suspected his credulity and folly so far got the better of his reason and reflection as to induce him upon the authority of this impostor actually to charge his neighbour with a felony and to cause him to be apprehended the magistrate settled the matter by discharging the prisoner reprimanding the accuser severely and ordering the conjuror to be taken into custody according to law as a rogue and a vagabond why mr marshal sir said he as to my being laughed at it is what i did not look for being as there are some men in hereford to whom i have mentioned that hole in the cathedral who have thought it no laughing matter and who have been precisely of my own opinion thereupon but did you tell these gentlemen that you had been consulting the king of the gipsies no sir no i cant say that i did then i advise you keep your own counsel as i will mr hill whose imagination wavered between the hole in the cathedral and his rick of bark on one side and between his rick of bark and his dog jowler on the other now began to talk of the dog and now of the rick of bark and when he had exhausted all he had to say upon these subjects mr marshal gently pulled him towards the window and putting a spyglass into his hand bid him look towards his own tanyard and tell him what he saw to his great surprise mr hill saw his rick of bark rebuilt why it was not there last night exclaimed he rubbing his eyes why some conjuror must have done this no replied mr marshal no conjuror did it but your friend bampfylde the second king of the gipsies was the cause of its being rebuilt and here is the man who actually pulled it down and who actually rebuilt it as he said these words mr marshal opened the door of an adjoining room and beckoned to the irish haymaker who had been taken into custody about an hour before this time the watch who took paddy had called at mr hills house to tell him what had happened but mr hill was not then at home it was with much surprise that the verger heard the simple truth from this poor fellow but no sooner was he convinced that oneill was innocent as to this affair than he recurred to his other ground of suspicion the loss of his dog the irish haymaker now stepped forward and with a peculiar twist of the hips and shoulders which those only who have seen it can picture to themselves said plase your honours honour i have a little word to say too about the dog say it then said mr marshal plase your honour if i might expect to be forgiven and let off for pulling down the jontlemans stack i might be able to tell him what i know about the dog if you can tell me any thing about my dog said the tanner i will freely forgive you for pulling down the rick especially as you have built it up again speak the truth now did not oneill make away with the dog not at all at all plase your honour replied the haymaker and the truth of the matter is i know nothing of the dog good or bad but i know something of his collar if your name plase your honour is hill as i take it to be my name is hill proceed said the tanner with great eagerness you know something about the collar of my dog jowler plase your honour this much i know any way that it is now or was the night before last at the pawnbrokers there below in town for plase your honour i was sent late at night that night that mr oneill long life to him was arrested to the pawnbrokers for a jew by mrs oneill poor creature she was in great trouble that same time very likely interrupted mr hill but go on to the collar what of the collar she sent meill tell you the story plase your honour out of the faceshe sent me to the pawnbrokers for the jew and it being so late at night the shop was shut and it was with all the trouble in life that i got into the house any way and when i got in there was none but a slip of a boy up and he set down the light that he had in his hand and ran up the stairs to waken his master and whilst he was gone i just made bold to look round at what sort of a place i was in and at the old clothes and rags and scraps there was a sort of a frieze trusty a trusty said mr hill what is that pray a big coat sure plase your honour there was a frieze big coat lying in a corner which i had my eye upon to trate myself to i having as i then thought money in my little purse enough for it well i wont trouble your honours honour with telling of you now how i lost my purse in the field as i found after but about the big coat as i was saying i just lifted it off the ground to see would it fit me and as i swung it round something plase your honour hit me a great knock on the shins it was in the pocket of the coat whatever it was i knew so i looks into the pocket to see what was it plase your honour and out i pulls a hammer and a dogcollar it was a wonder both together they did not break my shins entirely but its no matter for my shins now so before the boy came down i just out of idleness spelt out to myself the name that was upon the collar there were two names plase your honour and out of the first there were so many letters hammered out i could make nothing of it at all at all but the other name was plain enough to read any way and it was hill plase your honours honour as sure as life hill now this story was related in tones and gestures which were so new and strange to english ears and eyes that even the solemnity of our verger gave way to laughtermr marshal sent a summons for the pawnbroker that he might learn from him how he came by the dogcollar the pawnbroker when he found from mr marshal that he could by no other means save himself from being committed to prison confessed that the collar had been sold to him by bampfylde the second king of the gipsies a warrant was immediately despatched for his majesty and mr hill was a good deal alarmed by the fear of its being known in hereford that he was on the point of swearing examinations against an innocent man upon the evidence of a dogstealer and a gipsy bampfylde the second made no sublime appearance when he was brought before mr marshal nor could all his astrology avail upon this occasion the evidence of the pawnbroker was so positive as to the fact of his having sold to him the dogcollar that there was no resource left for bampfylde but an appeal to mr hills mercy he fell on his knees and confessed that it was he who stole the dog which used to bark at him at night so furiously that he could not commit certain petty depredations by which as much as by telling fortunes he made his livelihood and so said mr marshal with a sternness of manner which till now he had never shown to screen yourself you accused an innocent man and by your vile arts would have driven him from hereford and have set two families for ever at variance to conceal that you had stolen a dog the king of the gipsies was without farther ceremony committed to the house of correction we should not omit to mention that on searching his hut the irish haymakers purse was found which some of his majestys train had emptied the whole set of gipsies decamped upon the news of the apprehension of their monarch mr hill stood in profound silence leaning upon his walkingstick whilst the committal was making out for bampfylde the second the fear of ridicule was struggling with the natural positiveness of his temper he was dreadfully afraid that the story of his being taken in by the king of the gipsies would get abroad and at the same time he was unwilling to give up his prejudice against the irish glover but mr marshal cried he after a long silence the hole under the foundation of the cathedral has never been accounted for that is was and ever will be an ugly mystery to me and i never can have a good opinion of this irishman till it is cleared up nor can i think the cathedral in safety what said mr marshal with an arch smile i suppose the verses of the oracle still work upon your imagination mr hill they are excellent in their kind i must have them by heart that when i am asked the reason why mr hill has taken an aversion to an irish glover i may be able to repeat them now take my word wise men of hereford none in safety may be till the bad man doth flee youll oblige me sir said the verger if you would never repeat those verses sir nor mention in any company the affair of the king of the gipsies i will oblige you replied mr marshal if you will oblige me will you tell me honestly whether now that you find this mr oneill is neither a dogkiller nor a puller down of bark ricks you feel that you could forgive him for being an irishman if the mystery as you call it of the hole under the cathedral was cleared up but that is not cleared up i say sir cried mr hill striking his walkingstick forcibly upon the ground with both his hands as to the matter of his being an irishman i have nothing to say to it i am not saying any thing about that for i know we all are born where it pleases god and an irishman may be as good as another i know that much mr marshal and i am not one of those illiberalminded ignorant people that cannot abide a man that was not born in england ireland is now in his majestys dominions i know very well mr marshal and i have no manner of doubt as i said before that an irishman born may be as good almost as an englishman born i am glad said mr marshal to hear you speak almost as reasonably as an englishman born and every man ought to speak and i am convinced that you have too much english hospitality to persecute an inoffensive stranger who comes amongst us trusting to our justice and good nature i would not persecute a stranger god forbid replied the verger if he was as you say inoffensive and if he was not only inoffensive but ready to do every service in his power to those who are in want of his assistance we should not return evil for good should we that would be uncharitable to be sure and moreover a scandal said the verger then said mr marshal will you walk with me as far as the widow smiths the poor woman whose house was burnt last winter this haymaker who lodged near her can show us the way to her present abode during his examination of paddy mcormack who would tell his whole history as he called it out of the face mr marshal heard several instances of the humanity and goodness of oneill which paddy related to excuse himself for that warmth of attachment to his cause that had been manifested so injudiciously by pulling down the rick of bark in revenge for the arrest amongst other things paddy mentioned his countrymans goodness to the widow smith mr marshal was determined therefore to see whether he had in this instance spoken the truth and he took mr hill with him in hopes of being able to show him the favourable side of oneills character things turned out just as mr marshal expected the poor widow and her family in the most simple and affecting manner described the distress from which they had been relieved by the good gentleman and lady the lady was phoebe hill and the praises that were bestowed upon phoebe were delightful to her fathers ear whose angry passions had now all subsided the benevolent mr marshal seized the moment when he saw mr hills heart was touched and exclaimed i must be acquainted with this mr oneill i am sure we people of hereford ought to show some hospitality to a stranger who has so much humanity mr hill will you dine with him tomorrow at my house mr hill was just going to accept of this invitation when the recollection of all he had said to his club about the hole under the cathedral came across him and drawing mr marshal aside he whispered but sir sir that affair of the hole under the cathedral has not been cleared up yet at this instant the widow smith exclaimed oh here comes my little mary one of her children who came running in this is the little girl sir to whom the lady has been so good make your curtsy child where have you been all this while mammy said the child ive been showing the lady my rat lord bless her gentlemen the child has been wanting me this many a day to go to see this tame rat of hers but i could never get time never and i wondered too at the childs liking such a creature tell the gentlemen dear about your rat all i know is that let her have but never such a tiny bit of bread for breakfast or supper she saves a little of that little for this rat of hers she and her brothers have found it out somewhere by the cathedral it comes out of a hole under the wall of the cathedral said one of the elder boys and we have diverted ourselves watching it and sometimes we have put victuals for it so it has grown in a manner tame like mr hill and mr marshal looked at one another during this speech and the dread of ridicule again seized on mr hill when he apprehended that after all he had said the mountain might at last bring fortha rat mr marshal who instantly saw what passed in the vergers mind relieved him from this fear by refraining even from a smile on this occasion he only said to the child in a grave manner i am afraid my dear we shall be obliged to spoil your diversion mr verger here cannot suffer ratholes in the cathedral but to make you amends for the loss of your favourite i will give you a very pretty little dog if you have a mind the child was well pleased with this promise and at mr marshals desire she then went along with him and mr hill to the cathedral and they placed themselves at a little distance from that hole which had created so much disturbance the child soon brought the dreadful enemy to light and mr hill with a faint laugh said im glad its no worse but there were many in our club who were of my opinion and if they had not suspected oneill too i am sure i should never have given you so much trouble sir as i have done this morning but i hope as the club know nothing about that vagabond that king of the gipsies you will not let any one know any thing about the prophecy and all that i am sure i am very sorry to have given you so much trouble mr marshal mr marshal assured him that he did not regret the time which he had spent in endeavouring to clear up all these mysteries and suspicions and mr hill gladly accepted his invitation to meet oneill at his house the next day no sooner had mr marshal brought one of the parties to reason and goodhumour than he went to prepare the other for a reconciliation oneill and his mother were both people of warm but forgiving tempers the arrest was fresh in their minds but when mr marshal represented to them the whole affair and the vergers prejudices in a humorous light they joined in the goodnatured laugh and oneill declared that for his part he was ready to forgive and to forget every thing if he could but see miss phoebe in the limerick gloves phosbe appeared the next day at mr marshals in the limerick gloves and no perfume ever was so delightful to her lover as the smell of the rose leaves in which they had been kept mr marshal had the benevolent pleasure of reconciling the two families the tanner and the glover of hereford became from bitter enemies useful friends to each other and they were convinced by experience that nothing could be more for their mutual advantage than to live in union nov out of the debt out of danger chapter i leonard ludgate was the only son and heir of a london haberdasher who had made some money by constant attendance to his shop out of debt out of danger was the fathers oldfashioned saying the sons more liberal maxim was spend today and spare tomorrow whilst he was under his fathers eye it was not in his power to live up to his principles and he longed for the time when he should be relieved from his post behind the counter a situation which he deemed highly unworthy a youth of his parts and spirit to imprison his elegant person behind a counter in cranbournealley was to be sure in a cruel fathers power but his tyranny could not extend to his mind and whilst he was weighing minikin pins or measuring out penny ribbon his soul leaving all these meaner things was expatiating in bondstreet or hydepark whilst his fingers mechanically adjusted the scales or carelessly slipped the yard his imagination was galloping a fine bay with tom lewis or driving miss belle perkins in a gig now tom lewis was a dashing young citizen whom old ludgate could not endure and miss belle perkins a wouldbe fine lady whom he advised his son never to think of for a wife but the happy moment at length arrived when our hero could safely show how much he despised both the advice and the character of his father when he could quit his nook behind the counter throw aside the yard assume the whip and affect the fine gentleman in short the happy moment came when his father died leonard now shone forth in all the glory which the united powers of tailor hatter and hosier could spread around lug person miss belle perkins who had hitherto looked down upon our hero as a reptile of cranbournealley beheld his metamorphosis with surprise and admiration and she who had formerly been heard to say she would not touch him with a pair of tongs now unreluctantly gave him her envied hand at a ball at bagnigge wells report farther adds that at tea miss belle whispered loud enough to be heard that since his queer fathers death leonard ludgate had turned out quite a genteeler sort of person than could have been expected upon this hint he spake his fair one after assuming all proper and becoming airs upon the occasion suffered herself to be prevailed upon to call with her mother and a friend at mr ludgates house in cranbournealley to see whether it could be possibly inhabited by a lady of her taste and consequence as leonard handed her out of her hackneycoach she exclaimed bless us and be we to go up this paved lane and through the shop before we can get to the more creditabler apartments im going to cut a passage off the shop which ive long had in contemplation replied our hero only i cant get light into it cleverly oh a lamp in the style of a chandaleer will do vastly well by night which is the time one wants ones house to put the best foot foremost for company and by day we can make a shift somehow or other i dare say any things better than trapesing through a shop which is a thing ive never been used to and cannot reconcile myself to by any means leonard immediately acceded to this scheme of the dark passage by day and the chandaleer by night and he hurried his fair one through the odious shop to the more creditabler apartments she was handed above about and underneath she found every particle of the house wanted modernizing immensely and was altogether smaller than she could ever have conceived beforehand our hero ambitious at once to show his gallantry spirit and taste incessantly protested he would adopt every improvement miss belle perkins could suggest and he declared that the identical same ideas had occurred to him a hundred and a hundred times during his poor fathers lifetime but he could never make the old gentleman enter into any thing of the sort his notions of life being utterly limited to say no worse he had one old saw for ever grating in my ears as an answer to everything that bore the stamp of gentility or carried with it an air of spirit hey allen continued our hero looking over his shoulder at a young man who was casting up accounts hey allenyou remember the old saw yes sir replied the young man if you mean out of debt out of danger i hope i shall never forget it i hope so too as you have your fortune to make it is very proper for you but for one that has a fortune ready made to spend i am free to confess i think my principle worth a million of it and my maxim is spend today and spare tomorrow hey ladies concluded leonard appealing with an air secure of approbation to his fair mistress and her young companion why that suits my notions i must own candidly said belle but heres one beside me or behind mewhere are you lucy pursued the young lady addressing herself to her humble companion heres one who is more of your shopmans way of thinking than yours i fancy out of debt out of danger is just a sober saying to your mind ant it lucy lucy did not deny the charge well child said miss perkins its very proper for you have no fortune of your own to spend it is indeed said lucy with modest firmness for as i have none of my own if it were my maxim to spend today and spare tomorrow i should be obliged to spend other peoples money which i never will do as long as i can maintain myself independently how proud we are cried miss perkins sarcastically leonard assented to the sarcasm by his looks but allen declared he liked proper pride and seemed to think that lucys was of this species an argument might have ensued if a collation as mr ludgate called it had not appeared at this critical moment of what it consisted and how genteelly and gallantly our hero did the honours of his collation we forbear to relate but one material circumstance we must not omit as on this perhaps more than even on his gentility and gallantry depended the fortune of the day in rummaging over a desk to find a corkscrew young ludgate took occasion to open and shake a pocketbook from which fell a shower of bank notes what effect they produced upon his fair one and on her mother can be best judged of by the event miss belle perkins after this domiciliary visit consented to go with our hero on sunday to kensington gardens monday to sadlers wells tuesday on the water wednesday to the play thursday the lord knows to what ball friday to vauxhall and on saturday tothe altar some people thought the young lady and gentleman rather precipitate but these were persons who as the bride justly observed did not understand any thing in nature of a love match those who have more liberal notions and a more extensive knowledge of the human heart can readily comprehend how a lady may think a man so odious at one minute that she could not touch him with a pair of tongs and so charming the next that she would die a thousand deaths for him and him alone immediately after the ceremony was performed mr and mrs ludgate went down in the hoy to margate to spend their honeymoon in style their honeymoon alas could not be prolonged beyond the usual bounds even the joys of margate could not be eternal and the day came too soon when our happy pair were obliged to think of returning home home with what different sensations different people pronounce and hear that word pronounced mrs leonard ludgates home in cranbournealley appeared to her as she scrupled not to declare an intolerable low place after margate the stipulated alterations her husband observed had been made in the house but none of them had been executed to her satisfaction the expedient of the dark passage was not found to succeed a thorough wind from the front and back doors ran along it when either or both were left open to admit light and this wicked wind not content with running along the passage forced its way up and down stairs made the kitchen chimney smoke and rendered even the more creditabler apartments scarcely habitable chimney doctors were in vain consulted the favourite dark passage was at length abandoned and the lady to her utter discomfiture was obliged to pass through the shop to make herself amends for this mortification she insisted upon throwing down the partition between the diningroom and her own bedchamber that she might have one decent apartment at least fit for a rout it was to no purpose that her friend lucy who was called in to assist in making up furniture represented that this scheme of throwing bedchamber and diningroom into one would be attended with some inconveniences for instance that mr and mrs ludgate would be obliged in consequence of this improvement to sleep in half of the maids garret or to sit up all night this objection was overruled by mrs ludgate whose genius fertile in expedients made every thing easy by the introduction of a bed in the diningroom in the shape of a sofa the newlyenlarged apartment she observed would thus answer the double purposes of show and utility and as soon as the supper and card tables should be removed the sofabed might be let down she asserted that the first people in london manage in this way leonard could not contradict his lady because she had a ready method of silencing him by asking how he could possibly know any thing of life who had lived all his days except sundays in cranbournealley then if any one of his fathers old notions of economy by chance twinged his conscience belle very judiciously asked how he ever came to think of her for a wife since you have got a genteel wife said she it becomes you to live up to her notions and to treat her as she and her friends have a right to expect before i married you sir none of the perkinss were in trade themselves either directly or indirectly and manys the slights and reproaches ive met with from my own relations and former acquaintances since my marriage on account of the ludgates being all tradesfolks to which i always answer that my leonard is going to wash his hands of trade himself and to make over all concern in the haberdashery line and shop to the young man below stairs who is much better suited to such things by such speeches as these alternately piquing and soothing the vanity of her leonard our accomplished wife worked him to her purposes she had a rout once a week and her room was so crowded that there was scarcely a possibility of breathing yet notwithstanding all this she one morning declared with a burst of tears she was the most miserable woman in the world and why because her friend mrs pimlico miss coxeater that was had a house in weymouthstreet whilst she was forced to keep on being buried in cranbournealley mr ludgate was moved by his wifes tears and by his own ambition and took a house in weymouthstreet but before they had been there six weeks the fair one was again found bathed in tears and why because said belle because mr ludgate the furniture of this house is as old as methusalems and my friend mrs pimlico said yesterday that it was a shame to be seen and so to be sure it is compared with her own which is spick and span new yet why should she pretend to look down upon me in point of furniture or any thing who was she before she was married little kitty coxeater as we always called her at the dancing school and nobody ever thought of comparing her in point of gentility with belle perkins why she is as ugly as sin though she is my friend i must acknowledge that and if she had all the clothes in the world she would never know how to put any of them on thats one comfort and as every body says to be sure she never would have got a husband but for her money and after all what sort of a husband has she got a perfumer indeed a man with a face like one of his own washballs all manner of colours i declare i would rather have gone without to the end of my days than have married mr pimlico i cannot blame you there my dear said mr ludgate for to be sure mr pimlico much as he thinks of himself and his country house has as little the air ofthe air of fashion as can be well conceived leonard ludgate made an emphatic pause in this speech and surveyed himself in a lookingglass with much complacency whilst he pronounced the word fashion he indeed approved so much of his wifes taste and discernment in preferring him to mr pimlico that he could not at this moment help inclining to follow her judgment respecting the furniture he acceded to her position that the ludgates ought to appear at least no shabbier than the pimlicos the conclusion was inevitable leonard according to his favourite maxim of spend today and spare tomorrow agreed that they might new furnish the house this year and pay for it the next this was immediately done and the same principle was extended through all their household affairs as far as the tradesmen concerned would admit of its being carried into practice by this means mr and mrs ludgate were not for some time sensible of the difficulties they were preparing for themselves they went on vying with the pimlicos and with all their new acquaintance who were many of them much richer than themselves and of this vain competition there was no end those who estimate happiness not by the real comforts or luxuries which they enjoy but by comparison between themselves and their neighbours must be subject to continual mortification and discontent far from being happier than they were formerly mr and mrs ludgate were much more miserable after their removal to weymouthstreet was it not better to be the first person in cranbournealley than the last in weymouthstreet new wants and wishes continually arose in their new situation they must live like other people everybody that is everybody in weymouthstreet did so and so and therefore they must do the same they must go to such a place or they must have such a thing not because it was in itself necessary or desirable but because everybody that is everybody of their acquaintance did or had the same even to be upon a footing with their new neighbours was a matter of some difficulty and then merely to be upon an equality merely to be admitted and suffered at parties is awkward and humiliating noble ambition prompted them continually to aim at distinction the desire to attain il poco piuthe little more stimulates to excellence or betrays to ruin according to the objects of our ambition no artist ever took more pains to surpass raphael or correggio than was taken by mr and mrs ludgate to outshine mr and mrs pimlico and still what they had done seemed nothing what they were to do occupied all their thoughts no timid economical fears could stop or even startle them in the road to ruin faithful to his maxim our hero denied himself nothing if for a moment the idea that any thing was too expensive suggested itself his wife banished care by observing we need not pay for it now what signifies it since we need not think of paying for it till next year she had abundance of arguments of similar solidity adapted to all occasions sometimes the thing in question was such a trifle it could not ruin anybody tis but a guinea tis but a few shillings sometimes it was a sort of thing that could not ruin anybody because tis but for once and away tis but is a most dangerous thing how many guineas may be spent upon tis but in the course of one year in such a city as london bargains excellent bargains were also with our heroine admirable pleas for expense we positively must buy this my dear for it would be a sin to let such a bargain slip through ones fingers mrs pimlico paid twice as much for what is not half as good twould be quite a shame to ones good sense to miss such a bargain mrs ludgate was one of those ladies who think it is more reasonable to buy a thing because it is a bargain than because they want it she farther argued if we dont want it we may want it and this was a satisfactory plea under the head bargains we must not forget cheap days messrs run and raffle advertised a sale of old shop goods with the catching wordscheap days everybody crowded to throw away their money on cheap days and amongst the rest mrs ludgate one circumstance was rather disagreeable in these cheap days ready money was required and this did not suit those who lived by the favourite maxim of the family yet there was a reason that counterbalanced their objection in mrs ludgates mind mrs pimlico was going to messrs run and raffles and what would she think if i wasnt to be there shed think to be sure that we were as poor as job so to demonstrate that she had ready money to throw away mrs ludgate must go on the cheap days belle said her husband ready moneys a serious thing yes leonard but when nothing else will be taken you know one cant do without it but if one has not it i tell you one must do without it said leonard peevishly lord mr ludgate if you have not it about you cant you send to cranbournealley to mr allen for some for me tis but a few guineas i want and twould be a shame to miss such bargains as are to be had for nothing at run and raffles and these cheap days are extraordinary things it cant ruin any body to spend a guinea or two once and away like other people at the conclusion of her eloquent speech mrs ludgate rang the bell and without waiting for any assent from her husband but silence bade the footman run to the shop and desire allen to send her ten guineas immediately mr ludgate looked sullen whistled and then posted himself at the parlour window to watch for the ambassadors return i wonder continued mrs ludgate i wonder leonard that you let allen leave you so bare of cash of late it is very disagreeable to be always sending out of the house this way for odd guineas allen i think uses you very ill but i am sure i would not let him cheat me if i was you pray when you gave up the business of the shop to him was not you to have half the profits for your goodwill and name and all that yes and little enough but why dont you look after allen then and make him pay us what he owes us ill see about it tomorrow child about how much do you think is owing to us pursued mrs ludgate i cant tell maam i wish then youd settle accounts tomorrow that i might have some ready money the lady seemed to take it for granted that her having ready money would be the necessary and immediate consequence of settling accounts with allen her husband could have set her right in this particular and could have informed her that not a farthing was due to him that on the contrary he had taken up money in advance on the next half years expected profits but mr ludgate was ashamed to let his wife know the real state of his affairs indeed he was afraid to look them in the face himself heres the boy coming back cried he after watching for some time in silence at the window leonard went to the streetdoor to meet him and belle followed close crying well i hope allen has sent me the money i dont know said the breathless boy i have a letter for my master here that was written ready by good luck afore i got there leonard snatched the letter and his wife waited to see whether the money was enclosed the rascal has sent me no money i see but a letter and an account as long as my arm no money cried belle thats using us very oddly and ill indeed and i wonder you submit to such conduct i declare i wont bear it go back i say jack go run this minute and tell allen he must come up himself for i mrs ludgate wants to speak with him no my dear no nonsense dont go jack what signifies your sending to speak with allen what can you do how can you settle accounts with him what should women know of business i wish women would never meddle with things they dont understand women can understand well enough when they want money cried the sharp lady and the short and the long of it is mr ludgate that i will see and settle accounts with allen myself and bring him to reason if you wont and this minute too bless me upon my faith allens better than we thought heres banknotes within the account said mr ludgate ay i thought he could not be so very impertinent as to refuse when i sent to him myself but this is only one five pound note i sent for ten where is the other i want the other myself said her husband the tone was so peremptory that she dared not tempt him further and away she went to messrs run and raffles where she had the pleasure of buying a bargain of things that were of no manner of use to her and for which she paid twice as much as they were worth these cheap days proved dear days to many whilst mrs ludgate spent the morning at messrs run and raffles her husband was with tom lewis lounging up and down bondstreet tom lewis being just one step above him in gentility was invited to parties where ludgate could not gain admittance was bowed to by people who never bowed to leonard ludgate could tell to whom this livery or that carriage belonged knew who everybody was and could point out my lord this and my lady that in the park or at the play all these things made him a personage of prodigious consequence in the eyes of our hero who looked upon him as the mirror of fashion tom knew how to take advantage of this admiration and borrowed many a guinea from him in their morning walks in return he introduced mr ludgate to some of his friends and to his club new occasions or rather new necessities for expense occurred every day in consequence of his connexion with lewis whilst he aimed at being thought a young man of spirit he could not avoid doing as other people did he could not think of economy that would be shabby on his fortune rested his claims to respect from his present associates and therefore it was his constant aim to raise their opinion of his riches for some time extravagance was not immediately checked by the want of money because he put off the evil day of payment at last when bills poured in upon him and the frequent calls of tradesmen began to be troublesome he got rid of the present difficulty by referring them to allen go to allen he must settle with you he does all my business allen sent him account after account stating the sums he paid by his order ludgate thrust the unread accounts into his escritoire and thought no more of the matter allen called upon him to beg he would come to some settlement as he was getting more and more every day into his debt leonard desired to have an account stated in full and promised to look over it on monday but monday came and then it was put off till tuesday and so on day after day the more reason he had to know that his affairs were deranged the more carefully he concealed all knowledge of them from his wife her ignorance of the truth not only led her daily into fresh extravagance but was at last the cause of bringing things to a premature explanation after spending the morning at messrs run and raffles she returned home with a hackneycoach full of bargains as she came into the parlour loaded with things that she did not want she was surprised by the sight of an old friend whom she had lately treated entirely as a stranger it was lucy who had in former days been her favourite companion but lucy had chosen to work to support herself independently rather than to be a burden to her friends and mrs ludgate could not take notice of a person who had degraded herself so far as to become a workwoman at an upholsterers she had consequently never seen lucy since this event took place except when she went to mr beech the upholsterers to order her new furniture she then was in company with mrs pimlico and when she saw lucy at work in a back parlour with two or three other young women she pretended not to know her lucy could scarcely believe that this was done on purpose and at all events she was not mortified by the insult she was now come to speak to mrs ludgate about the upholsterers bill ha lucy is it you said mrs ludgate as soon as she entered ive never seen you in weymouthstreet before how comes it you never called if it was only to see our new house im sure i should always be very happy to have you herewhen weve nobody with us and im quite sorry as i cant ask you to stay and take a bit of mutton with us today because im engaged to dine in bondstreet with mrs pimlicos cousin pretty mrs paget the bride whom youve heard talk of no doubt so youll excuse me if i run away from you to make myself a little decent for its horrid late after running off this speech with an air and a volubility worthy of her betters she set before lucy some of her bargains and was then retreating to make herself decent but lucy stopped her by saying my dear mrs ludgate i am sorry to detain you but mr beech the upholsterer knowing i have been acquainted with you has sent me to speak to you about his bill he is in immediate want of money because he is fitting out one of his sons for the east indies well but his sons nothing to me i shant think of paying the bill yet i can assure him and you may take it back and tell him so but said lucy if i take back such an answer i am afraid mr beech will send the bill to mr ludgate and that was what you particularly desired should not be done why no thats what i cant say i should particularly wish just at present said mrs ludgate lowering her tone because to tell you a bit of a secret lucy ive run up rather an unconsciable bill this year with my milliner and mantuamaker and i would not have all them bills come upon him all in a lump and on a sudden as it were especially as i laid out more on the furniture than he counts so my dear lucy ill tell you what you must do you must use your influence with beech to make him wait a little longer im sure he may wait well enough and he shall be paid next month lucy declared that her influence on the present occasion would be of no avail but she had the goodnature to add if you are sure the bill can be paid next month i will leave my two years salary in mr beechs hands till then and this will perhaps satisfy him if he can get bills from other people paid to make up the money for his son he said thirty guineas from you on account would do for the present and that sum is due to me then my dearest lucy for heavens sake do leave it in his hands you were a good creature to think of it but you always were a good creature your mother used to be kind to me when i was a child and i am sure i ought not to forget it said lucy the tears starting into her eyes and you were once kind to me i do not forget that continued lucy wiping the tears from her cheeksbut do not let me detain you you are in a hurry to dress to go to mrs pimlicos noprayi am not in a hurry now said mrs ludgate who had the grace to blush at this instant but if you must go do take this hat along with you i assure you its quite the rage i got it this morning at run and raffles and mrs pimlico and mrs paget have got the same lucy declined accepting the hat notwithstanding this strong and as mrs ludgate would have thought it irresistible recommendation now you must have it it will become you a thousand times better than that you have on cried mrs ludgate insisting the more the more lucy withdrew and besides you must wear it for my sake you wont then i take it very ill of you that you are so positive for i assure you whatever you may think i wish to be as kind to you now as ever only you know one cant always when one lives in another style be at home as often as one wishes lucy relieved her cidevant friend from the necessity of making any more awkward apologies by moving quickly towards the door then you wont forget continued mrs ludgate following her into the passage you wont forget the job you are to do for me with beech certainly i shall not i will do what i have promised but i hope you will be punctual about the payment next month said lucy because i believe i shall be in want of my money at that time it is best to tell you exactly the truth certainly certainly you shall have your money before you want it long and long and my only reason for borrowing it from you at all is that i dont like to trouble mr ludgate till he has settled accounts with allen who keeps all our money from us in a strange way and in my opinion uses leonard exceedingly ill and unfairly allen cried lucy stopping short oh belle how can you say so how can you think so but you know nothing of him else you could not suspect him of using any one ill or unfairly much less your husband the son of his old friend bless me how she runs on and how she colours i am sure i didnt know i was upon such tender ground i did not know allen was such a prodigious favourite i only do him justice in saying that i am certain he could not do an unfair or unhandsome action i know nothing of the matter i protest only thisthat short accounts they say make long friends and i hope i shant affront any body by saying it would be very convenient if he could be got to settle with mr ludgate who i am sure is too much the gentleman to ask any thing from him but his own which indeed if it was not for me hed be too genteel to mention but as i said before short accounts make long friends and as you are so much allens friend you can hint that to him i shall not hint but say it to him as plainly as possible replied lucy and you may be certain that he will come to settle accounts with mr ludgate before night i am sure i shall be mighty glad of it and so will mr ludgate said belle and thus they parted mrs ludgate with triumph announced to her husband upon his return home that she had brought affairs to a crisis with allen and that he would come to settle his accounts this evening the surprise and consternation which appeared in mr ludgates countenance convinced the lady that her interference was highly disagreeable chapter ii allen came punctually in the evening to settle his accounts when he and leonard were by themselves he could not help expressing some astonishment mixed with indignation at the hints which had been thrown out by mrs ludgate why she knows nothing of the matter said ludgate ive no notion of talking of such things to ones wife it would only make her uneasy and we shall be able to go on some way or other so let us have another bottle of wine and talk no more of business for this night allen would by no means consent to put off the settlement of accounts after what had passed short accounts said he as mrs ludgate observed make long friends it appeared when the statement of affairs was completed that allen had advanced above three hundred pounds for leonard and bills to a large amount still remained unpaid now it happened that jack the footboy contrived to go in and out of the room several times whilst mr ludgate and allen were talking and he finding it more for his interest to serve his masters tradesmen than his master sent immediate notice to all whom it might concern that mr ludgates affairs were in a bad way and that now or never must be the word with his creditors the next morning bills came showering in upon leonard whilst he was at breakfast and amongst them came sundry bills of mrs ludgates they could not possibly have come at a more inauspicious moment people bespeak goods with one species of enthusiasm and look over their bills with another we should rather have said people spend with one enthusiasm and pay with another but this observation would not apply to our present purpose for mr and mrs ludgate had never yet experienced the pleasure or the pain of paying their debts they had hitherto been faithful to their maxim of spend today and pay tomorrow they agreed well in the beginning of their career of extravagance but the very similarity of their tastes and habits proved ultimately the cause of the most violent quarrels as they both were expensive selfish and selfwilled neither would from regard to the other forbear comparisons between their different degrees of extravagance commenced and once begun they never ended it was impossible to settle to the satisfaction of either party which of them was most to blame recrimination and reproaches were hourly and daily repeated and the lady usually ended by bursting into tears and the gentleman by taking his hat and walking out of the house in the meantime the bills must be paid mr ludgate was obliged to sell the whole of his interest in the shop in cranbournealley and the ready money he received from allen was to clear him from all difficulties allen came to pay him this sum do not think me impertinent mr ludgate said he but i cannot for the soul of me help fearing for you what will you do when this money is gone and go it must at the rate you live in a very short time you are very good sir replied leonard coldly to interest yourself so much in my concerns but i shall live at what rate i please every man is the best judge of his own affairs after this repulse allen could interfere no further but when two months had elapsed from the date of mrs ludgates promised payment of the upholsterers bill lucy resolved to call again upon mrs ludgate lucy had now a particular occasion for the money she was going to be married to allen and she wished to put into her husbands hands the little fortune which she had so hardly earned by her own industry from the time that allen heard her conversation when belle came to view the house in cranbournealley he had been of opinion that she would make an excellent wife and the circumstances which sunk lucy below mrs ludgates notice raised her in the esteem and affection of this prudent and sensible young man he did not despisehe admired her for going into a creditable business to make herself independent instead of living as an humble companion with mrs ludgate of whose conduct and character she could not approve when lucy called again upon mrs ludgate to remind her of her promise she was received with evident confusion she was employed in directing mr green a builder to throw out a bow in her diningroom and to add a balcony to the windows for mrs pimlico had a bow and a balcony and how could mrs ludgate live without them surely my dear mrs ludgate said lucy drawing her aside so that the man who was measuring the windows could not hear what she said surely you will think of paying mr beechs bill as you promised before you go into any new expense hush hush dont speak so loud leonard is in the next room and i would not have him hear any thing of beechs bill just when the mans here about the balcony for any thing in the world lucy though she was goodnatured was not so weak as to yield to airs and capricious extravagance and mrs ludgate at last though with a bad grace paid her the money which she had intended to lay out in a very different manner but no sooner had she paid this debt than she considered how she could prevail upon mr green to throw out the bow and finish the balcony without paying him for certain alterations he had made in the house in cranbournealley for which he had never yet received one farthing it was rather a difficult business for mr green was a sturdy man and used to regular payments he resisted all persuasion and mrs ludgate was forced again to have recourse to lucy do my dear girl said she lend me only twenty guineas for this positive man else you see i cannot have my balcony this did not appear to lucy the greatest of all misfortunes but is it not much more disagreeable to be always in debt and danger than to live in a room without a balcony said lucy why it is disagreeable certainly to be in debt because of being dunned continually but the reason im so anxious about the balcony is that mrs pimlico has one and thats the only thing in which her house is better than mine look just over the way do you see mrs pimlicos beautiful balcony mrs ludgate who had thrust her head far out of the window pulling lucy along with her now suddenly drew back exclaiming lord if here is not that odious woman i hope jack wont let her inshe shut the window hastily ran to the top of the stairs and called out jack i say jack dont let nurse in for your life not if she has the child with her maam said jack no no i say then thats a sin and a shame muttered jack to shut the door upon your own child mrs ludgate did not hear this reflection because she had gone back to the man who was waiting for directions about the balcony but lucy heard it distinctly maam nurse would come in for she says she saw you at the window and here she is coming up the stairs cried the footboy the nurse came in with mrs ludgates child in her arms indeed madam said she the truth of the matter is i cant and wont be denied my own any longer and it is not for my own sake i speak up so bold but for the dear babe that i have here in my arms that cant speak for itself but only smile in your face and stretch out its arms to you i that am only its nurse cant bear it but i have little ones of my own and cant see them want i cant do for them all if im not paid my lawful due how can i and is it not fit i should think of my own flesh and blood first so i must give up this one i musti mustcried the nurse kissing the child repeatedly i must leave her to her mother the poor woman laid the child down on the sofa then turned her back upon it and hiding her face in her apron sobbed as if her heart would break lucy was touched with compassion the mother stood abashed shame struggled for a few instants with pride pride got the victory the womans out of her wits i believe cried mrs ludgate mr green if youll please to call again tomorrow well talk about the balcony lucy give me the child and dont you fall a crying without knowing why or wherefore nurse im surprised at you did not i tell you id send you your money next week oh yes madam but you have said so this many a week and things are come to such a pass now that husband says i shall not bring back the child without the money what can i do said mrs ludgate lucy immediately took her purse out of her pocket and whispered i will lend you whatever you want to pay the nurse upon condition that you will give up the scheme of the balcony mrs ludgate submitted to this condition but she was not half so much obliged to lucy for doing her this real service as she would have been if her friend had assisted in gratifying her vanity and extravagance lucy saw what passed in mrs ludgates mind and nothing but the sense of the obligations she lay under to belles mother could have prevented her from breaking off all connexion with her but mrs ludgate was now much inclined to court lucys acquaintance as her approaching marriage with mr allen who was in good circumstances made her appear quite a different person mrs allen would be able and she hoped willing to assist her from time to time with money with this view belle showed lucy a degree of attention and civility which she had disdained to bestow upon her friend whilst she was in an inferior situation it was in vain however that this wouldbe fine lady endeavoured to draw the prudent lucy out of her own sphere of life though lucy was extremely pretty she had no desire to be admired she was perfectly satisfied and happy at home and she and her husband lived according to old ludgates excellent maxim out of debt out of danger we shall not weary our readers with the history of all the petty difficulties into which mr and mrs ludgates foolish extravagance led them the life of the shabby genteel is most miserable servants wages unpaid duns continually besieging the door perpetual excuses falsehoods to be invented melancholy at home and forced gaiety abroad who would live such a life yet all this mr and mrs ludgate endured for the sake of outshining mr and mrs pimlico it happened that one night at a party mrs ludgate caught a violent cold and her face became inflamed and disfigured by red spots being to go to a ball in a few days she was very impatient to get rid of the eruption and in this exigency she applied to mr pimlico the perfumer who had often supplied her with cosmetics and who now recommended a beautifying lotion this quickly cleared her complexion but she soon felt the effects of her imprudence she was taken dangerously ill and the physician who was consulted attributed her disease entirely to the preparation she had applied to her face whilst she was ill an execution was brought against mr ludgates goods threatened with a jail and incapable of taking any vigorous measures to avoid distress he went to consult his friend tom lewis how this mr lewis lived was matter of astonishment to all his acquaintance he had neither estate business or any obvious means of supporting the expense in which he indulged what a happy dog you are lewis said our hero how is it that you live better than i do you might live as well as i if you were inclined said lewis our hero was all curiosity and lewis exacted from him an oath of secrecy a long pause ensued have you the courage said lewis to extricate yourself from all your difficulties at once to be sure i have since i must either go to jail this night or raise two hundred guineas for these cursed fellows you shall have it in half an hour said lewis if you will follow my advice tell me at once what i am to do and i will do it cried leonard i will do any thing to save myself from disgrace and from a jail lewis who now perceived his friend was worked up to the pitch he wanted revealed the whole mystery he was connected with a set of gentlemen ingenious in the arts of forgery from whom he purchased counterfeit banknotes at a very cheap rate the difficulty and risk of passing them was extreme therefore the confederates were anxious to throw this part of the business off their hands struck with horror at the idea of becoming an accomplice in such a scheme of villany leonard stood pale and silent incapable of even thinking distinctly lewis was sorry that he had opened his mind so fully remember your oath of secrecy said he i do replied ludgate and remember that you must become one of us before night or go to jail ludgate said he would take an hour to consider of the business and here they parted lewis promising to call at his house before evening to learn his final decision and am i come to this thought the wretched man would to heaven i had followed my poor fathers maxim but it is now too late mr ludgate when he arrived at home shut himself up in his own room and continued walking backwards and forwards for nearly an hour in a state of mind more dreadful than can be described whilst he was in this situation some one knocked at the door he thought it was lewis and trembled from head to foot it was only a servant with a parcel of bills which several tradesmen hearing that an execution was in the house had hastened to present for payment among them were those of mr beech the upholsterer and mrs ludgates milliner and mantuamaker which having been let to run on for above two years and a half now amounted to a sum that astonished and shocked mr ludgate he could not remonstrate with his wife or even vent his anger in reproaches for she was lying senseless in her bed before he had recovered from this shock and whilst the tradesmen who brought the bills were still waiting for their money lewis and one of his companions arrived he came to the point immediately he produced banknotes sufficient to discharge all his debts and proposed to lend him this money on condition that he would enter into the confederacy as he had proposed all that we ask of you is to pass a certain number of notes for us every week you will find this to your advantage for we will allow you a considerable percentage besides freeing you from your present embarrassments the sight of the banknotes the pressure of immediate distress and the hopes of being able to support the style of life in which he had of late appeared all conspired to tempt ludgate when he had early in life vaunted to his young companions that he despised his fathers old maxim while he repeated his own they applauded his spirit they were not present at this instant to pity the wretched state into which that spirit had betrayed him but our hero has yet much greater misery to endure it is true his debts were now paid and he was able to support an external appearance of affluence but not one day not one night could he pass without suffering the horrors of a guilty conscience and all the terrors which haunt the man who sees himself in hourly danger of detection he determined to keep his secret cautiously from his wife he was glad that she was confined to her bed at this time lest her prying curiosity should discover what was going forward the species of affection which he had once felt for her had not survived the first six months of their marriage and their late disputes had rendered this husband and wife absolutely odious to each other each believed and indeed pretty plainly asserted that they could live more handsomely asunder but alas they were united for better and for worse mrs ludgates illness terminated in another eruption on her face she was extremely mortified by the loss of her beauty especially as mrs pimlico frequently contrasted her face with that of mrs paget who was now acknowledged to be the handsomest woman of mrs pimlicos acquaintance she endeavoured to make herself of consequence by fresh expense mr ludgate to account for the sudden payment of his debts and the affluence in which he now appeared to live spread a report of his having had a considerable legacy left to him by a relation who had died in a distant part of england the truth of the report was not questioned and for some time mr and mrs ludgate were the envy of their acquaintance how little the world as it is called can judge by external appearances of the happiness of those who excite admiration or envy what lucky people the ludgates are cried mrs pimlico the exclamation was echoed by a crowded card party assembled at her house but then continued mrs pimlico it is a pity poor belle is so disfigured by that scurvy or whatever it is in her face i remember the time when she was as pretty a woman as you could see nay would you believe it she had once as fine a complexion as young mrs paget these observations circulated quickly and did not escape mrs ludgates ear her vanity was deeply wounded and her health appeared to her but a secondary consideration in comparison with the chance of recovering her lost complexion mr pimlico who was an eloquent perfumer persuaded her that her former illness had nothing to do with the beautifying lotion she had purchased at his shop and to support his assertions he quoted examples of innumerable ladies of high rank and fashion who were in the constant habit of using this admirable preparation the vain and foolish woman notwithstanding the warnings which she had received from the physician who attended her during her illness listened to the oratory of the perfumer and bought half a dozen bottles of another kind of beautifying lotion the eruption vanished from her face after she had used the cosmetic and as she did not feel any immediate bad effects upon her health she persisted in the practice for some months the consequence was at last dreadful she was found one morning speechless in her bed with one side of her face distorted and motionless during the night she had been seized with a paralytic stroke in a few days she recovered her speech but her face continued totally disfigured this was the severest punishment that could have been inflicted on a woman of her character she was now ashamed to show herself abroad and incapable of being contented at home she had not the friendship of a husband or the affection of children to afford her consolation and support her eldest child was a boy of about five years old her youngest four they were as fretful and troublesome as children usually are whose education has been totally neglected and the quarrels between them and jack the footboy were endless for jack was alternately their tutor and their playfellow beside the disorder created in this family by mischievous children the servants were daily plagues nothing was ever done by them well or regularly and though the master and mistress scolded without mercy and perpetually threatened to turn jack or sukey away yet no reformation in their manners was produced for jack and sukeys wages were not paid and they felt that they had the power in their own hands so that they were rather the tyrants than the servants of the house chapter iii mrs ludgates temper which never was sweet was soured to such a degree by these accumulated evils that she was insufferable her husband kept out of the way as much as possible he dined and supped at his club or at the tavern and during the evenings and mornings he was visible at home but for a few minutes yet though his time was passed entirely away from his wife his children and his home he was not happy his life was a life of perpetual fraud and fear he was bound by his engagements with lewis to pass for the confederates a certain number of forged notes every day this was a perilous task his utmost exertions and ingenuity were continually necessary to escape detection and after all he was barely able to wrest from the hard hands of his friends a sufficient profit upon his labour to maintain himself how often did he look back with regret to the days when he stood behind the counter in his fathers shop then he had in allen a real friend but now he had in lewis only a profligate and unfeeling associate lewis cared for no one but himself and he was as avaricious as he was extravagant greedy of what belonged to others prodigal of his own one night leonard went to the house where the confederates met to settle with them for the last parcel of notes that he had passed lewis insisted upon being paid for his services before ludgate should touch a farthing words ran high between them lewis having the most influence with his associates carried his point and leonard who was in want of ready money could supply himself only by engaging to pass double the usual quantity of forged notes during the ensuing month upon this condition he obtained the supply for which he solicited upon his return home he locked up the forged notes as usual in his escritoir it happened the very next morning that mrs la mode the milliner called upon mrs ludgate the ruling passion still prevailed notwithstanding the miserable state to which this lady was reduced even palsy could not deaden her personal vanity her love of dress survived the total loss of her beauty she became accustomed to the sight of her distorted features and was still anxious to wear what was most genteel and becoming mrs la mode had not a more constant visitor how are you mrs ludgate this morning said she but i need not ask for you look surprising well i just called to tell you a bit of a secret that i have told to nobody else but you being such a friend and a favourite have a right to know it you must know i am going next week to bring out a new spring hat and i have made one of my girls bring it up to consult with you before any body else having a great opinion of your taste and judgment though it is a thing that must not be mentioned because it would ruin me with mrs pimlico who made me swear she should have the first sight flattered by having the first sight of the spring hat mrs ludgate was prepossessed in its favour and when she tried it on she thought it made her look ten years younger in short it was impossible not to take one of the hats though it cost three guineas and was not worth ten shillings positively maam you must patronize my spring hat said the milliner mrs ludgate was decided by the word patronize she took the hat and desired that it should be set down in her bill but mrs la mode was extremely concerned that she had made a rule nay a vow not to take any thing but ready money for the spring hats and she could not break her vow even for her favourite mrs ludgate this was at least a prudent resolution in the milliner who had lately received notice from mr ludgate not to give his wife any goods upon credit for that he was determined to refuse payment of her bills the wife who was now in a weak state of health was not able as formerly to fight her battles with her husband upon equal terms to cunning the refuge of weakness she had recourse and she considered that though she could no longer outscold she could still outwit her adversary she could not have the pleasure and honour of patronizing the spring hat without ready money to pay for it her husband she knew had always banknotes in his escritoir and she argued with herself that it was better to act without his consent than against it she went and tried with certain keys of her own to open leonards desk and open it came she seized from a parcel of banknotes as many as she wanted and paid mrs la mode with three of them for the spring hat when her husband came home the next day he did not observe that he had lost any of the notes and as he went out of the house again without once coming into the parlour where his wife was sitting she excused herself to her conscience for not telling him of the freedom she had taken by thinkingit will do as well to tell him of it tomorrow a few notes out of such a parcel as he has in his desk locked up from me cant signify and hell only bluster and bully when i do tell him of it so let him find it out when he pleases the scheme of acting without her husbands consent in all cases where she was morally certain that if she asked she could not obtain it mrs ludgate had often pursued with much success a few days after she had bought the spring hat she invited mrs pimlico mrs paget and all her genteel friends to tea and cards her husband she knew would be out of the way at his club or at the tavern mrs pimlico and mrs paget and all their genteel friends did mrs ludgate the honour to wait upon her on the appointed evening and she had the satisfaction to appear upon this occasion in the new spring hat while her friend mrs pimlico whispered to young mrs paget she patronize the new spring hat what a fool mrs la mode makes of her a deaths head in a wreath of roses how frightfully ridiculous unconscious that she was an object of ridicule to the whole company mrs ludgate sat down to cards in unusually good spirits firmly believing mrs la modes comfortable assertion that the spring hat made her look ten years younger she was in the midst of a panegyric upon mrs la modes taste when jack the footboy came behind her chair and whispered that three men were below who desired to speak to her immediately men gentlemen do you mean said mrs ludgate no maam not gentlemen then send them away about their business dunce said the lady some tradesfolk i suppose tell them im engaged with company but maam they will not leave the house without seeing you or mr ludgate let them wait then till mr ludgate comes in i have nothing to say to them whats their business pray it is something about a note maam that you gave to mrs la mode the other day what about it said mrs ludgate putting down her cards they say it is a bad note well ill change it bid them send it up they wont part with it maam they would not let it out of their hands even to let me look at it for an instant what a riot about a pound note said mrs ludgate rising from the cardtable ill speak to the fellows myself she had recourse again to her husbands desk and armed with a whole handful of fresh banknotes she went to the strangers they told her that they did not want and would not receive any note in exchange for that which they produced but that as it was a forgery they must insist upon knowing from whom she had it there was an air of mystery and authority about the strangers which alarmed mrs ludgate and without attempting any evasion she said that she took the note from her husbands desk and that she could not tell from whom he received it the strangers declared that they must wait till mr ludgate should return home she offered to give them a guinea to drink if they would go away quietly but this they refused jack the footboy whispered that they had pistols and that he believed they were bowstreet officers they went into the back parlour to wait for mr ludgate and the lady in extreme perturbation returned to her company and her cards in vain she attempted to resume her conversation about the spring hat and to conceal the agitation of her spirits it was observed by all her friends and especially by mrs pimlico whose curiosity was strongly excited to know the cause of her alarm mrs ludgate looked frequently at her watch and even yawned without ceremony more than once to manifest her desire that the company should depart but no hints availed the card players resolutely kept their seats and even the smell of extinguishing candles had no effect upon their callous senses the time appeared insupportably long to the wretched mistress of the house and the contrast between her fantastic headdress and her agonizing countenance every minute became more striking twelve oclock struck it is growing very late said mrs ludgate but we must have another rubber said mrs pimlico she began to deal a knock was heard at the door theres mr ludgate i do suppose said mrs pimlico continuing her deal mrs ludgate left her cards and went out of the room without speaking she stopped at the head of the staircase for she heard a scuffle and loud voices below presently all was silent and she ventured down when she heard the parlour door shut the footman met her in the passage what is the matter said she i dont know but i must be paid my wages said he or must pay myself he passed on rudely she half opened the parlour door and looked in her husband was lying back on the sofa seemingly stupefied by despair one of the bowstreet officers was chafing his temples another was rummaging his desk and the third was closely examining certain notes which he had just taken from the prisoners pockets what is the matter cried mrs ludgate advancing her husband lifted up his eyes saw her started up and stamping furiously exclaimed cursed cursed woman you have brought me to the gallows and all for this trumpery cried he snatching her gaudy hat from her head and trampling it under his feet for thisfor this you vain you ugly creature you have brought your husband to the gallows one of the bowstreet officers caught hold of his uplifted arm which trembled with rage his wife sank to the ground a second paralytic stroke deprived her of the power of speech as they were carrying her up stairs mrs pimlico and the rest of the company came out of the diningroom some of them with cards in their hands all eagerly asking what was the matter when they learnt that the bowstreet officers were in the house and that mr ludgate was taken into custody for uttering forged banknotes there was a general uproar some declared it was shocking others protested it was no more than might have been expected the ludgates lived so much above their circumstances then he was such a coxcomb and she such a poor vain creature better for people to do like their neighboursto make no show and live honestly in the midst of these effusions of long suppressed envy some few of the company attempted a slight word or two of apology for their host and hostess and the most humane went up to the wretched womans bedchamber to offer assistance and advice but the greater number were occupied in tucking up their white gowns finding their clogs or calling for hackney coaches in less than a quarter of an hour the house was clear of all mrs ludgates friends and it is to please such friends that whole families ruin themselves by unsuitable expense lucy and allen were not however of this class of friends a confused report of what had passed the preceding night was spread the next morning in cranbournealley by a young lady who had been at mrs ludgates rout the moment the news reached allens shop he and lucy set out immediately to offer their assistance to the unfortunate family when they got to weymouthstreet they gave only a single knock at the door that they might not create any alarm they were kept waiting a considerable time and at last the door was opened by a slipshod cookmaid who seemed to be just up though it was near eleven oclock she showed them into the parlour which was quite dark and whilst she was opening the shutters told them that the house had been up all night what with the bowstreet officers and her mistresss fits her master she added was carried off to prison she believed lucy asked who was with mrs ludgate and whether she could go up to her room theres nobody with her maam but nurse that called by chance early this morning to see the children and had the goodnature to stay to help and has been sitting in mistresss room whilst i went to my bed ill step up and see if you can go in maam they waited for some time in the parlour where every thing looked desolate and in disorder the ashes covered the hearth the poker lay upon the table near mr ludgates desk the lock of which had been broken open a brass flat candlestick covered with tallow was upon the windowseat and beside it a broken cruet of vinegar a cravat and red silk handkerchief which had been taken from mr ludgates neck when he swooned lay under the table lucy and her husband looked at one another for some moments without speaking at last allen said we had better lock up this press where there are silver spoons and china for there is nobody now left to take care of any thing and the creditors will be here soon to seize all they can lucy said that she would go up into the diningroom and take an inventory of the furniture in the diningroom she found jack the footboy collecting shillings from beneath the candlesticks on the cardtables the two little children were sitting on the floor the girl playing with a pack of cards the boy drinking the dregs of a decanter of white winepoor children poor creatures said lucy is there nobody to take care of you no nobody but jack said the boy and hes going away papas gone i dont know where and mamas not up yet so we have had no breakfast the cookmaid came in to say that mrs ludgate was awake and sensible now and would be glad to see mrs allen if shed be so good as to walk up lucy told the children who clung to her that she would take them home with her and give them some breakfast and then hastened up stairs she found her wretched friend humbled indeed to the lowest state of imbecile despair her speech had returned but she spoke with difficulty and scarcely so as to be intelligible the goodnatured nurse supported her in the bed saying repeatedly keep a good heart madam keep a good heart dont let your spirits sink so as this and all may be well yet o lucy lucy what will become of me now what a change is here and nobody to help or advise me nobody upon earth i am forsaken by all the world not forsaken by me said lucy in a soothing voice what noise is that below cried mrs ludgate lucy went downstairs to inquire and found that as allen had foretold the creditors were come to seize all they could find allen undertook to remain with them and to bring them to some settlement whilst lucy had her unfortunate friend and the two children removed immediately to her own house as to mr ludgate there was no hope for him the proofs of his guilt were manifest and incontrovertible the forged note which his wife had taken from his desk and given to the milliner was one which had not gone through certain mysterious preparations it was a bungling forgery the plate would doubtless have been retouched had not this bill been prematurely circulated by mrs ludgate thus her vanity led to a discovery of her husbands guilt all the associates in lewiss iniquitous confederacy suffered the just punishment of their crimes many applications were made to obtain a pardon for leonard ludgate but the executive power preserved that firmness which has not upon any similar occasion ever been relaxed lucy and allen those real friends who would not encourage mrs ludgate in extravagance now in the hour of adversity and repentance treated her with the utmost tenderness and generosity they were economical and therefore could afford to be generous all the wants of this destitute widow were supplied from the profits of their industry they nursed her with daily humanity bore with the peevishness of disease and did all in their power to soothe the anguish of unavailing remorse nothing could be saved from the wreck of mr ludgates fortune for the widow but allen in looking over old ludgates books had found and recovered some old debts which leonard after his fathers death thought not worth looking after the sum amounted to about three hundred and twenty pounds as the whole concern had been made over to him he could lawfully have appropriated this money to his own use but he reserved it for his friends children he put it out to interest and in the mean time he and lucy not only clothed and fed but educated these orphans with their own children in habits of economy and industry the orphans repaid by their affection and gratitude the care that was bestowed upon them and when they grew up they retrieved the credit of their family by living according to their grandfathers useful maximout of debt out of danger nov the lottery chapter i near derby on the way towards darleygrove there is a cottage which formerly belonged to one maurice robinson the jessamine which now covers the porch was planted by ellen his wife she was an industrious prudent young woman liked by all her neighbours because she was ready to assist and serve them and the delight of her husbands heart for she was sweettempered affectionate constantly clean and neat and made his house so cheerful that he was always in haste to come home to her after his days work he was one of the manufacturers employed in the cotton works at derby and he was remarkable for his good conduct and regular attendance at his work things went on very well in every respect till a relation of his mrs dolly robinson came to live with him mrs dolly had been laundrymaid in a great family where she learned to love gossiping and teadrinkings and where she acquired some taste for shawls and cherrybrandy she thought that she did her young relations a great favour by coming to take up her abode with them because as she observed they were young and inexperienced and she knowing a great deal of the world was able and willing to advise them and besides she had had a legacy of some hundred pounds left to her and she had saved some little matters while in service which might make it worth her relations while to take her advice with proper respect and to make her comfortable for the rest of her days ellen treated her with all due deference and endeavoured to make her as comfortable as possible but mrs dolly could not be comfortable unless besides drinking a large spoonful of brandy in every dish of tea she could make each person in the house do just what she pleased she began by being dissatisfied because she could not persuade ellen that brandy was wholesome in tea for the nerves next she was affronted because ellen did not admire her shawl and above all she was grievously offended because ellen endeavoured to prevent her from spoiling little george george was at this time between five and six years old and his mother took a great deal of pains to bring him up well she endeavoured to teach him to be honest to speak the truth to do whatever she and his father bid him and to dislike being idle mrs dolly on the contrary coaxed and flattered him without caring whether he was obedient or disobedient honest or dishonest she was continually telling him that he was the finest little fellow in the world and that she would do great things for him some time or another what these great things were to be the boy seemed neither to know nor care and except at the moments when she was stuffing gingerbread into his mouth he seemed never to desire to be near her he preferred being with william deane his fathers friend who was a very ingenious man and whom he liked to see at work william gave him a slate and a slate pencil and taught him how to make figures and to cast up sums and made a little wheelbarrow for him of which george was very fond so that george called him in play king deane all these things tended to make mrs dolly dislike william deane whom she considered as her rival in power one day it was georges birthday mrs dolly invited a party as she called it to drink tea with her and at teatime she was entertaining the neighbours with stories of what she had seen in the great world amongst others she had a favourite story of a butler in the family where she had lived who bought a ticket in the lottery when he was drunk which ticket came up a ten thousand pound prize when he was sober and the butler turned gentleman and kept his coach directly one evening maurice robinson and william came home after their days work just in time to hear the end of this story and mrs dolly concluded it by turning to maurice and assuring him that he must put into the lottery and try his luck for why should not he be as lucky as another here said she a man is working and drudging all the days of his life to get a decent coat to put on and a bit of bread to put into his childs mouth and after all may be he cant do it though all the while for five guineas or a guinea or halfaguinea even if he has but the spirit to lay out his money properly he has the chance of making a fortune without any trouble surely a man should try his luck if not for his own at least for his childrens sake continued mrs dolly drawing little george towards her and hugging him in her arms who knows what might turn up make your papa buy a ticket in the lottery love theres my darling and ill be bound hell have good luck tell him ill be bound we shall have a ten thousand pound prize at least and all for a few guineas im sure i think none but a miser would grudge the money if he had it to give as mrs dolly finished her speech she looked at william deane whose countenance did not seem to please her maurice was whistling and ellen knitting as fast as possible little george was counting william deanes buttons pray mr deane cried mrs dolly turning full upon him what may your advice and opinion be since nothings to be done here without your leave and word of command forsooth now as you know so much and have seen so much of the world would you be pleased to tell this good company and myself into the bargain what harm it can do anybody but a miser to lay out a small sum to get a good chance of a round thousand or five thousand or ten thousand or twenty thousand pounds without more ado as she pronounced the words five thousand ten thousand twenty thousand pounds in a triumphant voice all the company except ellen and william seemed to feel the force of her oratory william coolly answered that he was no miser but that he thought money might be better laid out than in the lottery for that there was more chance of a mans getting nothing for his money than of his getting a prize that when a man worked for fair wages every day he was sure of getting something for his pains and with honest industry and saving might get rich enough in time and have to thank himself for it which would be a pleasant thing but that if a man as he had known many set his heart upon the turning of the lottery wheel he would leave off putting his hand to any thing the whole year round and so grow idle and may be drunken and then said william at the years end if he have a blank what is he to do for his rent or for his wife and children that have nothing to depend upon but him and his industry here maurice sighed and so did ellen whilst william went on and told many a true story of honest servants and tradesmen whom he had known who had ruined themselves by gaming and lotteries but said maurice who now broke silence putting into the lottery william is not gaming like dice or cards or such things putting into the lottery is not gaming as i take it as i take it though replied william it is gaming for what is gaming but trusting ones money or somewhat to luck and haphazard and is there not as much haphazard in the turning of the wheel as in the coming up of the dice or the dealing of the cards true enough but somebody must get a prize argued maurice and somebody must win at dice or cards said william but a many more must lose and a many more i take it must lose by the lottery than by any other game else how would they that keep the lottery gain by it as they do put a case if you and i maurice were this minute to play at dice we stake our money down on the table here and one or tother takes all up but in the lottery it is another affair for the whole of what is put in does never come out this statement of the case made some impression upon maurice who was no fool but mrs dollys desire that he should buy a lottery ticket was not to be conquered by reason it grew stronger and stronger the more she was opposed she was silent and cross during the remainder of the evening and the next morning at breakfast she was so low that even her accustomed dose of brandy in her tea had no effect now maurice besides his confused hopes that mrs dolly would leave something handsome to him or his family thought himself obliged to her for having given a helping hand to his father when he was in distress and therefore he wished to bear with her humours and to make her happy in his house he knew that the lottery ticket was uppermost in her mind and the moment he touched upon that subject she brightened up she told him she had had a dream and she had great faith in dreams and she had dreamed three times over that he had bought number in the lottery and that it had come up a ten thousand pound prize well ellen said maurice ive half a mind to try my luck and it can do us no harm for ill only put off buying the cow this year nay said mrs dolly why so may be you dont know what i know that ellens as rich as a jew she has a cunning little cupboard in the wall yonder that i see her putting money into every day of her life and none goes out ellen immediately went and drew back a small sliding oak door in the wainscot and took out a glove in which some money was wrapped she put it altogether in her husbands hand saying with a goodhumoured smile there is my years spinning maurice i only thought to have made more of it before i gave it you do what you please with it maurice was so much moved by his wifes kindness that he at the moment determined to give up his lottery scheme of which he knew she did not approve but though a goodnatured wellmeaning man he was of an irresolute character and even when he saw what was best to be done had not courage to persist as he was coming home from work a few days after ellen had given him the money he saw in one of the streets of derby a house with large windows finely illuminated and read the words lotteryoffice of fortunatus gould and co at this office was sold the fortunate ticket which came up on monday last a twenty thousand pound prize ready money paid for prizes immediately on demand the l l l still in the wheel none but the brave deserve a prize whilst maurice was gazing at this and other similar advertisements which were exhibited in various bright colours in this tempting window his desire to try his fortune in the lottery returned and he was just going into the office to purchase a ticket when luckily he found that he had not his leathern purse in his pocket he walked on and presently brushed by some one it was william deane who was looking very eagerly over some old books at a booksellers stall i wish i had but money to treat myself with some of these said william but i cannot they cost such a deal of money having all these prints in them we can lend youno we cant neither cried maurice stopping himself short for he recollected that he could not both lend his friend money to buy the books and buy a lottery ticket he was in great doubt which he should do and walked on with william in silence so then cried he at last you would not advise me to put into the lottery nay said william laughing it is not for me to advise you about it now for i know you are considering whether you had best put it into the lottery or lend me the money to buy these books now i hope you dont think i was looking to my own interest in what i said the other day for i can assure you i had no thoughts of meeting with these books at that time and did not know that you had any money to spare say no more about it replied maurice dont i know you are an honest fellow and would lend me the money if i wanted it you shall have it as soon as ever we get home only mind and stand by me stoutly if mrs dolly begins any more about the lottery mrs dolly did not fail to renew her attacks and she was both provoked and astonished when she found that the contents of the leathern purse were put into the hands of william deane books indeed to buy books forsooth what business had such a one as he with books she had seen a deal of life she said and never saw no good come of bookish bodies and she was sorry to see that her own darling george was taking to the bookish line and that his mother encouraged him in it she would lay her best shawl she said to a gauze handkerchief that william deane would sooner or later beggar himself and all that belonged to him by his books and his gimcracks and if george were my son continued she raising her voice id soon cure him of prying and poring into that mans picturebooks and following him up and down with wheels and mechanic machines which will never come to no good nor never make a gentleman of him as a ticket in the lottery might and would all mouths were open at once to defend william maurice declared he was the most industrious man in the parish that his books never kept him from his work but always kept him from the alehouse and bad company and that as to his gimcracks and machines he never laid out a farthing upon them but what he got by working on holidays and odd times when other folks were idling or tippling his master who understood the like of those things said before all the workmen at the mills that william deanes machines were main clever and might come to bring in a deal of money for him and his why continued maurice there was mr arkwright the man that first set a going all our cotton frames here was no better than william deane and yet came at last to make a power of money it stands to reason any how that william deane is hurting nobody nor himself neither and moreover he may divert himself his own way without being taken to task by man woman or child as to children hes very good to my child theres one loves him pointing to george and im glad of it for i should be ashamed so i should that my flesh and blood should be in any ways disregardful or ungracious to those that be kind and good to them mrs dolly swelling with anger repeated in a scornful voice disregardful ungracious i wonder folks can talk so to me but this is all the gratitude one meets with in this world for all one does well well im an old woman and shall soon be out of peoples way and then they will be sorry they did not use me better and then theyll bethink them that it is not so easy to gain a friend as to lose a friend and then here mrs dollys voice was stopped by her sobs and maurice who was a very goodnatured man and much disposed to gratitude said he begged her pardon a thousand times if he had done any thing to offend her and declared his only wish was to please and satisfy her if she would but tell him how she continued sobbing without making any answer for some time but at last she cried my admy admy advice is never taken in any thing maurice declared he was ready to take her advice if that was the only way to make her easy in her mind i know what you mean now added he you are still harping upon the lottery ticket well ill buy a ticket this day week after ive sold the cow i bought at the fair will you have done sobbing now cousin dolly indeed cousin maurice it is only for your own sake i speak said she wiping her eyes you know you was always a favourite of mine from your childhood up i nursed you and had you on my knee and foretold often and often you would make a fortune so i did and will you buy the ticket i dreamed about hey maurice assured her that if it was to be had he would the cow was accordingly sold the following week and the ticket in the lottery was bought it was not however the number about which mrs dolly had dreamed for that was already purchased by some other person the ticket maurice bought was number and after he had got it his cousin dolly continually deplored that it was not the very number of which she dreamed it would have been better not to have taken her advice at all than to have taken it when it was too late maurice was an easytempered man and loved quiet and when he found that he was reproached for something or other whenever he came into his own house he began to dislike the thought of going home after his days work and loitered at publichouses sometimes but more frequently at the lotteryoffice as the lottery was now drawing his whole thoughts were fixed upon his ticket and he neglected his work at the manufactory what signify a few shillings wages more or less said he to himself if my ticket should come up a prize it makes a rich man of me at once his ticket at last was drawn a prize of five thousand pounds he was almost out of his senses with joy he ran home to tell the news a prize a prize dolly cried he as soon as he had breath to speak that comes of taking my advice said dolly a five thousand pound prize my dear ellen cried he and down he kicked her spinningwheel i wish we may be as happy with it as we have been without it maurice said ellen and calmly lifted her spinningwheel up again no more spinningwheels cried maurice no more spinning no more work we have nothing to do now but to be as happy as the day is long wife i say put by that wheel youre a lady now and ought to look and behave like a lady added mrs dolly stretching up her head and not stand moping over an old spinningwheel i dont know how to look and behave like a lady said ellen and sighed but i hopes maurice wont love me the less for that mrs dolly was for some time wholly taken up with the pleasure of laying out money and preparing as she said to look like somebody she had many acquaintances at paddington she said and she knew of a very snug house there where they could all live very genteel she was impatient to go thither for two reasons that she might make a figure in the eyes of these acquaintances and that she might get maurice and little george away from william deane who was now become more than ever the object of her aversion and contempt for he actually advised his friend not to think of living in idleness though he had five thousand pounds william moreover recommended it to him to put his money out to interest or to dispose of a good part of it in stocking a farm or in fitting out a shop ellen being a farmers daughter knew well the management of a dairy and when a girl had also assisted in a haberdashers shop that was kept in derby by her uncle so she was able and willing she said to assist her husband in whichever of these ways of life he should take to maurice irresolute and desirous of pleasing all parties at last said it would be as well seeing they were now rich enough not to mind such a journey just to go to paddington and look about em and if so be they could not settle there in comfort why still they might see a bit of london town and take their pleasure for a month or so and he hoped william deane would come along with them and it should not be a farthing out of his pocket little george said every thing he could think of to persuade his king deane to go with them and almost pulled him to the coach door when they were setting off but william could not leave his master and his business the child clung with his legs and arms so fast to him that they were forced to drag him into the carriage youll find plenty of friends at paddington wholl give you many pretty things dry your eyes and see youre in a coach said mrs dolly george dried his eyes directly for he was ashamed of crying but he answered i dont care for your pretty things i shall not find my good dear king deane any where and leaning upon his mothers lap he twirled round the wheel of a little cart which william deane had given him and which he carried under his arm as his greatest treasure ellen was delighted to see signs of such a grateful and affectionate disposition in her son and all her thoughts were bent upon him whilst mrs dolly chattered on about her acquaintance at paddington and her satisfaction at finding herself in a coach once again her satisfaction was not however of long continuance for she grew so sick that she was obliged or thought herself obliged every quarter of an hour to have recourse to her cordial bottle her spirits were at last raised so much that she became extremely communicative and she laid open to maurice and ellen all her plans of future pleasure and expense in the first place said she i am heartily glad now i have got you away from that cottage that was not fit to live in and from certain folks that shall be nameless that would have one live all ones life like scrubs like themselves you must know that when we get to paddington the first thing i shall do shall be to buy a handsome coach a coach exclaimed maurice and ellen with extreme astonishment a coach to be sure said mrs dolly i say a coach i say we shall be ruined then said maurice and laughed at into the bargain la you dont know what money is said mrs dolly why havent you five thousand pounds man you dont know what can be done with five thousand pounds cousin maurice no nor you neither cousin dolly or youd never talk of setting up your coach why not pray i know what a coach costs as well as another i know we can have a secondhand coach and we need not tell nobody that its secondhand for about a hundred pounds and whats a hundred pounds out of five thousand but if weve a coach we must have horses must not we said ellen and theyll cost a hundred more oh we can have job horses that will cost us little or nothing said mrs dolly say l ayear replied maurice for i heard my masters coachman telling that the liverykeeper in london declared as how he made nothing by letting him have job horses for l ayear we are to have our own coach said dolly and that will be cheaper you know but the coach wont last for ever said ellen it must be mended and that will cost something it is time enough to think of that when the coach wants mending said mrs dolly who without giving herself the trouble of calculating seemed to be convinced that every thing might be done for five thousand pounds i must let you know a little secret continued she i have written that is got a friend to write to have the house at paddington taken for a year for i know its quite the thing for us and we are only to give fifty pounds ayear for it and you know that one thousand pounds would pay that rent for twenty years to come but then said ellen you will want to do a great many other things with that thousand pounds theres the coach you mentioned and you said we must keep a footboy and must see a deal of company and must not grudge to buy clothes and that we could not follow any trade nor have a farm nor do any thing to make money so we must live on upon what we have now let us count and see how we shall do it you know maurice that william deane inquired about what we could get for our five thousand pounds if we put it out to interest ay two hundred ayear he said well we pay fifty pounds ayear for the rent of the house and a hundred ayear we three and the boy must have to live upon and there is but fifty pounds ayear left mrs dolly with some reluctance gave up the notion of the coach and ellen proposed that five hundred pounds should be laid out in furnishing a haberdashers shop and that the rest of their money should be put out to interest till it was wanted maurice and i can take care of the shop very well and we can live well enough upon what we make by it said ellen mrs dolly opposed the idea of keeping a shop and observed that they should not in that case be gentlefolks besides she said she was sure the people of the house she had taken would never let it be turned into a shop what mrs dolly had said was indeed true when they got to paddington they found that the house was by no means fit for a shop and as the bargain was made for a year and they could not get it off their hands without considerable loss ellen was forced to put off her prudent scheme in the mean time she determined to learn how to keep accounts properly there was a small garden belonging to the house in which george set to work and though he could do little more than pull up the weeds yet this kept him out of mischief and idleness and she sent him to a dayschool where he would learn to read write and cast accounts when he came home in the evenings he used to show her his copybook and read his lesson and say his spelling to her while she was at work his master said it was a pleasure to teach him he was so eager to learn and ellen was glad that she had money enough to pay for having her boy well taught mrs dolly all this time was sitting and gossiping amongst her acquaintance in paddington these acquaintance were people whom she had seen when they visited the housekeeper in the great family where she was laundrymaid and she was very proud to show them that she was now a finer person than even the housekeeper who was formerly the object of her envy she had teadrinking parties and sometimes dinner parties two or three in a week and hired a footboy and laughed at ellen for her low notions and dissuaded maurice from all industrious schemes still saying to him oh youll have time enough to think of going to work when you have spent all your money maurice who had been accustomed to be at work for several hours in the day at first thought it would be a fine thing to walk about as mrs dolly said like a gentleman without having any thing to do but when he came to try it he found himself more tired by this way of life than he had ever felt himself in the cottonmills at derby he gaped and gaped and lounged about every morning and looked a hundred times at his new watch and put it to his ear to listen whether it was going the time seemed to him to pass so slowly sometimes he sauntered through the town came back again and stood at his own door looking at dogs fighting for a bone at others he went into the kitchen to learn what there was to be for dinner and to watch the maid cooking or the boy cleaning knives it was a great relief for him to go into the room where his wife was at work but he never would have been able to get through a year in this way without the assistance of a pretty little black horse for which he paid thirty guineas during a month he was very happy in riding backwards and forwards on the edgewareroad but presently the horse fell lame it was discovered that he was spavined and brokenwinded and the jockey from whom maurice bought him was no where to be found maurice sold the horse for five guineas and bought a fine bay for forty which he was certain would turn out well seeing he paid such a good price for him but the bay scarcely proved better than the black how he managed it we do not know but it seems he was not so skilful in horses as in cottonweaving for at the end of the year he had no horse and had lost fifty guineas by his bargains another hundred guineas were gone nobody in the family but himself knew how but he resolved to waste no more money and began the new year well by opening a haberdashers shop in paddington the fitting up this shop cost them five hundred pounds it was tolerably stocked and ellen was so active and so attentive to all customers that she brought numbers to maurice robinsons new shop they made full twelve per cent upon all they sold and in six months had turned three hundred pounds twice and had gained the profit of seventytwo pounds maurice however had got such a habit of lounging during his year of idleness that he could not relish steady attendance in the shop he was often out frequently came home late at night and ellen observed that he sometimes looked extremely melancholy but when she asked him whether he was ill or what ailed him he always turned away answering nothingnothing ails me why do ye fancy any thing ails me alas it was no fancy ellen saw too plainly that something was going wrong but as her husband persisted in silence she could not tell how to assist or comfort him mrs dolly in the mean time was going on spending her money in junketing she was besides no longer satisfied with taking her spoonful of brandy in every dish of tea she found herself uncomfortable she said unless she took every morning fasting a full glass of the good cordial recommended to her by her friend mrs joddrell the apothecarys wife now this good cordial in plain english was a strong dram ellen in the gentlest manner she could represented to mrs dolly that she was hurting her health and was exposing herself by this increasing habit of drinking but she replied with anger that what she took was for the good of her health that everybody knew best what agreed with them that she should trust to her own feelings and that nobody need talk when all she took came out of the apothecarys shop and was paid for honestly with her own money besides what came out of the apothecarys shop mrs dolly found it agreed with her constantly to drink a pot of porter at dinner and another at supper and always when she had a cold and she had often a cold she drank large basins full of white wine whey to throw off her cold as she said then by degrees she lost her appetite and found she could eat nothing unless she had a glass of brandy at dinner small beer she discovered did not agree with her so at luncheon time she always had a tumbler full of brandy and water this she carefully mixed herself and put less and less water in every day because brandy she was convinced was more wholesome for some constitutions than water and brandy and peppermint taken together was an infallible remedy for all complaints low spirits included chapter ii mrs dolly never found herself comfortable moreover unless she dined abroad two or three days in the week at a publichouse near paddington where she said she was more at home than she was any where else there was a bowlinggreen at this publichouse and it was a place to which teadrinking parties resorted now mrs dolly often wanted to take little george out with her to these parties and said it is a pity and shame to keep the poor thing always mewed up at home without ever letting him have any pleasure would not you like to go with me george dear in the onehorse chaise and would not you be glad to have cakes and tea and all the good things that are to be had i should like to go in the onehorse chaise to be sure and to have cakes and tea but i should not like to go with you because mother does not choose it answered george in his usual plain way of speaking ellen who had often seen mrs dolly offer him wine and punch to drink by way of a treat was afraid he might gradually learn to love spirituous liquors and that if he acquired a habit of drinking such when he was a boy he would become a drunkard when he should grow to be a man george was now almost nine years old and he could understand the reason why his mother desired that he would not drink spirituous liquors she once pointed out to him a drunken man who was reeling along the street and bawling ridiculous nonsense he had quite lost his senses and as he did not attend to the noise of a carriage coming fast behind him he could not get out of the way time enough and the coachman could not stop his horses so the drunken man was thrown down and the wheel of the carriage went over his leg and broke it in a shocking manner george saw him carried towards his home writhing and groaning with pain see what comes of drunkenness said ellen she stopped the people who were carrying the hurt man past her door and had him brought in and laid upon a bed whilst a surgeon was sent for george stood beside the bed in silence and the words see what comes of drunkenness sounded in his ears another time his mother pointed out to him a man with terribly swollen legs and a red face blotched all over lifted out of a fine coach by two footmen in fine liveries the man leaned upon a goldheaded cane after he was lifted from his carriage and tried with his other hand to take off his hat to a lady who asked him how he did but his hand shook so much that when he had got his hat off he could not put it rightly upon his head and his footman put it on for him the boys in the street laughed at him poor man said ellen that is squire l who as you heard the apothecary say has drunk harder in his day than any man that ever he knew and this is what he has brought himself to by drinking all the physic in the apothecarys shop cannot make him well again no nor can his fine coach and fine footmen any more make him easy or happy poor man george exclaimed i wonder how people can be such fools as to be drunkards i will never be a drunkard mother and now i know the reason why you desired me not to drink the wine when mrs dolly used to say to me down with it george dear it will do ye no harm these circumstances made such an impression upon george that there was no further occasion to watch him he always pushed away the glass when mrs dolly filled it for him one day his mother said to him now i can trust you to take care of yourself george i shall not watch you mrs dolly is going to a bowlinggreen teaparty this evening and has asked you to go with her and i have told her you shall george accordingly went with mrs dolly to the bowlinggreen the company drank tea out of doors in summerhouses after tea mrs dolly bid george go and look at the bowlinggreen and george was very well entertained with seeing the people playing at bowls but when it grew late in the evening and when the company began to go away george looked about for mrs dolly she was not in the summerhouse where they had drunk tea nor was she any where upon the terrace round the bowlinggreen so he went to the publichouse in search of her and at last found her standing at the bar with the landlady her face was very red and she had a large glass of brandy in her hand into which the landlady was pouring some drops which she said were excellent for the stomach mrs dolly started so when she saw george that she threw down half her glass of brandy bless us child i thought you were safe at the bowlinggreen said she i saw every body going away answered george so i thought it was time to look for you and to go home but before you go my dear little gentleman said the landlady you must eat one of these tarts for my sake as she spoke she gave george a little tart and here added she you must drink my health too in something good dont be afraid love its nothing that will hurt you its very sweet and nice it is wine or spirits of some sort or other i know by the smell said george and i will not drink it thank you maam the boys a fool said mrs dolly but its his mothers fault she wont let him taste any thing stronger than water but now your mothers not by you know said mrs dolly winking at the landlady now your mothers not by yes and nobody will tell of you added the landlady so do what you like drink it down love no cried george pushing away the glass which mrs dolly held to his lips no no no i say i will not do any thing now my mothers not by that i would not do if she was here in this room well hush hush and dont bawl so loud though said mrs dolly who saw what george did not see a gentleman that was standing at the door of the parlour opposite to them and who could hear every thing that was saying at the bar i say continued george in a loud voice mother told me she could trust me to take care of myself and so i will take care of myself and i am not a fool no more is mother i know for she told me the reasons why it is not good to drink spirituous mrs dolly pushed him away without giving him time to finish his sentence bidding him go and see whether the gig was ready for it was time to be going home as george was standing in the yard looking at the mechanism of the onehorse chaise and observing how the horse was put to somebody tapped him upon the shoulder and looking up he saw a gentleman with a very goodnatured countenance who smiled upon him and asked him whether he was the little boy who had just been talking so loud in the bar yes sir says george you seem to be a good little boy added he and i liked what i heard you say very much so you will not do any thing when your mother is not by that you would not do if she was herewas not that what you said yes sir as well as i remember and who is your mother continued the gentleman where does she live george told him his mothers name and where she lived and the gentleman said i will call at your mothers house as i go home and tell her what i heard you say and i will ask her to let you come to my house where you will see a little boy of your own age whom i should be very glad to have seen behave as well as you did just now mr belton for that was the name of the gentleman who took notice of george was a rich carpet manufacturer he had a countryhouse near paddington and the acquaintance which was thus begun became a source of great happiness to george mr belton lent him several entertaining books and took him to see many curious things in london ellen was rejoiced to hear from him the praises of her son all the pleasure of ellens life had for some months past depended upon this boy for her husband was seldom at home and the gloom that was spread over his countenance alarmed her whenever she saw him as for mrs dolly she was no companion for ellen her love of drinking had increased to such a degree that she could love nothing else and when she was not half intoxicated she was in such low spirits that she sat either on the side of her bed or in her armchair wrapped in a shawl sighing and crying and seesawing herself and sometimes she complained to maurice that ellen did not care whether she was dead or alive and at others that george had always something or other to do and never liked to sit in her room and keep her company besides all this she got into a hundred petty quarrels with the neighbours who had a knack of remembering what she said when she was drunk and appealing to her for satisfaction when she was sober mrs dolly regularly expected that ellen should as she called it stand her friend in these altercations to which ellen could not always in justice consent ah said ellen to herself one night as she was sitting up late waiting for her husbands return home it is not the having five thousand pounds that makes people happy when maurice loved to come home after his days work to our little cottage and when our george was his delight as he is mine then i was light of heart but now it is quite otherwise however there is no use in complaining nor in sitting down to think upon melancholy things and ellen started up and went to work to mend one of her husbands waistcoats whilst she was at this employment she listened continually for the return of maurice the clock struck twelve and one and no husband came she heard no noise in the street when she opened her window for every body but herself was in bed and asleep at last she heard the sound of footsteps but it was so dark that she could not see who the person was who continued walking backwards and forwards just underneath the window is it you maurice are you there maurice said ellen the noise of the footsteps ceased and ellen again said is it you maurice are you there yes answered maurice it is i why are you not abed and asleep at this time of night i am waiting for you replied ellen you need not wait for me i have the key of the house door in my pocket and can let myself in whenever i choose it and dont you choose it now said ellen no shut down the window ellen shut the window and went and sat down upon the side of her boys bed he was sleeping ellen who could not sleep took up her work again and resolved to wait till her husband should come in at last the key turned in the house door and presently she heard her husbands steps coming softly towards the room where she was sitting he opened the door gently as if he expected to find her asleep and was afraid of awakening her he started when he saw her and slouching his hat over his face threw himself into a chair without speaking a single word something terrible has happened to him surely thought ellen and her hand trembled so that she could scarcely hold her needle when she tried to go on working what are you doing there ellen said he suddenly pushing back his hat im only mending your waistcoat love said ellen in a faltering voice i am a wretch a fool a miserable wretch exclaimed maurice starting up and striking his forehead with violence as he walked up and down the room what can be the matter said ellen it is worse to me to see you in this way than to hear whatever misfortune has befallen you dont turn away from me husband who in the world loves you so well as i do oh ellen said he letting her take his hand but still turning away you will hate me when you know what i have done i cannot hate you i believe said ellen we have not sixpence left in the world continued maurice vehemently we must leave this house tomorrow we must sell all we have i must go to jail ellen you must work all the rest of your days harder than ever you did and so must that poor boy who lies sleeping yonder he little thinks that his father has made a beggar of him and that whilst his mother was the best of mothers to him his father was ruining him her and himself with a pack of rascals at the gamingtable ellen i have lost every shilling of our money is that all said ellen thats bad but i am glad that you have done nothing wicked we can work hard and be happy again only promise me now dear husband that you will never game any more maurice threw himself upon his knees and swore that he never to the last hour of his life would go to any gamingtable again or play at any game of chance ellen then said all she could to soothe and console him she persuaded him to take some rest of which he was much in need for his looks were haggard and he seemed quite exhausted he declared that he had not had a nights good sleep for many months since he had got into these difficulties by gaming his mind had been kept in a continual flurry and he seemed as if he had been living in a fever the worst of it was ellen said he i could not bear to see you or the boy when i had been losing so i went on gaming deeper and deeper in hopes of winning back what i had lost and i now and then won and they coaxed me and told me i was getting a run of luck and it would be a sin to turn my back on good fortune this way i was ticed to go on playing till when i betted higher and higher my luck left me or as i shrewdly suspect the rascals did not play fair and they won stake after stake till they made me half mad and i risked all i had left upon one throw and lost it and when i found i had lost all and thought of coming home to you and our boy i was ready to hang myself oh ellen if you knew all i have felt i would not live over again the last two years for this room full of gold such are the miserable feelings and such the life of a gamester maurice slept for a few hours or rather dozed starting now and then and talking of cards and dice and sometimes grinding his teeth and clenching his hand till he wakened himself by the violence with which he struck the side of the bed i have had a terrible dream wife said he when he opened his eyes and saw ellen sitting beside him on the bed at first he did not recollect what had really happened but as ellen looked at him with sorrow and compassion in her countenance he gradually remembered all the truth and hiding his head under the bedclothes he said he wished he could sleep again if it could be without dreaming such dreadful things it was in vain that he tried to sleep so he got up resolving to try whether he could borrow twenty guineas from any of his friends to pay the most pressing of his gaming companions the first person he asked was mrs dolly she fell into an hysteric fit when she heard of his losses and it was not till after she had swallowed a double dram of brandy that she was able to speak and to tell him that she was the worst person in the world he could have applied to for that she was in the greatest distress herself and all her dependance in this world was upon him maurice stood in silent astonishment why cousin said he i thought and always believed that you had a power of money you know when you came to live with us you told me so no matter what i told you said mrs dolly folks cant live upon air yesterday the landlady of the publichouse at the bowlinggreen whom im sure i looked upon as my friendbut theres no knowing ones friendssent me in a bill as long as my arm and the apothecary here has another against me worse again and the man at the liverystables for onehorse chays and jobs that im sure i forgot ever having comes and charges me the lord knows what and then the grocer for tea and sugar which i have been giving to folks from whom i have got no thanks and then i have an account with the linendraper of i dont know how much hut he has overcharged me i know scandalously for my last three shawls and then i have never paid for my set of tea china and half of the cups are broke and the silver spoons and i cant tell what besides in short mrs dolly who had never kept any account of what she spent had no idea how far she was getting into a tradesmans debt till his bill was brought home and was in great astonishment to find when all her bills were sent in that she had spent four hundred and fifty pounds in her private expenses drinking included in the course of three years and eight months she had now nothing left to live upon but one hundred pounds so that she was more likely to be a burden to maurice than any assistance he however was determined to go to a friend who had frequently offered to lend him any sum of money he might want and who had often been his partner at the gamingtable in his absence ellen and george began to take a list of all the furniture in the house that it might be ready for a sale and mrs dolly sat in her armchair weeping and wailing oh laud laud that i should live to see all this cried she ah lackadaisy lackadaisy lackaday what will become of me oh la la la la her lamentations were interrupted by a knock at the door hark a knock a double knock at the door cried mrs dolly who is it ah lackaday when people come to know what has happened it will be long enough before we have any more visitors long enough before we hear any more double knocks at the door oh laud laud see who it is george it was mr belton who was come to ask george to go with him and his little nephew to see some wild beasts at exeterchange he was much surprised at the sorrowful faces of george and ellen whom he had always been used to see so cheerful and inquired what misfortune had befallen them mrs dolly thought she could tell the story best so she detailed the whole with many piteous ejaculations but the silent resignation of ellens countenance had much more effect upon mr belton george said he must stay to finish the inventory he is writing for his mother mr belton was inquiring more particularly into the amount of maurices debts and the names of the persons to whom he had lost his money at the gamingtable when the unfortunate man himself came home no hope ellen cried he no hope from any of those rascals that i thought my friends no hope he stopped short seeing a stranger in the room for mr belton was a stranger to him my husband can tell you the names of all the people said ellen who have been the ruin of us mr belton then wrote them down from maurices information and learned from him that he had lost to these sharpers upwards of three thousand eight hundred pounds in the course of three years that the last night he played he had staked the goods in his shop valued at l and lost them that afterwards he staked the furniture of his house valued at l this also he lost and so left the gamingtable without a farthing in the world it is not my intention said mr belton to add to your present suffering mr robinson by pointing out that it has arisen entirely from your own imprudence nor yet can i say that i feel much compassion for you for i have always considered a gamester as a most selfish being who should be suffered to feel the terrible consequences of his own avaricious folly as a warning to others oh sir oh mr belton cried ellen bursting now for the first time into tears do not speak so harshly to maurice to you i shall not speak harshly said mr belton his voice and looks changing for i have the greatest compassion for such an excellent wife and mother and i shall take care that neither you nor your son whom you have taken such successful pains to educate shall suffer by the folly and imprudence in which you had no share as to the ready money which your husband has lost and paid to these sharpers it is i fear irrecoverable but the goods in your shop and the furniture in your house i will take care shall not be touched i will go immediately to my attorney and direct him to inquire into the truth of all i have been told and to prosecute these villains for keeping a gamingtable and playing at unlawful games finish that inventory which you are making out george and give it to me i will have the furniture in your house ellen valued by an appraiser and will advance you money to the amount on which you may continue to live in comfort and credit trusting to your industry and integrity to repay me in small sums as you find it convenient out of the profits of your shop oh sir cried maurice clasping his hands with a strong expression of joy thank you thank you from the bottom of my soul save her from misery save the boy and let me suffer as i ought for my folly mr belton in spite of his contempt for gamesters was touched by maurices repentance but keeping a steady countenance replied in a firm tone suffering for folly does nobody any good unless it makes them wiser in future chapter iii mrs dolly who had been unaccountably awed to silence by mr beltons manner of speaking and looking broke forth the moment he had left the house very genteel indeed though he might have taken more notice of me see what it is george to have the luck of meeting with good friends see what it is to deserve good friends george said ellen youll all remember i hope said mrs dolly raising her voice that it was i who was the first and foremost cause of all this by taking george along with me to the teadrinking at the bowlinggreen where he first got acquainted with mr belton mr belton would never have troubled his head about such a little boy as george said ellen if it had not been foryou know what i mean mrs dolly all i wish to say is that georges own good behaviour was the cause of our getting acquainted with this good friend and i am sure you were the cause mother said george of what you call my good behaviour mrs dolly somewhat vexed at this turn changed the conversation saying well tis no matter how we made such a good acquaintance let us make the most of him and drink his health as becomes us after dinner and now i suppose all will go on as usual none of our acquaintance in paddington need know any thing of what has happened ellen who was very little solicitous about what mrs dollys acquaintance in paddington might think observed that so far from going on as usual now they were living on borrowed money it was fit they should retrench all their expenses and give up the drawingroom and parlour of the house to lodgers so then we are to live like shabby wretches for the rest of our days cried mrs dolly better live like what we are poor but industrious people replied ellen and then we shall never be forced to do any thing shabby ay ellen you are as you always are in the right and all i desire now in this world is to make up for the past and to fall to work in some way or other for idleness was what first led me to the gamingtable mrs dolly opposed these good resolutions and urged maurice to send george to mr belton to beg him to lend them some more money since he is in the humour to be generous and since he has taken a fancy to us said she why not take him at his word and make punch whilst the waters hot but all that mrs dolly said was lost upon ellen who declared that she would never be so mean as to encroach upon such a generous friend and maurice protested that nothing that man woman or devil could say should persuade him to live in idleness another year he sent george the next morning to mr belton with a letter requesting that he would procure employment for him and stating what he thought himself fit for amongst other things he mentioned that he could keep accounts that he could write a good hand was evident from his letter mr belton at this time wanted a clerk in his manufactory and upon maurices repeating his promise never more to frequent the gamingtable mr belton after a trial engaged him as his clerk at a salary of per annum every thing now went on well for some months maurice on whom his wifes kindness had made a deep impression became thoroughly intent upon his business and anxious to make her some amends for his past follies his heart was now at ease he came home after his days work at the countinghouse with an open cheerful countenance and ellen was perfectly happy they sold all the furniture that was too fine for their present way of life to the new lodgers who took the drawingroom and front parlour of their house and lived on the profits of their shop which being well attended was never in want of customers one night at about ten oclock as little george was sitting reading the history of sandford and merton in which he was much interested he was roused by a loud knocking at the house door he ran to open it but how much was he shocked at the sight he beheld it was mrs dolly her leg broken and her skull fractured ellen had her brought in and laid upon a bed and a surgeon was immediately sent for when maurice inquired how this terrible accident befel mrs dolly the account he received was that she was riding home from the bowlinggreen publichouse much intoxicated that she insisted upon stopping to get a glass of peppermint and brandy for her stomach that seeing she had drunk too much already every thing possible was done to prevent her from taking any more but she would not be advised she said she knew best what agreed with her constitution so she alighted and took the brandy and peppermint and when she was to get upon her horse again not being in her right senses she insisted upon climbing up by a gate that was on the roadside instead of going as she was advised to a bank that was a little further on the gate was not steady the horse being pushed moved she fell broke her leg and fractured her skull she was a most shocking spectacle when she was brought home at first she was in great agony but she afterwards fell into a sort of stupor and lay speechless the surgeon arrived he set her leg and during this operation she came to her senses but it was only the sensibility of pain she was then trepanned but all was to no purposeshe died that night and of all the friends as she called them who used to partake in her teadrinkings and merrymakings not one said more when they heard of her death than ah poor mrs dolly she was always fond of a comfortable glass twas a pity it was the death of her at last several tradesmen to whom she died in debt were very loud in their complaints and the landlady at the bowlinggreen did not spare her memory she went so far as to say that it was a shame such a drunken quean should have a christian burial what little clothes mrs dolly left at her death were given up to her creditors she had owed maurice ten guineas ever since the first month of their coming to paddington and when she was on her deathbed during one of the intervals that she was in her senses she beckoned to maurice and told him in a voice scarcely intelligible he would find in her lefthand pocket what she hoped would pay him the ten guineas he had lent to her however upon searching this pocket no money was to be found except sixpence in halfpence nor was there any thing of value about her they turned the pocket inside out and shook it they opened every paper that came out of it but these were all old bills ellen at last examined a new shawl which had been thrust into this pocket and which was all crumpled up she observed that one of the corners was doubled down and pinned and upon taking out the yellow crooked pin she discovered under the corner of the shawl a bit of paper much soiled with snuff and stained with liquor how it smells of brandy said ellen as she opened it what is it maurice it is not a bank note it is a lottery ticket i do believe cried maurice ay that it is she put into the lottery without letting us know any thing of the matter well as she said perhaps this may pay me my ten guineas and overpay me who knows we were lucky with our last ticket and why should not we be as lucky with this or luckier hey ellen we might have ten thousand pounds or twenty thousand pounds this time instead of five why not hey ellen but maurice observing that ellen looked grave and was not much charmed with the lottery ticket suddenly changed his tone and said now dont you ellen go to think that my head will run on nothing but this here lottery ticket it will make no difference on earth in me i shall mind my business just as well as if there was no such thing i promise you if it come up a prize well and good and if it come up a blank why well and good too so do you keep the ticket and i shall never think more about it ellen only before you put it by just let me look at the number what makes you smile i smiled only because i think i know you better than you know yourself but perhaps that should not make me smile said ellen and she gave a deep sigh now wife why will you sigh i cant bear to hear you sigh said maurice angrily i tell you i know myself and have a right to know myself i say a great deal better than you do and so none of your sighs wife ellen rejoiced to see that his pride worked upon him in this manner and mildly told him she was very glad to find he thought so much about her sighs why said maurice you are not one of those wives that are always taunting and scolding their husbands and thats the reason i take it why a look or a word from you goes so far with me he paused for a few moments keeping his eyes fixed upon the lottery ticket then snatching it up he continued this lottery ticket may tempt me to game again for as william deane said putting into the lottery is gaming and the worst sort of gaming so ellen ill show you that though i was a fool once ill never be a fool again all your goodness was not thrown away upon me ill go and sell this lottery ticket immediately at the office for whatever it is worth and youll give me a kiss when i come home again i know ellen maurice pleased with his own resolution went directly to the lottery office to sell his ticket he was obliged to wait some time for the place was crowded with persons who came to inquire after tickets which they had insured many of these ignorant imprudent poor people had hazarded guinea after guinea till they found themselves overwhelmed with debt and their liberty character and existence depending on the turning of the wheel what anxious faces did maurice behold how many he heard as they went out of the office curse their folly for having put into the lottery he pressed forward to sell his ticket how rejoiced he was when he had parted with this dangerous temptation and when he had received seventeen guineas in hand instead of anxious hopes how different were his feelings at this instant from those of many that were near him he stood to contemplate the scene here he saw a poor maidservant with scarcely clothes to cover her who was stretching her thin neck across the counter and asking the clerk in a voice of agony whether her ticket number was come up yet number answered the clerk with the most careless air imaginable yes turning over the leaves of his book number you sayyes it was drawn yesterdaya blank the wretched woman clasped her hands and burst into tears exclaiming then im undone nobody seemed to have time to attend to her a man servant in livery pushed her away saying you have your answer and have no more business here stopping the way pray sir is number the ticket ive insured footnote this was written before the act of parliament against insuring in lotteries so high come up today yes sirblank at the word blank the disappointed footman poured forth a volley of oaths declaring that he should be in jail before night to all which the lotteryoffice keeper only answered i cant help it sir i cant help it it is not my fault nobody is forced to put into the lottery sir nobodys obliged to insure sir twas your own choice sir dont blame me meanwhile a person behind the footman repeating the words he had addressed to the poor woman cried you have your answer sir dont stop the way maurice was particularly struck with the agitated countenance of one man who seemed as if the suspense of his mind had entirely bereaved him of all recollection when he was pressed forward by the crowd and found himself opposite to the clerk he was asked twice whats your business sir before he could speak and then could only utter the wordsnumber still in the wheel was the answer our messenger is not yet returned from guildhall with news of what has been drawn this last hour if you will call again at three we can answer you the man seemed to feel this as a reprieve but as he was retiring there came one with a slip of paper in his hand this was the messenger from guildhall who handed the paper to the clerk he read aloud number were you not inquiring for sir yes said the pale trembling man number is just come up sira blank at the fatal word blank the man fell flat upon his face in a swoon those near him lifted him out into the street for air here sir you are going without your change after waiting for it so long cried the clerk to maurice who touched with compassion for the man who had just fallen was following those who were carrying him out when he got into the street maurice saw the poor creature sitting on a stone supported by a hackneycoachman who held some vinegar to his nose at the same time asking him if he did not want a coach a coach oh no said the man as he opened his eyes i have not a farthing of money in the world the hackneycoachman swore that was a sad case and ran across the street to offer his services where they could be paid for a coach if you want one sir heavy rain coming on said he looking at the silver which he saw through the halfclosed fingers of maurices hand yes i want a coach said maurice and bade the coachman draw up to the stone where the poor man who had swooned was sitting maurice was really a goodnatured fellow and he had peculiar pity for the anguish this man seemed to feel because he recollected what he had suffered himself when he had been ruined at the gamingtable you are not able to walk here is a coach i will go your way and set you down sir said maurice the unfortunate man accepted this offer as they went along he sighed bitterly and once said with great vehemence curse these lotteries curse these lotteries maurice now rejoiced more than ever at having conquered his propensity to gaming and at having sold his ticket when they came opposite to a hosiers shop in oxfordstreet the stranger thanked him and desired to be set down this is my home said he or this was my home i ought to say pointing to his shop as he let down the coachglass a sad warning example i am but i am troubling you sir with what no way concerns you i thank you sir for your civility added he turning away from maurice to hide the tears which stood in his eyes good day to you he then prepared to get out of the coach but whilst the coachman was letting down the step a gentleman came out of the hosiers shop to the door and cried mr fulham i am glad you are come at last i have been waiting for you this halfhour and was just going away maurice pulled aside the flap of the hosiers coat as he was getting out that he might peep at the gentleman who spoke the voice was so like william deanes that he was quite astonishedit isit is william deane cried maurice jumping out of the coach and shaking hands with his friend william deane though now higher in the world than robinson was heartily glad to see him again and to renew their old intimacy mr fulham said he turning to the hosier excuse me today ill come and settle accounts with you tomorrow on their way to paddington maurice related to his friend all that had passed since they parted how his good luck in the lottery tempted him to try his fortune at the gamingtable how he was cheated by sharpers and reduced to the brink of utter ruin how kind ellen was towards him in this distress how he was relieved by mr belton who was induced to assist him from regard to ellen and little george how mrs dolly drank herself into ill health which would soon have killed her if she had not in a drunken fit shortened the business by fracturing her skull and lastly how she left him a lottery ticket which he had just sold lest it should be the cause of fresh imprudence you see added maurice i do not forget all you said to me about lotteriesbetter take good advice late than never but now tell me your history no replied william deane that i shall keep till we are all at dinner ellen and you i and my friend george who i hope has not forgotten me he was soon convinced that george had not forgotten him by the joy he showed at seeing him again at dinner william deane informed them that he was become a rich man by having made an improvement in the machinery of the cottonmills which after a great deal of perseverance he had brought to succeed in practice when i say that i am a rich man continued he i mean richer than ever i expected to be i have a share in the cottonmill and am worth about two thousand pounds ay said maurice you have trusted to your own sense and industry and not to gaming and lotteries i am heartily rejoiced you have nothing more to do with them said william deane but all this time you forget that i am your debtor you lent me five guineas at a season when i had nothing the books i bought with your money helped me to knowledge without which i should never have got forward now i have a scheme for my little friend george that will i hope turn out to your liking you say he is an intelligent honest industrious lad and that he understands bookkeeping and writes a good hand i am sure he is much obliged to you for giving him a good education to his mother there hes obliged for it all said maurice without it continued william deane i might wish him very well but i could do little or nothing for him but as i was going to tell you that unfortunate man whom you brought to his own door in the hackneycoach today maurice is a hosier who had as good a business as most in the city but he has ruined himself entirely by gaming he is considerably in our debt for cotton and i am to settle accounts with him tomorrow when he is to give up all his concerns into my hands in behalf of his brother who has commissioned me to manage the business and dissolve the partnership as he cannot hazard himself even out of friendship for a brother with one that has taken to gaming now my friend the elder fulham is a steady man and is in want of a good lad for an apprentice with your leave i will speak to him and get him to take george and as to the fee i will take care and settle that for you i am glad i have found you all out at last no thanks pray recollect i am only paying my old debts as william deane desired to have no thanks we shall omit the recital of those which he received both in words and looks we have only to inform our readers further that george was bound apprentice to the hosier that he behaved as well as might be expected from his excellent education that maurice continued in mr beltons service to conduct himself so as to secure the confidence and esteem of his master and that he grew fonder and fonder of home and of ellen who enjoyed the delightful reflection that she had effected the happiness of her husband and her son may equal happiness attend every such good wife and mother and may every man who like maurice is tempted to be a gamester reflect that a good character and domestic happiness which cannot be won in any lottery are worth more than the five thousand or even the ten thousand pounds prize let any mrs dolly in christendom say what she will to the contrary sept rosanna chapter i there are two sorts of content one is connected with exertion the other with habits of indolence the first is a virtue the second a vice examples of both may be found in abundance in ireland there you may sometimes see a man in sound health submitting day after day to evils which a few hours labour would remedy and you are provoked to hear him say it will do well enough for me didnt it do for my father before me i can make a shift with things for my time any how im content this kind of content is indeed the bane of industry but instances of a different sort may be found in various of the irish peasantry amongst them we may behold men struggling with adversity with all the strongest powers of mind and body and supporting irremediable evils with a degree of cheerful fortitude which must excite at once our pity and admiration in a pleasant village in the province of leinster there lives a family of the name of gray whether or not they are any way related to old robin gray history does not determine but it is very possible that they are because they came it is said originally from the north of ireland and one of the sons is actually called robin leaving this point however in the obscurity which involves the early history of the most ancient and illustrious families we proceed to less disputable and perhaps more useful facts it is well known that is by all his neighbours that farmer gray began life with no very encouraging prospects he was the youngest of a large family and the portion of his fathers property that fell to his share was but just sufficient to maintain his wife and three children at his fathers death he had but l in ready money and he was obliged to go into a poor mudwalled cabin facing the door of which there was a green pool of stagnant water and before the window of one pane a dunghill that reaching to the thatch of the roof shut out the light and filled the house with the most noisome smell the ground sloped towards the house door so that in rainy weather when the pond was full the kitchen was overflowed and at all times the floor was so damp and soft that the print of the nails of brogues was left in it wherever the wearer set down his foot to be sure these nailmarks could scarcely be seen except just near the door or where the light of the fire immediately shone because elsewhere the smoke was so thick that the pig might have been within a foot of you without your seeing him the former inhabitants of this mansion had it seems been content without a chimney and indeed almost without a roof the couples and purlins of the roof having once given way had never been repaired and swagged down by the weight of the thatch so that the ends threatened the wigs of the unwary the prospect without doors was scarcely more encouraging to our hero than the scene within the farm consisted of about forty acres and the fences of the grazingland were so bad that the neighbours cattle took possession of it frequently by day and always by night the tillageground had been so ill managed by his predecessor that the land was what is called quite out of heart if farmer gray had also been out of heart he and his family might at this hour have been beggars his situation was thought desperate by many of his neighbours and a few days after his fathers decease many came to condole with him amongst the rest was easy simon or as some called him soft simon on account of his unresisting disposition and contented or as we should rather name it reckless temper he was a sort of a half or a half quarter gentleman had a small patrimony of a hundred or a hundred and fifty pounds a year a place in the excise worth fifty more and a mill which might have been worth another hundred annually had it not been suffered to stand still for many a year wheugh wheugh what a bustle we are in and what a world of trouble is here cried simon when he came to grays house and found him on the ladder taking off the decayed thatch whilst one of his sons a lad of about fourteen was hard at work filling a cart from the dunghill which blockaded the window his youngest son a boy of twelve with a face and neck red with heat was making a drain to carry off the water from the green pond and rose the sister a girl of ten years old was collecting the ducks which her mother was going to carry to her landlords to sell wheugh wheugh wheugh why what a world of bustle and trouble is here troth jemmy gray youre in a bad way sure enough poor cratur poor cratur no man replied gray deserves to be called poor that has his health and the use of his limbs besides continued he have not i a good wife and good children and with those blessings has not a man sufficient reason to be content ay to be sure thats the only way to get through this world said simon whatever comes just to take it easy and be content content and a warm chimney corner is all in all according to my notion yes simon said gray laughing but your kind of content would never do for me content that sits down in the chimney corner and does nothing but smoke his pipe will soon have the house about his ears and then what will become of content time enough to think of that when it comes said simon fretting never propped a house yet and if it did i would rather see it fall than fret but could not you prop the house said gray without fretting is it by putting my shoulders to it said simon my shoulders have never been used to hard work and dont like it any way as long as i can eat drink and sleep and have a coat to my back what matter for the rest let the world go as it will im content shoo shoo the button is off the neck of this great coat of mine and how will i keep it on a pin sure will do as well as a button and better mrs gray or miss rose ill thank you kindly for a pin he stuck the pin in the place of the button to fasten the great coat round his throat and walked off it pricked his chin about a dozen times before the day was over but he forgot the next day and the next and the next to have the button sewed on he was content to make shift as he called it with the pin this is precisely the species of content which leads to beggary not such the temper of our friend gray not an inconvenience that he could remedy by industry or ingenuity was he content to endure but necessary evils he bore with unshaken patience and fortitude his house was soon new roofed and new thatched the dunghill was removed and spread over that part of his land which most wanted manure the putrescent water of the standing pool was drained off and fertilized a meadow and the kitchen was never again overflowed in rainy weather because the labour of half a day made a narrow trench which carried off the water the prints of the shoenails were no longer visible in the floor for the two boys trod dry mill seeds into the clay and beat the floor well till they rendered it quite hard and even the rooms also were cleared of smoke for gray built a chimney and the kitchen window which had formerly been stuffed up when the wind blew too hard with an old or new hat was glazed there was now light in the house light the great friend of cleanliness and order the pig could now no longer walk in and out unseen and unreproved he ceased to be an inmate of the kitchen the kitchen was indeed so altered from what it had been during the reign of the last master that he did not know it again it was not in the least like a pigsty the walls were whitewashed and shelves were put up on which clean wooden and pewter utensils were ranged there were no heaps of forlorn rubbish in the corners of the room nor even an old basket or a blanket or a cloak or a great coat thrown down just for a minute out of the girls way no rose was a girl who always put every thing in its place and she found it almost as easy to hang a coat or a cloak upon a peg as to throw it down on the floor she thought it as convenient to put the basket and turfkish out of her way when her brothers had brought in the potatoes and fuel as to let them lie in the middle of the kitchen to be stumbled over by herself and her mother or to be gnawed and clawed by a cat and dog these may seem trifles unworthy the notice of the historian but trifles such as these contribute much to the comfort of a poor family and therefore deserve a place in their simple annals it was a matter of surprise and censure to some of farmer grays neighbours that he began by laying out it could not be less than ten pounds a great sum for him on his house and garden at the first setting out when to be sure the land would have paid him better if the money had been laid out there and why could not he make a shift to live on in the old cabin for a while as others had done before his time well enough a poor man should be contented with a poor house where was the use said they of laying out the good ready penny in a way that would bring nothing in farmer gray calculated that he could not have laid out his money to better advantage for by these ten pounds he had probably saved his wife his children and himself from a putrid fever or from the rheumatism the former inhabitants of this house who had been content to live with the dunghill close to the window and the green pool overflowing the kitchen and the sharp wind blowing in through the broken panes had in the course of a few years lost their health the father of the family had been crippled by the rheumatism two children died of the fever and the mother had such an inflammation in her eyes that she could not see to work spin or do anything now the whole that was lost by the family sickness the doctors bill and the burying of the two children all together came in three years to nearly three times ten pounds therefore mr gray was if we only consider money a very prudent man what could he or any body do without health money is not the first thing to be thought of in this world for there are many things that money cannot buy and health is one of them health can make money but money cannot make health said our wise farmer and then for the value of a few shillings say pounds we have light to see what we are doing and shelves and a press to hold our clothes in why now this will be all so much saved to us by and by for the clothes will last the longer and the things about us will not go to wreck and when i and the boys can come home after our days work to a house like this we may be content having thus ensured as far as it was in his power health cleanliness and comfort in his house our hero and his sons turned their attention to the farm they set about to repair all the fences for the boys though they were young were able to help their father in the farm they were willing to work and happy to work with him john the eldest lad could set potatoes and robin was able to hold the plough so that gray did not hire any servantboy to help him nor did mrs gray hire a maid rose and i said she can manage very well to look after the two cows and milk them and make the butter and get something too by our spinning we must do without servants and may be happy and content to serve ourselves times will grow better that is we shall make them better every year we must have the roughest first said gray the first year to be sure it was rough enough and do what they could they could not do more than make the rent of the farm which rent amounted to forty pounds the landlord was a mr hopkins agent to a gentleman who resided in england mr hopkins insisted upon having the rent paid up to the day and so it was gray contented himself by thinking that this was perhaps for the best when the rent is once paid said he it cannot be called for again and i am in no mans power thats a great comfort to be sure if the half years rent was left in my hands for a few months it might have been of service but it is better not to be under an obligation to such a man as mr hopkins who would make us pay for it in some shape or other when we least expected it mr hopkins was what is called in ireland a middleman one that takes land from great proprietors to set it again at an advanced and often an exorbitant price to the poor gray had his land at a fair rent because it was not from mr hopkins his father had taken the lease but from the gentleman to whom this man was agent mr hopkins designed to buy the land which gray farmed and he therefore wished to make it appear as unprofitable as possible to his landlord who living in england knew but little of his own estate if these grays dont pay the rent said he to his driver pound their cattle and sell at the end of eight days if they break and run away i shall have the land clear and may make a compliment of it to tenants and friends of my own after it comes into my hands he was rather disappointed when the rent was paid to the day but said he it wont be so next year the man is laying out his money on the ground on draining and fencing and that wont pay suddenly well leave the rent in his hands for a year or so and bring down an ejectment upon him if he once gets into our power as he surely will then all that he has done to the house will be so much in my way what a fool he was to lay out his money so it happened however that the money which gray had laid out in making his house comfortable and neat was of the greatest advantage to him and at a time and in a way which he least expected his cottage was within sight of the high road that led to a town from which it was about a mile distant a regiment of english arrived to be quartered in the town and the wives of some of the soldiers came a few hours after their husbands one of these women a sergeants wife was taken suddenly in labour before they reached the town and the soldier who conducted the baggagecart in which she was drew up to the first amongst a row of miserable cabins that were by the roadside to ask the people if they would give her lodging but the sick woman was shocked at the sight of the smoke and dirt of this cabin and begged to be carried on to the neat whitewashed cottage that she saw at a little distance this was grays house his wife received the stranger with the greatest kindness and hospitality she was able to offer her a neat bed and a room that was perfectly dry and clean the sergeants wife was brought to bed soon after her arrival and remained with mrs gray till she recovered her strength she was grateful for the kindness that was shown to her by mrs gray and so was her husband the sergeant he came one evening to the cottage and in his blunt english fashion said mr gray you know i or my wife which is the same thing have cause to be obliged to you or your wife which comes also to the same thing now one good turn deserves another our colonel has ordered me i being quartermaster to sell off by auction some of the cast horses belonging to the regiment now i have bought in the best for a trifle and have brought him here with me to beg youll accept of him by way some sort of a return for the civilities you and your wife that being as i said the same thing showed me and mine gray replied he was obliged to him for this offer of the horse but that he could not think of accepting it that he was very glad his wife had been able to show any kindness or hospitality to a stranger but that as they did not keep a publichouse they could not take any thing in the way of payment the sergeant was more and more pleased by farmer grays generosity well said he i heard before i came to ireland that the irish were the most hospitable people on the face of the earth and so i find it come true and i shall always say so wherever im quartered hereafter and now do pray answer me is there any the least thing i can ever do to oblige you for if the truth must be told of me i dont like to lie under an obligation any more than another where i can help it to show you that i do not want to lay you under one said gray ill tell you how you can do as much for me and ten times as much as i have done for you and this without hurting yourself or any of your employers a penny say how and it shall be done by letting me have the dung of the barracks which will make my land and me rich without making you poorer for ill give you the fair price whatever it is i dont ask you to wrong your employers of a farthing the sergeant promised this should be done and rejoiced that he had found some means of serving his friend gray covered ten acres with the manure brought from the barracks and the next year these acres were in excellent heart this was sufficient for the grazing of ten cows he had three and he bought seven more and with what remained of his hundred pounds after paying for the cows he built a shed and a cowhouse his wife and daughter rose who was now about fourteen were excellent managers of the dairy they made by butter and buttermilk about four pounds each cow within the year the butter they salted and took to market at the neighbouring town the buttermilk they sold to the country people who according to the custom of the neighbourhood came to the house for it besides this they reared five calves which at a year old they sold for fifteen guineas and a half the dairy did not however employ all the time of this industrious mother and daughter they had time for spinning and by this cleared six guineas they also made some little matter by poultry but that was only during the first year afterwards mr hopkins sent notice that they must pay all the dutyfowl and dutygeese and turkeys footnote see a very curious anecdote in the statistical survey of the queens county charged in the lease or compound with him by paying two guineas a year this gentleman had many methods of squeezing money out of poor tenants and he was not inclined to spare the grays whose farm he now more than ever wished to possess because its value had been considerably increased by the judicious industry of the farmer and his sons young as they were both farmer grays sons had a share in these improvements the eldest had drained a small field which used to be called the rushy field from its having been quite covered with rushes now there was not a rush to be found upon it and his father gave him the profits of the field and said that it should be called by his name robin the youngest son had by his fathers advice tried a little experiment which many of his neighbours ridiculed at first and admired at last the spring which used to supply the duckpond that often flooded the house was at the head of a meadow that sloped with a fall sufficient to let the water run off robin flooded the meadow at the proper season of the year and it produced afterwards a crop such as never had been seen there before his father called this meadow robins meadow and gave him the value of the hay that was made upon it now my dear boys said this good father you have made a few guineas for yourselves and here are a few more for you all that i can spare let us see what you can do with this money i shall take a pride in seeing you get forward by your own industry and cleverness i dont want you to slave for me all your best days but shall always be ready as a father should be to give you a helping hand the sons had scarcely a word in answer to this for their hearts were full but that night when they were by themselves one said to the other brother did you see jack reels letter to his father they say he has sent home ten guineas to him is there any truth in it think you yes i saw the letter and a kinder never was written from son to father footnote this is fact the ten guineas i saw paid into the old mans hand and at that same minute i wished it was i that was doing the same by my own father that was just what i was thinking of when i asked you if you saw the letter why jack reel had nothing when he went abroad with the army to egypt last year well i never had a liking myself to follow the drum but its almost enough to tempt one to it if i thought i could send home ten guineas to my father i would list tomorrow that would not be well done of you robin said john for my father would rather have you a great deal than the ten guineas i am sure to say nothing of my poor mother and rose and myself who would be sorry enough to hear of your being knocked on the head as is the fate sooner or later of them that follow the army i would rather be any of the trades that hurt nobody and do good to a many along with myself as father said tother day then what a man makes so he makes with a safe conscience and he can enjoy it you are right john and i was wrong to talk of listing said robin but it was only jack reels letter and the ten guineas sent to his father that put it into my head i may make as much for my father by staying at home and minding my business so now good night to you ill go to sleep and we can talk more about it all tomorrow the next morning as these two youths were setting potatoes for the family and considering to what they should turn their hands when the potatoes were all set they were interrupted by a little gossoon who came running up as hard as he could crying murder murder simon odougherty wants you for the love of god cross the bog in all haste to help pull out his horse that has tumbled into the old tanpit there beyond in the night the two brothers immediately followed the boy carrying with them a rope and a halter as they guessed that soft simon would not have either they found him wringing his hands beside the tanpit in which his horse lay smothering a little ragged boy was tugging at the horses head with a short bit of hayrope oh murder murder what will i do for a halter sure the horse will be lost for want of a halter and where in the wide world will i look for one cried simon without stirring one inch from the spot oh the blessing of heaven be with you lads continued he turning at the sight of the grays youve brought us a halter but see its just over with the poor beast all the world put together will not get him alive out of that i must put up with the loss and be content he cost me fifteen good guineas and he could leap better than any horse in the county oh what a pity on him what a pity but take it easy thats all we have for it poor cratur poor cratur without listening to simons lamentations the active lads by the help of simon and the two boys pulled the horse out of the pit the poor animal was nearly exhausted by struggling but after some time he stretched himself and by degrees recovered sufficiently to stand one of his legs however was so much hurt that he could scarcely walk and simon said he would surely go lame for life who now would ever have thought of his straying into such an ugly place of all others continued he i know for my share the spot is so overgrown with grass and rubbish of one kind or other and its so long since any of the tanning business was going on here in my uncle ohaggartys time that i quite forgot there were such things as tanpits or any manner of pits in my possession and i wish these had been far enough off before my own little famous sir hyacinth obrien had strayed into them laming himself for life like a blockhead for the case was this i came home late last night not as sober as a judge and finding no one up but the girl i gave her the horse to put into the stable and she forgot the door after her which wants a lock and there being but a scanty feed of oats owing to the boys negligence and no halter to secure the beast my poor sir hyacinth strayed out here as ill luck would have it into the tanpit bad luck to my uncle ohaggarty that had the tanyard here at all he might have lived as became him without dirtying his hands with the tanning of dirty hides i was just going said john gray to comfort you simon for the laming of your horse by observing that if you had your tanyard in order again you could soon make up the price of another horse ohoo i would not be bothered with anything of the kind theres the mill of rosanna there beyond was the plague of my life till it stopped and i was glad to have fairly done with it them that come after me may set it agoing again and welcome i have enough just to serve my time and am content any way but if you could get a fair rent for the tanyard would you let it said john to that i should make no objection in life provided i had no trouble with it replied simon and if you could get somebody to keep the mill of rosanna going without giving you any trouble you would not object to that would you said robin not i to be sure replied simon laughing whatever god sends be it more or less i am content but i would not have you think me a fool for all i talk so easy about the matter i know very well what i might have got for the mill some years ago when first it stopped if i would have let it to the man that proposed for it but though he was as substantial a tenant as you could see yet he affronted me once at the last election by calling a freeholder of mine over the coals and so i was proud of an opportunity to show him i did not forget so i refused to let him the mill on any terms and i made him a speech for his pride to digest at the same time mr hopkins said i the lands of rosanna have been in my family these two hundred years and upwards and though nowadays many men think that every thing is to be done for money and though you mr hopkins have made as much money as most men could in the same timeall which i dont envy youyet i must make bold to tell you that the lands of rosanna or any part or parcel thereof is what youll never have whilst im alive mr hopkins for love or money the spirit of the odoughertys was up within me and though all the world calls me easy simon i have my own share of proper spirit these mushroom moneymakers that start up from the very dirt under ones feet i cant for my part swallow them now i should be happy to give you a lease of the mill of rosanna after refusing hopkins for you and your father before you lads have been always very civil to me my tanpits and all i am ready to talk to you about and thank you for pulling my horse out for me this morning will you walk up and look at the mill i would attend you myself but must go to the farrier about sir hyacinths leg instead of standing talking here any longer good morning to you kindly the girl will give you the key of the mill and show you everything the same as myself simon gathered his great coat about him and walked away to the farrier whilst the two brothers rejoiced that they should see the mill without hearing him talk the whole time simon having nothing to do all day long but to talk was an indefatigable gossip when the lands of rosanna were in question or when his pride was touched he was terribly fluent chapter ii upon examining the mill which was a common oatmill john gray found that the upper millstone was lodged upon the lower and that this was all which prevented the mill from going no other part of it was damaged or out of repair as to the tanyard it was in great disorder but it was very conveniently situated was abundantly supplied with water on one side and had an oak copse at the back so that tan could readily be procured it is true that the bark of these oak trees which had been planted by his careful uncle ohaggarty had been much damaged since simon came into possession for he had with his customary negligence suffered cattle to get amongst them he had also to supply himself with ready money occasionally cut down a great deal of the best timber before it arrived at its full growth and at this time the grays found every tree of tolerable size marked for destruction with the initials of simon odoughertys name before they said anything more about the mill or the tanyard to simon these prudent brothers consulted their father he advised them to begin cautiously by offering to manage the mill and the tanyard during the ensuing season for simon for a certain share in the profits and then if they should find the business likely to succeed they might take a lease of the whole simon willingly made this agreement and there was no danger in dealing with him because though careless and indolent he was honest and would keep his engagements it was settled that john and robin should have the power at the end of the year either to hold or give up all concern in the mill and tanyard and in the mean time they were to manage the business for simon and to have such a share in the profits as would pay them reasonably for their time and labour they succeeded beyond their expectations in the management of the mill and tanyard during their year of probation and simon at the end of that time was extremely glad to give them a long lease of the premises upon their paying him down by way of fine the sum of l this sum their father who had good credit and who could give excellent security upon his farm which was now in a flourishing condition raised for them and they determined to repay him the money by regular yearly portions out of their profits success did not render these young men presumptuous or negligent they went on steadily with business were contented to live frugally and work hard for some years many of the sons of neighbouring tradesmen and farmers who were able perhaps to buy a horse or two or three good coats in a year and who set up for gentlemen and spent their days in hunting shooting or cockfighting thought that the grays were poorspirited fellows for sticking so close to business they prophesied that even when these brothers should have made a fortune they would not have the liberality to spend or enjoy it but this prediction was not verified the grays had not been brought up to place their happiness merely in the scraping together pounds shillings and pence they valued money for moneys worth not for moneys sake and amongst the pleasures it could purchase they thought that of contributing to the happiness of their parents and friends the greatest when they had paid their father the hundred and fifty pounds he had advanced their next object was to build a neat cottage for him near the wood and mill of rosanna on a beautiful spot upon which they had once heard him say that he should like to have a house we mentioned that mr hopkins the agent had a view to this farm and that he was desirous of getting rid of the grays but this he found no easy matter to accomplish because the rent was always punctually paid there was no pretence for driving even for the dutyfowls mrs gray always had them ready at the proper time mr hopkins was farther provoked by seeing the rich improvements which our farmer made every year on his land his envy which could be moved by the meanest objects of gain was continually excited by his neighbours successful industry today he envied him his green meadows and tomorrow the crocks of butter packed on the car for dublin farmer grays ten cows which regularly passed by mr hopkinss window morning and evening were a sight that often spoiled his breakfast and supper but that which grieved this envious man the most was the barrack manure he would stand at his window and with a heavy heart count the car loads that went by to grays farm once he made an attempt to ruin grays friend the sergeant by accusing him secretly of being bribed to sell the barrack manure to gray for less than he had been offered for it by others but the officer to whom mr hopkins made this complaint was fortunately a man who did not like secret informations he publicly inquired into the truth of the matter and the sergeants honesty and mr hopkinss meanness were clearly proved and contrasted the consequence of this malicious interference was beneficial to gray for the officer told the story to the colonel of the regiment which was next quartered in the town and he to the officer who succeeded him so that year after year mr hopkins applied in vain for the barrack manure farmer gray had always the preference and the hatred of mr hopkins knew no bounds that is no bounds but the letter of the law of which he was ever mindful because lawsuits are expensive at length however he devised a legal mode of annoying his enemy some land belonging to mr hopkins lay between grays farm and the only bog in the neighbourhood now he would not permit mr gray or any body belonging to him to draw turf upon his bogroad and he absolutely forbade his own wretched tenants to sell turf to the object of his envy by these means he flattered himself he should literally starve the enemy out of house and home things were in this situation when john and robin gray determined to build a house for their father at rosanna they made no secret to him of their intentions for they did not want to surprise but to please him and to do every thing in the manner that would be most convenient to him and their mother their sister rose was in all their counsels and it had been for the last three years one of her chief delights to go after her days work was done to the mill at rosanna to see how her brothers were going on how happy are those families where there is no envy or jealousy but in which each individual takes an interest in the prosperity of the whole farmer gray was heartily pleased with the gratitude and generosity of his boys as he still continued to call them though bythebye john was now threeandtwenty and his brother only two years younger my dear boys said he nothing could be more agreeable to me and your mother than to have a snug cottage near you both on the very spot which you say i pitched upon two years ago this cabin that we now live in after all i have tried to do to prop it up and notwithstanding all rose does to keep it neat and clean withinside is but a crazy sort of a place we are able now to have a better house and i shall be glad to be out of the reach of mr hopkinss persecution therefore let us set about and build the new house you shall contribute your share my boys but only a share mind i say only a share and i hope next year to contribute my share towards building a house for each of you it is time you should think of marrying and settling it is no bad thing to have a house ready for a bride we shall have quite a little colony of our own at rosanna who knows but i may live to see my grandchildren ay and my greatgrandchildren settled there all round me industrious and contented goodwill is almost as expeditious and effectual as aladdins lampthe new cottage for farmer gray was built at rosanna and he took possession of it the ensuing spring they next made a garden and furnished it with all sorts of useful vegetables and some pretty flowers rose had great pleasure in taking care of this garden her brothers also laid out a small green lawn before the door and planted the boundaries with whitethorn crabtrees lilacs and laburnums the lawn sloped down to the waterside and the mill and copse behind it were seen from the parlour windows a prettier cottage indeed so pretty a one was never before seen in this county but what was better far than the pretty cottage or the neat garden or the green lawn or the whitethorn the crabtrees the lilacs and the laburnums was the content that smiled amongst them many who have hundreds and thousands are miserable because they still desire more or rather because they know not what they would have for instance mr hopkins the rich mr hopkins who had scraped together in about fifteen years above twenty thousand some said thirty thousand pounds had never been happy for a single day either whilst he was making this fortune or when he had made it for he was of an avaricious discontented temper the more he had the more he desired he could not bear the prosperity of his neighbours and if his envy made him industrious yet it at the same time rendered him miserable though he was what the world calls a remarkably fortunate man yet the feelings of his own mind prevented him from enjoying his success he had no wife no children to share his wealth he would not marry because a wife is expensive and children are worse than taxes his whole soul was absorbed in the love of gain he denied himself not only the comforts but the common necessaries of life he was alone in the world he was conscious that no human being loved him he read his history in the eyes of all his neighbours it was known that he had risen upon the ruin of others and the higher he had risen the more conspicuous became the faults of his character whenever any man grew negligent of his affairs or by misfortune was reduced to distress hopkins was at hand to take advantage of his necessities his first approaches were always made under the semblance of friendship but his victims soon repented their imprudent confidence when they felt themselves in his power unrestrained by a sense of honour or the feelings of humanity he felt no scruple in pursuing his interest to the very verge of what the law would call fraud even his own relations complained that he duped them without scruple and none but strangers to his character or persons compelled by necessity would have any dealings with this man of what advantage to him or to any one else were the thousands he had accumulated it may be said that such beings are necessary in society that their industry is productive and that therefore they ought to be preferred to the idle unproductive members of the community but wealth and happiness are not the same things perhaps at some future period enlightened politicians may think the happiness of nations more important than their wealth in this point of view they would consider all the members of society who are productive of happiness as neither useless nor despicable and on the contrary they would contemn and discourage those who merely accumulate money without enjoying or dispensing happiness but some centuries must probably elapse before such a philosophic race of politicians can arise in the mean time let us go on with our story chapter iii mr hopkins was enraged when he found that his expected victim escaped his snares he saw the pretty cottage rise and the mill of rosanna work in despite of his malevolence he long brooded over his malice in silence as he stood one day on the top of a high mount on his own estate from which he had a view of the surrounding country his eyes fixed upon the little paradise in the possession of his enemies he always called those his enemies of whom he was the enemy this is no uncommon mistake in the language of the passions the rosanna mill shall be stopped before this day twelvemonth or my name is not hopkins said he to himself i have sworn vengeance against those grays but i will humble them to the dust before i have done with them i shall never sleep in peace till i have driven those people from the country it was however no easy matter to drive from the country such inoffensive inhabitants the first thing mr hopkins resolved upon was to purchase from simon odougherty the field adjoining to that in which the mill stood the brook flowed through this field and mr hopkins saw with malicious satisfaction that he could at a small expense turn the course of the stream and cut off the water from the mill poor simon by this time had reduced himself to a situation in which his pride was compelled to yield to pecuniary considerations within the last three years his circumstances had been materially changed whilst he was a bachelor his income had been sufficient to maintain him in idleness soft simon however at last took it into his head to marry or rather a cunning damsel who had been his mistress for some years took it into her head to make him marry she was skilled in the arts both of wheedling and scolding to resist these united powers was too much to be expected from a man of simons easy temper he argued thus with himselfshe has cost me more as she is than if she had been my wife twice over for she has no interest in looking after any thing belonging to me but only just living on from day to day and making the most for herself and her children and the children too all in the same way snatching what they could make sure of for themselves now if i make her my lawful wife as she desires the property will be hers as well as mine and it will be her interest to look after all she is a stirring notable woman and will save me a world of trouble and make the best of every thing for her childrens sake and they being then all acknowledged by me will make my interest their own as she says and besides this is the only way left me to have peace to avoid the cares and plagues of matrimony and that worst of plagues a wifes tongue simon first was induced to keep a mistress and now to silence his mistress he made her his wife she assured him that till she was his lawful lady she never should have peace or quietness nor could she in conscience suffer him to have a moments rest simon married her to use his own phrase out of hand but the marriage was only the beginning of new troubles the bride had hordes and clans of relations who came pouring in from all quarters to pay their respects to mrs odougherty her good easy man could not shut his doors against any one the odoughertys were above a hundred years ay two hundred years ago famous for hospitality and it was incumbent upon simon odougherty to keep up the honour of the family his four children were now to be maintained in idleness for they like their father had an insurmountable aversion to business the public opinion of simon suddenly changed those who were any way related to the odoughertys and who dreaded that he and his children should apply to them for pecuniary assistance began the cry against him of what a shame it is footnote essay on charity schools that the man does not do something for himself and his family how can those expect to be helped who wont help themselves he is contented indeed yes and he must soon be contented to sell the lands that have been in the family so long and then by and by he must be content if he does not bestir himself to be carried to jail it is a sin for any one to be content to eat the bread of idleness these and similar reproaches were uttered often in our idle heros presence they would perhaps have excited him to some sort of exertion if his friend sir hyacinth obrien had not in consequence of certain electioneering services and in consideration of his being one of the best sportsmen in the county and of simons having named a horse after him procured for him a place of about fifty pounds a year in the revenue upon the profits of this place simon contrived to live in a shambling sort of way how long he might have shuffled on is a problem which must now for ever remain unsolved for his indolence was not permitted to take its natural course his ruin was accelerated by the secret operation of an active and malignant power mr hopkins who had determined to get that field which joined to grays mill and who well knew that the pride of the odoughertys would resist the idea of selling to him any part or parcel of the lands of rosanna devised a scheme to reduce simon to immediate and inextricable distress simon was as it might have been foreseen negligent in discharging the duties of his office which was that of a supervisor he either did not know or connived at the practices of sundry illegal distillers in his neighbourhood malicious tongues did not scruple to say that he took money upon some occasions from the delinquents but this he positively denied possibly his wife and sons knew more of this matter than he did they sold certain scraps of paper called protections to several petty distillers whose safest protection would have been simons indolence one of the scraps of paper to which there was odoughertys signature fell into the hands of mr hopkins that nothing might be omitted to ensure his disgrace hopkins sent a person on whom he could depend to give simon notice that there was an illegal still at such a house naming the house for which the protection was granted soft simon received the information with his customary carelessness said it was too late to think of going to seize the still that evening and declared he would have it seized the next day but the next day he put it off and the day afterwards he forgot it and the day after that he received a letter from the collector of excise summoning him to answer to an information which had been laid against him for misconduct in this emergency he resolved to have recourse to his friend sir hyacinth obrien who he thought could make interest to screen him from justice sir hyacinth gave him a letter to the collector who happened to be in the country away he went with the letter he was met on the road by a friend who advised him to ride as hard after the collector as he could to overtake him before he should reach counsellor quins where he was engaged to dine counsellor quin was candidate for the county in opposition to sir hyacinth obrien and it was well understood that whomsoever the one favoured the other hated it behoved simon therefore to overtake the collector before he should be within the enemys gates simon whipped and spurred and puffed and fretted but all in vain for he was mounted upon the horse which as the reader may remember fell into the tanpit the collector reached counsellor quins long before simon arrived and when he presented sir hyacinths letter it was received in a manner that showed it came too late simon lost his place and his fifty pounds a year but what he found most trying to his temper were the reproaches of his wife which were loud bitter and unceasing he knew from experience that nothing could silence her but letting her have all the plea so he suffered her to rail till she was quite out of breath and he very nearly asleep and then said what you have been observing is all very just no doubt but since a thing past cant be recalled and those that are upon the ground as our proverb says can go no lower thats a great comfort so we may be content content in truth is it content to live upon potatoes and salt i that am your lawful wife and you that are an odougherty too to let your lady be demeaned and looked down upon as she will be now even by them that are sprung up from nothing since yesterday theres mrs gray over yonder at rosanna living on your own land look at her and look at me and see what a difference there is some difference there surely is said simon some difference there surely is repeated mrs odougherty raising her voice to the shrillest note of objurgation for she was provoked by a sigh that escaped simon as he pronounced his reply or rather his acceding sentence nothing in some cases provokes a female so much as agreeing with her and if there is some difference betwixt me and mrs gray should be glad to know whose fault that is so should i mrs odougherty then ill tell you instantly whose fault it is mr odougherty the fault is your own mr odougherty no the fault is mine mr odougherty for marrying you or consorting with you at all if i had been matched to an active industrious man like mr gray i might have been as well in the world and better than mrs gray for i should become a fortune better than she or any of her seed breed or generation and its a scandal in the face of the world and all the world says so its a scandal to see them grays flourishing and settling a colony there at rosanna at our expense not at our expense my dear for you know we made nothing of either tanyard or mill and now they pay us l a year and that punctually too what should we do without it now we have lost the place in the revenue i am sure i think we were very lucky to get such tenants as the grays in truth i think no such thing for if you had been blessed with the sense of a midge you might have done all they have done yourself and then what a different way your lawful wife and family would have been in i am sure i wish it had pleased the saints above to have married me when they were about it to such a man as farmer gray or his sons as for the sons said simon they are a little out of the way in point of age but to farmer gray i see no objection in life and if he sees none and will change wives im sure ally i shall be content the sort of composure and dry humour with which simon made this last speech overcame the small remains of mrs odoughertys patience she burst into a passion of tears and from this hour it being now past eleven oclock at night from this hour till six in the morning she never ceased weeping wailing and upbraiding simon rose from his sleepless bed saying the saints above as you call them must take care of you now ally any how for im fairly tired out so i must go ahunting or ashooting with my friend sir hyacinth obrien to recruit my spirits the unfortunate simon found to his mortification that his horse was so lame he could scarcely walk whilst he was considering where he could borrow a horse just for the days hunt mr hopkins rode into his yard mounted upon a fine hunter though naturally supercilious this gentleman could stoop to conquer he was well aware of simons dislike to him but he also knew that simon was in distress for money even the strongest passions of those who involve themselves in pecuniary difficulties must yield to the exigencies of the moment easy simons indolence had now reduced him to a situation in which his pride was obliged to bend to his interest mr hopkins had once been repulsed with haughtiness by the representative of the odougherty family when he offered to purchase some of the family estate but his proposal was now better timed and was made with all the address of which he was master he began by begging simon to give him his opinion of the horse on which he was mounted as he knew mr odougherty was a particularly good judge of a hunter and he would not buy it from counsellor quins groom without having a skilful friends advice then he asked whether it was true that simon and the collector had quarrelled exclaimed against the malice and officiousness of the informer whoever he might be and finished by observing that if the loss of his place put simon to any inconvenience there was a ready way of supplying himself with money by the sale of any of the lands of rosanna the immediate want of a horse and the comparison he made at this moment between the lame animal on which he was leaning and the fine hunter upon which hopkins was mounted had more effect upon simon than all the rest before they parted mr hopkins concluded a bargain for the field on which he had set his heart he obtained it for less than its value by three years purchase the hunter was part of the valuable consideration he gave to simon the moment that hopkins was in possession of this field adjoining to grays mill he began to execute a malignant project which he had long been contriving we shall leave him to his operations matters of higher import claim our attention one morning as rose was on the little lawn before the house door gathering the first snowdrops of the year a servant in a handsome livery rode up and asked if mr gray or any of the family were at home her father and brothers were out in the fields at some distance but she said she would run and call them there is no occasion miss said the servant for the business is only to leave these cards for the ladies of the family he put two cards into roses hand and galloped off with the air of a man who had a vast deal of business of importance to transact the cards contained an invitation to an election ball which sir hyacinth obrien was going to give to the secondary class of gentry in the county rose took the cards to her mother and whilst they were reading them over for the second time in came farmer gray to breakfast what have we here child said he taking up one of the cards he looked at his wife and daughter with some anxiety for a moment and then as if he did not wish to restrain them turned the conversation to another subject and nothing was said of the ball till breakfast was over mrs gray then bade rose go and put her flowers into water and as soon as she was out of the room said my dear i see you dont like that we should go to this ball so i am glad i did not say what i thought of it to rose before you came in for you must know i had a mothers foolish vanity about me and the minute i saw the card i pictured to myself our rose dressed like any of the best of the ladies and looking handsomer than most of them and every body admiring her but perhaps the girl is better as she is having not been bred to be a lady and yet now we are as well in the world as many that set up for and are reckoned gentlefolks why should not our girl take this opportunity of rising a step in life mrs gray spoke with some confusion and hesitation my dear replied farmer gray in a gentle yet firm tone it is very natural that you being the mother of such a girl as our rose should be proud of her and eager to show her to the best advantage but the main point is to make her happy not to do just what will please our own vanity for the minute now i am not at all sure that raising her a step in life even if we could do it by sending her to this ball would be for her happiness are not we happy as we arecome in rose love come in i should be glad for you to hear what we are saying and judge for yourself you are old enough and wise enough i am sure i was going to ask are not we all happy in the way we live together now yes oh yes that we are indeed said both the wife and daughter then should not we be content and not wish to alter our condition but to go to only one ball father would not alter our condition would it said rose timidly if we begin once to set up for gentry we shall not like to go back again to be what we are now so before we begin we had best consider what we have to gain by a change we have meat drink clothes and fire what more could we have if we were gentry we have enough to do and not too much we are all well pleased with ourselves and with one another we have health and good consciences what more could we have if we were to set up to be gentry or rather to put the question closer could we in that case have all these comforts no i think not for in the first place we should be straitened for want of money because a world of baubles that we dont feel the want of now would become as necessary to us as our daily bread we should be ashamed not to have all the things that gentlefolks have though these dont signify a straw nor half a straw in point of any real pleasure they give still they must be had then we should be ashamed of the work by which we must make money to pay for all these nicknacks john and robin would blush up to the eyes then if they were to be caught by the genteel folks in their mill heaving up sacks of flour and covered all over with meal or if they were to be found with their arms bare beyond the elbows in the tanyard and you rose would hurry your spinningwheel out of sight and be afraid to be caught cooking my dinner yet there is no shame in any of these things and now we are all proud of doing them and long may we be so cried mrs gray you are right and i spoke like a foolish woman rose my child throw these cards into the fire we are happy and contented and if we change we shall be discontented and unhappy as so many of what they call our betters are there the cards are burnt now let us think no more about them rose i hope is not disappointed about this ball are you my little rose said her father drawing her towards him and seating her on his knee there was one reason father said rose blushing there was one reason and only one why i wished to have gone to this ball well let us hear it you shall do as you please i promise you beforehand but tell us the reason i believe you have found it somewhere at the bottom of that snowdrop which you have been examining this last quarter of an hour come let me have a peep added he laughing the only reason papa iswas i mean said rosebut look oh i cant tell you now see who is coming it was sir hyacinth obrien in his gig and with him his english servant stafford whose staid and sober demeanour was a perfect contrast to the dash and bustle of his masters appearance this was an electioneering visit sir hyacinth was canvassing the countya business in which he took great delight and in which he was said to excel he possessed all the requisite qualifications and was certainly excited by a sufficiently strong motive for he knew that if he should lose his election he should at the same time lose his liberty as the privilege of a member of parliament was necessary to protect him from being arrested he had a large estate yet he was one of the poorest men in the county for no matter what a persons fortune may be if he spend more than his income he must be poor sir hyacinth obrien not only spent more than his income but desired that his rentroll should be thought to be at least double what it really was of course he was obliged to live up to the fortune which he affected to possess and this idle vanity early in life entangled him in difficulties from which he had never sufficient strength of mind to extricate himself he was ambitious to be the leading man in his county studied all the arts of popularity and found them extremely expensive and stood a contested election he succeeded but his success cost him several thousands all was to be set to rights by his talents as a public speaker and these were considerable he had eloquence wit humour and sufficient assurance to place them all in the fullest light his speeches in parliament were much admired and the passion of ambition was now kindled in his mind he determined to be a leading man in the senate and whilst he pursued this object with enthusiasm his private affairs were entirely neglected ambition and economy never can agree sir hyacinth however found it necessary to the happiness that is to the splendour of his existence to supply by some means or other the want of what he called the paltry selfish counterfeit virtueeconomy nothing less would do than the sacrifice of that which had been once in his estimation the most noble and generous of human virtuespatriotism the sacrifice was painful but he could not avoid making it because after living upon five thousand ayear he could not live upon five hundred so from a flaming patriot he sunk into a pensioned placeman he then employed all his powers of wit and sophistry to ridicule the principles which he had abandoned in short he affected to glory in a species of political profligacy and laughed or sneered at public virtue as if it could only be the madness of enthusiasm or the meanness of hypocrisy by the brilliancy of his conversation and the gaiety of his manners sir hyacinth sometimes succeeded in persuading others that he was in the right but alas there was one person whom he could never deceive and that was himself he despised himself and nothing could make him amends for the selfcomplacency that he had lost without selfapprobation all the luxuries of life are tasteless sir hyacinth obrien however was for some years thought by those who could see only the outward man to be happy and it was not till the derangement of his affairs became public that the world began at once to pity and blame him he had a lucrative place but he was or thought himself obliged to live in a style suited to it and he was not one shilling the richer for his place he endeavoured to repair his shattered fortunes by marrying a rich heiress but the heiress was or thought herself obliged to live up to her fortune and of course her husband was not one shilling the richer for his marriage when sir hyacinth was occasionally distressed for money his agent who managed all affairs in his absence borrowed money with as much expedition as possible and expedition in matters of business must as every body knows be paid for exorbitantly there are men who upon such terms will be as expeditious in lending money as extravagance and ambition united can desire mr hopkins was one of these and he was the moneylender who supplied the baronets real and imaginary wants sir hyacinth did not know the extreme disorder of his own affairs till a sudden dissolution of parliament obliged him to prepare for the expense of a new election when he went into the country he was at once beset with duns and constituents who claimed from him favours and promises miserable is the man who courts popularity if he be not rich enough to purchase what he covets our baronet endeavoured to laugh off with a good grace his apostasy from the popular party and whilst he could laugh at the head of a plentiful table he could not fail to find many who would laugh with him but there was a strong party formed against him in the county two other candidates were his competitors one of them was counsellor quin a man of vulgar manners and mean abilities but yet one who could drink and cajole electors full as well as sir hyacinth with all his wit and elegance the other candidate mr molyneux was still more formidable not as an electioneerer but as a man of talents and unimpeached integrity which had been successfully exerted in the service of his country he was no demagogue but the friend of justice and of the poor whom he would not suffer to be oppressed by the hand of power or persecuted by the malice of party spirit a large number of grateful independent constituents united to support this gentleman sir hyacinth obrien had reason to tremble for his fate it was to him a desperate game he canvassed the county with the most keen activity and took care to engage in his interest all those underlings who delight in galloping round the country to electioneer and who think themselves paid by the momentary consequence they enjoy and the bustle they create amongst these busybodies was simon odougherty indolent in all his own concerns he was remarkably active in managing the affairs of others his home being now insufferable to him he was glad to stroll about the country and to him sir hyacinth obrien left all the dirty work of the canvass soft simon had reduced himself to the lowest class of stalkoes or walking gentlemen as they are termed men who have nothing to do and no fortune to support them but who style themselves esquire and who to use their own mode of expression are jealous of that title and of their claims to family antiquity sir hyacinth obrien knew at once how to flatter simons pride and to lure him on by promises soft simon believed that the baronet if he gained his election would procure him some place equivalent to that of which he had been lately deprived upon the faith of this promise simon worked harder for his patron than he ever was known to do upon any previous occasion and he was not deficient in that essential characteristic of an electioneerer boasting he carried this habit sometimes rather too far for he not only boasted so as to bully the opposite party but so as to deceive his friends over his bottle he often persuaded his patron that he could command voters with whom he had no manner of influence for instance he told sir hyacinth obrien that he was certain all the grays would vote for him and it was in consequence of this assurance that the cards of invitation to the ball had been sent to rose and her mother and that the baronet was now come in person to pay his respects at rosanna we have kept him waiting an unconscionable time at the cottage door we must now show him in chapter iv the beauty of rose was the first thing that struck him upon his entrance the impression was so sudden and so lively that for a few minutes the election and all that belonged to it vanished from his memory the politeness of a county candidate made him appear in other houses charmed with father mother son and daughter but in this cottage there was no occasion for dissimulation he was really pleased with each individual of the family the natural feelings of the heart were touched the ambitious man forgot all his schemes and all his cares in the contemplation of this humble picture of happiness and content and the baronet conversed a full quarter of an hour with farmer gray before he relapsed into himself how much happier thought he are these people than i am or than i ever have been they are contented in obscurity i was discontented even in the full blaze of celebrity but my fate is fixed i embarked on the sea of politics as thoughtlessly as if it were only on a party of pleasure now i am chained to the oar and a galleyslave cannot be more wretched perhaps the beauty of rose had some share in exciting sir hyacinths sudden taste for rural felicity it is certain he at first expressed more disappointment at hearing she would not go to the ball than at being told her father and brothers could not vote for him farmer gray who was as independent in his principles as in his circumstances honestly answered the baronet that he thought mr molyneux the fittest man to represent the county and that it was for him he should therefore vote sir hyacinth tried all his powers of persuasion in vain and he left the cottage mortified and melancholy he met simon odougherty when he had driven a few miles from the door and in a tone of much pique and displeasure reproached him for having deceived him into a belief that the grays were his friends simon was rather embarrassed but the genius of gossiping had luckily just supplied him with a hint by which he could extricate himself from this difficulty the fault is all your own if i may make so free as to tell you so sir hyacinth obrien said he as capital an electioneerer as you are ill engage ill find one that shall outdo you here send me and stafford back again this minute to rosanna and well bring you the three votes as dead as crows in an hours time or my name is not odougherty now i protest mr odougherty i do not understand you then let me whisper half a word in your ear sir hyacinth and ill make you sensible im right simon winked most significantly and looked wondrous wise then stretching himself half off his horse into the gig to gain sir hyacinths ear he whispered that he knew from the best authority stafford was in love with grays pretty daughter rose and that rose had no dislike to him that she was all in all to her father and brothers and of course could and would secure their votes if properly spoken to this intelligence did not immediately produce the pleasing change of countenance which might have been expected sir hyacinth coldly replied he could not spare stafford at present and drove on the genius of gossiping according to her usual custom had exaggerated considerably in her report stafford was attached to rose but had never yet told her so and as to rose we might perhaps have known all her mind if sir hyacinths gig had not appeared just as she was seated on her fathers knee and going to tell him her reasons for wishing to go to the ball stafford acted in the capacity of housesteward to the baronet and had the management of all his masters unmanageable servants he had brought with him from england ideas of order and punctuality which were somewhat new and extremely troublesome to the domestics at hyacinthhall consequently he was much disliked by them and not only by them but by most of the country people in the neighbourhood who imagined he had a strong predilection in favour of every thing that was english and an undisguised contempt for all that was irish they however perceived that this prejudice against the irish admitted of exceptions the family of the grays stafford acknowledged were almost as orderly punctual industrious and agreeable as if they had been born in england this was matter of so much surprise to him that he could not forbear going at every leisure hour to the mill or the cottage of rosanna to convince himself that such things could actually be in ireland he bought all the flour for the hall at rosannamill and rose supplied the housekeeper constantly with poultry so that his masters business continually obliged stafford to repeat his visits and every time he went to grays cottage he thought it more and more like an english farmhouse and imagined rose every day looked more like an englishwoman than any thing else what a pity she was not born the other side of the water for then his mother and friends in warwickshire could never have made any objection to her but she being an irishwoman they would for certain never fancy her he had oftentimes heard them as good as say that it would break their hearts if he was to marry and settle amongst the bogs and the wild irish this recollection of his friends prejudices at first deterred stafford from thinking of marrying rose but it sometimes happens that reflection upon the prejudices of others shows us the folly of our own and so it was in the present instance stafford wrote frequently to his friends in warwickshire to assure them that they had quite wrong notions of ireland that all ireland was not a bog that there were several wellgrown trees in the parts he had visited that there were some as pretty villages as you could wish to see any where only that they called them towns that the men though some of them still wear brogues were more hospitable to strangers than the english and that the women when not smokedried were some of the handsomest he had seen especially one rose or rosamond gray who was also the best and most agreeable girl he had ever known though it was almost a sin to say so much of one who was not an englishwoman born much more in the same strain stafford wrote to his mother who in reply to these letters besought him to consider well what he was about before he suffered himself to begin falling desperately in love with this rose or rosamond gray or any irishwoman whatsoever who having been bred in a mudwalled cabin could never be expected to turn out at the long run equal to a trueborn englishwoman bred in a slated house staffords notions had been so much enlarged by his travel that he could not avoid smiling at some passages in his mothers epistle yet he so far agreed with her in opinion as to think it prudent not to begin falling desperately in love with any woman whether irish or english till he was thoroughly acquainted with her temper and disposition he therefore prudently forbore that is to say as much as he could forbear to show any signs of his attachment to rose till he had full opportunity of forming a decisive judgment of her character this he had now in his power he saw that his master was struck with the fair rosamonds charms and he knew that sir hyacinth would pursue his purpose with no common perseverance his heart beat with joy when the card which brought her refusal arrived he read it over and over again and at last put it into his bosom close to his heart rose is a good daughter said he to himself and that is a sign that she will make a good wife she is too innocent to see or suspect that master has taken a fancy to her but she is right to do as her prudent affectionate father advises i never loved that farmer gray so well in all my whole life as at this instant stafford was interrupted in his reverie by his master who in an angry voice called for him to inquire why he had not according to his orders served out some oats for his horses the preceding day the truth was that anxiety about rose and the ball had made him totally forget the oats stafford coloured a good deal confessed that he had done very wrong to forget the oats but that he would go to the granary immediately and serve them out to the groom perhaps staffords usual exactness might have rendered his omission pardonable to any less irritable and peremptory master than sir h obrien when sterne once heard a master severely reprimanding a servant for some trifling fault he said to the gentleman my dear sir we should not expect to have every virtue under the sun for l ayear sir hyacinth obrien expected to have them for merely the promise of l ayear though he never punctually paid his servants wages he abused them most insolently whenever he was in a passion upon the present occasion his illhumour was heightened by jealousy i wish sir cried he to stafford after pouring forth a volley of oaths you would mind your business and not run after objects that are not fit for you you are become good for nothing of late careless insolent and not fit to be trusted stafford bore all that his master said till he came to the words not fit to be trusted but the moment those were uttered he could no longer command himself he threw down the great key of the granary which he held in his hand and exclaimed not fit to be trusted is this the reward of all my services not fit to be trusted then i have no business here the sooner you go the better sir cried the angry baronet who at this instant desired nothing more than to get him out of his way you had best set off for england directly i have no farther occasion for your services stafford said not a word more but retired from his masters presence to conceal his emotion and when he was alone burst into tears repeating to himself so this is the reward of all my services when sir hyacinths passion cooled he reflected that seven years wages were due to stafford and as it was not convenient to him at this election time to part with so much ready money he resolved to compromise it was not from any sense of justice therefore it must be said he had the meanness to apologize to his steward and to hint that he was welcome to remain if he pleased in his service satisfied by this explanation and by the condescension with which it was given staffords affection for his master returned with all its wonted force and he resumed his former occupations about the house with redoubled activity he waited only till he could be spared for a day to go to rosanna and make his proposal for rose her behaviour concerning the ball convinced him that his mothers prejudices against irishwomen were illfounded whilst his mind was in this state his master one morning sent for him and told him that it was absolutely necessary he should go to a neighbouring county to some persons who were freeholders and whose votes might turn the election the business would only occupy a few days sir hyacinth said and stafford willingly undertook it the gentlemen to whom stafford had letters were not at home and he was detained above a fortnight when he returned he took a road which led by rosanna that he might at least have the pleasure of seeing rose for a few minutes but when he called at the cottage to his utter surprise he was refused admittance being naturally of a warm temper and not deficient in pride his first impulse was to turn his horses head and gallop off but checking his emotion he determined not to leave the place till he should discover the cause of this change of conduct he considered that none of this family had formerly treated him with caprice or duplicity it was therefore improbable they should suddenly alter their conduct towards him unless they had reason to believe that they had some sufficient cause he rode immediately to a field where he saw some labourers at work farmer gray was with them stafford leaped from his horse and with an air of friendly honesty held out his hand saying i cant believe you mean to affront me tell me what is the reason i am not to be let into your house my good friend gray leaned upon his stick and after looking at him for a moment replied we have been too hasty i see we have had no cause of quarrel with you stafford you could never look at me with that honest countenance if you had any hand in this business what business cried stafford walk home with me out of the hearing of these people and you shall know as they walked towards his cottage gray took out his great leather pocketbook and searched for a letter pray stafford said he did you about ten days ago send my girl a melon yes one of my own raising i left it with the gardener to be sent to her with my best respects and services and a message intimating to say that i was sorry my masters business required i should take a journey and could not see her for a few days or something that way no such message came only your services the melon and this note i declare continued gray looking at stafford whilst he read the letter he turns as pale as my wife herself did when i showed it to her stafford indeed grew pale with anger it was a billetdoux from his master to rose which sir hyacinth entreated might be kept secret promising to make her fortune and marry her well if she would only have compassion upon a man who adored and was dying for her c i will never see my master again exclaimed stafford i could not see him without the danger of doing something that i might not forgive myself he a gentleman he a gentleman ill gallop off and leave his letters and his horse with some of his people ill never see him again if he does not pay me a farthing of my seven years wages i dont care i will not sleep in his house another night he a gentleman farmer gray was delighted by staffords generous indignation which appeared the more striking as his manner was usually sober and remarkably civil all this happened at two oclock in the afternoon and the evening of the same day he returned to rosanna rose was sitting at work in the seat of the cottage window when she saw him at the little white gate her colour gave notice to her brothers who was coming and they ran out to meet him you ought to shut your doors against me now instead of running out to meet me said he for i am not clear that i have a farthing in the world except what is in this portmanteau i have been fool enough to leave all i have earned in the hands of a gentleman who can give me only his bond for my wages but i am glad i am out of his house at any rate and i am glad you are in mine said farmer gray receiving him with a warmth of hospitality which brought tears of gratitude into staffords eyes rose smiled upon her father and said nothing but set him his armchair and was very busy arranging the teatable mrs gray beckoned to her guest and made him sit down beside her telling him he should have as good tea at rosanna as ever he had in warwickshire and out of staffordshire ware too said she taking her best wedgwood teacups and saucers out of a cupboard robin who was naturally gay and fond of rallying his friends could not forbear affecting to express his surprise at staffords preferring an irishwoman of all women in the world are you quite sure stafford said he that you are not mistaken are you sure my sister has not wings on her shoulders have you done now robin said his mother who saw that stafford was a good deal abashed and had no answer ready if mr stafford had a prejudice against us irish so much the more honourable for my rose to have conquered it and as to wings they would have been no shame to us natives supposing we had them and of course it was no affront to attribute them to us have not the angels themselves wings a timely joke is sometimes a real blessing and so stafford felt it at this instant his bashfulness vanished by degrees and robin rallied him no more i had no idea said he how easy it is to put an englishman out of countenance in the company of his mistress this was a most happy evening at rosanna after rose retired which she soon did to see after the household affairs her father spoke in the kindest manner to stafford mr stafford said he if you tell me that you are able to maintain my girl in the way of life she is in now you shall have her this in my opinion and in hers is the happiest life for those who have been bred to it i would rather see rose matched to an honest industrious goodhumoured man like yourself whom she can love than see her the wife of a man as grand as sir hyacinth obrien for to the best of my opinion it is not the being born to a great estate that can make a man content or even rich i think myself a richer man this minute than sir hyacinth for i owe no man any thing am my own master and can give a little matter both to child and stranger but your head is very naturally running upon rose and not upon my moralizing all i have to say is win her and wear her and as to the rest even if sir hyacinth never pays you your own that shall not stop your wedding my sons are good lads and you and rose shall never want whilst the mill of rosanna is going this generosity quite overpowered stafford generosity is one of the characteristics of the irish it not only touched but surprised the englishman who amongst the same rank of his own countrymen had been accustomed to strict honesty in their dealings but seldom to this warmth of friendship and forgetfulness of all selfish considerations it was some minutes before he could articulate a syllable but after shaking his intended fatherinlaws hand with that violence which expresses so much to english feelings he said i thank you heartily and if i live to the age of methusalem shall never forget this a friend in need is a friend indeed but i will not live upon yours or your good sons earnings that would not be fair dealing or like what ive been bred up to think handsome it is a sad thing for me that this master of mine can give me nothing for my seven years service but this scrap of paper taking out of his pocketbook a bond of sir hyacinths but my mother though she has her prejudices and is very stiff about them being an elderly woman and never going out of england or even beyond the parish in which she was born yet she is kindhearted and i cannot think will refuse to help me or that she will cross me in marriage when she knows the thing is determined so i shall write to her before i sleep and wish i could but enclose in the cover of my letter the picture of rose which would be better than all i could say but no picture would do her justice i dont mean a compliment like those sir hyacinth paid to her face but only the plain truth i mean that a picture could never make my mother understand how good and sweettempered and modest rose is mother has a world of prejudices but she is a good woman and will prove herself so to me i make no doubt stafford wrote to his mother a long letter and received in a fortnight afterwards this short answer son george i warned you not to fall in love with an irishwoman to which i told you i could never give my consent as you bake so you must brew your sister dolly is marrying too and setting up a shop in warwick by my advice and consent all the money i can spare i must give as in reason to her who is a dutiful child and mean with her and grandchildren if god please to pass my latter days as fitting in this parish of little sonchy in old england where i was born and bred wishing you may not repent or starve or so forth which please to let me know i am your affectionate mother dorothy stafford all staffords hopes were confounded by this letter he put it into farmer grays hands without saying a word then drew his chair away from rose hid his face in his hands and never spoke or heard one word that was saying round about him for full half an hour till at last he was roused by his friend robin who clapping him on his back said come stafford english pride wont do with us this is all to punish you for refusing to share and share alike with us in the mill of rosanna which is what you must and shall do now for roses sake if not for ours or your own come say done stafford could not help being moved all the family except rose joined in these generous entreaties and her silence said even more than their words dinner was on the table before this amicable contest was settled and robin insisted upon his drinking a toast with him in irish ale which was rose gray and rosannamill the glass was just filled and the toast pronounced when in came one of grays workmen in an indescribable perspiration and rage master robin master john master cried he we are all ruined the mill and all the mill exclaimed every body starting up ay the mill its all over with it and with us not a turn more will rosannamill ever take for me or you not a turn continued he wiping his forehead with his arm and hiding by the same motion his eyes which ran over with tears its all that thief hopkinss doing may every guinea he touches and every shilling and tester and penny itself blister his fingers from this day forward and for evermore but what has he done to the mill may every guinea shilling tester and penny he looks upon from this day forth for evermore be a blight to his eyes and a canker to his heart but i cant wish him a worse canker than what he has there already yes he has a canker at heart is not he eaten up with envy as all who look at him may read in that evil eye bad luck to the hour when it fixed on the mill of rosanna but what has he done to the mill take it patiently and tell us quietly said farmer gray and do not curse the man any more not curse the man take it quietly master is it the time to take it quietly when he is at the present minute carrying off every drop of water from our millcourse so he is the villain at these words stafford seized his oak stick and sprang towards the door robin and john eagerly followed but as they passed their father he laid a hand on each and called to stafford to stop at his respected voice they all paused my children said he what are you going to do no violence no violence you shall have justice boys depend upon it we will not let ourselves be oppressed if mr hopkins were ten times as great and twenty times as tyrannical as he is we shall have justice the law will reach him but we must take care and do nothing in anger therefore i charge you let me speak to him and do you keep your tempers whatever passes may be all this is only a mistake perhaps mr hopkins is only making drains for his own meadow or may be is going to flood it and does not know till we tell him that he is emptying our watercourse he cant but know it he cant but know it hes cute enough and too cute muttered paddy as he led the way to the mill stafford and the two brothers followed their father respectfully admiring his moderation and resolving to imitate it if they possibly could mr hopkins was stationed cautiously on the boundary of his own land there he is mounted on the back of the ditch enjoying the mischief all he can cried paddy and hark he is whistling whilst our stream is running away from us may i never cross myself again if i would not rather than the best shirt ever i had to my back push him into the mud as he deserves this very minute and if it wasnt for my master here its what id do before i drew breath again farmer gray restrained paddys indignation with some difficulty and advancing calmly towards mr hopkins he remonstrated with him in a mild tone surely mr hopkins said he you cannot mean to do us such an injury as to stop our mill i have not laid a finger on your mill replied hopkins with a malicious smile if your man there pointing to paddy could prove my having laid a finger upon it you might have your action of trespass but i am no trespasser i stand on my own land and have a right to water my own meadow and moreover have witnesses to prove that for ten years last past while the mill of rosanna was in simon odoughertys hands the watercourse was never full and the mill was in disuse the stream runs against you now and so does the law gentlemen i have the best counsels opinion in ireland to back me take your remedy when and where you can find it good morning to you without listening to one word more mr hopkins hastily withdrew for he had no small apprehensions that paddy whose threats he had overheard and whose eyes sparkled with rage might execute upon him that species of prompt justice which no quibbling can evade do not be disheartened my dear boys said farmer gray to his sons who were watching with mournful earnestness the slackened motion of their waterwheel saddle my horse for me john and get yourselves ready both of you to come with me to counsellor molyneux oh father said john there is no use in going to him for he is one of the candidates you know and mr hopkins has a great many votes no matter for that said gray mr molyneux will do justice that is my opinion of him if he was another sort of man i would not trouble myself to go near him nor stoop to ask his advice but my opinion of him is that he is above doing a dirty action for votes or any thing else and i am convinced his own interest will not weigh a grain of dust in the balance against justice saddle the horses boy his sons saddled the horses and all the way the farmer was riding he continued trying to keep up the spirits of his sons by assurances that if counsellor molyneux would take their affair in hand there would be an end of all difficulty he is not one of those justices of the peace continued he who will huddle half a dozen poor fellows into jail without law or equity he is not a man who goes into parliament saying one thing and who comes out saying another he is not like our friend sir hyacinth obrien forced to sell tongue and brains and conscience to keep his head above water in short he is a man who dares to be the same and can moreover afford to be the same at election time as at any other time for which reason i dare to go to him now in this our distress although i have to complain of a man who has fortysix votes which is the number they say mr hopkins can command whilst farmer gray was thus pronouncing a panegyric on counsellor molyneux for the comfort of john and robin stafford was trying to console rose and her mother who were struck with sorrow and dismay at the news of the mills being stopped stafford had himself almost as much need of consolation as they for he foresaw it was impossible he should at present be united to his dear rose all that her generous brothers had to offer was a share in the mill the father had his farm but this must serve for the support of the whole family and how could stafford become a burden to them now that they would be poor when he could not bring himself to be dependent upon them even when they were comparatively speaking rich chapter v with anxious hearts the little party at the cottage expected the return of the father and his sons rose sat at the window watching for them her mother laid down her knitting and sighed and stafford was silent for he had exhausted all his consolatory eloquence and saw and felt it had no effect here they come but they ride so slow that i am sure they bring us no good news no there was not any good news counsellor molyneux had indeed behaved as well as man could do he had declared that he would undertake to manage and plead their cause in any court of justice on earth and had expressed the strongest indignation against the villany of hopkins but at the same time he had fairly told the grays that this litigious man if they commenced a suit might ruin them by law before they could recover their rights so we may go to bed this night melancholy enough said robin with the certainty that our mill is stopped and that we have a long lawsuit to go through before we can see it going againif ever we do rose and stafford looked at one another and sighed we had better not go to law to lose the little we have left at any rate said mrs gray wife i am determined my boys shall have justice said the father firmly i am not fond of law god knows i never had a lawsuit in my life nobody dreads such things more than i do but i dread nothing in defence of my sons and justice whilst i have a penny left in the world ill spend it to obtain them justice the labour of their lives shall not be in vain they shall not be robbed of all they have they shall not be trampled upon by any one living let him be ever so rich or ever so litigious i fear neither his money nor his quirks of law plain sense is the same for him and for me and justice my boys shall have mr molyneux will plead our cause himselfdesire no more if we fail and are ruined our ruin be upon the head of him who works it i shall die content when i have done all i can to obtain justice for my children as soon as these facts were known every body in the neighbourhood felt extreme indignation against hopkins and all joined in pitying the two brothers and applauding the spirit of their father there was not an individual who did not wish that hopkins might be punished but he had been engaged in so many lawsuits and had been so successful in screening himself from justice and in ruining his opponents that every body feared the grays though they were so much in the right would never be able to make this appear according to the forms of law many therefore advised that it might not be brought to trial but farmer gray persisted and counsellor molyneux steadily abided by his word and declared he would plead the cause himself mr hopkins sent the counsellor a private hint that if he directly or indirectly protected the grays he must give up all hopes of the fortysix votes which as the county was now nearly balanced must turn the election mr molyneux paid no attention to this hint but the very day on which he received it visited farmer gray in his cottage walked with him to rosannamill and settled how the suit should be carried on hopkins swore he would spare no expense to humble the pride both of the grays and their protector an unexpected circumstance however occurred it had often been prophesied by mr molyneux who knew the species of bargains which hopkins drove with all manner of people by whose distresses he could make money that he would sooner or later overshoot his mark as cunning persons often do mr molyneux predicted that amongst the medley of his fraudulent purchases he would at length be the dupe of some unsound title and that amongst the multitudes whom he ruined he would at last meet with some one who would ruin him the person who was the means of accomplishing this prophecy was indeed the last that would have been guessedsoft simon odougherty in dealing with him mr hopkins who thoroughly despised indolent honesty was quite off his guard and in truth poor simon had no design to cheat him but it happened that the lease which he made over to hopkins as his title to the field that he sold was a lease renewable for ever with a strict clause binding the lessee to renew within a certain time after the failure of each life under penalty of forfeiting the lease from the natural laziness of easy simon he had neglected to renew and had even forgotten that the life was dropped he assigned his lease over a bottle to mr hopkins who seized it with avidity lest he should lose the lucky moment to conclude a bargain in which he thought he had at once overreached simon and had secured to himself the means of wreaking his vengeance upon the grays this lease was of the field adjoining to rosannamill and by the testimony of some old people in the neighbourhood he fancied he could prove that this meadow was anciently flooded and that the millcourse had gone into disuse in all his subsequent operations he had carefully kept himself as he thought upon his own lands but now that a suit against him was instituted it was necessary to look to his own title into which he knew mr molyneux would examine upon reading over the lease assigned to him by simon he noticed the strict clause binding the tenant to renew within a certain time a qualm came over him he was astonished at himself for not having more carefully perused the lease before he concluded the bargain had it been with any one but soft simon this could not have happened he hastened in search of simon with the utmost anxiety to inquire whether all the lives were in being simon at first said he had such a mist over his memory that he could not exactly recollect who the lives were but at last he made out that one of them had been dead beyond the time for renewal the gentleman his landlord he said was in dublin and he had neglected sure enough to write to him from post to post the rage of mr hopkins was excessive he grew white with anger easy simon yawned and begged him not to take the thing so to heart for after all said he you know the loss must be mine i cant make good the sale of this field to you as i have lost it by my own carelessness but thats nothing to you for you know as well as i do that to make good the deficiency you will somehow or other get a better piece of ground out of the small remains of patrimony i have left god help me god help you indeed cried hopkins with a look and accent of mingled rage and contempt i tell you man the loss is mine and no other land you have to sell or give can make me any amends i shall lose my lawsuit wheugh wheugh why so much the better wheres the use of having lawsuits the loss of such bad things can never be great no trifling pray said hopkins with impatience as he walked up and down the room and repeatedly struck his forehead ho ho ho i begin to comprehend i know whereabouts you are now cried simon is not it the grays you are thinking of ah thats the suit you are talking about but now mr hopkins you ought to rejoice as i do instead of grieving that it is out of your power to ruin that family for in truth they are good people and have the voice of the country with them against you and if you were to win your suit twenty times over that would still be the same you would never be able to show your face and for my own part my conscience would never forgive me for being instrumental unknown to myself in giving you the power to do this mischief and after all what put it into your head to stop rosannamill when its going gave you no trouble in life hopkins who had not listened to one syllable simon was saying at this instant suddenly stopped walking and in a soft insinuating voice addressed him in these words mr odougherty you know i have a great regard for you may be so said simon though that is more than i ever knew you to have for any body pray be serious i tell you i have and will prove it that is more and more surprising mr hopkins and which is more surprising still i will make your fortune if you will do a trifling kindness for me any thing in nature that wont give me an unreasonable deal of trouble oh this will give you no sort of trouble said hopkins i will get you before this day sennight that place in the revenue that you have been wishing for so long and that sir hyacinth obrien will never get for you i say i will insure it to you under my hand this minute if you will do what i want of you to be sure i will if its no trouble what is it only just said hopkins hesitating only justyou must rememberyou cannot but recollect that you wrote to your landlord to offer to renew i remember to recollect no such thing said simon surprised yes yes said hopkins but he gave you no answer you know but i tell you i never wrote to him at all pshaw you have a bad memory simon and your letter might have miscarried theres nothing simpler than that nothing more easily said if it were but true said simon true or not it may be said you know not by simon odougherty mr hopkins look you mr odougherty i have a great regard for you continued hopkins holding him fast and producing a pocketbook full of bank notes i must thought he come up to this scoundrels price for he has me now he is more knave than fool i see let us understand one another my good friend simon name your sum and make me but a short affidavit purporting that you did apply for this renewal and you have your place in the revenue snug besides you dont know whom you are speaking to mr hopkins said simon looking over his shoulder with cool and easy contempt the odoughertys are not accustomed to perjuring themselves and its a trouble i would not take for any man if he were my own father even no not for all the places in the revenue that ever were created nor for all the bank notes ever you cheated mankind out of mr hopkins into the bargain no offence i never talked of cheating till you named perjury to me for which i do not kick you down stairs in the first place because there are no stairs i believe to my house next because if there were ever so many it would be beneath me to make use of them upon any such occasion and lastly it would be quite too much trouble now we comprehend one another perfectly i hope mr hopkins cursing himself and overwhelmed with confusion mr hopkins withdrew proud of himself and having a story to tell simon odougherty hastened to rosanna to relate all that had happened to the grays and to congratulate them as he said upon his own carelessness the joy with which they listened to simons story was great and in proportion to the anxiety they had suffered in less than half an hours time they received a mean supplicating letter from hopkins entreating they would not ruin his reputation and all his prospects in life by divulging what had passed and promising that the millstream of rosanna should be returned to its proper channel without any expense to them and that he would make a suitable compensation in money if they would bind themselves to secrecy it will easily be guessed that they rejected all his offers with disdain the whole affair was told by them to mr molyneux and the next day all the neighbourhood knew it and triumphed in the detection of a villain who had long been the oppressor of the poor the neighbours all joined in restoring the water to the millcourse and when rosannamill was once more at work the village houses were illuminated and even the children showed their sympathy for the family of the grays by huge bonfires and loud huzzas simon odoughertys landlord was so much pleased by the honesty he had shown in this affair that he renewed the lease of the meadow instead of insisting upon the forfeiture and farmer gray delighted poor simon still more by promising to overlook for him the management of the land which still remained in his possession in the mean time mr hopkins who could not go out of his own house without being insulted or without fearing to be insulted prepared to quit the country but before i go said he i shall have the pleasure and triumph at least of making mr molyneux lose his election the grays feared mr molyneux would indeed be a sufferer for the generous protection he had afforded them in their distress the votes were nearly balanced in the county and the fortysix votes which hopkins could command would decide the contest there are often in real life instances of what is called poetical justice the day before the election sir hyacinth was arrested at the suit of stafford who chose his opportunity so well that the sheriff though he was a fast friend of the baronets could not refuse to do his duty the sheriff had such a number of writs immediately put into his hands that bail could not be found and mr molyneux was elected without opposition but let us return from the misery of arrests and elections to peace industry family union and love in the happy cottage of rosanna no obstacles now prevented the marriage of stafford and rose it was celebrated with every simple demonstration of rural felicity the bride had the blessings of her fond father and mother the congratulations of her beloved brothers and the applause of her own heart are not these better things than even forty fine wedding gowns or a coach of hatchetts best workmanship rose thought so and her future life proved she was not much mistaken stafford some time after his marriage took his wife to england to see his mother who was soon reconciled to him and her irish daughterinlaw whose gentle manners and willing obedience overcame her unreasonable dislike old mrs stafford declared to her son when he was returning that she had so far got the better of what he called her prejudices that if she could but travel to ireland without crossing the sea she verily believed she would go and spend a year with him and the grays at rosanna footnote having heard from good judges that the language used by farmer gray in this story appears superior to his condition we insert a letter which we lately received from him matter manner and orthography his own to r l edgeworth esq hon sir i have read your valuable present with care so has also the whole family its design is excellent it breathes forth a spirit of virtue and industry and in a word all the social virtues which constitute human happinessits other characters are admirably adapted to expose vice in all its hideous forms and gives us a view of those baneful principles which terminate in certain misery and proves beyond a doubt that many of mankind are the authors of their own calamities and frequently involve others in the same or similar unhappy circumstances thrice happy are they who in affluence endeavour thus to amend the morals of mankind its they only who enjoy true felicitytheir example and their precepts have a powerful influence on all around them and never fail to excite a virtuous emulation except among the utterly abandoned and profligate on the contrary families in elevated situations of life who devote their time to dissipation and its sensual allurements are the pest of societythe vices and crimes of the great are frequently imitated by the lower ranksthey all die and no memorial is left behind but that of folly and an illspent life may that life of virtue so strongly recommended be long the shining ornament of you and your family and its end be rewarded with a crown of eternal happiness which is the joint wish of the family of farmer gray july st murad the unlucky chapter i it is well known that the grand seignior amuses himself by going at night in disguise through the streets of constantinople as the caliph haroun alraschid used formerly to do in bagdad one moonlight night accompanied by his grand vizier he traversed several of the principal streets of the city without seeing any thing remarkable at length as they were passing a ropemakers the sultan recollected the arabian story of cogiahassan alhabal the ropemaker and his two friends saad and saadi who differed so much in their opinion concerning the influence of fortune over human affairs what is your opinion on this subject said the grand seignior to his vizier i am inclined please your majesty replied the vizier to think that success in the world depends more upon prudence than upon what is called luck or fortune and i said the sultan am persuaded that fortune does more for men than prudence do you not every day hear of persons who are said to be fortunate or unfortunate how comes it that this opinion should prevail amongst men if it be not justified by experience it is not for me to dispute with your majesty replied the prudent vizier speak your mind freely i desire and command it said the sultan then i am of opinion answered the vizier that people are often led to believe others fortunate or unfortunate merely because they only know the general outline of their histories and are ignorant of the incidents and events in which they have shown prudence or imprudence i have heard for instance that there are at present in this city two men who are remarkable for their good and bad fortune one is called murad the unlucky and the other saladin the lucky now i am inclined to think if we could hear their stories we should find that one is a prudent and the other an imprudent character where do these men live interrupted the sultan i will hear their histories from their own lips before i sleep murad the unlucky lives in the next square said the vizier the sultan desired to go thither immediately scarcely had they entered the square when they heard the cry of loud lamentations they followed the sound till they came to a house of which the door was open and where there was a man tearing his turban and weeping bitterly they asked the cause of his distress and he pointed to the fragments of a china vase which lay on the pavement at his door this seems undoubtedly to be beautiful china said the sultan taking up one of the broken pieces but can the loss of a china vase be the cause of such violent grief and despair ah gentlemen said the owner of the vase suspending his lamentations and looking at the dress of the pretended merchants i see that you are strangers you do not know how much cause i have for grief and despair you do not know that you are speaking to murad the unlucky were you to hear all the unfortunate accidents that have happened to me from the time i was born till this instant you would perhaps pity me and acknowledge i have just cause for despair curiosity was strongly expressed by the sultan and the hope of obtaining sympathy inclined murad to gratify it by the recital of his adventures gentlemen said he i scarcely dare invite you into the house of such an unlucky being as i am but if you will venture to take a nights lodging under my roof you shall hear at your leisure the story of my misfortunes the sultan and the vizier excused themselves from spending the night with murad saying that they were obliged to proceed to their khan where they should be expected by their companions but they begged permission to repose themselves for half an hour in his house and besought him to relate the history of his life if it would not renew his grief too much to recollect his misfortunes few men are so miserable as not to like to talk of their misfortunes where they have or where they think they have any chance of obtaining compassion as soon as the pretended merchants were seated murad began his story in the following manner my father was a merchant of this city the night before i was born he dreamed that i came into the world with the head of a dog and the tail of a dragon and that in haste to conceal my deformity he rolled me up in a piece of linen which unluckily proved to be the grand seigniors turban who enraged at his insolence in touching his turban commanded that his head should be struck off my father awaked before he lost his head but not before he had lost half his wits from the terror of his dream he considered it as a warning sent from above and consequently determined to avoid the sight of me he would not stay to see whether i should really be born with the head of a dog and the tail of a dragon but he set out the next morning on a voyage to aleppo he was absent for upwards of seven years and during that time my education was totally neglected one day i inquired from my mother why i had been named murad the unlucky she told me that this name was given to me in consequence of my fathers dream but she added that perhaps it might be forgotten if i proved fortunate in my future life my nurse a very old woman who was present shook her head with a look which i shall never forget and whispered to my mother loud enough for me to hear unlucky he was and is and ever will be those that are born to ill luck cannot help themselves nor can any but the great prophet mahomet himself do anything for them it is a folly for an unlucky person to strive with their fate it is better to yield to it at once this speech made a terrible impression upon me young as i then was and every accident that happened to me afterwards confirmed my belief in my nurses prognostic i was in my eighth year when my father returned from abroad the year after he came home my brother saladin was born who was named saladin the lucky because the day he was born a vessel freighted with rich merchandise for my father arrived safely in port i will not weary you with a relation of all the little instances of good fortune by which my brother saladin was distinguished even during his childhood as he grew up his success in everything he undertook was as remarkable as my ill luck in all that i attempted from the time the rich vessel arrived we lived in splendour and the supposed prosperous state of my fathers affairs was of course attributed to the influence of my brother saladins happy destiny when saladin was about twenty my father was taken dangerously ill and as he felt that he should not recover he sent for my brother to the side of his bed and to his great surprise informed him that the magnificence in which we had lived had exhausted all his wealth that his affairs were in the greatest disorder for having trusted to the hope of continual success he had embarked in projects beyond his powers the sequel was he had nothing remaining to leave to his children but two large china vases remarkable for their beauty but still more valuable on account of certain verses inscribed upon them in an unknown character which were supposed to operate as a talisman or charm in favour of their possessors both these vases my father bequeathed to my brother saladin declaring he could not venture to leave either of them to me because i was so unlucky that i should inevitably break it after his death however my brother saladin who was blessed with a generous temper gave me my choice of the two vases and endeavoured to raise my spirits by repeating frequently that he had no faith either in good fortune or ill fortune i could not be of his opinion though i felt and acknowledged his kindness in trying to persuade me out of my settled melancholy i knew it was in vain for me to exert myself because i was sure that do what i would i should still be murad the unlucky my brother on the contrary was nowise cast down even by the poverty in which my father left us he said he was sure he should find some means of maintaining himself and so he did on examining our china vases he found in them a powder of a bright scarlet colour and it occurred to him that it would make a fine dye he tried it and after some trouble it succeeded to admiration during my fathers lifetime my mother had been supplied with rich dresses by one of the merchants who was employed by the ladies of the grand seigniors seraglio my brother had done this merchant some trifling favours and upon application to him he readily engaged to recommend the new scarlet dye indeed it was so beautiful that the moment it was seen it was preferred to every other colour saladins shop was soon crowded with customers and his winning manners and pleasant conversation were almost as advantageous to him as his scarlet dye on the contrary i observed that the first glance at my melancholy countenance was sufficient to disgust every one who saw me i perceived this plainly and it only confirmed me the more in my belief in my own evil destiny it happened one day that a lady richly appareled and attended by two female slaves came to my brothers house to make some purchases he was out and i alone was left to attend to the shop after she had looked over some goods she chanced to see my china vase which was in the room she took a prodigious fancy to it and offered me any price if i would part with it but this i declined doing because i believed that i should draw down upon my head some dreadful calamity if i voluntarily relinquished the talisman irritated by my refusal the lady according to the custom of her sex became more resolute in her purpose but neither entreaties nor money could change my determination provoked beyond measure at my obstinacy as she called it she left the house on my brothers return i related to him what had happened and expected that he would have praised me for my prudence but on the contrary he blamed me for the superstitious value i set upon the verses on my vase and observed that it would be the height of folly to lose a certain means of advancing my fortune for the uncertain hope of magical protection i could not bring myself to be of his opinion i had not the courage to follow the advice he gave the next day the lady returned and my brother sold his vase to her for ten thousand pieces of gold this money he laid out in the most advantageous manner by purchasing a new stock of merchandise i repented when it was too late but i believe it is part of the fatality attending certain persons that they cannot decide rightly at the proper moment when the opportunity has been lost i have always regretted that i did not do exactly the contrary to what i had previously determined upon often whilst i was hesitating the favourable moment passed footnote whom the gods wish to destroy they first deprive of understanding now this is what i call being unlucky but to proceed with my story the lady who bought my brother saladins vase was the favourite of the sultan and allpowerful in the seraglio her dislike to me in consequence of my opposition to her wishes was so violent that she refused to return to my brothers house while i remained there he was unwilling to part with me but i could not bear to be the ruin of so good a brother without telling him my design i left his house careless of what should become of me hunger however soon compelled me to think of some immediate mode of obtaining relief i sat down upon a stone before the door of a bakers shop the smell of hot bread tempted me in and with a feeble voice i demanded charity the master baker gave me as much bread as i could eat upon condition that i should change dresses with him and carry the rolls for him through the city this day to this i readily consented but i had soon reason to repent of my compliance indeed if my ill luck had not as usual deprived me at this critical moment of memory and judgment i should never have complied with the bakers treacherous proposal for some time before the people of constantinople had been much dissatisfied with the weight and quality of the bread furnished by the bakers this species of discontent has often been the sure forerunner of an insurrection and in these disturbances the master bakers frequently lose their lives all these circumstances i knew but they did not occur to my memory when they might have been useful i changed dresses with the baker but scarcely had i proceeded through the adjoining streets with my rolls before the mob began to gather round me with reproaches and execrations the crowd pursued me even to the gates of the grand seigniors palace and the grand vizier alarmed at their violence sent out an order to have my head struck off the usual remedy in such cases being to strike off the bakers head i now fell upon my knees and protested i was not the baker for whom they took me that i had no connexion with him and that i had never furnished the people of constantinople with bread that was not weight i declared i had merely changed clothes with a master baker for this day and that i should not have done so but for the evil destiny which governs all my actions some of the mob exclaimed that i deserved to lose my head for my folly but others took pity on me and whilst the officer who was sent to execute the viziers order turned to speak to some of the noisy rioters those who were touched by my misfortune opened a passage for me through the crowd and thus favoured i effected my escape i quitted constantinople my vase i had left in the care of my brother at some miles distance from the city i overtook a party of soldiers i joined them and learning that they were going to embark with the rest of the grand seigniors army for egypt i resolved to accompany them if it be thought i the will of mahomet that i should perish the sooner i meet my fate the better the despondency into which i was sunk was attended by so great a degree of indolence that i scarcely would take the necessary means to preserve my existence during our passage to egypt i sat all day long upon the deck of the vessel smoking my pipe and i am convinced that if a storm had risen as i expected i should not have taken my pipe from my mouth nor should i have handled a rope to save myself from destruction such is the effect of that species of resignation or torpor whichever you please to call it to which my strong belief in fatality had reduced my mind we landed however safely contrary to my melancholy forebodings by a trifling accident not worth relating i was detained longer than any of my companions in the vessel when we disembarked and i did not arrive at the camp till late at night it was moonlight and i could see the whole scene distinctly there was a vast number of small tents scattered over a desert of white sand a few date trees were visible at a distance all was gloomy and all still no sound was to be heard but that of the camels feeding near the tents and as i walked on i met with no human creature my pipe was now out and i quickened my pace a little towards a fire which i saw near one of the tents as i proceeded my eye was caught by something sparkling in the sand it was a ring i picked it up and put it on my finger resolving to give it to the public crier the next morning who might find out its rightful owner but by ill luck i put it on my little finger for which it was much too large and as i hastened towards the fire to light my pipe i dropped the ring i stooped to search for it amongst the provender on which a mule was feeding and the cursed animal gave me so violent a kick on the head that i could not help roaring aloud my cries awakened those who slept in the tent near which the mule was feeding provoked at being disturbed the soldiers were ready enough to think ill of me and they took it for granted that i was a thief who had stolen the ring i pretended to have just found the ring was taken from me by force and the next day i was bastinadoed for having found it the officer persisting in the belief that stripes would make me confess where i had concealed certain other articles of value which had lately been missed in the camp all this was the consequence of my being in a hurry to light my pipe and of my having put the ring on a finger that was too little for it which no one but murad the unlucky would have done when i was able to walk again after my wounds were healed i went into one of the tents distinguished by a red flag having been told that these were coffeehouses whilst i was drinking coffee i heard a stranger near me complaining that he had not been able to recover a valuable ring he had lost although he had caused his loss to be published for three days by the public crier offering a reward of two hundred sequins to whoever should restore it i guessed that this was the very ring which i had unfortunately found i addressed myself to the stranger and promised to point out to him the person who had forced it from me the stranger recovered his ring and being convinced that i had acted honestly he made me a present of two hundred sequins as some amends for the punishment which i had unjustly suffered on his account now you would imagine that this purse of gold was advantageous to me far the contrary it was the cause of new misfortunes one night when i thought that the soldiers who were in the same tent with me were all fast asleep i indulged myself in the pleasure of counting my treasure the next day i was invited by my companions to drink sherbet with them what they mixed with the sherbet which i drank i know not but i could not resist the drowsiness it brought on i fell into a profound slumber and when i awoke i found myself lying under a date tree at some distance from the camp the first thing i thought of when i came to my recollection was my purse of sequins the purse i found still safe in my girdle but on opening it i perceived that it was filled with pebbles and not a single sequin was left i had no doubt that i had been robbed by the soldiers with whom i had drunk sherbet and i am certain that some of them must have been awake the night i counted my money otherwise as i had never trusted the secret of my riches to any one they could not have suspected me of possessing any property for ever since i kept company with them i had appeared to be in great indigence i applied in vain to the superior officers for redress the soldiers protested they were innocent no positive proof appeared against them and i gained nothing by my complaint but ridicule and illwill i called myself in the first transport of my grief by that name which since my arrival in egypt i had avoided to pronounce i called myself murad the unlucky the name and the story ran through the camp and i was accosted afterwards very frequently by this appellation some indeed varied their wit by calling me murad with the purse of pebbles all that i had yet suffered is nothing compared to my succeeding misfortunes it was the custom at this time in the turkish camp for the soldiers to amuse themselves with firing at a mark the superior officers remonstrated against this dangerous practice footnote antias observations on the manners and customs of the egyptians but ineffectually sometimes a party of soldiers would stop firing for a few minutes after a message was brought them from their commanders and then they would begin again in defiance of all orders such was the want of discipline in our army that this disobedience went unpunished in the mean time the frequency of the danger made most men totally regardless of it i have seen tents pierced with bullets in which parties were quietly seated smoking their pipes whilst those without were preparing to take fresh aim at the red flag on the top this apathy proceeded in some from unconquerable indolence of body in others from the intoxication produced by the fumes of tobacco and of opium but in most of my brother turks it arose from the confidence which the belief in predestination inspired when a bullet killed one of their companions they only observed scarcely taking the pipes from their mouths our hour is not yet come it is not the will of mahomet that we should fall i own that this rash security appeared to me at first surprising but it soon ceased to strike me with wonder and it even tended to confirm my favourite opinion that some were born to good and some to evil fortune i became almost as careless as my companions from following the same course of reasoning it is not thought i in the power of human prudence to avert the stroke of destiny i shall perhaps die tomorrow let me therefore enjoy today i now made it my study every day to procure as much amusement as possible my poverty as you will imagine restricted me from indulgence and excess but i soon found means to spend what did not actually belong to me there were certain jews who were followers of the camp and who calculating on the probability of victory for our troops advanced money to the soldiers for which they engaged to pay these usurers exorbitant interest the jew to whom i applied traded with me also upon the belief that my brother saladin with whose character and circumstances he was acquainted would pay my debts if i should fall with the money i raised from the jew i continually bought coffee and opium of which i grew immoderately fond in the delirium it created i forgot all my misfortunes all fear of the future one day when i had raised my spirits by an unusual quantity of opium i was strolling through the camp sometimes singing sometimes dancing like a madman and repeating that i was not now murad the unlucky whilst these words were on my lips a friendly spectator who was in possession of his sober senses caught me by the arm and attempted to drag me from the place where i was exposing myself do you not see said he those soldiers who are firing at a mark i saw one of them just now deliberately taking aim at your turban and observe he is now reloading his piece my ill luck prevailed even at this instant the only instant in my life when i defied its power i struggled with my adviser repeating i am not the wretch you take me for i am not murad the unlucky he fled from the danger himself i remained and in a few seconds afterwards a ball reached me and i fell senseless on the sand the ball was cut out of my body by an awkward surgeon who gave me ten times more pain than was necessary he was particularly hurried at this time because the army had just received orders to march in a few hours and all was confusion in the camp my wound was excessively painful and the fear of being left behind with those who were deemed incurable added to my torments perhaps if i had kept myself quiet i might have escaped some of the evils i afterwards endured but as i have repeatedly told you gentlemen it was my ill fortune never to be able to judge what was best to be done till the time for prudence was past during that day when my fever was at the height and when my orders were to keep my bed contrary to my natural habits of indolence i rose a hundred times and went out of my tent in the very heat of the day to satisfy my curiosity as to the number of the tents which had not been struck and of the soldiers who had not yet marched the orders to march were tardily obeyed and many hours elapsed before our encampment was raised had i submitted to my surgeons orders i might have been in a state to accompany the most dilatory of the stragglers i could have borne perhaps the slow motion of a litter on which some of the sick were transported but in the evening when the surgeon came to dress my wounds he found me in such a situation that it was scarcely possible to remove me he desired a party of soldiers who were left to bring up the rear to call for me the next morning they did so but they wanted to put me upon the mule which i recollected by a white streak on its back to be the cursed animal that had kicked me whilst i was looking for the ring i could not be prevailed upon to go upon this unlucky animal i tried to persuade the soldiers to carry me and they took me a little way but soon growing weary of their burden they laid me down on the sand pretending that they were going to fill a skin with water at a spring they had discovered and bade me lie still and wait for their return i waited and waited longing for the water to moisten my parched lips but no water cameno soldiers returned and there i lay for several hours expecting every moment to breathe my last i made no effort to move for i was now convinced my hour was come and that it was the will of mahomet that i should perish in this miserable manner and lie unburied like a dog a death thought i worthy of murad the unlucky my forebodings were not this time just a detachment of english soldiers passed near the place where i lay my groans were heard by them and they humanely came to my assistance they carried me with them dressed my wound and treated me with the utmost tenderness christians though they were i must acknowledge that i had reason to love them better than any of the followers of mahomet my good brother only excepted under their care i recovered but scarcely had i regained my strength before i fell into new disasters it was hot weather and my thirst was excessive i went out with a party in hopes of finding a spring of water the english soldiers began to dig for a well in a place pointed out to them by one of their men of science i was not inclined to such hard labour but preferred sauntering on in search of a spring i saw at a distance something that looked like a pool of water and i pointed it out to my companions their man of science warned me by his interpreter not to trust to this deceitful appearance for that such were common in this country and that when i came close to the spot i should find no water there he added that it was at a greater distance than i imagined and that i should in all probability be lost in the desert if i attempted to follow this phantom i was so unfortunate as not to attend to his advice i set out in pursuit of this accursed delusion which assuredly was the work of evil spirits who clouded my reason and allured me into their dominion i went on hour after hour in expectation continually of reaching the object of my wishes but it fled faster than i pursued and i discovered at last that the englishman who had doubtless gained his information from the people of the country was right and that the shining appearance which i had taken for water was a mere deception i was now exhausted with fatigue i looked back in vain after the companions i had left i could see neither men animals nor any trace of vegetation in the sandy desert i had no resource but weary as i was to measure back my footsteps which were imprinted in the sand i slowly and sorrowfully traced them as my guides in this unknown land instead of yielding to my indolent inclinations i ought however to have made the best of my way back before the evening breeze sprung up i felt the breeze rising and unconscious of my danger i rejoiced and opened my bosom to meet it but what was my dismay when i saw that the wind swept before it all trace of my footsteps in the sand i knew not which way to proceed i was struck with despair tore my garments threw off my turban and cried aloud but neither human voice nor echo answered me the silence was dreadful i had tasted no food for many hours and i now became sick and faint i recollected that i had put a supply of opium into the folds of my turban but alas when i took my turban up i found that the opium had fallen out i searched for it in vain on the sand where i had thrown the turban i stretched myself out upon the ground and yielded without further struggle to my evil destiny what i suffered from thirst hunger and heat cannot be described at last i fell into a sort of trance during which images of various kinds seemed to flit before my eyes how long i remained in this state i know not but i remember that i was brought to my senses by a loud shout which came from persons belonging to a caravan returning from mecca this was a shout of joy for their safe arrival at a certain spring well known to them in this part of the desert the spring was not a hundred yards from the spot where i lay yet such had been the fate of murad the unlucky that he missed the reality whilst he had been hours in pursuit of the phantom feeble and spiritless as i was i sent forth as loud a cry as i could in hopes of obtaining assistance and i endeavoured to crawl to the place from which the voices appeared to come the caravan rested for a considerable time whilst the slaves filled the skins with water and whilst the camels took in their supply i worked myself on towards them yet notwithstanding my efforts i was persuaded that according to my usual ill fortune i should never be able to make them hear my voice i saw them mount their camels i took off my turban unrolled it and waved it in the air my signal was seen the caravan came towards me i had scarcely strength to speak a slave gave me some water and after i had drunk i explained to them who i was and how i came into this situation whilst i was speaking one of the travellers observed the purse which hung to my girdle it was the same the merchant for whom i recovered the ring had given to me i had carefully preserved it because the initials of my benefactors name and a passage from the koran were worked upon it when he gave it to me he said that perhaps we should meet again in some other part of the world and he should recognize me by this token the person who now took notice of the purse was his brother and when i related to him how i had obtained it he had the goodness to take me under his protection he was a merchant who was now going with the caravan to grand cairo he offered to take me with him and i willingly accepted the proposal promising to serve him as faithfully as any of his slaves the caravan proceeded and i was carried with it chapter ii the merchant who was become my master treated me with great kindness but on hearing me relate the whole series of my unfortunate adventures he exacted a promise from me that would do nothing without first consulting him since you are so unlucky murad said he that you always choose for the worst when you choose for yourself you should trust entirely to the judgment of a wiser or a more fortunate friend i fared well in the service of this merchant who was a man of a mild disposition and who was so rich that he could afford to be generous to all his dependants it was my business to see his camels loaded and unloaded at proper places to count his bales of merchandise and to take care that they were not mixed with those of his companions this i carefully did till the day we arrived at alexandria when unluckily i neglected to count the bales taking it for granted that they were all right as i had found them so the preceding day however when we were to go on board the vessel that was to take us to cairo i perceived that three bales of cotton were missing i ran to inform my master who though a good deal provoked at my negligence did not reproach me as i deserved the public crier was immediately sent round the city to offer a reward for the recovery of the merchandise and it was restored by one of the merchants slaves with whom we had travelled the vessel was now under sail my master and i and the bales of cotton were obliged to follow in a boat and when we were taken on board the captain declared he was so loaded that he could not tell where to stow the bales of cotton after much difficulty he consented to let them remain upon deck and i promised my master to watch them night and day we had a prosperous voyage and were actually in sight of shore which the captain said we could not fail to reach early the next morning i stayed as usual this night upon deck and solaced myself by smoking my pipe ever since i had indulged in this practice at the camp at el arish i could not exist without opium and tobacco i suppose that my reason was this night a little clouded with the dose i took but towards midnight i was sobered by terror i started up from the deck on which i had stretched myself my turban was in flames the bale of cotton on which i had rested was all on fire i awakened two sailors who were fast asleep on deck the consternation became general and the confusion increased the danger the captain and my master were the most active and suffered the most in extinguishing the flames my master was terribly scorched for my part i was not suffered to do any thing the captain ordered that i should be bound to the mast and when at last the flames were extinguished the passengers with one accord besought him to keep me bound hand and foot lest i should be the cause of some new disaster all that had happened was indeed occasioned by my ill luck i had laid my pipe down when i was falling asleep upon the bale of cotton that was beside me the fire from my pipe fell out and set the cotton in flames such was the mixture of rage and terror with which i had inspired the whole crew that i am sure they would have set me ashore on a desert island rather than have had me on board for a week longer even my humane master i could perceive was secretly impatient to get rid of murad the unlucky and his evil fortune you may believe that i was heartily glad when we landed and when i was unbound my master put a purse containing fifty sequins into my hand and bade me farewell use this money prudently murad if you can said he and perhaps your fortune may change of this i had little hopes but determined to lay out my money as prudently as possible as i was walking through the streets of grand cairo considering how i should lay out my fifty sequins to the greatest advantage i was stopped by one who called me by my name and asked me if i could pretend to have forgotten his face i looked steadily at him and recollected to my sorrow that he was the jew rachub from whom i had borrowed certain sums of money at the camp at el arish what brought him to grand cairo except it was my evil destiny i cannot tell he would not quit me he would take no excuses he said he knew that i had deserted twice once from the turkish and once from the english array that i was not entitled to any pay and that he could not imagine it possible that my brother saladin would own me or pay my debts i replied for i was vexed by the insolence of this jewish dog that i was not as he imagined a beggar that i had the means of paying him my just debt but that i hoped he would not extort from me all that exorbitant interest which none but a jew could exact he smiled and answered that if a turk loved opium better than money this was no fault of his that he had supplied me with what i loved best in the world and that i ought not to complain when he expected i should return the favour i will not weary you gentlemen with all the arguments that passed between me and rachub at last we compromised matters he would take nothing less than the whole debt but he let me have at a very cheap rate a chest of secondhand clothes by which he assured me i might make my fortune he brought them to grand cairo he said for the purpose of selling them to slave merchants who at this time of the year were in want of them to supply their slaves but he was in haste to get home to his wife and family at constantinople and therefore he was willing to make over to a friend the profits of this speculation i should have distrusted rachubs professions of friendship and especially of disinterestedness but he took me with him to the khan where his goods were and unlocked the chest of clothes to show them to me they were of the richest and finest materials and had been but little worn i could not doubt the evidence of my senses the bargain was concluded and the jew sent porters to my inn with the chest the next day i repaired to the public marketplace and when my business was known i had choice of customers before night my chest was emptyand my purse was full the profit i made upon the sale of these clothes was so considerable that i could not help feeling astonishment at rachubs having brought himself so readily to relinquish them a few days after i had disposed of the contents of my chest a damascene merchant who had bought two suits of apparel from me told me with a very melancholy face that both the female slaves who had put on these clothes were sick i could not conceive that the clothes were the cause of their i sickness but soon afterwards as i was crossing the market i was attacked by at least a dozen merchants who made similar complaints they insisted upon knowing how i came by the garments and demanded whether i had worn any of them myself this day i had for the first time indulged myself with wearing a pair of yellow slippers the only finery i had reserved for myself out of all the tempting goods convinced by my wearing these slippers that i could have had no insidious designs since i shared the danger whatever it might be the merchants were a little pacified but what was my terror and remorse the next day when one of them came to inform me that plagueboils had broken out tinder the arms of all the slaves who had worn this pestilential apparel on looking carefully into the chest we found the word smyrna written and half effaced upon the lid now the plague had for some time raged at smyrna and as the merchants suspected these clothes had certainly belonged to persons who had died of that distemper this was the reason why the jew was willing to sell them to me so cheap and it was for this reason that he would not stay at grand cairo himself to reap the profits of his speculation indeed if i had paid attention to it at the proper time a slight circumstance might have revealed the truth to me whilst i was bargaining with the jew before he opened the chest he swallowed a large dram of brandy and stuffed his nostrils with sponge dipped in vinegar this he told me he did to prevent his perceiving the smell of musk which always threw him into convulsions the horror i felt when i discovered that i had spread the infection of the plague and that i had probably caught it myself overpowered my senses a cold dew spread over all my limbs and i fell upon the lid of the fatal chest in a swoon it is said that fear disposes people to take the infection however this may be i sickened that evening and soon was in a raging fever it was worse for me whenever the delirium left me and i could reflect upon the miseries my ill fortune had occasioned in my first lucid interval i looked round and saw that i had been removed from the khan to a wretched hut an old woman who was smoking her pipe in the farthest corner of my room informed me that i had been sent out of the town of grand cairo by order of the cadi to whom the merchants had made their complaint the fatal chest was burnt and the house in which i had lodged razed to the ground and if it had not been for me continued the old woman you would have been dead probably at this instant but i have made a vow to our great prophet that i would never neglect an opportunity of doing a good action therefore when you were deserted by all the world i took care of you here too is your purse which i saved from the rabble and what is more difficult from the officers of justice i will account to you for every para that i have expended and will moreover tell you the reason of my making such an extraordinary vow as i believed that this benevolent old woman took great pleasure in talking i made an inclination of my head to thank her for her promised history and she proceeded but i must confess i did not listen with all the attention her narrative doubtless deserved even curiosity the strongest passion of us turks was dead within me i have no recollection of the old womans story it is as much as i can do to finish my own the weather became excessively hot it was affirmed by some of the physicians that this heat would prove fatal to their patients footnote antiss observations on the manners and customs of the egyptians but contrary to the prognostics of the physicians it stopped the progress of the plague i recovered and found my purse much lightened by my illness i divided the remainder of my money with my humane nurse and sent her out into the city to inquire how matters were going on she brought me word that the fury of the plague had much abated but that she had met several funerals and that she had heard many of the merchants cursing the folly of murad the unlucky who as they said had brought all this calamity upon the inhabitants of cairo even fools they say learn by experience i took care to burn the bed on which i had lain and the clothes i had worn i concealed my real name which i knew would inspire detestation and gained admittance with a crowd of other poor wretches into a lazaretto where i performed quarantine and offered up prayers daily for the sick when i thought it was impossible i could spread the infection i took my passage home i was eager to get away from grand cairo where i knew i was an object of execration i had a strange fancy haunting my mind i imagined that all my misfortunes since i left constantinople had arisen from my neglect of the talisman upon the beautiful china vase i dreamed three times when i was recovering from the plague that a genius appeared to me and said in a reproachful tone murad where is the vase that was intrusted to thy care this dream operated strongly upon my imagination as soon as we arrived at constantinople which we did to my great surprise without meeting with any untoward accidents i went in search of my brother saladin to inquire for my vase he no longer lived in the house in which i left him and i began to be apprehensive that he was dead but a porter hearing my inquiries exclaimed who is there in constantinople that is ignorant of the dwelling of saladin the lucky come with me and i will show it to you the mansion to which he conducted me looked so magnificent that i was almost afraid to enter lest there should be some mistake but whilst i was hesitating the doors opened and i heard my brother saladins voice he saw me almost at the same instant that i fixed my eyes upon him and immediately sprang forward to embrace me he was the same good brother as ever and i rejoiced in his prosperity with all my heart brother saladin said i can you now doubt that some men are born to be fortunate and others to be unfortunate how often you used to dispute this point with me let us not dispute it now in the public street said he smiling but come in and refresh yourself and we will consider the question afterwards at leisure no my dear brother said i drawing back you are too good murad the unlucky shall not enter your house lest he should draw down misfortunes upon you and yours i come only to ask for my vase it is safe cried he come in and you shall see it but i will not give it up till i have you in my house i have none of these superstitious fears pardon me the expression but i have none of these superstitious fears i yielded entered his house and was astonished at all i saw my brother did not triumph in his prosperity but on the contrary seemed intent only upon making me forget my misfortunes he listened to the account of them with kindness and obliged me by the recital of his history which was i must acknowledge far less wonderful than my own he seemed by his own account to have grown rich in the common course of things or rather by his own prudence i allowed for his prejudices and unwilling to dispute farther with him said you must remain of your opinion brother and i of mine you are saladin the lucky and i murad the unlucky and so we shall remain to the end of our lives i had not been in his house four days when an accident happened which showed how much i was in the right the favourite of the sultan to whom he had formerly sold his china vase though her charms were now somewhat faded by time still retained her power and her taste for magnificence she commissioned my brother to bespeak for her at venice the most splendid lookingglass that money could purchase the mirror after many delays and disappointments at length arrived at my brothers house he unpacked it and sent to let the lady know it was in perfect safety it was late in the evening and she ordered it should remain where it was that night and that it should be brought to the seraglio the next morning it stood in a sort of antechamber to the room in which i slept and with it were left some packages containing glass chandeliers for an unfinished saloon in my brothers house saladin charged all his domestics to be vigilant this night because he had money to a great amount by him and there had been frequent robberies in our neighbourhood hearing these orders i resolved to be in readiness at a moments warning i laid my scimitar beside me upon a cushion and left my door half open that i might hear the slightest noise in the antechamber or the great staircase about midnight i was suddenly awakened by a noise in the antechamber i started up seized my scimitar and the instant i got to the door saw by the light of the lamp which was burning in the room a man standing opposite to me with a drawn sword in his hand i rushed forward demanding what he wanted and received no answer but seeing him aim at me with his scimitar i gave him as i thought a deadly blow at this instant i heard a great crash and the fragments of the lookingglass which i had shivered fell at my feet at the same moment something black brushed by my shoulder i pursued it stumbled over the packages of glass and rolled over them down the stairs my brother came out of his room to inquire the cause of all this disturbance and when he saw the fine mirror broken and me lying amongst the glass chandeliers at the bottom of the stairs he could not forbear exclaiming well brother you are indeed murad the unlucky when the first emotion was over he could not however forbear laughing at my situation with a degree of goodness which made me a thousand times more sorry for the accident he came down stairs to help me up gave me his hand and said forgive me if i was angry with you at first i am sure you did not mean to do me any injury but tell me how all this has happened whilst saladin was speaking i heard the same kind of noise which had alarmed me in the antechamber but on looking back i saw only a black pigeon which flew swiftly by me unconscious of the mischief he had occasioned this pigeon i had unluckily brought into the house the preceding day and had been feeding and trying to tame it for my young nephews i little thought it would be the cause of such disasters my brother though he endeavoured to conceal his anxiety from me was much disturbed at the idea of meeting the favourites displeasure who would certainly be grievously disappointed by the loss of her splendid lookingglass i saw that i should inevitably be his ruin if i continued in his house and no persuasions could prevail upon me to prolong my stay my generous brother seeing me determined to go said to me a factor whom i have employed for some years to sell merchandise for me died a few days ago will you take his place i am rich enough to bear any little mistakes you may fall into from ignorance of business and you will have a partner who is able and willing to assist you i was touched to the heart by this kindness especially at such a time as this he sent one of his slaves with me to the shop in which you now see me gentlemen the slave by my brothers directions brought with us my china vase and delivered it safely to me with this message the scarlet dye that was found in this vase and in its fellow was the first cause of saladins making the fortune he now enjoys he therefore does no more than justice in sharing that fortune with his brother murad i was now placed in as advantageous a situation as possible but my mind was ill at ease when i reflected that the broken mirror might be my brothers ruin the lady by whom it had been bespoken was i well knew of a violent temper and this disappointment was sufficient to provoke her to vengeance my brother sent me word this morning however that though her displeasure was excessive it was in my power to prevent any ill consequences that might ensue in my power i exclaimed then indeed i am happy tell my brother there is nothing i will not do to show him my gratitude and to save him from the consequences of my folly the slave who was sent by my brother seemed unwilling to name what was required of me saying that his master was afraid i should not like to grant the request i urged him to speak freely and he then told me the favourite declared nothing would make her amends for the loss of the mirror but the fellow vase to that which she had bought from saladin it was impossible for me to hesitate gratitude for my brothers generous kindness overcame my superstitious obstinacy and i sent him word i would carry the vase to him myself i took it down this evening from the shelf on which it stood it was covered with dust and i washed it but unluckily in endeavouring to clean the inside from the remains of the scarlet powder i poured hot water into it and immediately i heard a simmering noise and my vase in a few instants burst asunder with a loud explosion these fragments alas are all that remain the measure of my misfortunes is now completed can you wonder gentlemen that i bewail my evil destiny am i not justly called murad the unlucky here end all my hopes in this world better would it have been if i had died long ago better that i had never been born nothing i ever have done or attempted has prospered murad the unlucky is my name and illfate has marked me for her own chapter iii the lamentations of murad were interrupted by the entrance of saladin having waited in vain for some hours he now came to see if any disaster had happened to his brother murad he was surprised at the sight of the two pretended merchants and could not refrain from exclamations on beholding the broken vase however with his usual equanimity and goodnature he began to console murad and taking up the fragments examined them carefully one by one joined them together again found that none of the edges of the china were damaged and declared he could have it mended so as to look as well as ever murad recovered his spirits upon this brother said he i comfort myself for being murad the unlucky when i reflect that you are saladin the lucky see gentlemen continued he turning to the pretended merchants scarcely has this most fortunate of men been five minutes in company before he gives a happy turn to affairs his presence inspires joy i observe your countenances which had been saddened by my dismal history have brightened up since he has made his appearance brother i wish you would make these gentlemen some amends for the time they have wasted in listening to my catalogue of misfortunes by relating your history which i am sure they will find rather more exhilarating saladin consented on condition that the strangers would accompany him home and partake of a social banquet they at first repeated the former excuse of their being obliged to return to their inn but at length the sultans curiosity prevailed and he and his vizier went home with saladin the lucky who after supper related his history in the following manner my being called saladin the lucky first inspired me with confidence in myself though i own that i cannot remember any extraordinary instances of good luck in my childhood an old nurse of my mothers indeed repeated to me twenty times a day that nothing i undertook could fail to succeed because i was saladin the lucky i became presumptuous and rash and my nurses prognostics might have effectually prevented their accomplishment had i not when i was about fifteen been roused to reflection during a long confinement which was the consequence of my youthful conceit and imprudence at this time there was at the porte a frenchman an ingenious engineer who was employed and favoured by the sultan to the great astonishment of many of my prejudiced countrymen on the grand seigniors birthday he exhibited some extraordinarily fine fireworks and i with numbers of the inhabitants of constantinople crowded to see them i happened to stand near the place where the frenchman was stationed the crowd pressed upon him and i amongst the rest he begged we would for our own sakes keep at a greater distance and warned us that we might be much hurt by the combustibles which he was using i relying upon my good fortune disregarded all these cautions and the consequence was that as i touched some of the materials prepared for the fireworks they exploded dashed me upon the ground with great violence and i was terribly burnt this accident gentlemen i consider as one of the most fortunate circumstances of my life for it checked and corrected the presumption of my temper during the time i was confined to my bed the french gentleman came frequently to see me he was a very sensible man and the conversations he had with me enlarged my mind and cured me of many foolish prejudices especially of that which i had been taught to entertain concerning the predominance of what is called luck or fortune in human affairs though you are called saladin the lucky said he you find that your neglect of prudence has nearly brought you to the grave even in the bloom of youth take my advice and henceforward trust more to prudence than to fortune let the multitude if they will call you saladin the lucky but call yourself and make yourself saladin the prudent these words left an indelible impression on my mind and gave a new turn to my thoughts and character my brother murad has doubtless told you that our difference of opinion on the subject of predestination produced between us frequent arguments but we could never convince one another and we each have acted through life in consequence of our different beliefs to this i attribute my success and his misfortunes the first rise of my fortune as you have probably heard from murad was owing to the scarlet dye which i brought to perfection with infinite difficulty the powder it is true was accidentally found by me in our china vases but there it might have remained to this instant useless if i had not taken the pains to make it useful i grant that we can only partially foresee and command events yet on the use we make of our own powers i think depends our destiny but gentlemen you would rather hear my adventures perhaps than my reflections and i am truly concerned for your sakes that i have no wonderful events to relate i am sorry i cannot tell you of my having been lost in a sandy desert i have never had the plague nor even been shipwrecked i have been all my life an inhabitant of constantinople and have passed my time in a very quiet and uniform manner the money i received from the sultans favourite for my china vase as my brother may have told you enabled me to trade on a more extensive scale i went on steadily with my business and made it my whole study to please my employers by all fair and honourable means this industry and civility succeeded beyond my expectations in a few years i was rich for a man in my way of business i will not proceed to trouble you with the journal of a petty merchants life i pass on to the incident which made a considerable change in my affairs a terrible fire broke out near the walls of the grand seigniors seraglio footnote vide baron de totts memoirs as you are strangers gentlemen you may not have heard of this event though it produced so great a sensation in constantinople the viziers superb palace was utterly consumed and the melted lead poured down from the roof of the mosque of st sophia various were the opinions formed by my neighbours respecting the cause of the conflagration some supposed it to be a punishment for the sultans having neglected one friday to appear at the mosque of st sophia others considered it as a warning sent by mahomet to dissuade the porte from persisting in a war in which we were just engaged the generality however of the coffeehouse politicians contented themselves with observing that it was the will of mahomet that the palace should be consumed satisfied by this supposition they took no precaution to prevent similar accidents in their own houses never were fires so common in the city as at this period scarcely a night passed without our being wakened by the cry of fire these frequent fires were rendered still more dreadful by villains who were continually on the watch to increase the confusion by which they profited and to pillage the houses of the sufferers it was discovered that these incendiaries frequently skulked towards evening in the neighbourhood of the bezestein where the richest merchants store their goods some of these wretches were detected in throwing coundaks footnote a coundak is a sort of combustible that consists only of a piece of tinder wrapped in brimstone matches in the midst of a small bundle of pine shavings this is the method usually employed by incendiariesthey lay this match by stealth behind a door which they find open or on a window and after setting it on fire they make their escape this is sufficient often to produce the most terrible ravages in a town where the houses built with wood and painted with oil of spike afford the easiest opportunity to the miscreant who is disposed to reduce them to ashes the method employed by the incendiaries and which often escapes the vigilance of the masters of the houses added to the common causes of fires gave for some time very frequent causes of alarmtranslation of memoirs of baron de tott vol i or matches into the windows and if these combustibles remained a sufficient time they could not fail to set the house on fire notwithstanding all these circumstances many even of those who had property to preserve continued to repeat it is the will of mahomet and consequently to neglect all means of preservation i on the contrary recollecting the lesson i had learned from the sensible foreigner neither suffered my spirits to sink with superstitious fears of ill luck nor did i trust presumptuously to my good fortune i took every possible means to secure myself i never went to bed without having seen that all the lights and fires in the house were extinguished and that i had a supply of water in the cistern i had likewise learned from my frenchman that wet mortar was the most effectual thing for stopping the progress of flames i therefore had a quantity of mortar made up in one of my outhouses which i could use at a moments warning these precautions were all useful to me my own house indeed was never actually on fire but the houses of my next door neighbours were no less than five times in flames in the course of one winter by my exertions or rather by my precautions they suffered but little damage and all my neighbours looked upon me as their deliverer and friend they loaded me with presents and offered more indeed than i would accept all repeated that i was saladin the lucky this compliment i disclaimed feeling more ambitious of being called saladin the prudent it is thus that what we call modesty is often only a more refined species of pride but to proceed with my story one night i had been later than usual at supper at a friends house none but the watch were in the streets and even they i believe were asleep as i passed one of the conduits which convey water to the city i heard a trickling noise and upon examination i found that the cock of the waterspout was half turned so that the water was running out i turned it back to its proper place thought it had been left unturned by accident and walked on but i had not proceeded far before i came to another spout and another which were in the same condition i was convinced that this could not be the effect merely of accident and suspected that some illintentioned persons designed to let out and waste the water of the city that there might be none to extinguish any fire that should break out in the course of the night i stood still for a few moments to consider how it would be most prudent to act it would be impossible for me to run to all parts of the city that i might stop the pipes that were running to waste i first thought of wakening the watch and the firemen who were most of them slumbering at their stations but i reflected that they were perhaps not to be trusted and that they were in a confederacy with the incendiaries otherwise they would certainly before this hour have observed and stopped the running of the sewers in their neighbourhood i determined to waken a rich merchant called damat zade who lived near me and who had a number of slaves whom he could send to different parts of the city to prevent mischief and give notice to the inhabitants of their danger he was a very sensible active man and one that could easily be wakened he was not like some turks an hour in recovering their lethargic senses he was quick in decision and action and his slaves resembled their master he despatched a messenger immediately to the grand vizier that the sultans safety might be secured and sent others to the magistrates in each quarter of constantinople the large drums in the janissary agas tower beat to rouse the inhabitants and scarcely had this been heard to beat half an hour before the fire broke out in the lower apartments of damat zades house owing to a coundak which had been left behind one of the doors the wretches who had prepared the mischief came to enjoy it and to pillage but they were disappointed astonished to find themselves taken into custody they could not comprehend hew their designs had been frustrated by timely exertions the fire in my friends house was extinguished and though fires broke out during the night in many parts of the city but little damage was sustained because there was time for precautions and by the stopping of the spouts sufficient water was preserved people were awakened and warned of the danger and they consequently escaped unhurt the next day as soon as i made my appearance at the bezestein the merchants crowded round called me their benefactor and the preserver of their lives and fortunes damat zade the merchant whom i had awakened the preceding night presented to me a heavy purse of gold and put upon my finger a diamond ring of considerable value each of the merchants followed his example in making me rich presents the magistrates also sent me tokens of their approbation and the grand vizier sent me a diamond of the first water with a line written by his own hand to the man who has saved constantinople excuse me gentlemen for the vanity i seem to show in mentioning these circumstances you desired to hear my history and i cannot therefore omit the principal circumstance of my life in the course of fourandtwenty hours i found myself raised by the munificent gratitude of the inhabitants of this city to a state of affluence far beyond what i had ever dreamed of attaining i now took a house suited to my circumstances and bought a few slaves as i was carrying my slaves home i was met by a jew who stopped me saying in his language my lord i see has been purchasing slaves i could clothe them cheaply there was something mysterious in the manner of this jew and i did not like his countenance but i considered that i ought not to be governed by caprice in my dealings and that if this man could really clothe my slaves more cheaply than another i ought not to neglect his offer merely because i took a dislike to the cut of his beard the turn of his eye or the tone of his voice i therefore bade the jew follow me home saying that i would consider of his proposal when we came to talk over the matter i was surprised to find him so reasonable in his demands on one point indeed he appeared unwilling to comply i required not only to see the clothes i was offered but also to know how they came into his possession on this subject he equivocated i therefore suspected there must be something wrong i reflected what it could be and judged that the goods had been stolen or that they had been the apparel of persons who had died of some contagious distemper the jew showed me a chest from which he said i might choose whatever suited me best i observed that as he was going to unlock the chest he stuffed his nose with some aromatic herbs he told me that he did so to prevent his smelling the musk with which the chest was perfumed musk he said had an extraordinary effect upon his nerves i begged to have some of the herbs which he used himself declaring that musk was likewise offensive to me the jew either struck by his own conscience or observing my suspicions turned as pale as death he pretended he had not the right key and could not unlock the chest said he must go in search of it and that he would call on me again after he had left me i examined some writing upon the lid of the chest that had been nearly effaced i made out the word smyrna and this was sufficient to confirm all my suspicions the jew returned no more he sent some porters to carry away the chest and i heard nothing of him for some time till one day when i was at the house of damat zade i saw a glimpse of the jew passing hastily through one of the courts as if he wished to avoid me my friend said i to damat zade do not attribute my question to impertinent curiosity or to a desire to intermeddle with your affairs if i venture to ask the nature of your business with the jew who has just now crossed your court he has engaged to supply me with clothing for my slaves replied my friend cheaper than i can purchase it elsewhere i have a design to surprise my daughter fatima on her birthday with an entertainment in the pavilion in the garden and all her female slaves shall appear in new dresses on the occasion i interrupted my friend to tell him what i suspected relative to this jew and his chest of clothes it is certain that the infection of the plague can be communicated by clothes not only after months but after years have elapsed the merchant resolved to have nothing more to do with this wretch who could thus hazard the lives of thousands of his fellowcreatures for a few pieces of gold we sent notice of the circumstance to the cadi but the cadi was slow in his operations and before he could take the jew into custody the cunning fellow had effected his escape when his house was searched he and his chest had disappeared we discovered that he sailed for egypt and rejoiced that we had driven him from constantinople my friend damat zade expressed the warmest gratitude to me you formerly saved my fortune you have now saved my life and a life yet dearer than my own that of my daughter fatima at the sound of that name i could not i believe avoid showing some emotion i had accidentally seen this lady and i had been captivated by her beauty and by the sweetness of her countenance but as i knew she was destined to be the wife of another i suppressed my feeling and determined to banish the recollection of the fair fatima for ever from my imagination her father however at this instant threw into my way a temptation which it required all my fortitude to resist saladin continued he it is but just that you who have saved our lives should share our festivity come here on the birthday of my fatima i will place you in a balcony which overlooks the garden and you shall see the whole spectacle we shall have a feast of tulips in imitation of that which as you know is held in the grand seigniors gardens i assure you the sight will be worth seeing and besides you will have a chance of beholding my fatima for a moment without her veil that interrupted i is the thing i most wish to avoid i dare not indulge myself in a pleasure which might cost me the happiness of my life i will conceal nothing from you who treat me with so much confidence i have already beheld the charming countenance of your fatima but i know that she is destined to be the wife of a happier man damat zade seemed much pleased by the frankness with which i explained myself but he would not give up the idea of my sitting with him in the balcony on the day of the feast of tulips and i on my part could not consent to expose myself to another view of the charming fatima my friend used every argument or rather every sort of persuasion he could imagine to prevail upon me he then tried to laugh me out of my resolution and when all failed he said in a voice of anger go then saladin i am sure you are deceiving me you have a passion for some other woman and you would conceal it from me and persuade me you refuse the favour i offer you from prudence when in fact it is from indifference and contempt why could you not speak the truth of your heart to me with that frankness with which one friend should treat another astonished at this unexpected charge and at the anger which flashed from the eyes of damat zade who till this moment had always appeared to me a man of a mild and reasonable temper i was for an instant tempted to fly into a passion and leave him but friends once lost are not easily regained this consideration had power sufficient to make me command my temper my friend replied i we will talk over this affair tomorrow you are now angry and cannot do me justice but tomorrow you will be cool you will then be convinced that i have not deceived you and that i have no design but to secure my own happiness by the most prudent means in my power by avoiding the sight of the dangerous fatima i have no passion for any other woman then said my friend embracing me and quitting the tone of anger which he had assumed only to try my resolution to the utmost then saladin fatima is yours i scarcely dared to believe my senses i could not express my joy yes my friend continued the merchant i have tried your prudence to the utmost it has been victorious and i resign my fatima to you certain that you will make her happy it is true i had a greater alliance in view for her the pacha of maksoud has demanded her from me but i have found upon private inquiry he is addicted to the intemperate use of opium and my daughter shall never be the wife of one who is a violent madman one half the day and a melancholy idiot during the remainder i have nothing to apprehend from the pachas resentment because i have powerful friends with the grand vizier who will oblige him to listen to reason and to submit quietly to a disappointment he so justly merits and now saladin have you any objection to seeing the feast of tulips i replied only by falling at the merchants feet and embracing his knees the feast of tulips came and on that day i was married to the charming fatima the charming fatima i continue still to think her though she has now been my wife some years she is the joy and pride of my heart and from our mutual affection i have experienced more felicity than from all the other circumstances of my life which are called so fortunate her father gave me the house in which i now live and joined his possessions to ours so that i have more wealth even than i desire my riches however give me continually the means of relieving the wants of others and therefore i cannot affect to despise them i must persuade my brother murad to share them with me and to forget his misfortunes i shall then think myself completely happy as to the sultanas lookingglass and your broken vase my dear brother continued saladin we must think of some means think no more of the sultanas lookingglass or of the broken vase exclaimed the sultan throwing aside his merchants habit and showing beneath it his own imperial vest saladin i rejoice to have heard from your own lips the history of your life i acknowledge vizier i have been in the wrong in our argument continued the sultan turning to his vizier i acknowledge that the histories of saladin the lucky and murad the unlucky favour your opinion that prudence has more influence than chance in human affairs the success and happiness of saladin seem to me to have arisen from his prudence by that prudence constantinople has been saved from flames and from the plague had murad possessed his brothers discretion he would not have been on the point of losing his head for selling rolls which he did not bake he would not have been kicked by a mule or bastinadoed for finding a ring he would not have been robbed by one party of soldiers or shot by another he would not have been lost in a desert or cheated by a jew he would not have set a ship on fire nor would he have caught the plague and spread it through grand cairo he would not have run my sultanas lookingglass through the body instead of a robber he would not have believed that the fate of his life depended on certain verses on a china vase nor would he at last have broken this precious talisman by washing it with hot water henceforward let murad the unlucky be named murad the imprudent let saladin preserve the surname he merits and be henceforth called saladin the prudent so spake the sultan who unlike the generality of monarchs could bear to find himself in the wrong and could discover his vizier to be in the right without cutting off his head history farther informs us that the sultan offered to make saladin a pacha and to commit to him the government of a province but saladin the prudent declined this honour saying he had no ambition was perfectly happy in his present situation and that when this was the case it would be folly to change because no one can be more than happy what farther adventures befel murad the imprudent are not recorded it is known only that he became a daily visitor to the teriaky and that he died a martyr to the immoderate use of opium footnote those among the turks who give themselves up to an immoderate use of opium are easily to be distinguished by a sort of rickety complaint which this poison produces in course of time destined to live agreeably only when in a sort of drunkenness these men present a curious spectacle when they are assembled in a part of constantinople called teriaky or tcharkissy the market of opiumeaters it is there that towards the evening you may see the lovers of opium arrive by the different streets which terminate at the solymania the greatest mosque in constantinople their pale and melancholy countenances would inspire only compassion did not their stretched necks their heads twisted to the right or left their backbones crooked one shoulder up to their ears and a number of other whimsical attitudes which are the consequences of the disorder present the most ludicrous and the most laughable picturevide de totts memoirs the manufacturers chapter i by patient persevering attention to business mr john darford succeeded in establishing a considerable cotton manufactory by means of which he secured to himself in his old age what is called or what he called a competent fortune his ideas of a competent fortune were indeed rather unfashionable for they included as he confessed only the comforts and conveniences without any of the vanities of life he went farther still in his unfashionable singularities of opinion for he was often heard to declare that he thought a busy manufacturer might be as happy as any idle gentleman mr darford had taken his two nephews charles and william into partnership with him william who had been educated by him resembled him in character habits and opinions always active and cheerful he seemed to take pride and pleasure in the daily exertions and care which his situation and the trust reposed in him required far from being ashamed of his occupations he gloried in them and the sense of duty was associated in his mind with the idea of happiness his cousin charles on the contrary felt his duty and his ideas of happiness continually at variance he had been brought up in an extravagant family who considered tradesmen and manufacturers as a caste disgraceful to polite society nothing but the utter ruin of his fathers fortune could have determined him to go into business he never applied to the affairs of the manufactory he affected to think his understanding above such vulgar concerns and spent his days in regretting that his brilliant merit was buried in obscurity he was sensible that he hazarded the loss of his uncles favour by the avowal of his prejudices yet such was his habitual conceit that he could not suppress frequent expressions of contempt for mr darfords liberal notions whenever his uncles opinion differed from his own he settled the argument as he fancied by saying to himself or to his clerk my uncle darford knows nothing of the world how should he poor man shut up as he has been all his life in a countinghouse nearly sixty years experience which his uncle sometimes pleaded as an apology for trusting to his own judgment availed nothing in the opinion of our prejudiced youth prejudiced youth did we presume to say charles would have thought this a very improper expression for he had no idea that any but old men could be prejudiced uncles and fathers and grandfathers were as he thought the race of beings peculiarly subject to this mental malady from which all young men especially those who have their boots made by a fashionable bootmaker are of course exempt at length the time came when charles was at liberty to follow his own opinions mr darford died and his fortune and manufactory were equally divided between his two nephews now said charles i am no longer chained to the oar i will leave you william to do as you please and drudge on day after day in the manufactory since that is your taste for my part i have no genius for business i shall take my pleasure and all i have to do is to pay some poor devil for doing my business for me i am afraid the poor devil will not do your business as well as you would do it yourself said william you know the proverb of the masters eye true true very likely cried charles going to the window to look at a regiment of dragoons galloping through the town but i have other employment for my eyes do look at those fine fellows who are galloping by did you ever see a handsomer uniform than the colonels and what a fine horse gad i wish i had a commission in the army i should so like to be in his place this minute this minute yes perhaps you would because he has as you say a handsome uniform and a fine horse but all his minutes may not be like this minute faith william that is almost as soberly said as my old uncle himself could have spoken see what it is to live shut up with old folks you catch all their ways and grow old and wise before your time the danger of growing wise before my time does not alarm me much but perhaps cousin you feel that danger more than i do not i said charles stretching himself still farther out of the window to watch the dragoons as they were forming on the parade in the marketplace i can only say as i said before that i wish i had been put into the army instead of into this cursed cotton manufactory now the army is a genteel profession and i own i have spirit enough to make it my first object to look and live like a gentleman and i have spirit enough replied william to make it my first object to look and live like an independent man and i think a manufacturer whom you despise so much may be perfectly independent i am sure for my part i am heartily obliged to my uncle for breeding me up to business for now i am at no mans orders no one can say to me go to the east or go to the west march here or march there fire upon this man or run your bayonet into that i do not think the honour and pleasure of wearing a red coat or of having what is called a genteel profession would make me amends for all that a soldier must suffer if he does his duty unless it were for the defence of my country for which i hope and believe i should fight as well as another i cannot say that i should like to be hurried away from my wife and children to fight a battle against people with whom i have no quarrel and in a cause which perhaps i might not approve of well as you say william you that have a wife and children are quite in a different situation from me you cannot leave them of course thank my stars i am still at liberty and i shall take care and keep myself so my plan is to live for myself and to have as much pleasure as i possibly can whether this plan of living for himself was compatible with the hopes of having as much pleasure as possible we leave it to the heads and hearts of our readers to decide in the mean time we must proceed with his history soon after this conversation had passed between the two partners another opportunity occurred of showing their characters still more distinctly a party of ladies and gentlemen travellers came to the town and wished to see the manufactories there they had letters of recommendation to the mr darfords and william with great goodnature took them to see their works he pointed out to them with honest pride the healthy countenances of the children whom they employed you see said he that we cannot be reproached with sacrificing the health and happiness of our fellowcreatures to our own selfish and mercenary views my good uncle took all the means in his power to make every person concerned in this manufactory as happy as possible and i hope we shall follow his example i am sure the riches of both the indies could not satisfy me if my conscience reproached me with having gained wealth by unjustifiable means if these children were overworked or if they had not fresh air and wholesome food it would be the greatest misery to me to come into this room and look at them i could not do it but on the contrary knowing as i do that they are well treated and well provided for in every respect i feel joy and pride in coming amongst them and in bringing my friends here williams eyes sparkled as he thus spoke the generous sentiments of his heart but charles who had thought himself obliged to attend the ladies of the party to see the manufactory evidently showed he was ashamed of being considered as a partner william with perfect simplicity went on to explain every part of the machinery and the whole process of the manufacture whilst his cousin charles who thought he should that way show his superior liberality and politeness every now and then interposed with cousin im afraid we are keeping the ladies too long standing cousin this noise must certainly annoy the ladies horridly cousin all this sort of thing cannot be very interesting i apprehend to the ladies besides they wont have time at this rate to see the chinaworks which is a style of thing more to their taste i presume the fidgeting impatience of our hero was extreme till at last he gained his point and hurried the ladies away to the chinaworks amongst these ladies there was one who claimed particular attention miss maude germaine an elderly young lady who being descended from a high family thought herself entitled to be proud she was yet more vain than proud and found her vanity in some degree gratified by the officious attention of her new acquaintance though she affected to ridicule him to her companions when she could do so unobserved she asked them in a whisper how they liked her new cicerone and whether he did not show the lions very prettily considering who and what he was it has been well observed that people are never ridiculous by what they are but by what they pretend to be footnote rochefoucault these ladies with the best dispositions imaginable for sarcasm could find nothing to laugh at in mr william darfords plain unassuming manners as he did not pretend to be a fine gentleman there was no absurd contrast between his circumstances and his conversation while almost every word look or motion of his cousin was an object of ridicule because it was affected his being utterly unconscious of his foibles and perfectly secure in the belief of his own gentility increased the amusement of the company miss maude germaine undertook to play him off but she took sufficient care to prevent his suspecting her design as they were examining the beautiful china she continually appealed to mr charles darford as a man of taste and he with awkward gallantry and still more awkward modesty always began his answers by protesting he was sure miss maude germaine was infinitely better qualified to decide in such matters than he was he had not the smallest pretensions to taste but that in his humble opinion the articles she pitched upon were evidently the most superior in elegance and certainly of the newest fashion fashion you know ladies is all in all in these things as in every thing else miss germaine with a degree of address which afforded much amusement to herself and her companions led him to extol or reprobate whatever she pleased and she made him pronounce an absurd eulogium on the ugliest thing in the room by observing it was vastly like what her friend lady mary crawley had just bought for her chimneypiece not content with showing she could make our man of taste decide as she thought proper she was determined to prove that she could make him reverse his own decisions and contradict himself as often as she pleased they were at this instant standing opposite to two vases of beautiful workmanship now whispered she to one of her companions i will lay you any wager i first make him say that both those vases are frightful then that they are charming afterward that he does not know which he likes best next that no person of any taste can hesitate betwixt them and at last when he has pronounced his decided humble opinion he shall reverse his judgment and protest he meant to say quite the contrary all this the lady accomplished much to her satisfaction and to that of her friends and so blind and deaf is selflove our hero neither heard nor saw that he was the object of derision william however was rather more clearsighted and as he could not bear to see his cousin make himself the butt of the company he interrupted the conversation by begging the ladies would come into another room to look at the manner in which the china was painted charles with a contemptuous smile observed that the ladies would probably find the odour of the paint rather too much for their nerves full of the sense of his own superior politeness he followed since it was determined that they must go as he said nolens volens he did not hear miss germaine whisper to her companions as they passed can any thing in nature be much more ridiculous than a vulgar manufacturer who sets up for a fine gentleman amongst the persons who were occupied in painting a set of china with flowers there was one who attracted particular attention by the ease and quickness with which she worked an iris of her painting was produced which won the admiration of all the spectators and whilst charles was falling into ecstasies about the merit of the painting and the perfection to which the arts are now carried in england william was observing the flushed and unhealthy countenance of the young artist he stopped to advise her not to overwork herself to beg she would not sit in a draught of wind where she was placed and to ask her with much humanity several questions concerning her health and her circumstances whilst he was speaking to her he did not perceive that he had set his foot by accident on miss germaines gown and as she walked hastily on it was torn in a deplorable manner charles apologized for his cousins extreme absence of mind and rudeness and with a candid condescension added ladies you must not think ill of my cousin william because he is not quite so much your humble servant as i am notwithstanding his little rusticities want of polish gallantry and so forth things that are not in every mans power i can assure you there is not a better man in the world except that he is so entirely given up to business which indeed ruins a man for every thing else the apologist little imagined he was at this moment infinitely more awkward and illbred than the person whom he affected to pity and to honour with his protection our hero continued to be upon the best terms possible with himself and with miss maude germaine during the remainder of this day he discovered that this lady intended to pass a fortnight with a relation of hers in the town of he waited upon her the next day to give her an account of the manner in which he had executed some commissions about the choice of china with which she had honoured him one visit led to another and charles darford was delighted to find himself admitted into the society of such very genteel persons at first he was merely proud of being acquainted with a lady of miss maude germaines importance and contented himself with boasting of it to all his acquaintance by degrees he became more audacious he began to fancy himself in love with her and to flatter himself she would not prove inexorable the raillery of some of his companions piqued him to make good his boast and he determined to pay his addresses to a lady who they all agreed could never think of a man in business our hero was not entirely deluded by his vanity the ladys coquetry contributed to encourage his hopes though she always spoke of him to her friends as a person whom it was impossible she could ever think of for a moment yet as soon as he made a declaration of his love to her she began to consider that a manufacturer might have common sense and even some judgment and taste her horror of people in business continued in full force but she began to allow there was no general rule that did not admit of an exception when her female friends laughed following the example she had set them at charles darford her laughter became fainter than theirs and she was one evening heard to ask a stranger who saw him for the first time whether that young gentleman looked as if he was in business sundry matters began to operate in our heros favour precedents opportunely produced by her waitingmaid of ladies of the first families in england ladies even of the first fashion who had married into mercantile houses a present too from her admirer of the beautiful china vase of which she had so often made him change his opinion had its due effect but the preponderating motive was the dread of dying an old maid if she did not accept of this offer after various airs and graces and doubts and disdains this fair lady consented to make her lover happy on the express condition that he should change his name from darford to germaine that he should give up all share in the odious cotton manufactory and that he should purchase the estate of germainepark in northamptonshire to part with which as it luckily happened some of her great relations were compelled in the folly of his joy at the prospect of an alliance with the great germaine family he promised every thing that was required of him notwithstanding the remonstrances of his friend william who represented to him in the forcible language of common sense the inconveniences of marrying into a family that would despise him and of uniting himself to such an old coquette as miss germaine who would make him not only a disagreeable but a most extravagant wife do you not see said he that she has not the least affection for you she marries you only because she despairs of getting any other match and because you are rich and she is poor she is seven years older than you by her own confession and consequently will be an old woman whilst you are a young man she is as you seei mean as i seevain and proud in the extreme and if she honours you with her hand she will think you can never do enough to make her amends for having married beneath her pretensions instead of finding in her as i find in my wife the best and most affectionate of friends you will find her your torment through life and consider this is a torment likely to last these thirty or forty years is it not worth while to pauseto reflect for as many minutes or even days charles paused double the number of seconds perhaps and then replied you have married to please yourself cousin william and i shall marry to please myself as i dont mean to spend my days in the same style in which you do the same sort of wife that makes you happy could never content me i mean to make some figure in the world i know no other use of fortune and an alliance with the germaines brings me at once into fashionable society miss maude germaine is very proud i confess but she has some reason to be proud of her family and then you see her love for me conquers her pride great as it is william sighed when he saw the extent of his cousins folly the partnership between the two darfords was dissolved it cost our hero much money but no great trouble to get his name changed from darford to germaine and it was certainly very disadvantageous to his pecuniary interest to purchase germainepark which was sold to him for at least three years purchase more than its value but in the height of his impatience to get into the fashionable world all prudential motives appeared beneath his consideration it was as he fancied part of the character of a man of spirit the character he was now to assume and support for life to treat pecuniary matters as below his notice he bought germainepark married miss germaine and determined no mortal should ever find out by his equipages or style of life that he had not been born the possessor of this estate in this laudable resolution it cannot possibly be doubted but that his bride encouraged him to the utmost of her power she was eager to leave the county where his former friends and acquaintance resided for they were people with whom of course it could not be expected that she should keep up any manner of intercourse charles in whose mind vanity at this moment smothered every better feeling was in reality glad of a pretext for breaking off all connexion with those whom he had formerly loved he went to take leave of william in a fine chariot on which the germaine arms were ostentatiously blazoned that real dignity which arises from a sense of independence of mind appeared in williams manners and quite overawed and abashed our hero in the midst of all his finery and airs i hope cousin william said charles when you can spare time though to be sure that is a thing hardly to be expected as you are situated but in case you should be able any ways to make it convenient i hope you will come and take a look at what we are doing at germainepark there was much awkward embarrassment in the enunciation of this feeble invitation for charles was conscious he did not desire it should be accepted and that it was made in direct opposition to the wishes of his bride he was at once relieved from his perplexity and at the same time mortified by the calm simplicity with which william replied i thank you cousin for this invitation but you know i should be an encumbrance to you at germainepark and i make it a rule neither to go into any company that would be ashamed of me or of which i should be ashamed ashamed of you butwhat an idea my dear william surely you dont thinkyou cant imaginei should ever consider you as any sort of encumbrancei protest save yourself the trouble of protesting my dear charles cried william smiling with much goodnature i know why you are so much embarrassed at this instant and i do not attribute this to any want of affection for me we are going to lead quite different lives i wish you all manner of satisfaction perhaps the time may come when i shall be able to contribute to your happiness more than i can at present charles uttered some unmeaning phrases and hurried to his carriage at the sight of its varnished panels he recovered his selfcomplacency and courage and began to talk fluently about chariots and horses whilst the children of the family followed to take leave of him saying are you going quite away charles will you never come back to play with us as you used to do charles stepped into his carriage with as much dignity as he could assume which indeed was very little william who judged of his friends always with the most benevolent indulgence excused the want of feeling which charles betrayed during this visit my dear said he to his wife who expressed some indignation at the slight shown to their children we must forgive him for you know a man cannot well think of more than one thing at a time and the one thing that he is thinking of is his fine chariot the day will come when he will think more of fine children at least i hope so for his own sake and now behold our hero in all his glory shining upon the northamptonshire world in the splendour of his new situation the dress the equipage the entertainments and above all the airs of the bride and bridegroom were the general subject of conversation in the county for ten days our hero not precisely knowing what degree of importance mr germaine of germainepark was entitled to assume outgermained germaine the country gentlemen first stared then laughed and at last unanimously agreed over their bottle that this new neighbour of theirs was an upstart who ought to be kept down and that a vulgar manufacturer should not be allowed to give himself airs merely because he had married a proud lady of good family it was obvious they said he was not born for the situation in which he now appeared they remarked and ridiculed the ostentation with which he displayed every luxury in his house his habit of naming the price of every thing to enforce its claim to admiration his affected contempt for economy his anxiety to connect himself with persons of rank joined to his ignorance of the genealogy of nobility and the strange mistakes he made between old and new titles certain little defects in his manners and some habitual vulgarisms in his conversation exposed him also to the derision of his wellbred neighbours mr germaine saw that the gentlemen of the county were leagued against him but he had neither temper nor knowledge of the world sufficient to wage this unequal war the meanness with which he alternately attempted to court and to bully his adversaries shewed them at once the full extent of their power and of his weakness things were in this position when our hero unluckily affronted mr cole one of the proudest gentlemen in the county by mistaking him for a merchant of the same name and under this mistake neglecting to return his visit a few days afterwards at a public dinner mr cole and mr germaine had some high words which were repeated by the persons present in various manners and this dispute became the subject of conversation in the county particularly amongst the ladies each related according to her fancy what her husband had told her and as these husbands had drunk a good deal they had not a perfectly clear recollection of what had passed so that the whole and every part of the conversation was exaggerated the fair judges averse as they avowed their feelings were to duelling were clearly of opinion among themselves that a real gentleman would certainly have called mr cole to account for the words he uttered though none of them could agree what those words were mrs germaines female friends in their coteries were the first to deplore with becoming sensibility that she should be married to a man who had so little the spirit as well as the manners of a man of birth their pity became progressively vehement the more they thought of or at least the more they talked of the business till at last one old lady the declared and intimate friend of mrs germaine unintentionally and in the heat of tattle made use of one phrase that led to another and another till she betrayed in conversation with that lady the gossiping scandal of these female circles mrs germaine piqued as her pride was and though she had little affection for her husband would have shuddered with horror to have imagined him in the act of fighting a duel and especially at her instigation yet of this very act she became the cause in their domestic quarrels her tongue was ungovernable and at such moments the malice of husbands and wives often appears to exceed the hatred of the worst of foes and in the ebullition of her vengeance when his reproaches had stung her beyond the power of her temper to support unable to stop her tongue she vehemently told him he was a coward who durst not so talk to a man he had proved himself a coward and was become the byword and contempt of the whole county even women despised his cowardice however astonishing it may appear to those who are unacquainted with the nature of quarrels between man and wife it is but too certain that such quarrels have frequently led to the most fatal consequences the agitation of mind which mrs germaine suffered the moment she could recollect what she had so rashly said her vain endeavours to prove to herself that so provoked she could not say less and the sudden effect which she plainly saw her words had produced upon her husband were but a part of the punishment that always follows conduct and contentions so odious mr germaine gazed at her a few moments with wildness in his eyes his countenance expressed the stupefaction of rage he spoke not a word but started at length and snatched up his hat she was struck with panic terror gave a scream sprang after him caught him by the coat and with the most violent protestations denied the truth of all she had said the look he gave her cannot be described he rudely plucked the skirt from her grasp and rushed out of the house all day and all night she neither saw nor heard of him in the morning he was brought home accompanied by a surgeon in the carriage of a gentleman who had been his second dangerously wounded he was six weeks confined to his bed and in the first moment of doubt expressed by the surgeon for his life she expressed contrition which was really sincere but as he recovered former bickerings were renewed and the terms on which they lived gradually became what they had been neither did his duel regain that absurd reputation for which he fought it was malignantly said he had neither the courage to face a man nor the understanding to govern a wife still however mrs germaine consoled herself with the belief that the most shocking circumstance of his having been partner in a manufactory was a profound secret alas the fatal moment arrived when she was to be undeceived in this her last hope soon after mr germaine recovered from his wounds she gave a splendid bail to which the neighbouring nobility and gentry were invited she made it a point with all her acquaintance to come on this grand night the more importance the germaines set upon success and the more anxiety they betrayed the more their enemies enjoyed the prospect of their mortification all the young belles who had detested miss maude germaine for the airs she used to give herself at county assemblies now leagued to prevent their admirers from accepting her invitation all the married ladies whom she had outshone in dress and equipage protested they were not equal to keep up an acquaintance with such prodigiously fine people and that for their part they must make a rule not to accept of such expensive entertainments as it was not in their power to return them some persons of consequence in the county kept their determination in doubt suffered themselves to be besieged daily with notes and messages and hopes that their imaginary coughs headaches and influenzas were better and that they would find themselves able to venture out on the th when the coughs headaches and influenzas could hold out no longer these ingenious tormentors devised new pretexts for supposing it would be impossible to do themselves the honour of accepting mr and mrs germaines obliging invitation on the th some had recourse to the roads and others to the moon mrs germaine whose pride was now compelled to make all manner of concessions changed her night from the th to the th to insure a full moon to those timorous damsels whom she had known to go home nine miles from a ball the darkest night imaginable without scruple or complaint mr germaine at his own expense mended some spots in the roads which were obstacles to the delicacy of other travellers and when all this was accomplished the haughty leaders of the county fashions condescended to promise they would do themselves the pleasure to wait upon mr and mrs germaine on the th their cards of acceptation were shown with triumph by the germaines but it was a triumph of short duration with all the refinement of cruelty they gave hopes which they never meant to fulfil on the morning noon and night of the th notes poured in with apologies or rather with excuses for not keeping their engagements scarcely one was burnt before another arrived mrs germaine could not command her temper and she did not spare her husband in this trying moment the arrival of some company for the ball interrupted a warm dispute between the happy pair the ball was very thinly attended the guests looked as if they were more inclined to yawn than to dance the supper table was not half filled and the profusion with which it was laid out was forlorn and melancholy every thing was on too grand a scale for the occasion wreaths of flowers and pyramids and triumphal arches sufficient for ten times as many guests even the most inconsiderate could not help comparing the trouble and expense incurred by the entertainment with the small quantity of pleasure it produced most of the guests rose from table whispering to one another as they looked at the scarcelytasted dishes what a waste what a pity poor mrs germaine what a melancholy sight this must be to her the next day a mock heroic epistle in verse in the character of mrs germaine to one of her noble relations giving an account of her ball and disappointment was handed about and innumerable copies were taken it was written with some humour and great illnature the good old lady who occasioned the duel thought it but friendly to show mrs germaine a copy of it and to beg she would keep it out of her husbands way it might be the cause of another duel mrs germaine in spite of all her endeavours to conceal her vexation was obviously so much hurt by this mock heroic epistle that the laughers were encouraged to proceed and the next week a ballad entitled the manufacturer turned gentleman was circulated with the same injunctions to secresy and the same success mr and mrs germaine perceiving themselves to be the objects of continual enmity and derision determined to leave the county germainepark was forsaken a house in london was bought and for a season or two our hero was amused with the gaieties of the town and gratified by finding himself actually moving in that sphere of life to which he had always aspired but he soon perceived that the persons whom at a distance he had regarded as objects of admiration and envy upon a nearer view were capable of exciting only contempt or pity even in the company of honourable and right honourable men he was frequently overpowered with ennui and amongst all the fine acquaintances with which his fine wife crowded his fine house he looked in vain for a friend he looked in vain for a william darford one evening at ranelagh charles happened to hear the name of mr william darford pronounced by a lady who was walking behind him he turned eagerly to look at her but though he had a confused recollection of having seen her face before he could not remember when or where he had met with her he felt a wish to speak to her that he might hear something of those friends whom he had neglected but not forgotten he was not however acquainted with any of the persons with whom she was walking and was obliged to give up his purpose when she left the room he followed her in hopes of learning from her servants who she was but she had no servantsno carriage mrs germaine who clearly inferred she was a person of no consequence besought her husband not to make any further inquiries i beg mr germaine you will not gratify your curiosity about the darfords at my expense i shall have a whole tribe of vulgar people upon my hands if you do not take care the darfords you know are quite out of our line of life especially in town this remonstrance had a momentary effect upon mr germaines vanity but a few days afterwards he met the same lady in the park attended by mr william darfords old servant regardless of his ladys representations he followed the suggestions of his own heart and eagerly stopped the man to inquire after his friends in the most affectionate manner the servant who was pleased to see that charles was not grown quite so much a fine gentleman as to forget all his friends in the country became very communicative he told mr germaine that the lady whom he was attending was a miss locke governess to mr william darfords children and that she was now come to town to spend a few days with a relation who had been very anxious to see her this relation was not either rich or genteel and though our hero used every persuasion to prevail upon his lady to show miss locke some civility whilst she was in town he could not succeed mrs germaine repeated her former phrase again and again the darfords are quite out of our line of life and this was the only reason she would give charles was disgusted by the obstinacy of his wifes pride and indulged his better feelings by going frequently to visit miss locke she stayed however but a fortnight in town and the idea of his friends which had been strongly recalled by his conversations with her gradually faded away he continued the course of life into which he had been forced rather from inability to stop than from inclination to proceed their winters were spent in dissipation in town their summers wasted at wateringplaces or in visits to fine relations who were tired of their company and who took but little pains to conceal this sentiment those who do not live happily at home can seldom contrive to live respectably abroad mr and mrs germaine could not purchase esteem and never earned it from the world or from one another their mutual contempt increased every day only those who have lived with bosom friends whom they despise can fully comprehend the extent and intensity of the evil we spare our readers the painful detail of domestic grievances and the petty mortifications of vanity from the specimens we have already given they may form some idea but certainly not a competent one of the manner in which this illmatched pair continued to live together for twelve long years twelve long years the imagination cannot distinctly represent such a period of domestic suffering though to the fancy of lovers the eternal felicity to be ensured by their union is an idea perfectly familiar and intelligible perhaps if we could bring our minds to dwell more upon the hours and less upon the years of existence we should make fewer erroneous judgments our hero and heroine would never have chained themselves together for life if they could have formed an adequate picture of the hours contained in the everlasting period of twelve years of wrangling during this time scarcely an hour certainly not a day passed in which they did not directly or indirectly reproach one another and tacitly form or explicitly express the wish that they had never been joined in holy wedlock they however had a family children are either the surest bonds of union between parents or the most dangerous causes of discord if parents agree in opinion as to the management of their children they must be a continually increasing source of pleasure but where the father counteracts the mother and the mother the fatherwhere the children cannot obey or caress either of their parents without displeasing the other what can they become but wretched little hypocrites or detestable little tyrants mr and mrs germaine had two children a boy and a girl from the moment of their birth they became subjects of altercation and jealousy the nurses were obliged to decide whether the infants were most like the father or the mother two nurses lost their places by giving what was in mr germaines opinion an erroneous decision upon this important question every stranger who came to pay a visit was obliged to submit to a course of interrogations on this subject and afterwards to their utter confusion saw biting of lips and tossing of heads either on the paternal or maternal side at last it was established that miss maude was the most like her mamma and master charles the most like his papa miss maude of course became the faultless darling of her mother and master charles the mutinous favourite of his father a comparison between their features gestures and manners was daily instituted and always ended in words of scorn from one party or the other even whilst they were pampering these children with sweetmeats or inflaming them with wine the parents had always the same mean and selfish views the mother before she would let her maude taste the sweetmeats insisted upon the childs lisping out that she loved mamma best and before the little charles was permitted to carry the bumper of wine to his lips he was compelled to say he loved papa best in all their childish quarrels maude ran roaring to her mamma and charles sneaked up to his papa as the interests of the children were so deeply concerned in the question it was quickly discovered who ruled in the house with the strongest hand mr germaines influence over his son diminished as soon as the boy was clearly convinced that his sister by adhering to her mamma enjoyed a larger share of the good things he was wearied out by the incessant rebuffs of the nurserymaids who were all in their ladys interests and he endeavoured to find grace in their sight by recanting all the declarations he had made in his fathers favour i dont like papa best now i love mamma best today yes master but you must love mamma best every day or it wont do i promise you by such a course of nursery precepts these unfortunate children were taught equivocation falsehood envy jealousy and every fault of temper which could render them insupportable to themselves and odious to others those who have lived in the house with spoiled children must have a lively recollection of the degree of torment they can inflict upon all who are within sight or hearing these domestic plagues became more and more obnoxious and mrs germaine in the bitterness of her heart was heard to protest she wished she had never had a child children were pretty things at three years old but began to be great plagues at six and were quite intolerable at ten schools and tutors and governesses were tried without number but those capricious changes served only to render the pupils still more unmanageable at length mr and mrs germaines children became so notoriously troublesome that every body dreaded the sight of them one summer when mrs germaine was just setting out on a visit to my lady mary crawley when the carriage was actually at the door and the trunks tied on an express arrived from her ladyship with a letter stipulating that neither miss maude nor master charles should be of the party lady mary declared she had suffered so much from their noise quarrelling and refractory tempers when they were with her the preceding summer that she could not undergo such a trial again that their mothers nerves might support such things but that hers really could not besides she could not in justice and politeness to the other friends who were to be in her house suffer them to be exposed to such torments lady mary crawlev did not give herself any trouble to soften her expressions because she would have been really glad if they had given offence and if mrs germaine had resented her conduct by declining to pay that annual visit which was now become in the worst sense of the word visitation to what meanness proud people are often forced to submit rather than break her resolution never to spend another summer at her own country seat mrs germaine submitted to all the haughtiness of her leicestershire relations and continued absolutely to force upon them visits which she knew to be unwelcome but what was to be done about her children the first thing of course was to reproach her husband you see mr germaine the effect of the pretty education you have given that boy of yours i am sure if he had not gone with us last summer into leicestershire my maude would not have been in the least troublesome to lady mary on the contrary my dear i have heard lady mary herself say twenty times that charles was the best of the two and i am persuaded if maude had been away the boy would have become quite a favourite there you are utterly mistaken i can assure you my dear for you know you are no great favourite of lady marys yourself and i have often heard her say that charles is your image it is very extraordinary that all your great relations show us so little civility my dear they do not seem to have much regard for you they have regard enough for me and showed it formerly but of late to be sure i confess things are altered they never have been so cordial since my marriage and all things considered i scarcely know how to blame them mr germaine bowed by way of thanking his lady for this compliment she besought him not to bow so like a man behind a counter if he could possibly help it he replied it became him to submit to be schooled by a wife who was often taken for his mother at length when every species of reproach mental and personal which conjugal antipathy could suggest had been exhausted the orators recurred to the business of the day and to the question what is to be done with the children whilst we are at lady mary crawleys chapter ii in this embarrassment we must leave the germaines for the present and refresh ourselves with a look at a happy circlethe family of mr darford where there is no discordance of opinions of tastes or of tempers none of those evils which arise sometimes from the disappointment and sometimes from the gratification of vanity and pride mr darford succeeded beyond his most sanguine expectations in the management of his business wealth poured in upon him but he considered wealth like a true philosopher only as one of the means of happiness he did not become prodigal or avaricious neither did he ever feel the slightest ambition to quit his own station in society he never attempted to purchase from people of superior rank admission into their circles by giving luxurious and ostentatious entertainments he possessed a sturdy sense of his own value and commanded a species of respect very different from that which is paid to the laced livery or the varnished equipage the firmness of his character was however free from all severity he knew how to pardon in others the weakness and follies from which he was himself exempt though his cousin was of such a different character and though since his marriage mr germaine had neglected his old friends william felt more compassion for his unhappiness than resentment for his faults in the midst of his own family william would often say i wish poor charles may ever be as happy as we are frequently in his letters to london correspondents he desired them to inquire privately how mr germaine went on for some time he heard of nothing but his extravagance and of the entertainments given to the fine world by mrs germaine but in the course of a few years his correspondents hinted that mr germaine began to be distressed for money and that this was a secret which had been scrupulously kept from his lady as scrupulously as she concealed from him her losses at play mr darford also learned from a correspondent who was intimately acquainted with one of mrs germaines friends that this lady lived upon very bad terms with her husband and that her children were terribly spoiled by the wretched education they received these accounts gave william sincere concern far from triumphing in the accomplishing of his prophecies he never once recalled them to the memory even of his own family all his thoughts were intent upon saving his friend from future pain one day as he was sitting with his family round their cheerful teatable his youngest boy who had climbed upon his knees exclaimed papa what makes you so very grave tonight you are not at all like yourself what can make you sorry my dear little boy said his father i was thinking of a letter i received today from london i wish those letters would never come for they always make you look sad and make you sigh mamma why do you not desire the servants not to bring papa any more such letters what did this letter say to you papa to make you so grave my dear said his father smiling at the childs simplicity this letter told me that your little cousin charles is not quite so good a boy as you are then papa i will tell you what to do send our miss locke to cousin charles and she will soon make him very good i dare say she would replied the father laughing but my dear boy i cannot send miss locke and i am afraid she would not like to go besides we should be rather sorry to part with her then papa suppose you were to send for my cousin and miss locke could take care of him here without leaving us could take care of himtrue but would she if you can prevail upon her to do so i will send for your cousin the proposal though playfully made was seriously accepted by miss locke and the more willingly as she remembered with gratitude the attention mr germaine had paid to her some years before when with poor relations in london mr darford wrote immediately to invite his cousins children to his house and the invitation was most gladly accepted for it was received the very day when mr and mrs germaine were so much embarrassed by lady mary crawleys absolute refusal to admit these children into her house mrs germaine was not too proud to accept of favours from those whom she had treated as beneath her acquaintance quite out of her line of life she despatched her children directly to mr darfords and miss locke undertook the care of them it was not an easy or agreeable task but she had great obligations to mrs darford and was rejoiced at finding an opportunity of showing her gratitude miss locke was the young woman whose painting of an iris had been admired by charles and by miss maude germaine when they visited the china works thirteen or fourteen years before this time she was at that period very ill and in great distress her father had been a bankrupt and to earn bread for herself and her sisters she was obliged to work harder than her health and strength allowed probably she would have fallen a sacrifice to her exertions if she had not been saved by the humanity of mr darford and fortunately for him he was married to a woman who sympathized in all his generous feelings and who assisted him in every benevolent action mrs darford after making sufficient inquiries as to the truth of the story and the character of the girl was so much pleased with all she heard of her merit and so much touched by her misfortunes that she took miss locke into her family to teach her daughters to draw she well knew that a sense of dependence is one of the greatest evils and she was careful to relieve the person whom she obliged from this painful feeling by giving her an opportunity of being daily useful to her benefactress miss locke soon recovered her health she perceived she might be serviceable in teaching the children of the family many things besides drawing and with unremitting perseverance she informed her own mind that she might be able to instruct her pupils year after year she pursued this plan and was rewarded by the esteem and affection of the happy family in which she lived but though miss locke was a woman of great abilities she had not the magical powers attributed to some characters in romance she could not instantaneously produce a total reformation of manners the habits of spoiled children are not to be changed by the most skilful preceptress without the aid of time miss maude germaine and her brother had tempers which tried miss lockes patience to the utmost but gradually she acquired some influence over these wayward spirits she endeavoured with her utmost skill to eradicate the jealousy which had been implanted in the minds of the brother and sister they found that they were now treated with strict impartiality and they began to live together more peaceably time was willingly allowed to miss locke by their parents who were glad to be disencumbered of their children eighteen months passed away and no news were heard of mr and mrs germaine except that they continued the same extravagant dissipated course of life and that they began to be much embarrassed in their circumstances at last mr darford received a letter which informed him that an execution was laid on mr germaines fine house in town and that he and his family were all in the greatest distress and affliction william hastened immediately to london he was denied admittance at mr germaines the porter with an air of mystery said that his master was ill and did not choose to see any body william however forced his way up stairs charles at the sight of him stepped back exclaiming may i believe my eyes william is it you yes it is william your old friend william said mr darford embracing him affectionately pride and shame struggled in the mind of charles and turning aside to repress the tears which in the first instance of emotion had started into his eyes he went to the farthest end of the room for an armchair for his cousin placed it with awkward ceremony and said wont you be seated cousin darford i am sure mrs germaine and i are much indebted to you and mrs darford for your goodness to our children i was just thinking of writing to you about thembut we are in sad confusion here just at this moment i am quite ashamedi did not expectwhy did you never honour us with a visit before i am sure you could not possibly have hit upon a more unlucky moment for a visitfor yourself i mean if it proves lucky to you my dear charles replied william mildly i shall think it the most fortunate moment i could possibly have chosen vanquished by the tone of this reply our hero burst into tears he squeezed his friends hand but could not speak recovering himself after a few minutes he said you are too good cousin william and always were i thought you called in by accident i had no supposition that you came on purpose to assist me in this moment of distressembarrassment i ought to say for in fact it is only a mere temporary embarrassment i am heartily glad to hear it but speak to me freely charles do not conceal the real state of your affairs from your best friend what tendency could this have but to plunge you into irretrievable ruin charles paused for a minute the truth of the matter is my dear william continued he that there are circumstances in this business which i should be sorry reached mrs germaines ear or any of her cursed proud relations for if once they heard of it i should have no peace for the rest of my life indeed as to peace i cannot boast of much as it is but it might be worse much worse if the whole truth came out to you however i can trust it though in your line of life it would be counted a shocking thing but still you are so indulgent william listened without being able to guess where this preamble would end in the first place continued charles you knowmrs germaine is almost ten years older than i am six years i thought you formerly told me i beg your pardon tentenwithin a few months if i said six it was before our marriage when i knew no better she owns to seven her own relations say eight her nurse said nine and i say ten well ten let it be since you will have it so i should be very glad to have it otherwise i promise you if i could for it is not very pleasant to a man like me to be quizzed by half the young men of fashion in town for having married a woman old enough to be my mother not quite old enough to be your mother said his cousin in a conciliatory tone these young men of fashion are not the best calculators mrs germaine could not well have been your mother since at the worst by your own account there is only ten years difference between you oh but that is not all for what is still worse mrs germaine thanks to the raking hours she keeps and gaming and fretting looks full ten years older than she is so that you see in fact there are twenty years between us i do not see it indeed replied william smiling but i am bound to believe what you assert let me ask you to what does this discussion concerning poor mrs germaines age tend to justify or at least to excuse poor mr germaine for keeping a mistress who is something younger something prettier and above all something more goodhumoured than his wife perhaps the wife would be as goodhumoured as the mistress if she were as happy in possessing her husbands affections affections oh lord affections are out of the question mrs germaine does not care a straw about my affections and yet you dread that she should have the least hint of your having a mistress of course you dont see my jet you dont consider what a devil of a handle that would give her against me she has no more love for me than this table but she is jealous beyond all credibility and she knows right well how to turn her jealousy to account she would go caballing amongst her tribes of relations and get all the women and all the world on her side with this hue and cry of a mistress and then i should be branded as the worst husband upon earth that indeed i should laugh at because all the young men in town would keep me in countenance but mrs germaine would rummage out the history of the sums of money i have given this girl and then would set those against her playdebts and i should have no more hold over her for you know if i should begin to reproach her with the one she would recriminate she is a devil of a hand at that work neither you nor any man on earth except myself can form any idea of the temper of mrs germaine she isto you my dear friend i may have the relief of saying soshe is without exception the most proud peevish selfish unreasonable extravagant tyrannical unfeeling woman in christendom in christendom oh you exaggerate charles exaggerate upon my soul i do not she is all i have said and more more impossible come i see how it is she has been unlucky at the cardtable you are angry and therefore you speak as angry people always do footnote swift worse than you think no not at all i promise you i am as perfectly cool as you are you do not know mrs germaine as well as i do but i know that she is much to be pitied if her husband has a worse opinion of her than any body else expresses that is precisely because i am her husband and know her better than other people do will not you give me leave to be the best judge in what relates to my own wife i never indeed expected to hear you of all people upon earth cousin william undertake her defence i think i remember that she was no great favourite of yours before i married and you dissuaded me as much as possible from the match yet now you are quite become her advocate and take her part to my face against me it is not taking her part against you my dear charles replied his cousin to endeavour to make you better satisfied with your wife i am not so obstinate in selfopinion as to wish at the expense of your domestic happiness to prove that i was right in dissuading you from the match on the contrary i would do all in my power to make the best of it and so should you ah cousin william it is easy for you to talk of making the best of a bad match you who are married to one of the best tempered women alive i wish you were to live with mrs germaine for one month william smiled as much as to say i cannot join in that wish besides continued charles if i were to open my whole heart to you you would pity me on another account my wife is not my only plague my mistress is almost as great a torment as my wife what this mistress of whom you are so fond ay there is the curse i cannot help being fond of her and that she knows and plays me off as she pleases but i believe the little jilt loves me all the time because she has offers enough and from men of the first fashion if she would leave me she is certainly a good girl but then so passionate i thought you told me she was goodhumoured interrupted his cousin well so she is at times the best humoured creature in nature and then she is charming but when she falls into a passion she is a little fury absolutely a little devil there is nothing she would not do now do you know all this terrible business this execution against me is her doing a singular proof of love said mr william darford oh the fool loves me notwithstanding i must do her that justice but she is quite a child i put her into a passion by going down to leicestershire when she wanted me to stay with her in town she told me she would be revenged but i could not believe she would go such lengths she gave a note of mine for two hundred guineas to her uncle and he got a writ now she is in despair about it i saw her two hours ago all in tears and tearing her hair because her uncle wont consent to withdraw the execution i am sure she is really and truly sorry and would give her eyes to get me out of this scrape whether she would give her eyes or not i will not pretend to determine but it is plain she would not pay two hundred guineas to get you out of this scrape now where do you intend to get the money ah theres the rub i have not a farthing till our next rents come in and you see these heaps of bills then the agent who manages every thing heaven knows how at germainepark says tenants are breaking that we are i do not know how much in his debt and that we must sell but that if we sell in a hurry and if our distress be talked of we shall get nothing for the land and so shall be ruined outright now this all originates in mrs germaines pride and positiveness she never could be prevailed upon to go down to germainepark these ten years past because some of the northamptonshire people affronted her so our affairs have gone on just as the agent pleases and he is a rascal i am convinced for he is always writing to say we are in his debt but indeed my dear william you are too good to take any interest in this history of my affairs i am conscious that i have not treated you well do not talk of that now do not think of it charles interrupted mr darford i am come to town on purpose to be of all the service to you i can i will discharge this writ upon one and only upon one condition upon any condition you please cried charles i will give you my bond i will give you security upon the germaine estate if you require it i require no security i require no bond charles i require only a condition which i believe to be absolutely necessary for your happiness promise me you will break off all connexion with this treacherous mistress of yours treacherous no no i assure you you mistake the girl mistake her or not charles without arguing the matter farther on this one point i must be peremptory and positively the only condition on which i will pay this money is your promise never to see her again charles hesitated upon my soul cried he i believe the girl will break her heart but then she is so cursedly extravagant she ruins me i would have broken with her long ago if i could have summoned up courage enough after all i believe it was more habit idleness and fashion than any thing else that made me go to see her so often when i did not know what to do with myself or when i was put out of humour at home i went to this girl well let us say no more about it she is not worth thinking of i give her up you may depend upon it my dear william i will have nothing more to do with her i will since you make that your ultimatum never see her again will you write to her then immediately to let her know your determination certainly immediately charles wrote to bid adieu to this mistress to whom by his own account habit idleness fashion and the want of a happy home had attached him and william gave him a draft for the amount of his debt by which the execution was taken off mr darford seized the moment when his cousins mind was warmed with gratitude to say a few words as little in the form of advice as possible in praise of economy you know my dear charles said he that i am and always was a very plain man in my way of living and i dare say my ideas will appear quite absurd to you who are used to live with men of taste and fashion but really these rooms this furniture and this house appear to me fitter for a nobleman than for a man of your fortune it is so mrs germaine would insist upon my taking it but i will part with it before next winter i will advertise it immediately i will begin a course of economy mr germaines projects of economy were at this moment interrupted by the sudden entrance of his wife her eyes flashing with anger she walked with the proud air of an enraged tragedy queen across the room seated herself upon a sofa and in a voice which trembled with illsuppressed rage said i am to thank you mr germaine for the many obliging things you have said of me this last hour i have heard them all you are under a mistake sir if you imagine i have been hitherto your dupe you have never imposed upon me for a moment i have suspected this twelvemonth that you kept a mistress and now i am happy to have the truth confirmed from your own lips but i deserve all that has happened i am justly treated weak woman to marry as i did no gentleman sir would have behaved or would have spoken as you have done could not you have been content with ruining yourself and your family mr germaine by your profligate low tastes without insulting me by base reflections upon my temper and downright falsehoods about my age no gentleman sir would have treated me as you have done i am the most miserable of women passion choked her utterance and she fell back in a violent fit of hysterics mr william darford was much shocked at this matrimonial scene the lady had caught hold of his arm in one of her convulsive motions and she held it so fast that he could not withdraw charles stood in silent dismay his conscience smote him and though he could not love his wife he blamed himself for having rendered her the most miserable of women leave her to me charles said mr darford and i will endeavour to set matters to rights charles shook his head and left the room mrs germaine by degrees recovered herself for a hysteric fit cannot last for ever she cast her eyes round the room and exclaimed he has done well to leave me oh that it were for ever oh that we had never met but may i ask why mr william darford is here my own servantmy own maid should have been summoned to attend me we have servants still sir and humbled as i am i see no necessity for submitting to have cool spectators of our family distresses and family quarrels believe me madam said mr darford i am not a cool spectator of either i do not wish to recal sic disagreeable things but to obtain the right of speaking to you of your affairs as a friend permit me to remind you that when i could not guess you heard me i defended your interests really sir you spoke so low that i did not distinctly hear what you said and my feelings were so much hurt by all i heard from mr germaine who spoke loud enough that i attended to nothing else upon recollection i do however remember you made some offer to get mr germaine out of his present embarrassments upon condition that he would break off all connexion with this girl whom nobody knows or rather whom every body knows too well and was not this offer of mine some proof mrs germaine that i wish your happiness why really mr darford having lived in the world as i have done from my childhood i am not apt to expect much friendship from any one especially from people in the habits of calculation and i have been so much deceived where i have unguardedly trusted to the friendship and love of a man brought up in that sort of way that you must forgive me if i could not bring my mind to think you had any concern for my happiness in the offer you made i did indeed suppose it would be a mortifying circumstance to you to see your cousin quite ruined by this infamous creature i say i did imagine you would be shocked at seeing your cousin sent to jail that you know is a thing discreditable to a whole family let it be of what sort it may from your kindness to our children i see you consider us as relations every human being i do suppose has some family pride in their own way i own i have a great deal of family pride in my own way madam replied mr darford with a calm smile i am proud for instance of having and of being able to maintain in perfect independence a number of good and affectionate children and a wife whose good sense and sweetness of temper constitute the happiness of my existence mrs germaine coloured threw back her head and strove to conceal the anguish of her conscience william was sorry he had inflicted pain but he saw that the only way to make himself understood in this conversation was to assert that real superiority of character to which in certain situations the factitious pretensions of rank or fashion never fail to yield you are at liberty mrs germaine continued william to interpret my offers and my actions as you think proper but you will when you are cool observe that neither i nor any of my family have any thing to gain from you or yours not even a curtsy or a bow in public places for we do not frequent them we live retired and have no connexion with fine people we preserve our own independence by confining ourselves to our own station in life and by never desiring to quit it nor to ape those who are called our betters from what i have just heard you say i think it possible you may have formed the idea that we invited your children to our house with the selfish supposition that the connexion i believe that is the fashionable phrase might be advantageous to our own but this is quite a mistake our children will live as we do they have no idea of forming high connexions because they have been taught not to think them necessary to happiness i assure you it is not my habit to talk so much of myself and of mine but i thought it best to explain the truth to you at once as this was the only way to gain your confidence and as we have neither of us time to spare very true said mrs germaine and now madam i have a proposal to make to you which i hope you will take as it is meant i understand from mr germaine you have some play debts mr germaine does not know their amount said mrs germaine lowering her voice as if she apprehended she might be overheard if you will trust me with that secret i will not make a bad use of it mrs germaine in a whisper named the sum it was certainly considerable for the naming of it made mr darford step back with surprise after a few minutes thought he recovered himself and said this is a larger debt than i was aware of but we will see what can be done from the time that charles and i dissolved our partnership i have never remitted my attention to business and that very circumstance for which you must despise me puts it now in my power to assist you without injuring my own family i am a man who speak my mind freely perhaps bluntly you must solemnly promise me you will never again play at any game of hazard upon this condition i will pay your present debts immediately with all the eagerness of a person who wishes to seize an offer which appears too generous to be repeated mrs germaine promised all that was required her debts were paid and now her benefactor had hopes that she and her husband would live more prudently and that they might still enjoy some portion of domestic happiness vain hopes charles really wished to retrench his expenses but mrs germaines pride was an insuperable obstacle to all his plans of economy she had always been accustomed to such and such things there was no possibility of living without them her relations would be perfectly astonished if she did not appear in the style in which she had always lived before her marriage provoked by the insolent absurdity of such arguments mr germaine insisted with the authoritative voice of a husband who was conscious that he had both reason and power on his side hence arose daily altercations more bitter even than those which jealousy had formerly occasioned some wives acknowledge they can more easily forgive a husbands infidelity than his interference in the regulation of their household expenses of this class of amiable females was mrs germaine though her husband strictly adhered to his promise never to have any farther connexion with his mistress yet he was not rewarded by any increase of affection or kindness from his wife on the contrary she seemed to be rather vexed that she was deprived of this legitimate subject of complaint she could not with so much tragic effect bewail that her husband would ruin himself and her by his follies to loud altercations silent hatred succeeded mrs germaine grew sullen lowspirited nervous and hysterical among fashionable medical dowagers she became an interesting personage but this species of consequence was by no means sufficient to support her selfcomplacency and as she declared she felt herself incapable of supporting the intolerable burden of ennui in various situations the conduct of many individuals may be predicted with certainty by those who are acquainted with their previous habits habit is to weak minds a species of moral predestination from which they have no power to escape their common language expresses their sense of their own inability to struggle against that destiny which their previous folly has prepared they usually say for my part i cannot help doing so and so i know it is very wrong i know it is my ruin but i own i cannot resist it is in vain to argue with me it is my way it is my fate mrs germaine found herself led by an irresistible impulse to the cardtable notwithstanding her solemn promise never more to play at any game of hazard it was in vain to argue with her it was her way it was her fate she knew it was very wrong she knew it was her ruin but she could not resist in the course of a few months she was again involved in debt and she had the meanness and the assurance again to apply to the generosity of mr william darford her letter was written in the most abject strain and was full of all the flattering expressions which she imagined must from a woman of her birth and consequence in the world have a magical effect upon one in mr william darfords station she was surprised when she received a decided refusal he declined all farther interference as he perceived it was impossible that he could be of any real utility he forbore to reproach the lady with her breach of promise she will said he to himself be sufficiently punished by the consequences of her own conduct i would not increase her distress a separation from her husband was the immediate consequence perhaps it may be thought that to mrs germaine this would be no punishment but the loss of all the pride pomp and circumstance of married life was deeply felt she was thrown absolutely upon the charity of relations who had very little charity in any sense of the word she was disregarded by all her fine acquaintance she had no friend upon earth to pity her even her favourite maid gave warning because she was tired of her mistresss temper and of receiving no wages the detail of poor mrs germaines mortifications and sufferings cannot be interesting she was a prey to low spirits or in other words to mortified vanity for some time and at last died of a nervous fever her husband wrote the following letter to mr william darford soon after her death my dear william you have heard of poor mrs germaines death and of the manner of it no more need be said upon that subject whatever were her faults she has suffered for them and so have i for mine believe me i am effectually cured of all desire to be a fine gentleman i shall quit the name of germaine immediately and resume that of darford you know the state of my affairs there is yet hope i may set things to rights by my own industry and i am determined to go into business and to apply to it in good earnest for my own sake and for the sake of my children whom i have hitherto shamefully neglected but i had it not always in my power after my marriage to do as i wished no more of that the blame be upon me for the past for the future i shall i hope be a different man i dare not ask you to trust so far to these good resolutions as to take me into partnership with you in your manufactory but perhaps your goodnature can direct me to some employment suited to my views and capacity i ask only a fair trial i think i shall not do as i used to do and leave all the letters to be written by my partner give my love to my dear little boy and girl how can i thank you and mrs darford enough for all you have done for them there is another person whom i should wish to thank but scarcely dare to name feeling as i do so unworthy of her goodness adieu yours sincerely charles darford again thank god it is scarcely necessary to inform our readers that mr william darford received his penitent friend with open arms took him into partnership and assisted him in the most kind and judicious manner to reestablish his fortune and his credit he became remarkable for his steady attention to business to the great astonishment of those who had seen him only in the character of a dissipated fine gentleman few have sufficient strength of mind thus to stop short in the career of folly and few have the resolution to bear the ridicule thrown upon them even by those whom they despise our hero was ridiculed most unmercifully by all his former companionsby all the bondstreet loungers but of what consequence was this to him he did not live among them he did not hear their witticisms and well knew that in less than a twelvemonth they would forget such a person as charles germaine had ever existed his knowledge of what is called high life had sufficiently convinced him that happiness is not in the gift or in the possession of those who are often to ignorant mortals objects of supreme admiration and envy charles darford looked for happiness and found it in domestic life belief founded upon our own experience is more firm than that which we grant to the hearsay evidence of moralists but happy those who according to the ancient proverb can profit by the experience of their predecessors feb the contrast chapter i what a blessing it is to be the father of such a family of children said farmer frankland as he looked round at the honest affectionate faces of his sons and daughters who were dining with him on his birthday what a blessing it is to have a large family of children a blessing you may call it if you will neighbour said farmer bettesworth but if i were to speak my mind i should be apt to call it a curse why as to that we may both be right and both be wrong replied frankland for children are either a blessing or a curse according as they turn out and they turn out according as they are brought up bring up a child in the way it should go that has ever been my maxim show me a better show me a happier family than my own and show me a happier father than myself continued the good old man with pleasure sparkling in his eyes observing however that his neighbour bettesworth looked blank and sighed deeply he checked himself and said in a more humble tone to be sure it is not so mannerly for a man to be praising his own except it just come from the heart unawares amongst friends who will excuse it especially upon such a day as this this day i am seventy years of age and never was heartier or happier so fanny love fill neighbour bettesworth a glass of your sisters cider tis my pattys making sir and better never was drunk nay nay sit ye still neighbour as you happened to call in just as we were all dining and making merry together why you cannot do better than to stay and make one of us seeing that you are heartily welcome mr bettesworth excused himself by saying that he was in haste to get home no happy home had he no affectionate children to welcome his return yet he had as numerous a family as mr frankland three sons and two daughters idle isaac wild will bullying bob saucy sally and jilting jessy such were the names by which they were called by all who knew them in the town of monmouth where they lived alliteration had lent its artful aid in giving these nicknames but they were not misapplied mr bettesworth was an indolent man fond of his pipe and fonder of building castles in the air by his fireside mrs bettesworth was a vain foolish vixen fond of dress and fonder of her own will neither of them took the least care to breed up their children whilst they were young the mother humoured them when they grew up she contradicted them in every thing and then wondered how they could he so ungrateful as not to love her the father was also surprised to find that his boys and girls were not as wellmannered nor as welltempered nor as clever nor as steady nor as dutiful and affectionate as his neighbour franklands and he said to himself some folks have the luck of having good children to be sure some children are born better than others he should rather have said to be sure some children are bred better than others mr franklands wife was a prudent sensible woman and had united with him in constant endeavours to educate their family whilst they were yet infants prattling at their mothers knee she taught them to love and help one another to conquer their little froward humours and to be obedient and tractable this saved both them and herself a great deal of trouble afterward and their father often said both to the boys and girls you may thank your mother and so may i for the good tempers you have the girls had the misfortune to lose this excellent mother when one was about seventeen and the other eighteen but she was always alive in their memory patty the eldest sister was homely in her person but she was so neat in her dress and she had such a cheerful agreeable temper that people forgot she was not handsome particularly as it was observed that she was very fond of her sister fanny who was remarkably pretty fanny was neither prudish nor censorious neither a romp nor a flirt she was so unaffected and unassuming that most of her neighbours loved her and this is saying a great deal in favour of one who had so much the power to excite envy mr franklands eldest son george was bred to be a farmer and he understood country business uncommonly well for a young man of his age he constantly assisted his father in the management of the farm and by this means acquired much experience with little waste of time or money his father had always treated him so much as his friend and had talked to him so openly of his affairs that he ever looked upon his fathers business as his own and he had no idea of having any separate interest james the second son was bred to trade he had been taught whatever was necessary and useful for a man in business he had habits of punctuality civil manners and a thorough love of fair dealing frank the youngest son was of a more lively disposition than his brothers and his father used often to tell him when he was a boy that if he did not take care his hasty temper would get him into scrapes and that the brightest parts as they are called will be of little use to a man unless he has also steadiness to go through with whatever he begins these hints from a father whom he heartily loved made so strong an impression upon frank that he took great pains to correct the natural violence of his temper and to learn patience and industry the three brothers were attached to one another and their friendship was a source of improvement as well as of pleasure the evening of mr franklands birthday the whole family retired to an arbour in their garden and began to talk over their affairs with open hearts well frank my boy said the happy father who was the confidant of his children i am sure if your heart is set upon this match with jessy bettesworth i will do my best to like the girl and her not being rich shall be no objection to me we can make that up amongst us some way or other but frank it is fair to tell you my opinion of the girl plainly and fully beforehand as i have done she that has jilted others i think would be apt to jilt you if she met with a better offer why then father ill not be in a hurry ill take time to consider before i speak to her any more and i thank you for being so kind which i hope i shall not forget the morning after this conversation passed jilting jessy accompanied by her sister saucy sally came to pay patty and fanny frankland a visit they were full of some piece of news which they were eager to tell well to be sure i dreamed i had a diamond ring put on my finger by a great lord not a week ago cried jessy and who knows but it may come true you have not heard the news fanny frankland hey patty not they they never hear any news said sally well then ill tell you cried jessy rich captain bettesworth our relation who made the great fortin abroad over seas has just broken his neck out ahunting and the fortin all comes to us we shall now see whether mrs craddock will push by me again as she did yesterday in the street well see whether i shant make as good a fine lady as herself i warrant it thats all its my turn to push by folk now said saucy sally fanny and patty frankland with sincere goodnature congratulated their neighbours on this increase of fortune but they did not think that pushing by mrs craddock could be one of the most useful or agreeable consequences of an increase in fortune lord patty how you sit moping yourself there at your work continued sally but some people must work to be sure that cant afford to be idle how you must envy us patty patty assured her she did not in the least envy those who were idle fine talking fine airs truly miss patty this is by way of calling me over the coals for being idle i suppose said sally but ive no notion of being taken to task this way you think youve had a fine education i suppose and so are to get a pattern for all monmouthshire indeed but youll find some people will be as much thought of now as other people and may hold their heads as high edications a fine thing no doubt but fortins a better as the world goes ive a notion so you may go moping on here as long as you please being a good child all the days of your life come when youre calld and do as youre bid shut the door after you and youll never be chid im sure i would not let my nose be kept to the grindstone as yours is for any one living ive too much spirit for my part to be made a fool of as some people are and all for the sake of being called a vastly good daughter or a vastly good sister forsooth nothing but the absolute want of breath could have suspended the remainder of this speech for she was so provoked to see patty did not envy her that she was determined to say every thing she could invent to try her pattys temper however was proof against the trial and saucy sally despairing of success against one sister turned to the other miss fanny i presume said she wont give herself such high and mighty airs as she used to do to one of her sweethearts who shall be nameless fanny blushed for she knew this speech alluded to wild will who was an admirer of hers but whom she had never encouraged i hope said she i never gave myself airs to anybody but if you mean to speak of your brother william i assure you that my opinion of him will not be changed by his becoming richer nor will my fathers here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of frank who had just heard from one of the bettesworths of their good fortune he was impatient to see how jessy would behave in prosperity now said he to himself i shall judge whether my fathers opinion of her or mine is right jilting jessy had certainly given frank reason to believe she was very fond of him but the sudden change in her fortune quite altered her views and opinions as soon as frank came in she pretended to be in great haste to be gone and by various petty manoeuvres avoided giving him an opportunity of speaking to her though she plainly saw he was anxious to say something to her in private at length when she was looking out of the window to see whether a shower was over he went behind her and whispered why are you in such haste cannot you stay a few minutes with us you were not always in such a hurry to run away lord nonsense mr frank why will you always plague me with nonsense mr frank she opened the lattice window as she spoke put out her beautiful neck as far as possible and looked up eagerly to the clouds how sweet this jasmine smells said frank pulling a bit of it which hung over the casement this is the jasmine you used to like so much see ive nailed it up and its finer than ever it was wont you have a sprig of it offering to put some in her hat as he had done before but she now drew back disdainfully saying lord mr frank its all wet and will spoil my new lilac ribbons how awkward and disagreeable you are always always you did not always think so at least you did not say so well i think so and say so now and thats enough and too much if you are in earnest but that i can hardly believe thats your business and not mine if you dont choose to believe what i say how can i help it but this youll remember if you please sir sir oh jessy is it come to this to what sir for i vow and declare i dont understand you i have never understood you till now i am afraid perhaps not its well we understand one another at last better late than never the scornful lady walked off to a lookingglass to wipe away the insult which her new lilac ribbons had received from franks sprig of jasmine one word more and i have done said frank hastily following her have i done anything to displease you or does this change in you proceed from the change in your fortune jessy im not obliged sir to account for my proceedings to any body and dont know what right you have to question me as if you were my lord and judge which you are not nor ever will be thank god franks passion struggled with his reason for a few instants he stood motionless then in an altered voice repeated thank god and turned from her with proud composure from this time forward he paid no more court to jessy ah father said he you knew her better than i did i am glad i did not marry her last year when she would have accepted of me and when she seemed to love me i thought you were rather hard upon her then but you were not in love with her as i was and now i find you were right my dear frank said the good old man i hope you will not think me hard another time when i do not think just the same as you do i would as i told you have done every thing in my power to settle you well in the world if you had married this girl i should never have been angry with you but i should have been bitterly grieved if you had for the whim of the minute made yourself unhappy for life and was it not best to put you upon your guard what better use can an old man make of his experience than to give it to his children frank was touched by the kind manner in which his father spoke to him and fanny who was present immediately put a letter into her fathers hand saying i have just received this from will bettesworth what answer do you think i had best give him now fanny though she did not quite approve of wild wills character felt a little partiality for him for he seemed to be of a generous temper and his manners were engaging she hoped his wildness was only the effect of good spirits and that he would soon settle to some business however she had kept these hopes and this partiality a secret from all but her father and she had never given will bettesworth any encouragement her father had not a good opinion of this young man and she had followed his advice in keeping him at a distance his letter was written in so vile a hand that it was not easy to decipher the meaning my sweet pretty fanny notwithstanding your cruelty i ham more in love with you than hever and now i ham come in for a share in a great fortin and shall ask no questions from father nor mother if you will marry me having no reason to love or care for either mothers as cross as hever and will never i am shure agre to my doing any thing i like myself which makes me more set upon having my own whay and i ham more and more in love with you than hever and would go through fire and water to get you your true love in haste will bettesworth at first reading the letter fanny was pleased to find that her lover did not like jilting jessy change his mind the moment that his situation was altered but upon looking over it again she could not help considering that such an undutiful son was not likely to make a very good husband and she thought even that wild will seemed to be more and more in love with her than ever from the spirit of opposition for he had not been much attached to her till his mother as he said set herself against the match at the end of this letter were the words turn over but they were so scrawled and blotted that fanny thought they were only one of the strange flourishes which he usually made at the end of his name and consequently she had never turned over or read the postscript when she put the epistle into her fathers hands he deciphered the flourish and read the following addition i know your feather does not like me but never mind his not being agreuble as shure as my names will id carry you hoff night or day and bob would fight your brothers along with me if they said a word for bob loves fun i will be at your windor this night if you are agreuble like a gurl of spirit fanny was shocked so much that she turned quite pale and would have sunk to the ground if she had not been supported by her father as soon as she recovered herself sufficiently to be able to think she declared that all the liking she had ever felt for william bettesworth was completely conquered and she thanked her father for having early warned her of his character ah father said she what a happiness it has been to me that you never made me afraid of you else i never should have dared to tell you my mind and in what a sad snare might i have been at this instant if it had not been for you i should perhaps have encouraged this man i might not then may be have been able to draw back and what would have become of me it is scarcely necessary to say that fanny wrote a decided refusal to wild will all connexion between the bettesworths and franklands was now broken off will was enraged at being rejected by fanny and jessy was equally incensed at finding she was no longer admired by frank they however affected to despise the franklands and to treat them as people beneath their notice the fortune left by captain bettesworth to his relations was said to be about twenty thousand pounds with this sum they thought to use their own expression they were entitled to live in as great style and cut as grand a dash as any of the first families in monmouthshire for the present we shall leave them to the enjoyment of their new grandeur and continue the humble history of farmer frankland and his family by many years of persevering industry mr frankland had so improved the farm upon which he lived that he was now affluent for a man in his station of life his house garden farmyard every thing about him were so neat and comfortable that travellers as they passed by never failed to ask who lives there travellers however only saw the outside and that was not in this instance the best part they would have seen happiness if they had looked within these farmhouse walls happiness which may be enjoyed as well in the cottage as in the palace that which arises from family union mr frankland was now anxious to settle his sons in the world george had business enough at home in taking care of the farm and james proposed to set up a haberdashers shop in monmouth accordingly the goods were ordered and the shop was taken there was a part in the roof of the house which let in the wet and james would not go into it till this was completely repaired so his packages of goods were sent from london to his fathers house which was only a mile distant from monmouth his sisters unpacked them by his desire to set shopmarks upon each article late at night after all the rest of the family were asleep patty was sitting up to finish setting the marks on a box full of ribbons the only thing that remained to be done her candle was just burnt out and as she was going for another she went by a passage window that faced the farmyard and suddenly saw a great light without she looked out and beheld the large hayrick all in flames she ran immediately to awaken her brothers and her father they used every possible exertion to extinguish the fire and to prevent it from communicating to the dwellinghouse but the wind was high it blew directly towards the house george poured buckets of water over the thatch to prevent its catching fire but all was in vain thick flakes of fire fell upon it faster than they could be extinguished and in an hours time the dwellinghouse was in a blaze the first care of the sons had been to get their father and sisters out of danger then with great presence of mind they collected every thing that was most valuable and portable and laboured hard to save poor jamess stock of haberdashery they were all night hard at work towards three oclock the fire was got under and darkness and silence succeeded there was one roof of the house saved under which the whole family rested for a few hours till the return of daylight renewed the melancholy spectacle of their ruin hay oats straw cornricks barn every thing that the farmyard contained was utterly consumed the walls and some halfburnt beams remained of the dwellinghouse but it was no longer habitable it was calculated that six hundred pounds would not repair the loss occasioned by this unfortunate accident how the hayrick had caught fire nobody knew george who had made up the haystack was most inclined to think that the hay had not been sufficiently dried and that the rick had heated from this cause he blamed himself extremely but his father declared he had seen felt and smelt the hay when the rick was making and that it was as well saved hay as ever was brought into a farmyard this in some measure quieted poor georges conscience and he was yet more comforted by pattys goodnature who showed him a bucket of ashes which had been left very near the spot where the hayrick stood the servantgirl who though careless was honest confessed she recollected having accidentally left this bucket in that dangerous place the preceding evening that she was going with it across the yard to the ashhole but she heard her lover whistle to her from the lane and she set down the bucket in a hurry ran to meet him and forgot the ashes all she could say in her own defence was that she did not think there was any fire in the bucket her good master forgave her carelessness he said he was sure she reproached herself enough for it as indeed she did and the more so when her master spoke to her so kindly she cried as if her heart would break and all that could be done to comfort her was to set her to work as hard as possible for the family they did not any of them spend their time in vain lamentations ready money was wanting to rebuild the house and barns and james sold to a haberdasher in monmouth all of his stock which had been saved out of the fire and brought the money to his father father said he you gave this to me when you were able to afford it you want it now and i can do very well without it i will go and be shopman in some good shop in monmouth and by degrees i shall get on and do very well in the world it would be strange if i did not after the education you have given me the father took the money from his son with tears of pleasure it is odd enough said he that i should feel pleasure at such a time but this is the blessing of having good children as long as we all are ready to help one another in this manner we can never be very miserable happen what may now let us think of rebuilding our house continued the active old man frank reach me down my hat ive a twinge of the rheumatism in this arm i caught a little cold the night of the fire i believe but stirring about will do me good and i must not be lazy i should be ashamed to be lazy amongst so many active young men the father and sons were very busy at work when an illlooking man rode up to them and after asking if their name was frankland put a paper into each of their hands these papers were copies of a notice to quit their farm before the ensuing first of september under pain of paying double rent for the same this is some mistake sir said old frankland mildly no mistake sir replied the stranger you will find the notice is a good notice and duly served your lease i have seen myself within these few days it expired last may and you have held over contrary to law and justice eleven months this being april my father never did anything contrary to law and justice in his whole life interrupted frank whose eyes flashed with indignation softly frank said his father putting his hand on his sons shoulder softly my dear boy let this gentleman and i come to an understanding quietlyhere is some mistake sir it is very true that my lease expired last may but i had a promise of a renewal from my good landlord i dont know sir anything of that replied the stranger as he looked over a memorandumbook i do not know whom you denominate your good landlord that being no way of describing a man in the eye of the law but if you refer to the original grantor or lessor francis folingsby of folingsbyplace monmouthshire esq i am to inform you that he died at bath the th instant died my poor landlord dead i am very sorry for it and his nephew philip folingsby esq came into possession as heir at law continued the stranger in an unvaried tone and under his orders i act having a power of attorney for that purpose but sir i am sure mr philip folingsby cannot know of the promise of renewal which i had from his uncle verbal promises you know are nothing sir mere air without witnesses and if gratuitous on the part of the deceased are no ways binding either in common law or equity on the survivor or heir in case the promise had been in writing and on a proper stamp it would have been something it was not in writing to be sure sir said frankland but i thought my good landlords word was as good as his bond and i said so yes cried frank and i remember when you said so to him i was by and he answered you shall have my promise in writing such things are of little use between honest men but who knows what may happen and who may come after me everything about business should be put into writing i would never let a tenant of mine be at an uncertainty you have improved your farm and deserve to enjoy the fruits of your own industry mr frankland just then company came in and our landlord put off writing the promise he next day left the country in a hurry and i am sure thought afterwards he had given us the promise in writing very clear evidence no doubt sir but not at all to the point at present said the stranger as an agent i am to know nothing but what is my employers intent when we see the writing and stamp i shall be a better judge added he with a sneer in the mean time gentlemen i wish you a good morning and you will please to observe that you have been duly served with notice to quit or pay double rent there can be no doubt however said frank that mr folingsby will believe you father he is a gentleman i suppose and not like this new agent who talks like an attorney i hate all attorneys all dishonest attorneys i suppose you mean frank said the benevolent old man who even when his temper was most tried never spoke or even felt with acrimony the new landlord came into the country and a few days after his arrival old frankland went to wait upon him there was little hope of seeing young mr folingsby he was a man whose head was at this time entirely full of gigs and tandems and unicorns business was his aversion pleasure was his business money he considered only as the means of pleasure and tenants only as machines who make money he was neither avaricious nor cruel but thoughtless and extravagant whilst he appeared merely in the character of a young man of fashion these faults were no offence to his equals to whom they did no injury but when he came into possession of a large estate and when numbers were dependent upon him they were severely felt by his inferiors mr folingsby had just gathered up the reins in hand and was seated in his unicorn when farmer frankland who had been waiting some hours to see him came to the side of the carriage as he took off his hat the wind blew his grey hair over his face put on your hat pray my good friend and dont come near these horses for i cant answer for them have you any commands with me i have been waiting some hours to speak to you sir but if you are not at leisure i will come again tomorrow morning said old frankland ay do so call tomorrow morning for now i have not one moment to spare said young folingsby as he whipped his horses and drove off as if the safety of the nation had depended upon twelve miles an hour the next day and the next and the next the old tenant called upon his young landlord but without obtaining an audience still he was desired to call tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow he wrote several letters to him but received no answer at last after giving half a guinea to his landlords gentleman he gained admittance mr folingsby was drawing on his boots and his horses were coming to the door frankland saw it was necessary to be concise in his story he slightly touched on the principal circumstances the length of time he had occupied his farm the improvements he had made upon the land and the misfortune which had lately befallen him the boots were on by the time that he got to the promise of renewal and the notice to quit promise of renewal i know of no such thing notice to quit thats my agents business speak to him hell do you justice i really am sorry for you mr frankland very sorry extremely sorry damn the rascal who made these bootsbut you see how im circumstanced havent a moment to myself only came to the country for a few days set out for ascotraces tomorrow really have not a moment to think of any thing but speak to mr deal my agent hell do you justice im sure i leave all these things to him jack that bay horse is coming on i have spoken to your agent sir said the old tenant following his thoughtless young landlord but he said that verbal promises without a witness present were nothing but air and i have nothing to rely on but your justice i assure you sir i have not been an idle tenant my land will show that i have not tell mr deal so make him understand it in this light i leave every thing of this sort to mr deal i really have not time for business but im sure mr deal will do you justice this was all that could be obtained from the young landlord his confidence in his agents sense of justice was somewhat misplaced mr deal had received a proposal from another tenant for franklands farm and with this proposal a bank note was sent which spoke more forcibly than all that poor frankland could urge the agent took the farm from him and declared he could not in justice to his employer do otherwise because the new tenant had promised to build upon the land a lodge fit for any gentleman to inhabit instead of a farmhouse the transaction was concluded without mr folingsbys knowing any thing more of the matter except signing the leases which he did without reading them and receiving half a years rent in hand as a fine which he did with great satisfaction he was often distressed for ready money though he had a large estate and his agent well knew how to humour him in his hatred of business no interest could have persuaded mr folingsby deliberately to commit so base an action as that of cheating a deserving old tenant out of a promised renewal but in fact long before the leases were sent to him he had totally forgotten every syllable that poor frankland had said to him on the subject chapter ii the day on which they left their farm was a melancholy day to this unfortunate family mr franklands father and grandfather had been tenants and excellent tenants to the folingsby family all of them had occupied and not only occupied but highly improved this farm all the neighbours were struck with compassion and cried shame upon mr folingsby but mr folingsby was at ascot and did not hear them he was on the race ground betting hundreds upon a favourite horse whilst this old man and his family were slowly passing in their covered cart down the lane which led from their farm taking a last farewell of the fields they had cultivated and the harvest they had sown but which they were never to reap hannah the servantgirl who had reproached herself so bitterly for leaving the bucket of ashes near the hayrick was extremely active in assisting her poor master upon this occasion she seemed to be endowed with double strength and a degree of cleverness and presence of mind of which she had never shown any symptoms in her former life but gratitude awakened all her faculties before she came to this family she had lived some years with a farmer who as she now recollected had a small farm with a snug cottage upon it which was to be this very year out of lease without saying a word of her intentions she got up early one morning walked fifteen miles to her old masters and offered to pay out of her wages which she had laid by for six or seven years the years rent of this farm beforehand if the farmer would let it to mr frankland the farmer would not take the girls money for he said he wanted no security from mr frankland or his son george they bore the best of characters he observed and no people in monmouthshire could understand the management of land better he willingly agreed to let him the farm but it contained only a few acres and the house was so small that it could scarcely lodge above three people here old frankland and his eldest son george settled james went to monmouth where he became shopman to mr cleghorn a haberdasher who took him in preference to three other young men who applied on the same day shall i tell you the reason why i fixed upon you james said mr cleghorn it was not whim i had my reasons i suppose said james you thought i had been honestly and well brought up as i believe in former times sir you knew something of my mother yes sir and in former times i knew something of yourself you may forget but i do not that when you were a child not more than nine years old footnote this circumstance is a fact you came to this shop to pay a bill of your mothers the bill was cast up a pound too little you found out the mistake and paid me the money i dare say you are as good an accountant and as honest a fellow still i have just been terribly tricked by a lad to whom i trusted foolishly but this will not make me suspicious towards you because i know how you have been brought up and that is the best security a man can have thus even in childhood the foundation of a good character may be laid and thus children inherit the good name of their parents a rich inheritance of which they cannot be deprived by the utmost malice of fortune the good characters of fanny and patty frankland were well known in the neighbourhood and when they could no longer afford to live at home they found no difficulty in getting places on the contrary several of the best families in monmouth were anxious to engage them fanny went to live with mrs hungerford a lady of an ancient family who was proud but not insolent and generous but not what is commonly called affable she had several children and she hired fanny frankland for the particular purpose of attending them pray let me see that you exactly obey my orders young woman with respect to my children said mrs hungerford and you shall have no reason to complain of the manner in which you are treated in this house it is my wish to make every body happy in it from the highest to the lowest you have i understand received an education above your present station in life and i hope and trust that you will deserve the high opinion i am from that circumstance inclined to form of you fanny was rather intimidated by the haughtiness of mrs hungerfords manner yet she felt a steady though modest confidence in herself which was not displeasing to her mistress about this time patty also went into service her mistress was a mrs crumpe a very old rich lady who was often sick and peevish and who confessed that she required an uncommonly goodhumoured person to wait upon her she lived a few miles from monmouth where she had many relations but on account of her great age and infirmities she led an extremely retired life frank was now the only person in the family who was not settled in the world he determined to apply to a mr barlow an attorney of an excellent character he had been much pleased with the candour and generosity frank showed in a quarrel with the bettesworths and he had promised to befriend him if ever it should be in his power it happened that at this time mr barlow was in want of a clerk and as he knew franks abilities and had reason to feel confidence in his integrity he determined to employ him in his office frank had once a prejudice against attorneys he thought that they could not be honest men but he was convinced of his mistake when he became acquainted with mr barlow this gentleman never practised any mean pettyfogging arts on the contrary he always dissuaded those who consulted him from commencing vexatious suits instead of fomenting quarrels it was his pleasure and pride to bring about reconciliations it was said of mr barlow that he had lost more suits out of the court and fewer in them than any attorney of his standing in england his reputation was now so great that he was consulted more as a lawyer than as an attorney with such a master frank had a prospect of being extremely happy and he determined that nothing should be wanting on his part to ensure mr barlows esteem and regard james frankland in the mean time went on happily with mr cleghorn the haberdasher whose customers all agreed that his shop had never been so well attended as since this young man had been his foreman his accounts were kept in the most exact manner and his bills were made out with unrivalled neatness and expedition his attendance on the shop was so constant that his master began to fear it might hurt his health especially as he had never till of late been used to so confined a life you should go abroad james these fine evenings said mr cleghorn take a walk in the country now and then in the fresh air dont think i want to nail you always to the counter come this is as fine an evening as you can wish take your hat and away ill mind the shop myself till you come back he must be a hard master indeed that does not know when he is well served and that never will be my case i hope good servants make good masters and good masters good servants not that i mean to call you mr james a servant that was only a slip of the tongue and no matter for the tongue where the heart means well as mine does towards you towards all the world mr cleghorn was not disposed to be indulgent he was not a selfish man but he had a high idea of subordination in life having risen himself by slow degrees he thought that every man in trade should have what he called the rough as well as the smooth he saw that his new foreman bore the rough well and therefore he was now inclined to give him some of the smooth james who was extremely fond of his brother frank called upon him and took him to mrs hungerfords to ask fanny to accompany them in this walk they had seldom seen her since they had quitted their fathers house and lived in monmouth and they were disappointed when they were told by mrs hungerfords footman that fanny was not at home she was gone to walk out with the children the man did not know which road they went so they had no hopes of meeting her and they took their way through one of the shady lanes near monmouth it was late before they thought of returning for after several weeks confinement in close houses the fresh air green fields and sweetsmelling wild flowers in the hedges were delightful novelties those who see these things every day said james scarcely notice them i remember i did not when i lived at our farm so things as my father used to say are made equal to people in this world we who are hard at work in a close room all day long have more relish for an evening walk a hundred to one than those who saunter about from morning till night the philosophic reflections of james were interrupted by the merry voices of a troop of children who were getting over a stile into the lane where he and frank were walking the children had huge nosegays of honeysuckles dogroses and bluebells in their little hands and they gave their flowers to a young woman who attended them begging she would hold them whilst they got over the stile james and frank went to offer their services to help the children and then they saw that the young woman who held the flowers was their sister fanny our own fanny said frank how lucky this is it seems almost a year since i saw you we have been all the way to mrs hungerfords to look for you and have been forced to take half our walk without you but the other half will make amends ive a hundred things to say to you which is your way home take the longest way i entreat you here is my arm what a delightful fine evening it is but whats the matter it is a very fine evening said fanny hesitating a little and i hope tomorrow will be as fine ill ask my mistress to let me walk out with you tomorrow but this evening i cannot stay with you because i have the children under my care and i have promised her that i will never walk with any one when they are with me but your own brother said frank a little angry at this refusal i promised i would not walk with any one and surely you are somebody so good night good bye replied fanny endeavouring to turn off his displeasure with a laugh but what harm i say can i do the children by walking with you cried frank catching hold of her gown i dont know but i know what the orders of my mistress are and you know dear frank that whilst i live with her i am bound to obey them oh frank she must obey them said james frank loosened his hold of fannys gown immediately you are right dear fanny said he you are right and i was wrong so good night good bye only remember to ask leave to walk with us tomorrow evening for i have had a letter from father and brother george and i want to show it you wait five minutes and i can read it to you now fanny fanny though she was anxious to hear her fathers letter would not wait but hurried away with the children that were under her care saying she must keep her promise to her mistress exactly frank followed her and put the letter into her hands you are a dear good girl and deserve all the fine things father says of you in this letter take it child your mistress does not forbid you receiving a letter from your father i suppose i shall wish her hanged if she does not let you walk with us tomorrow whispered he the children frequently interrupted fanny as she was reading her fathers letter pray pull that high dogrose for me fanny said one pray hold me up to that large honeysuckle said another and do fanny said the youngest boy let us go home by the common that i may see the glowworms mamma said i might and whilst we are looking for the glowworms you can sit on a stone or a bank and read your letter in peace fanny who was always very ready to indulge the children in any thing which her mistress had not forbidden agreed to this proposal and when they came to the common little gustavus for that was the name of the eldest boy found a charming seat for her and she sat down to read her letter whilst the children ran to hunt for glowworms fanny read her fathers letter over three times and yet few people except those who have the happiness to love a father as well and to have a father as deserving to be loved would think it at all worth reading even once my dear boys and girls it is a strange thing to me to be without you but with me or from me i am sure you are doing well and that is a great comfort ay the best a father can have especially at my age i am heartily glad to hear that my frank has by his own deserts got so good a place with that excellent man mr barlow he does not hate attorneys now i am sure indeed it is my belief he could not hate any body for half an hour together if he were to do his worst thank god none of my children have been brought up to be revengeful or envious and they are not fighting with one another as i hear the poor bettesworths now all are for the fortune better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith i need not have troubled myself to write this text to any of you but old men will be talkative my rheumatism however prevents me from being as talkative as i could wish it has been rather severe or so owing to the great cold i caught the day that i was obliged to wait so long at squire folingsbys in my wet clothes but i hope soon to be stirring again and to be able to take share of the work about our little farm with your dear brother george poor fellow he has so much to do and does so much that i fear he will overwork himself he is at this present time out in the little field opposite my window digging up the docks which are very hard to conquer he has made a brave large heap of them but i wish to my heart he would not toil so desperately i desire my dear james and frank you will not confine yourselves too much in your shop and at your desk this is all i have to dread for either of you give my love and blessing to my sweet girls if fanny was not as prudent as she is pretty i should be in fear for her hearing as i do that mrs hungerford keeps so much fine company a waitingmaid in such a house is in a dangerous place but my fanny i am sure will ever keep in mind her mothers precepts and example i am told that mrs crumpe pattys mistress is owing i suppose to her great age and infirmities difficult in her humour but my patty has so even and pleasant a temper that i defy any one living that knows her not to love her my hand is now quite tired of writing this being penned with my left as my right arm is not yet free from rheumatism i have not james with me to write god bless and preserve you all my dear children with such comforts i can have nothing to complain of in this world this i know i would not exchange any one of you for all my neighbour bettesworths fine fortune write soon to your affectionate father b frankland look look at the glowworms cried the children gathering round fanny just as she had finished reading her letter there were prodigious numbers of them on this common and they shone over the whole ground in clusters or singly like little stars whilst the children were looking with admiration and delight at this spectacle their attention was suddenly diverted from the glowworms by the sound of a frenchhorn they looked round and perceived that it came from the balcony of a house which was but a few yards distant from the spot where they were standing oh let us go nearer to the balcony said the children that we may hear the music better a violin and a clarinet at this moment began to play oh let us go nearer said the children drawing fanny with all their little force towards the balcony my dears it is growing late said she and we must make haste home there is a crowd of company you see at the door and at the windows of that house and if we go near to it some of them will certainly speak to you and that you know your mamma would not like the children paused and looked at one another as if inclined to submit but at this moment a kettledrum was heard and little gustavus could not resist his curiosity to hear and see more of this instrument he broke loose from fannys hands and escaped to the house exclaiming i must and will hear it and see it too fanny was obliged to pursue him into the midst of the crowd he made his way up to a young gentleman in regimentals who took him up in his arms saying by jove a fine little fellow a soldier every inch of him by jove he shall see the drum and beat it too let us see who dares say to the contrary as the gallant ensign spoke he carried gustavus up a flight of stairs that led to the balcony fanny in great anxiety called after him to beg that he would not detain the child who was trusted to her care her mistress she said would be extremely displeased with her if she disobeyed her orders she was here interrupted in her remonstrance by the shrill voice of a female who stood on the same stair with the ensign and whom notwithstanding the great alteration in her dress fanny recognized to be sally bettesworth jilting jessy stood beside her fanny frankland i protest what a pother she keeps about nothing cried saucy sally know your betters and keep your distance young woman who cares whether your mistress is displeased or not she cant turn us away can she pray she cant call ensign bloomington to account can she hey an insolent laugh closed this speech a laugh in which several of the crowd joined but some gentlemen were interested by fannys beautiful and modest countenance as she looked up to the balcony and with tears in her eyes entreated to be heard oh for shame bloomington give her back the boy it is not fair that she should lose her place cried they bloomington would have yielded but saucy sally stood before him crying in a threatening tone ill never speak to you again i promise you bloomington if you give up a fine thing indeed for a man and a soldier to give up to a woman and a servantgirl and an impertinent servantgirl who cares for her or her place either i do i do exclaimed little gustavus springing from the ensigns arms i care for her she is not an impertinent girl and ill give up seeing the kettledrum and go home with her directly with all my heart in vain sally attempted to withhold him the boy ran down the stairs to fanny and marched off with her in all the conscious pride of a hero whose generosity has fairly vanquished his passions little gustavus was indeed a truly generous child the first thing he did when he got home was to tell his mother all that had passed this evening mrs hungerford was delighted with her son and said to him i cannot i am sure reward you better my dear than by rewarding this good young woman the fidelity with which she has fulfilled my orders in all that regards my children places her in my opinion above the rank in which she was born henceforward she shall hold in my house a station to which her habits of truth gentleness and good sense entitle her from this time forward fanny by mrs hungerfords desire was always present when the children took their lessons from their several masters mrs hungerford advised her to apply herself to learn all those things which were necessary for a governess to young ladies when you speak your language in general is good and correct and no pains shall be wanting on my part said this haughty but benevolent lady to form your manners and to develop your talents this i partly owe you for your care of my children and i am happy to reward my son gustavus in a manner which i am certain will be most agreeable to him and mamma said the little boy may she walk out sometimes with her brothers for i do believe she loves them as well as i love my sisters mrs hungerford permitted fanny to walk out for an hour every morning during the time that her children were with their dancingmaster and at this hour sometimes her brother james and sometimes her brother frank could be spared and they had many pleasant walks together what a happiness it was to them to have been thus bred up from their earliest years in friendship with one another this friendship was now the sweetest pleasure of their lives poor patty she regretted that she could not join in these pleasant meetings but alas she was so useful so agreeable and so necessary to her infirm mistress that she could never be spared from home wheres patty why does not patty do this were mrs crumpes constant questions whenever she was absent patty had all the business of the house upon her hands because nobody could do any thing so well as patty mrs crumpe found that no one could dress her but patty nobody could make her bed so that she could sleep on it but patty no one could make jelly or broth or whey that she could taste but patty no one could roast or boil or bake but patty of course all these things must be done by nobody else the ironing of mrs crumpes caps which had exquisitely nice plaited borders at last fell to pattys share because once when the laundrymaid was sick she plaited one so charmingly that her lady would never afterwards wear any but of her plaiting now mrs crumpe changed her cap or rather had her cap changed three times a day and never wore the same cap twice the labours of washing ironing plaiting roasting boiling baking making jelly broth and whey were not sufficient mrs crumpe took it into her head that she could eat no butter but of pattys churning but what was worse than all not a night passed without pattys being called up to see what could be the matter with the dog that was barking or the cat that was mewing and when she was just sinking to sleep again at daybreak her lady in whose room she slept would call out patty patty theres a dreadful noise in the chickenyard oh maam it is only the cocks crowing well do step out and hinder them from crowing at this terrible rate but maam i cannot hinder them indeed oh yes you could if you were up get up and whip em child whip em all round or i shall not sleep a wink more this night footnote taken from life how little poor patty slept her lady never considered not that she was in reality an illnatured woman but sickness inclined her to be peevish and she had so long been used to be humoured and waited upon by relations and servants who expected she would leave them rich legacies that she considered herself as a sort of golden idol to whom all that approached should and would bow as low as she pleased perceiving that almost all around her were interested she became completely selfish she was from morning till night from night till morning nay from years end to years end so much in the habit of seeing others employed for her that she absolutely considered this to be the natural and necessary course of things and she quite forgot to think of the comfort or even of the wellbeing of those creatures who were born for her use and live but to oblige her from time to time she was so far awakened to feeling by pattys exertions and goodhumour that she would say to quiet her own conscience well well ill make it all up to her in my will ill make it all up to her in my will she took it for granted that patty like the rest of her dependents was governed entirely by mercenary considerations and she was persuaded that the hopes of this legacy would secure patty her slave for life in this she was mistaken one morning patty came into her room with a face full of sorrow a face so unlike her usual countenance that even her mistress unaccustomed as she was to attend to the feelings of others could not help noticing the change well whats the matter child said she oh sad news madam said patty turning aside to hide her tears but whats the matter child i say cant you speak whatever it is hey what have you burnt my best cap in the ironing hey is that it oh worse worse maam worse what can be worse my brother maam my brother george is ill very ill of a fever and they dont think hell live here is my fathers letter maam lord how can i read it without spectacles and why should i read it when youve told me all thats in it how the child cries continued mrs crumpe raising herself a little on her pillow and looking at patty with a sort of astonished curiosity heigho but i cant stay in bed this way till dinnertime get me my cap child and dry your eyes for crying wont do your brother any good patty dried her eyes no crying will not do him any good said she but but where is my cap i dont see it on the dressingtable no maam martha will bring it in a minute or two she is plaiting it i will not have it plaited by martha go and do it yourself but maam said patty who to her mistresss surprise stood still notwithstanding she heard this order i hope you will be so good as to give me leave to go to my poor brother today all the rest of my brothers and sisters are with him and he wants to see me and they have sent a horse for me no matter what they have sent you shant go i cant spare you if you choose to serve me serve me if you choose to serve your brother serve your brother and leave me then madam said patty i must leave you for i cannot but choose to serve my brother at such a time as this if i can serve him which god grant i maynt be too late to do what you will leave me leave me contrary to my orders take notice then these doors you shall never enter again if you leave me now cried mrs crumpe who by this unexpected opposition to her orders was actually worked up to a state unlike her usual peevishness she started up in her bed and growing quite red in the face cried leave me now and you leave me for ever remember that remember that then madam i must leave you for ever said patty moving towards the door i wish you your health and happiness and am sorry to break so short the girls an idiot cried mrs crumpe after this you cannot expect that i should remember you in my will no indeed madam i expect no such thing said patty her hand was on the lock of the door as she spoke then said mrs crumpe perhaps you will think it worth your while to stay with me when i tell you i have not forgot you in my will consider that child before you turn the handle of the door consider that and dont disoblige me for ever oh madam consider my poor brother i am sorry to disoblige you for ever but i can consider nothing but my poor brother said patty the lock of the door turned quickly in her hand why is your brother rich what upon earth do you expect from this brother that can make it worth your while to behave to me in this strange way said mrs crumpe patty was silent with astonishment for a few moments and then answered i expect nothing from him madam he is as poor as myself but that does not make me love him the less before mrs crumpe could understand this last speech patty had left the room her mistress sat up in her bed in the same attitude for some minutes after she was gone looking fixedly at the place where patty had stood she could scarcely recover from her surprise and a multitude of painful thoughts crowded upon her mind if i were dying and poor who would come to me not a relation i have in the world would come near me not a creature on earth loves me as this poor girl loves her brother who is as poor as herself here her reflections were interrupted by hearing the galloping of pattys horse as it passed by the windows mrs crumpe tried to compose herself again to sleep but she could not and in half an hours time she rang the bell violently took her purse out of her pocket counted out twenty bright guineas and desired that a horse should be saddled immediately and that her steward should gallop after patty and offer her that whole sum in hand if she would return begin with one guinea and bid on till you come up to her price said mrs crumpe have her back again i will if it were only to convince myself that she is to be had for money as well as other people the steward as he counted the gold in his hand thought it was a great sum to throw away for such a whim he had never seen his lady take the whim of giving away ready money before but it was in vain to remonstrate she was peremptory and he obeyed in two hours time he returned and mrs crumpe saw her gold again with extreme astonishment the steward said he could not prevail upon patty even to look at the guineas mrs crumpe now flew into a violent passion in which none of our readers will probably sympathize we shall therefore forbear to describe it chapter iii when patty came within half a mile of the cottage in which her father lived she met hannah the faithful servant who had never deserted the family in their misfortunes she had been watching all the morning on the road for the first sight of patty but when she saw her and came quite close up to her she had no power to speak and patty was so much terrified that she could not ask her a single question she walked her horse a slow pace and kept silence wont you go on maam said hannah at last forcing herself to speak wont you go on a bit faster hes almost wild to see you he is alive then cried patty the horse was in full gallop directly and she was soon at her fathers door james and frank were there watching for her they lifted her from the horse and feeling that she trembled so much as to be scarcely able to stand they would have detained her a little while in the air but she passed or rather rushed into the room where her brother lay he took no notice of her when she came in for he was insensible fanny was supporting his head she held out her hand to patty who went on tiptoe to the side of the bed is he asleep whispered she not asleep buthell come to himself presently continued fanny and he will be very very glad you are come and so will my father where is my father said patty i dont see him fanny pointed to the farthest end of the room where he was kneeling at his devotion the shutters being half closed she could but just see the faint beam which shone upon his grey hairs he rose came to his daughter patty with an air of resigned grief and taking her hand between both of his said my lovewe must lose himgods will be done oh there is hope there is hope still said patty see the colour is coming back to his lips again his eyes open oh george dear george dear brother it is your own sister patty dont you know patty pattyyes why does she not come to me i would go to her if i could said the sufferer without knowing what he talked of is not she come yet send another horse frank why it is only six miles six miles in three hours that ishow many miles an hour ten miles is it dont hurry herdont tell her im so bad nor my fatherdont let him see me nor james nor frank nor pretty fanny nor any bodythey are all too good to me i only wished to see poor patty once before i die but dont frighten heri shall be very well tell herquite well by the time she comes after running on in this manner for some time his eyes closed again and he lay in a state of stupor he continued in this condition for some time at last his sisters who were watching beside the bed heard a knocking at the door it was frank and james they had gone for a clergyman whom george before he became delirious had desired to see the clergyman was come and with him a benevolent physician who happened to be at his house and who insisted upon accompanying him as soon as the physician saw the poor young man and felt his pulse he perceived that the ignorant apothecary who had been first employed had entirely mistaken georges disease and had treated him improperly his disease was a putrid fever and the apothecary had bled him repeatedly the physician thought he could certainly have saved his life if he had seen him two days sooner but now it was a hopeless case all that could be done for him he tried towards evening the disease seemed to take a favourable turn george came to his senses knew his father his brothers and fanny and spoke to each with his customary kindness as they stood round his bed he then asked whether poor patty was come when he saw her he thanked her tenderly for coming to him but could not recollect he had any thing particular to say to her i only wished to see you all together to thank you for your goodnature to me ever since i was born and to take leave of you before i die for i feel that i am dying nay do not cry so my father oh my father is most to be pitied but he will have james and frank left seeing his fathers affliction which the good old man struggled in vain to subdue george broke off here he put his hand to his head as if fearing it was again growing confused let me see our good clergyman now that i am well enough to see him said he he then took a hand of each of his brothers and sisters joined them together and pressed them to his lips looking from them to his father whose back was now turned you understand me whispered george he can never come to want while you are left to work and comfort him if i should not see you again in this world farewell ask my father to give me his blessing god bless you my son god bless you my dear good son god will surely bless so good a son said the agonized father laying his hand upon his sons forehead which even now was cold with the damp of death what a comfort it is to have a fathers blessing said george may you all have it when you are as i am now i shall be out of this world long long before that time i hope said the poor old man as he left the room but gods will be done send the clergyman to my boy the clergyman remained in the room but a short time when he returned to the family they saw by his looks that all was over there was a solemn silence be comforted said the good clergyman never man left this world with a clearer conscience or had happier hope of a life to come be comforted alas at such a time as this you cannot be comforted by any thing that the tongue of man can say all the family attended the funeral it was on a sunday just before morning prayers and as soon as george was interred his father brothers and sisters left the churchyard to avoid being seen by the gay people who were coming to their devotion as they went home they passed through the field in which george used to work there they saw his heap of docks and his spade upright in the ground beside it just as he had left it the last time that he had ever worked the whole family stayed for a few days with their poor father late one evening as they were all walking out together in the fields a heavy dew began to fall and james urged his father to make haste home lest he should catch cold and should have another fit of the rheumatism they were then at some distance from their cottage and frank who thought he knew a short way home took them by a new road which unluckily led them far out of their way it brought them unexpectedly within sight of their old farm and of the new house which mr bettesworth had built upon it oh my dear father i am sorry i brought you this way cried frank let us turn back no my son why should we turn back said his father mildly we can pass by these fields and this house i hope without coveting our neighbours goods as they came near the house he stopped at the gate to look at it it is a good house said he but i have no need to envy any man a good house i that have so much better thingsgood children just as he uttered these words mr bettesworths house door opened and three or four men appeared on the stone steps quarrelling and fighting the loud voices of bullying bob and wild will were heard too plainly we have no business here said old frankland turning to his children let us go the combatants pursued each other with such furious rapidity that they were near to the gate in a few instants lock the gate you without there whoever you are lock the gate or ill knock you down when i come up whoever you are cried bullying bob who was hindmost in the race wild will was foremost he kicked open the gate but his foot slipped as he was going through his brother overtook him and seizing him by the collar cried give me back the banknotes you rascal they are mine and ill have em in spite of you they are mine and ill keep em in spite of you retorted will who was much intoxicated oh what a sight brothers fighting oh part them part them hold hold for heavens sake cried old frankland to them frank and james held them asunder though they continued to abuse one another in the grossest terms their father by this time came up he wrung his hands and wept bitterly oh shame shame to me in my old age cried he cant you two let me live the few years i have to live in peace ah neighbour frankland you are better off my heart will break soon these children of mine will be the ruin and the death of me at these words the sons interrupted their father with loud complaints of the manner in which he had treated them they had quarrelled with one another and with their father about money the father charged them with profligate extravagance and they accused him of sordid avarice mr frankland much shocked at this scene besought them at least to return to their house and not to expose themselves in this manner especially now that they were in the station of gentlemen their passions were too loud and brutal to listen to this appeal to their pride their being raised to the rank of gentlemen could not give them principles or manners that can only be done by education despairing to effect any good mr frankland retired from this scene and made the best of his way home to his peaceful cottage my children said he to his family as they sat down to their frugal meal we are poor but we are happy in one another was not i right to say i need not envy neighbour bettesworth his fine house whatever misfortunes befall me i have the blessing of good children it is a blessing i would not exchange for any this world affords god preserve them in health he sighed and soon added it is a bitter thing to think of a good son who is dead but it is worse perhaps to think of a bad son who is alive that is a misfortune i can never know but my dear boys and girls continued he changing his tone this idle way of life of ours must not last for ever you are too poor to be idle and so much the better for you tomorrow you must all away to your own business but father cried they all at once which of us may stay with you none of you my good children you are all going on well in the world and i will not take you from your good masters and mistresses patty now urged that she had the strongest right to remain with her father because mrs crumpe would certainly refuse to receive her into her service again after what had passed at their parting but nothing could prevail upon frankland he positively refused to let any of his children stay with him at last frank cried how can you possibly manage this farm without help you must let either james or me stay with you father suppose you should be seized with another fit of the rheumatism frankland paused for a moment and then answered poor hannah will nurse me if i fall sick i am able still to pay her just wages i will not be a burden to my children as to this farm i am going to give it up for indeed said the old man smiling i should not be well able to manage it with the rheumatism in my spadearm my landlord farmer hewit is a goodnatured friendly man and he will give me my own time for the rent nay he tells me he would let me live in this cottage for nothing but i cannot do that then what will you do dear father said his sons the clergyman who was here yesterday has made interest for a house for me which will cost me nothing nor him either and i shall be very near you both boys but father interrupted frank i know by your way of speaking there is something about this house which you do not like that is true said old frankland but that is the fault of my pride and of my old prejudices which are hard to conquer at my time of life it is certain i do not much like the thoughts of going into an almshouse an almshouse cried all his children at once in a tone of horror oh father you must not indeed you must not go into an almshouse the pride which renders the english yeoman averse to live upon public charity is highly advantageous to the industry and virtue of the nation even where it is instilled early into families as a prejudice it is useful and ought to be respected franklands children shocked at the idea of their fathers going into an almshouse eagerly offered to join together the money they had earned and to pay the rent of the cottage in which he now lived but frankland knew that if he took this money his children would themselves be in distress he answered with tears in his eyes my dear children i thank you all for your goodness but i cannot accept of your offer since i am no longer able to support myself i will not from false pride be the ruin of my children i will not be a burden to them and i prefer living upon public charity to accepting of the ostentatious liberality of any one rich man i am come to a resolution which nothing shall induce me to break i am determined to live in the monmouth almshousenay hear me my children patientlyto live in the monmouth almshouse for one year and during that time i will not see any of you unless i am sick i lay my commands upon you not to attempt to see me till this day twelvemonth if at that time you are all together able to maintain me without hurting yourselves i will most willingly accept of your bounty for the rest of my days his children assured him they should be able to earn money sufficient to maintain him without injury to themselves long before the end of the year and they besought him to permit them to do so as soon as it was in their power but he continued firm in his resolution and made them solemnly promise they would obey his commands and not even attempt to see him during the ensuing year he then took leave of them in a most affectionate manner saying i know my dearest children i have now given you the strongest possible motive for industry and good conduct this day twelvemonth we shall meet again and i hope it will be as joyful a meeting as this is a sorrowful parting his children with some difficulty obtained permission to accompany him to his new abode the almshouses at monmouth are far superior to common institutions of this kind they are remarkably neat and comfortable little dwellings and form a row of pretty cottages behind each of which there is a garden full of gooseberries currants and a variety of useful vegetables these the old men cultivate themselves the houses are fitted up conveniently and each individual is provided with every thing that he wants in his own habitation so that there is no opportunity or temptation for those petty disputes about property which often occur in charitable institutions that are not prudently conducted poor people who have their goods in common must necessarily become quarrelsome you see said old frankland pointing to the shining row of pewter on the clean shelf over the fireplace in his little kitchen you see i want for nothing here i am not much to be pitied his children stood silent and dejected whilst he dressed himself in the uniform belonging to the almshouse before they parted they all agreed to meet at this place that day twelvemonth and to bring with them the earnings of the year they had hopes that thus by their united efforts a sum might be obtained sufficient to place their father once more in a state of independence with these hopes they separated and returned to their masters and mistresses chapter iv patty went to mrs crumpes to get her clothes which she had left there and to receive some months wages which were still due for her services after what had passed she had no idea that mrs crumpe would wish she should stay with her and she had heard of another place in monmouth which she believed would suit her in every respect the first person she saw when she arrived at the house of her late mistress was martha who with a hypocritical length of face said to her sad news sad news mrs patty the passion my lady was thrown into by your going away so sudden was of terrible detriment to her that very night she had a stroke of the palsy and has scarce spoke since dont take it to heart it is none of your fault dont take it to heart dear patty said betty the housemaid who was fond of patty what could you do but go to your brother here drink this water and dont blame yourself at all about the matter mistress had a stroke sixteen months ago afore ever you came into the house and i dare say shed have had this last whether you had stayed or gone here they were interrupted by the violent ringing of mrs crumpes bell they were in the room next to her and as she heard voices louder than usual she was impatient to know what was going on patty heard mrs martha answer as she opened her ladys door tis only patty frankland maam who is come for her clothes and her wages and she is very sorry to hear you have been so ill very sorry said betty following to the door bid her come in said mrs crumpe in a voice more distinct than she had ever been heard to speak in since the day of her illness what are you sorry for me child said mrs crumpe fixing her eyes upon pattys patty made no answer but it was plain how much she was shocked ay i see you are sorry for me said her mistress and so am i for you added she stretching out her hand and taking hold of pattys black gown you shall have a finer stuff than this for mourning for me but i know that is not what you are thinking of and thats the reason i have more value for you than for all the rest of them put together stay with me stay with me to nurse me you nurse me to my mind you cannot leave me in the way i am in now when i ask you to stay patty could not without inhumanity refuse she stayed with mrs crumpe who grew so dotingly fond of her that she could scarcely bear to have her a moment out of sight she would take neither food nor medicines but from pattys hand and she would not speak except in answer to pattys questions the fatigue and confinement she was now forced to undergo were enough to hurt the constitution of any one who had not very strong health patty bore them with the greatest patience and good humour indeed the consciousness that she was doing right supported her in exertions which would otherwise have been beyond her power she had still more difficult trials to go through mrs martha was jealous of her favour with her lady and often threw out hints that some people had much more luck and more cunning too than other people but that some people might perhaps be disappointed at last in their ends patty went on her own straight way without minding these insinuations at first but she was soon forced to attend to them mrs crumpes relations received intelligence from mrs martha that her lady was growing worse and worse every hour and that she was quite shut up under the dominion of an artful servantgirl who had gained such power over her that there was no knowing what the consequence might be mrs crumpes relations were much alarmed by this story they knew she had made a will in their favour some years before this time and they dreaded that patty should prevail upon her to alter it and should get possession herself of the fortune they were particularly struck with this idea because an instance of undue power acquired by a favourite servantmaid over her doting mistress happened about this period to be mentioned in an account of a trial in the newspapers of the day mrs crumpes nearest relations were two grandnephews the eldest was mr josiah crumpe a merchant who was settled at liverpool the youngest was that ensign bloomington whom we formerly mentioned he had been intended for a merchant but he would never settle to business and at last ran away from the countinghouse where he had been placed and went into the army he was an idle extravagant young man his greataunt was by fits very angry with him or very fond of him sometimes she would supply him with money at others she would forbid him her presence and declare he should never see another shilling of hers this had been her latest determination but ensign bloomington thought he could easily get into favour again and he resolved to force himself into the house mrs crumpe positively refused to see him the day after this refusal he returned with a reinforcement for which patty was not in the least prepared he was accompanied by miss sally bettesworth in a regimental ridinghabit jessy had been the original object of this gentlemans gallantry but she met with a new and richer lover and of course jilted him sally who was in haste to be married took undisguised pains to fix the ensign and she thought she was sure of him but to proceed with our story patty was told that a lady and gentleman desired to see her in the parlour she was scarcely in the room when sally began in a voice capable of intimidating the most courageous of scolds fine doings fine doings here you think you have the game in your own hands i warrant my lady paramount but im not one to be bullied you know of old nor am i one to be bullied i hope replied patty in a modest but firm voice will you be pleased to let me know in a quiet way what are your commands with me or my lady this gentleman here must see your lady as you call her to let you into a bit of a secret this gentleman and i is soon to be one so no wonder i stir in this affair and i never stir for nothing so it is as well for you to do it with fair words as foul without more preambling please to show this gentleman into his aunts room which sure he has the best right to see of any one in this world and if you prevent it in any species ill have the law of you and i take this respectable woman looking at mrs martha who came in with a salver of cakes and wine i take this here respectable gentlewoman to be my witness if you choose to refuse my husband that is to be admittance to his true and lawful nearest relation upon earth only say the doors are locked and that you wont let him in thats all we ask of you mrs patty paramount only say that afore this here witness indeed i shall say no such thing maam replied patty for it is not in the least my wish to prevent the gentleman from seeing my mistress it was she herself who refused to let him in and i think if he forces himself into the room she will be apt to be very much displeased but i shall not hinder him if he chooses to try there are the stairs and my ladys room is the first on the right hand only sir before you go up let me caution you lest you should startle her so as to be the death of her the least surprise or fright might bring on another stroke in an instant ensign bloomington and saucy sally now looked at one another as if at a loss how to proceed they retired to a window to consult and whilst they were whispering a coach drove up to the door it was full of mrs crumpes relations who came posthaste from monmouth in consequence of the alarm given by mrs martha mr josiah crumpe was not in the coach he had been written for but was not yet arrived from liverpool now it must be observed this coachfull of relations were all enemies to ensign bloomington and the moment they put their heads out of the carriagewindow and saw him standing in the parlour their surprise and indignation were too great for coherent utterance with all the rashness of prejudice they decided that he had bribed patty to let him in and to exclude them possessed with this idea they hurried out of the coach passed by poor patty who was standing in the hall and beckoned to mrs martha who showed them into the drawingroom and remained shut up with them there for some minutes she is playing us false cried saucy sally rushing out of the parlour i told you not to depend on that martha nor on nobody but me i said id force a way for you up to the room and so i have and now you have not the spirit to take your advantage theyll get in all of them before you and then where will you be and what will you be mrs crumpes bell rang violently and patty ran up stairs to her room i have been ringing for you patty this quarter of an hour what is all the disturbance i hear below your relations maam who wish to see you i hope you wont refuse to see them for they are very anxious very anxious to have me dead and buried not one of them cares a groat for me i have made my will tell them and they will see that in time i will not see one of them by this time they were all at the bedchamber door struggling which party should enter first saucy sallys loud voice was heard maintaining her right to be there as wife elect to ensign bloomington tell them the first who enters this room shall never see a shilling of my money cried mrs crumpe patty opened the door the disputants were instantly silent be pleased before you come in to hearken to what my mistress says maam will you say whatever you think proper yourself said patty for it is too hard for me to be suspected of putting words into your mouth and keeping your friends from the sight of you the first of them who comes into this room cried mrs crumpe raising her feeble voice to the highest pitch she was able the first who enters this room shall never see a shilling of my money and so on to the next and the next and the next ill see none of you no one ventured to enter their infinite solicitude to see how poor mrs crumpe found herself today suddenly vanished the two parties adjourned to the parlour and the drawingroom and there was nothing in which they agreed except in abusing patty they called for pen ink and paper and each wrote what they wished to say their notes were carried up by patty herself for mrs martha would not run the risk of losing her own legacy to oblige any of them though she had been bribed by all with much difficulty mrs crumpe was prevailed upon to look at the notes at last she exclaimed let them all come up all this moment tell them all they were in the room instantly all except saucy sally ensign bloomington persuaded her it was for the best that she should not appear patty was retiring as soon as she had shown them in but her mistress called to her and bade her take a key which she held in her hand and unlock an escritoir that was in the room she did so give me that parcel which is tied up with red tape and sealed with three seals said mrs crumpe all eyes were immediately fixed upon it for it was her will she broke the seals deliberately untied the red string opened the huge sheet of parchment and without saying one syllable tore it down the middle then tore the pieces again and again till they were so small that the writing could not be read the spectators looked upon one another in dismay ay you may all look as you please cried mrs crumpe im alive and in my sound senses still my moneys my own my propertys my own ill do what i please with it you were all handsomely provided for in this will but you could not wait for your legacies till i was under ground no you must come hovering over me like so many ravens it is not time yet it is not time yet the breath is not yet out of my body and when it is you shall none of you be the better for it i promise you my moneys my own my propertys my own ill make a new will tomorrow good bye to you all ive told you my mind not the most abject humiliations not the most artful caresses not the most taunting reproaches from any of the company could extort another word from mrs crumpe her disappointed and incensed relations were at last obliged to leave the house though not without venting their rage upon patty whom they believed to be the secret cause of all that had happened after they had left the house she went up to a garret where she thought no one would see her or hear her sat down on an old bedstead and burst into tears she had been much shocked by the scenes that had just passed and her heart wanted this relief oh thought she it is plain enough that it is not riches which make people happy here is this poor lady with heaps of money and fine clothes without any one in this whole world to love or care for her but all wishing her dead worried by her own relations and abused by them almost in her hearing upon her deathbed oh my poor brother how different it was with you pattys reflections were here interrupted by the entrance of martha who came and sat down on the bedstead beside her and with a great deal of hypocritical kindness in her manner began to talk of what had passed blaming mrs crumpes relations for being so hardhearted and inconsiderate as to force business upon her when she was in such a state indeed they have no one to thank but themselves for the new turn things have taken i hear my mistress has torn her will to atoms and is going to make a new one to be sure you mrs patty will be handsomely provided for in this as is i am sure becoming and i hope if you have an opportunity as for certain you will you wont forget to speak a good word for me patty who was disgusted by this interested and deceitful address answered she had nothing to do with her mistresss will and that her mistress was the best judge of what should be done with her own money which she did not covet mrs martha was not mistaken in her opinion that patty would be handsomely remembered in this new will mrs crumpe the next morning said to patty as she was giving her some medicine it is for your interest child that i should get through this day at least for if i live a few hours longer you will be the richest single woman in monmouthshire ill show them that all my moneys my own and that i can do what i please with my own go yourself to monmouth child as soon as you have plaited my cap and bring me the attorney your brother lives with to draw my new will dont say one word of your errand to any of my relations i charge you for your own sake as well as mine the harpies would tear you to pieces but ill show them that i can do what i please with my own thats the least satisfaction i can have for my money before i die god knows it has been plague enough to me all my life long but now before i die oh maam interrupted patty there is no need to talk of your dying now for i have not heard you speak so strong or so clear nor seem so much yourself this long time you may live yet and i hope you will to see many a good day and to make it up if i may be so bold to say it with all your relations which i am sure would be a great ease to your heart and i am sure they are very sorry to have offended you the girls a fool cried mrs crumpe why child dont you understand me yet i tell you as plain as i can speak i mean to leave the whole fortune to you well what makes you look so blank because maam indeed i have no wish to stand in any bodys way and would not for all the world do such an unjust thing as to take advantage of your being a little angry or so with your relations to get the fortune for myself for i can do having done all my life without fortune well enough but i could not do without my own good opinion and that of my father and brothers and sister all which i should lose if i was to be guilty of a mean thing so maam said patty i have made bold to speak the whole truth of my mind to you and i hope you will not do me an injury by way of doing me a favour i am sure i thank you with all my heart for your goodness to me patty turned away as she finished speaking for she was greatly moved you are a strange girl said mrs crumpe i would not have believed this if any one had sworn it to me go for the attorney as i bid you this minute i will have my own way when patty arrived at mr barlows she asked immediately for her brother frank whom she wished to consult but he was out and she then desired to speak to mr barlow himself she was shown into his office and she told him her business without any circumlocution with the plain language and ingenuous countenance of truth indeed sir said she i should be glad you would come directly to my mistress and speak to her yourself for she will mind what you say and i only hope she may do the just thing by her relations i dont want her fortune nor any part of it but a just recompense for my service knowing this in my own heart i forgive them for all the illwill they bear me it being all founded in a mistaken notion there was a gentleman in mr barlows office who was sitting at a desk writing a letter when patty came in she took him for one of the clerks whilst she was speaking he turned about several times and looked at her very earnestly at last he went to a clerk who was folding up some parchments and asked who she was he then sat down again to his writing without saying asingle word this gentleman was mr josiah crumpe the liverpool merchant mrs crumpes eldest nephew who had come to monmouth in consequence of the account he had heard of his aunts situation mr barlow had lately amicably settled a suit between him and one of his relations at monmouth and mr crumpe had just been signing the deed relative to this affair he was struck with the disinterestedness of pattys conduct but he kept silence that she might not find out who he was and that he might have full opportunity of doing her justice hereafter he was not one of the ravens as mrs crumpe emphatically called those who were hovering over her impatient for her death he had by his own skill and industry made himself not only independent but rich after patty was gone he with the true spirit of a british merchant declared that he was as independent in his sentiments as in his fortune that he would not crouch or fawn to man or woman peer or prince in his majestys dominions no not even to his own aunt he wished his old aunt crumpe he said to live and enjoy all she had as long as she could and if she chose to leave it to him after her death well and good he should be much obliged to her if she did not why well and good he should not be obliged to be obliged to her and that to his humour would perhaps be better still with these sentiments mr josiah crumpe found no difficulty in refraining from going to see or as he called it from paying his court to his aunt i have some choice west india sweetmeats here for the poor soul said he to mr barlow she gave me sweetmeats when i was a schoolboy which i dont forget i know she has a sweet tooth still in her head for she wrote to me last year to desire i would get her some but i did not relish the style of her letter and i never complied with the order however i was to blame she is an infirm poor creature and should be humoured now let her be ever so cross take her the sweetmeats but mind do not let her have a taste or a sight of them till she has made her will i do not want to bribe her to leave me her moneybags i thank my god and myself i want them not mr barlow immediately went to mrs crumpes as she had land to dispose of three witnesses were necessary to the will patty said she had two menservants who could write but to make sure of a third mr barlow desired that one of his clerks should accompany him frank was out so the eldest clerk went in his stead this clerks name was mason he was franks chief friend and a young man of excellent character he had never seen patty till this day but he had often heard her brother speak of her with so much affection that he was prepossessed in her favour even before he saw her the manner in which she spoke on the subject of mrs crumpes fortune quite charmed him for he was of an open and generous temper and said to himself i would rather have this girl for my wife without sixpence in the world than any woman i ever saw in my lifeif i could but afford itand if she was but a little prettier as it is however there is no danger of my falling in love with her so i may just indulge myself in the pleasure of talking to her besides it is but civil to lead my horse and walk a part of the way with franks sister accordingly mason set off to walk a part of the way to mrs crumpes with patty and they fell into conversation in which they were both so earnestly engaged that they did not perceive how time passed instead however of part of the way mason walked the whole way and he and patty were both rather surprised when they found themselves within sight of mrs crumpes house what a fine healthy colour this walking has brought into her face thought mason as he stood looking at her whilst they were waiting for some one to open the door though she has not a single beautiful feature and though nobody could call her handsome yet there is so much goodnature in her countenance that plain as she certainly is her looks are more pleasing to my fancy than those of many a beauty i have heard admired the door was now opened and mr barlow who had arrived some time summoned mason to business they went up to mrs crumpes room to take her instructions for her new will patty showed them in dont go child i will not have you stir said mrs crumpe now stand there at the foot of my bed and without hypocrisy tell me truly child your mind this gentleman who understands the law can assure you that in spite of all the relations upon earth i can leave my fortune to whom i please so do not let fear of my relations prevent you from being happy no madam interrupted patty it was not fear that made me say what i did to you this morning and it is not fear that keeps me in the same mind still i would not do what i thought wrong myself if nobody else in the whole world was to know it but since you desire me to say what i really wish i have a father who is in great distress and i should wish you would leave fifty pounds to him with such principles and feelings cried mr barlow you are happier than ten thousand a year could make you mason said nothing but his looks said a great deal and his master forgave him the innumerable blunders he made in drawing mrs crumpes will come mason give me up the pen whispered he at last you are not your own man i see and i like you the better for being touched with good and generous conduct but a truce with sentiment now i must be a mere man of law go you and take a walk to recover your legal senses the contents of mrs crumpes new will were kept secret patty did not in the least know how she had disposed of her fortune nor did mason for he had written only the preamble when his master compassionately took the pen from his hand contrary to expectation mrs crumpe continued to linger on for some months and during this time patty attended her with the most patient care and humanity though long habits of selfishness had rendered this lady in general indifferent to the feelings of her servants and dependants yet patty was an exception she often said to her child it goes against my conscience to keep you prisoner here the best days of your life in a sick room go out and take a walk with your brothers and sister i desire whenever they call for you these walks with her brothers and sister were very refreshing to patty especially when mason was of the party as he almost always contrived to be every day he grew more and more attached to patty for every day he became more and more convinced of the goodness of her disposition and the sweetness of her temper the affection which he saw her brothers and sister bore her spoke to his mind most strongly in her favour they have known her from her childhood thought he and cannot be deceived in her character tis a good sign that those who know her best love her most and her loving her pretty sister fanny as she does is a proof that she is incapable of envy and jealousy in consequence of these reflections mason determined he would apply diligently to his business that he might in due time be able to marry and support patty she ingenuously told him she had never seen the man she could love so well as himself but that her first object was to earn some money to release her father from the almshouse where she could not bear to see him living upon charity when amongst us all we have accomplished this said she it will be time enough for me to think of marrying duty first and love afterwards mason loved her the better when he found her so steady in her gratitude to her father for he was a man of sense and knew that so good a daughter and sister would in all probability make a good wife we must now give some account of what fanny has been doing all this time upon her return to mrs hungerfords after the death of her brother she was received with the greatest kindness by her mistress and by all the children who were really fond of her though she had never indulged them in anything that was contrary to their mothers wishes mrs hungerford had not forgotten the affair of the kettledrum one morning she said to her little son gustavus your curiosity about the kettledrum and the clarionet shall be satisfied your cousin philip will come here in a few days and he is well acquainted with the colonel of the regiment which is quartered in monmouth he shall ask the colonel to let us have the band here some day we may have them at the farthest end of the garden and you and your brothers and sisters shall dine in the arbour with fanny who upon this occasion particularly deserves to have a share in your amusement the cousin philip of whom mrs hungerford spoke was no other than franklands landlord young mr folingsby besides liking fine horses and fine curricles this gentleman was a great admirer of fine women he was struck with fannys beauty the first day he came to mrs hungerfords every succeeding day he thought her handsomer and handsomer and every day grew fonder and fonder of playing with his little cousins upon some pretence or other he contrived to be constantly in the room with them when fanny was there the modest propriety of her manners however kept him at that distance at which it was no easy matter for a pretty girl in her situation to keep such a gallant gentleman his intention when he came to mrs hungerfords was to stay but a week but when that week was at an end he determined to stay another he found his aunt hungerfords house uncommonly agreeable the moment she mentioned to him her wish of having the band of music in the garden he was charmed with the scheme and longed to dine out in the arbour with the children but he dared not press this point lest he should excite suspicion amongst other company who dined this day with mrs hungerford was a mrs cheviott a blind lady who took the liberty as she said to bring with her a young person who was just come to live with her as a companion this young person was jessy bettesworth or as she is henceforth to be called miss jessy bettesworth since her father had come in for captain bettesworths fortin her mother had spared no pains to push jessy forward in the world having no doubt that her beauty when well dressed would charm some great gentleman or may be some great lord accordingly jessy was dizened out in all sorts of finery her thoughts were wholly bent on fashions and flirting and her mothers vanity joined to her own nearly turned her brain just as this fermentation of folly was gaining force she happened to meet with ensign bloomington at a ball at monmouth he fell or she thought he fell desperately in love with her she of course coquetted with him indeed she gave him so much encouragement that every body concluded they were to be married she and her sister sally were continually seen walking arm in arm with him in the streets of monmouth and morning noon and night she wore the dropearrings of which he had made her a present it chanced however that jilting jessy heard an officer in her ensigns regiment swear she was pretty enough to be the captains lady instead of the ensigns and from that moment she thought no more of the ensign he was enraged to find himself jilted thus by a country girl and determined to have his revenge consequently he immediately transferred all his attentions to her sister sally judiciously calculating that from the envy and jealousy he had seen between the sisters this would be the most effectual mode of mortifying his perfidious fair jilting jessy said her sister was welcome to her castoff sweethearts and saucy sally replied her sister was welcome to be her bridemaid since with all her beauty and all her airs she was not likely to be a bride mrs bettesworth had always confessed that jessy was her favourite like a wise and kind mother she took part in all these disputes and set these amiable sisters yet more at variance by prophesying that her jessy would make the grandest match to put her into fortunes way mrs bettesworth determined to get her into some genteel family as companion to a lady mrs cheviotts housekeeper was nearly related to the bettesworths and to her mrs bettesworth applied but im afraid jessy is something too much of a flirt said the housekeeper for my mistress who is a very strict staid lady you know or at least we in monmouth know that jessy was greatly talked of about a young officer here in town i used myself to see her go trailing about with her muslin and pink and fine coloured shoes in the dirt oh thats all over now said mrs bettesworth the man was quite beneath her noticethats all over now he will do well enough for sally but maam my daughter jessy has quite laid herself out for goodness now and only wants to get into some house where she may learn to be a little genteel the housekeeper though she had not the highest possible opinion of the young lady was in hopes that since jessy had now laid herself out for goodness she might yet turn out well and considering that she was her relation she thought it her duty to speak in favour of miss bettesworth in consequence of her recommendation mrs cheviott took jessy into her family and jessy was particularly glad to be the companion of a blind lady she discovered the first day she spent with mrs cheviott that besides the misfortune of being blind she had the still greater misfortune of being inordinately fond of flattery jessy took advantage of this foible and imposed so far on the understanding of her patroness that she persuaded mrs cheviott into a high opinion of her judgment and prudence things were in this situation when jessy for the first time accompanied the blind lady to mrs hungerfords without having the appearance or manners of a gentlewoman miss jessy bettesworth was notwithstanding such a pretty showy girl that she generally contrived to attract notice she caught mr folingsbys eye at dinner as she was playing off her best airs at the sidetable and it was with infinite satisfaction that she heard him ask one of the officers as they were going out to walk in the garden who is that girl she has fine eyes and a most beautiful long neck upon the strength of this whisper jessy flattered herself she had made a conquest of mr folingsby by which idea she was so much intoxicated that she could scarcely restrain her vanity within decent bounds lord fanny frankland is it you who expected to meet you sitting here said she when to her great surprise she saw fanny in the arbour with the children to her yet greater surprise she soon perceived that mr folingsbys attention was entirely fixed upon fanny and that he became so absent he did not know he was walking upon the flowerborders jessy could scarcely believe her senses when she saw that her rival for as such she now considered her gave her lover no encouragement is it possible that the girl is such a fool as not to see that this here gentleman is in love with her no that is out of the nature of things oh its all artifice and i will find out her drift i warrant before long having formed this laudable resolution she took her measures well for carrying it into effect mrs cheviott being blind had few amusements she was extremely fond of music and one of mrs hungerfords daughters played remarkably well on the pianoforte this evening as mrs cheviott was listening to the young ladys singing jessy exclaimed oh maam how happy it would make you to hear such singing and music every day if she would come every day when my sister is practising with the musicmaster she might hear enough of it said little gustavus ill run and desire mamma to ask her because added he in a low voice if i was blind may be i should like it myself mrs hungerford who was goodnatured as well as polite pressed mrs cheviott to come whenever it should be agreeable to her the poor blind lady was delighted with the invitation and went regularly every morning to mrs hungerfords at the time the musicmaster attended jessy bettesworth always accompanied her for she could not go any where without a guide jessy had now ample opportunities of gratifying her malicious curiosity she saw or thought she saw that mr folingsby was displeased by the reserve of fannys manners and she renewed all her own coquettish efforts to engage his attention he amused himself sometimes with her in hopes of rousing fannys jealousy but he found that this expedient though an infallible one in ordinary cases was here totally unavailing his passion for fanny was increased so much by her unaffected modesty and by the daily proofs he saw of the sweetness of her disposition that he was no longer master of himself he plainly told her that he could not live without her thats a pity sir said fanny laughing and trying to turn off what he said as if it were only a jest it is a great pity sir that you cannot live without me for you know i cannot serve my mistress do my duty and live with you mr folingsby endeavoured to convince or rather to persuade her that she was mistaken and swore that nothing within the power of his fortune should be wanting to make her happy ah sir said she your fortune could not make me happy if i were to do what i know is wrong what would disgrace me for ever and what would break my poor fathers heart but your father shall never know any thing of the matter i will keep your secret from the whole world trust to my honour honour oh sir how can you talk to me of honour do you think i do not know what honour is because i am poor or do you think i do not set any value on mine though you do on yours would you not kill any man if you could in a duel for doubting of your honour and yet you expect me to love you at the very moment you show me most plainly how desirous you are to rob me of mine mr folingsby was silent for some moments but when he saw that fanny was leaving him he hastily stopped her and said laughing you have made me a most charming speech about honour and what is better still you looked most charmingly when you spoke it but now take time to consider what i i have said to you let me have your answer tomorrow and consult this book before you answer me i conjure you fanny took up the book as soon as mr folingsby had left the room and without opening it determined to return it immediately she instantly wrote a letter to mr folingsby which she was just wrapping up with the book in a sheet of paper when miss jessy bettesworth the blind lady and the musicmaster came into the room fanny went to set a chair for the blind lady and whilst she was doing so miss jessy bettesworth who had observed that fanny blushed when they came in slily peeped into the book which lay on the table between the first pages she opened there was a fivepound banknote she turned the leaf and found another and another and another at every leaf of these notes she counted oneandtwenty whilst fanny unsuspicious of what was doing behind her back was looking for the childrens musicbooks philip folingsby so so did he give you this book fanny frankland said jessy in a scornful tone it seems truly to be a very valuable performance and no doubt he had good reasons for giving it to you fanny coloured deeply at this unexpected speech and hesitated from the fear of betraying mr folingsby he did not give me the book he only lent it to me said she and i am going to return it to him directly oh no pray lend it to me first replied jessy in an ironical tone mr folingsby to be sure would lend it to me as soon as to you im growing as fond of reading as other folks lately continued she holding the book fast i dare say mr folingsby wouldmr folingsby would lend it to you i suppose said fanny colouring more and more deeply but as it is trusted to me now i must return it safe pray let me have it jessy oh yes return it madam safe i make no manner of doubt you will i make no manner of doubt you will replied jessy several times as she shook the book whilst the banknotes fell from between the leaves and were scattered upon the floor it is a thousand pities mrs cheviott you cant see what a fine book we have got full of banknotes but mrs hungerford is not blind at any rate it is to be hoped continued she turning to mrs hungerford who at this instant opened the door she stood in dignified amazement jessy had an air of malignant triumph fanny was covered with blushes but she looked with all the tranquillity of innocence the children gathered round her and blind mrs cheviott cried what is going on what is going on will nobody tell me what is going on jessy what is it you are talking about jessy about a very valuable book maam containing more than i can easily count in banknotes maam that mr folingsby has lent only lent maam she says to miss fanny frankland maam who was just going to return them to him maam when i unluckily took up the book and shook them all out upon the floor maam pick them up gustavus my dear said mrs hungerford coolly from what i know of fanny frankland i am inclined to believe that whatever she says is truth since she has lived with me i have never in the slightest instance found her deviate from the truth therefore i must entirely depend upon what she says oh yes mamma cried the children all together that i am sure you may come with me fanny resumed mrs hungerford it is not necessary that your explanation should be public though i am persuaded it will be satisfactory fanny was glad to escape from the envious eye of miss jessy bettesworth and felt much gratitude to mrs hungerford for this kindness and confidence but when she was to make her explanation fanny was in great confusion she dreaded to occasion a quarrel between mr folingsby and his aunt yet she knew not how to exculpate herself without accusing him why these blushes and tears and why this silence fanny said mrs hungerford after she had waited some minutes in expectation she would begin to speak are not you sure of justice from me and of protection both from slander and insult i am fond of my nephew it is true but i think myself obliged to you for the manner in which you have conducted yourself towards my children since you have had them under your care tell me then freely if you have any reason to complain of young mr folingsby oh madam said fanny thank you a thousand times for your goodness to me i do not indeed i do not wish to complain of any body and i would not for the world make mischief between you and your nephew i would rather leave your family at once and that continued the poor girl sobbing that is what i believe i had best nay is what i must and will do no fanny do not leave my house without giving me an explanation of what has passed this morning for if you do your reputation is at the mercy of miss jessy bettesworths malice heaven forbid said fanny with a look of real terror i must beg madam that you will have the kindness to return this book and these banknotes to mr folingsby and that you will give him this letter which i was just going to wrap up in the paper with the book when jessy bettesworth came in and found the banknotes which i had never seen these can make no difference in my answer to mr folingsby therefore i shall leave my letter just as it was first written if you please madam fannys letter was as follows sir i return the book which you left with me as nothing it contains can ever alter my opinion on the subject of which you spoke to me this morning i hope you will never speak to me again sir in the same manner consider sir that i am a poor unprotected girl if you go on as you have done lately i shall be obliged to leave good mrs hungerford who is my only friend oh where shall i find so good a friend my poor old father is in the almshouse and there he must remain till his children can earn money sufficient to support him do not fancy sir that i say this by way of begging from you i would not nor would he accept of any thing that you could offer him whilst in your present way of thinking pray sir have some compassion and do not injure those whom you cannot serve i am sir your humble servant fanny frankland mr folingsby was surprised and confounded when this letter and the book containing his banknotes were put into his hand by his aunt mrs hungerford told him by what means the book had been seen by miss jessy bettesworth and to what imputations it must have exposed fanny fanny is afraid of making mischief between you and me continued mrs hungerford and i cannot prevail upon her to give me an explanation which i am persuaded would be much to her honour then you have not seen this letter then she has decided without consulting you she is a charming girl cried mr folingsby and whatever you may think of me i am bound in justice to her to show you what she has written that will sufficiently explain how much i have been to blame and how well she deserves the confidence you place in her as he spoke mr folingsby rang the bell to order his horses i will return to town immediately continued he so fanny need not leave the house of her only friend to avoid me as to these banknotes keep them dear aunt she says her father is in great distress perhaps now that i am come to a right way of thinking she will not disdain my assistance give her the money when and how you think proper i am sure i cannot make a better use of a hundred guineas and wish i had never thought of making a worse mr folingsby returned directly to town and his aunt thought he had in some measure atoned for his fault by his candour and generosity miss jessy bettesworth waited all this time with malicious impatience to hear the result of fannys explanation with mrs hungerford how painfully was she surprised and disappointed when mrs hungerford returned to the company to hear her speak in the highest terms of fanny oh mamma cried little gustavus clapping his hands i am glad you think her good because we all think so and i should be very sorry indeed if she was to go away especially in disgrace there is no danger of that my dear said mrs hungerford she shall never leave my house as long as she desires to stay in it i do not give or withdraw my protection without good reasons miss jessy bettesworth bit her lips her face which nature intended to be beautiful became almost ugly envy and malice distorted her features and when she departed with mrs cheviott her humiliated appearance was a strong contrast to the air of triumph with which she had entered chapter v after jessy and mrs cheviott had left the room one of the little girls exclaimed i dont like that miss bettesworth for she asked me whether i did not wish that fanny was gone because she refused to let me have a peach that was not ripe i am sure i wish fanny may always stay here there was a person in the room who seemed to join most fervently in this wish this was mr reynolds the drawingmaster for some time his thoughts had been greatly occupied by fanny at first he was struck with her beauty but he had discovered that mr folingsby was in love with her and had carefully attended to her conduct resolving not to offer himself till he was sure on a point so serious her modesty and prudence fixed his affections and he now became impatient to declare his passion he was a man of excellent temper and character and his activity and talents were such as to ensure independence to a wife and family mrs hungerford though a proud was not a selfish woman she was glad that mr reynolds was desirous to obtain fanny though she was sorry to part with one who was so useful in her family fanny had now lived with her nearly two years and she was much attached to her a distant relation about this time left her five children a small legacy of ten guineas each gustavus though he had some ambition to be master of a watch was the first to propose that this legacy should be given to fanny his brothers and sisters applauded the idea and mrs hungerford added fifty guineas to their fifty i had put by this money said she to purchase a lookingglass for my drawingroom but it will be much better applied in rewarding one who has been of real service to my children fanny was now mistress of two hundred guineas a hundred given to her by mr folingsby fifty by mrs hungerford and fifty by the children her joy and gratitude were extreme for with this money she knew she could relieve her father this was the first wish of her heart and it was a wish in which her lover so eagerly joined that she smiled on him and said now i am sure you really love me let us go to your father directly said mr reynolds let me be present when you give him this money you shall said fanny but first i must consult my sister patty and my brothers for we must all go together that is our agreement the first day of next month is my fathers birthday and on that day we are all to meet at the almshouse what a happy day it will be but what has james been about all this time how has he gone on with his master mr cleghorn the haberdasher during the eighteen months that james had spent in mr cleghorns shop he never gave his master the slightest reason to complain of him on the contrary this young man made his employers interests his own and consequently completely deserved his confidence it was not however always easy to deal with mr cleghorn for he dreaded to be flattered yet could not bear to be contradicted james was very near losing his favour for ever upon the following occasion one evening when it was nearly dusk and james was just shutting up shop a strangelooking man prodigiously corpulent and with huge pockets to his coat came in he leaned his elbows on the counter opposite to james and stared him full in the face without speaking james swept some loose money off the counter into the till the stranger smiled as if purposely to show him this did not escape his quick eye there was in his countenance an expression of roguery and humour the humour seemed to be affected the roguery natural what are you pleased to want sir said james a glass of brandy and your master my master is not at home sir and we have no brandy you will find brandy i believe at the house over the way i believe i know where to find brandy a little better than you do and better brandy than you ever tasted or the devils in it replied the stranger i want none of your brandy i only asked for it to try what sort of a chap you were so you dont know who i am no sir not in the least no never heard of admiral tipsey where do you come from never heard of admiral tipsey whose noble paunch is worth more than a laplander could reckon cried he striking the huge rotundity he praised let me into this back parlour ill wait there till your master comes home sir you cannot possibly go into that parlour there is a young lady mr cleghorns daughter sir at tea in that room she must not be disturbed said james holding the lock of the parlour door he thought the stranger was either drunk or pretending to be drunk and contended with all his force to prevent him from getting into the parlour whilst they were struggling mr cleghorn came home heyday whats the matter o admiral is it you said mr cleghorn in a voice of familiarity that astonished james let us by james you dont know the admiral admiral tipsey was a smuggler he had the command of two or three smuggling vessels and thereupon created himself an admiral a dignity which few dared to dispute with him whilst he held his oak stick in his hand as to the name of tipsey no one could be so unjust as to question his claim to it for he was never known to be perfectly sober during a whole day from one years end to another to jamess great surprise the admiral after he had drunk one dish of tea unbuttoned his waistcoat from top to bottom and deliberately began to unpack his huge false corpulence round him were wound innumerable pieces of lace and fold after fold of fine cambric when he was completely unpacked it was difficult to believe that he was the same person he looked so thin and shrunk he then called for some clean straw and began to stuff himself out again to what he called a passable size did not i tell you young man i carried that under my waistcoat which would make a fool stare the lace thats on the floor to say nothing of the cambric is worth full twice the sum for which you shall have it cleghorn good night ill call again tomorrow to settle our affairs but dont let your young man here shut the door as he did today in the admirals face here is a cravat for you notwithstanding continued he turning to james and throwing him a piece of very fine cambric i must list you in admiral tipseys service james followed him to the door and returned the cambric in despite of all his entreaties that he would wear it or sell it for the admirals sake so james said mr cleghorn when the smuggler was gone you do not seem to like our admiral i know nothing of him sir except that he is a smuggler and for that reason i do not wish to have any thing to do with him i am sorry for that said mr cleghorn with a mixture of shame and anger in his countenance my conscience is as nice as other peoples and yet i have a notion i shall have something to do with him though he is a smuggler and if i am not mistaken shall make a deal of money by him i have not had any thing to do with smugglers yet but i see many in monmouth who are making large fortunes by their assistance there is our neighbour mr raikes what a rich man he is become and why should i or why should you be more scrupulous than others many gentlemen ay gentlemen in the country are connected with them and why should a shopkeeper be more conscientious than they speak i must have your opinion with all the respect due to his master james gave it as his opinion that it would be best to have nothing to do with admiral tipsey or with any of the smugglers he observed that men who carried on an illicit trade and who were in the daily habit of cheating or of taking false oaths could not be safe partners even putting morality out of the question he remarked that the smuggling trade was a sort of gaming by which one year a man might make a deal of money and another might be ruined upon my word said mr cleghorn in an ironical tone you talk very wisely for so young a man pray where did you learn all this wisdom from my father sir from whom i learned every thing that i know every thing that is good i mean i had an uncle once who was ruined by his dealings with smugglers and who would have died in jail if it had not been for my father i was but a young lad at the time this happened but i remember my father saying to me the day my uncle was arrested when my aunt and all the children were crying take warning by this my dear james you are to be in trade some day or other yourself never forget that honesty is the best policy the fair trader will always have the advantage at the long run well well no more of this interrupted mr cleghorn good night to you you may finish the rest of your sermon against smugglers to my daughter there whom it seems to suit better than it pleases me the next day when mr cleghorn went into the shop he scarcely spoke to james except to find fault with him this he bore with patience knowing that he meant well and that his master would recover his temper in time so the parcels were all sent and the bills made out as i desired said mr cleghorn you are not in the wrong there you know what you are about james very well but why should not you deal openly by me according to your fathers maxim that honesty is the best policy why should not you fairly tell me what were your secret views in the advice you gave me about admiral tipsey and the smugglers i have no secret views sir said james with a look of such sincerity that his master could not help believing him nor can i guess what you mean by secret views if i consulted my own advantage instead of yours i should certainly use all my influence with you in favour of this smuggler for here is a letter which i received from him this morning hoping for my friendship and enclosing a ten pound note which i returned to him mr cleghorn was pleased by the openness and simplicity with which james told him all this and immediately throwing aside the reserve of his manner said james i beg your pardon i see i have misunderstood you i am convinced you were not acting like a double dealer in the advice you gave me last night it was my daughters colouring so much that led me astray i did to be sure think you had an eye to her more than to me in what you said but if you had i am sure you would tell me so fairly james was at a loss to comprehend how the advice that he gave concerning admiral tipsey and the smugglers could relate to miss cleghorn except so far as it related to her father he waited in silence for a farther explanation you dont know then continued mr cleghorn that admiral tipsey as he calls himself is able to leave his nephew young raikes more than i can leave my daughter it is his whim to go about dressed in that strange way in which you saw him yesterday and it is his diversion to carry on the smuggling trade by which he has made so much but he is in reality a rich old fellow and has proposed that i should marry my daughter to his nephew now you begin to understand me i see the lad is a smart lad he is to come here this evening dont prejudice my girl against him not a word more against smugglers before her i beg you shall be obeyed sir said james his voice altered and he turned pale as he spoke circumstances which did not escape mr cleghorns observation young raikes and his uncle the rich smuggler paid their visit miss cleghorn expressed a decided dislike to both uncle and nephew her father was extremely provoked and in the height of his anger declared he believed she was in love with james frankland that he was a treacherous rascal and that he should leave the house within three days if his daughter did not before that time consent to marry the man he had chosen for her husband it was in vain that his daughter endeavoured to soften her fathers rage and to exculpate poor james by protesting he had never directly or indirectly attempted to engage her affections neither had he ever said one syllable that could prejudice her against the man whom her father recommended mr cleghorns high notions of subordination applied on this occasion equally to his daughter and to his foreman he considered them both as presumptuous and ungrateful and said to himself as he walked up and down the room in a rage my foreman to preach to me indeed i thought what he was about all the time but it shant doit shant do my daughter shall do as i bid her or ill know why have not i been all my life making a fortune for her and now she wont do as i bid her she would if this fellow were out of the house and out he shall go in three days if she does not come to her senses i was cheated by my last shopman out of my money i wont be duped by this fellow out of my daughter no no off he shall trudge a shopman indeed to think of his masters daughter without his consent what insolence what the times are come to such a thing could not have been done in my days i never thought of my masters daughter ill take my oath and then the treachery of the rascal to carry it all on so slily i could forgive him anything but that for that he shall go out of this house in three days as sure as he and i are alive if this young lady does not give him up before that time passion so completely deafened mr cleghorn that he would not listen to james who assured him he had never for one moment aspired to the honour of marrying his daughter can you deny that you love her can you deny cried mr cleghorn that you turned pale yesterday when you said i should be obeyed james could not deny either of these charges but he firmly persisted in asserting that he had been guilty of no treachery that he had never attempted secretly to engage the young ladys affections and that on the contrary he was sure she had no suspicion of his attachment it is easy to prove all this to me by persuading my girl to do as i bid her prevail on her to marry mr raikes and all is well that is out of my power sir replied james i have no right to interfere and will not indeed i am sure i should betray myself if i were to attempt to say a word to miss cleghorn in favour of another man that is a task i could not undertake even if i had the highest opinion of this mr raikes but i know nothing concerning him and therefore should do wrong to speak in his favour merely to please you i am sorry very sorry sir that you have not the confidence in me which i hoped i had deserved but the time will come when you will do me justice the sooner i leave you now i believe the better you will be satisfied and far from wishing to stay three days i do not desire to stay three minutes in your house sir against your will mr cleghorn was touched by the feeling and honest pride with which james spoke do as i bid you sir said he and neither more nor lessstay out your three days and may be in that time this saucy girl may come to reason if she does not know you love her you are not so much to blame the three days passed away and the morning came on which james was to leave his master the young lady persisted in her resolution not to marry mr raikes and expressed much concern at the injustice with which james was treated on her account she offered to leave home and spend some time with an aunt who lived in the north of england she did not deny that james appeared to her the most agreeable young man she had seen but added she could not possibly have any thoughts of marrying him because he had never given her the least reason to believe that he was attached to her mr cleghorn was agitated yet positive in his determination that james should quit the house james went into his masters room to take leave of him so then you are really going said mr cleghorn you have buckled that portmanteau of yours like a blockhead ill do it better stand aside so you are positively going why this is a sad thing but then it is a thing as your own sense and honour tell youit is a thing mr cleghorn took snuff at every pause of his speech but even this could not carry him through it when he pronounced the words it is a thing that must be done the tears fairly started from his eyes now this is ridiculous resumed he in my days in my younger days i mean a man could part with his foreman as easily as he could take off his glove i am sure my master would as soon have thought of turning bankrupt as of shedding a tear at parting with me and yet i was as good a foreman in my day as another not so good a one as you are to be sure but it is no time now to think of your goodness well what do we stand here for when a thing is to be done the sooner it is done the better shake hands before you go mr cleghorn put into jamess hand a fifty pound note and a letter of recommendation to a liverpool merchant james left the house without taking leave of miss cleghorn who did not think the worse of him for his want of gallantry his master had taken care to recommend him to an excellent house in liverpool where his salary would be nearly double that which he had hitherto received but james was notwithstanding very sorry to leave monmouth where his dear brother sister and father livedto say nothing of miss cleghorn late at night james was going to the inn at which the liverpool stage set up where he was to sleep as he passed through a street that leads down to the river wye he heard a great noise of men quarrelling violently the moon shone bright and he saw a party of men who appeared to be fighting in a boat that was just come to shore he asked a person who came out of the publichouse and who seemed to have nothing to do with the fray what was the matter only some smugglers who are quarrelling with one another about the division of their booty said the passenger who walked on eager to get out of their way james also quickened his pace but presently heard the cry of murder murder help help and then all was silence a few seconds afterwards he thought that he heard groans he could not forbear going to the spot whence the groans proceeded in hopes of being of some service to a fellowcreature by the time he got thither the groans had ceased he looked about but could only see the men in the boat who were rowing fast down the river as he stood on the shore listening he for some minutes heard no sound but that of their oars but afterwards a man in the boat exclaimed with a terrible oath there he is there he is all alive again we have not done him business dn it hell do ours the boatmen rowed faster away and james again heard the groans though they were now much feebler than before he searched and found the wounded man who having been thrown overboard had with great difficulty swam to shore and fainted with the exertion as soon as he reached the land when he came to his senses he begged james for mercys sake to carry him into the next publichouse and to send for a surgeon to dress his wounds the surgeon came examined them and declared his fears that the poor man could not live fourandtwenty hours as soon as he was able to speak intelligibly he said he had been drinking with a party of smugglers who had just brought in some fresh brandy and that they had quarrelled violently about a keg of contraband liquor he said that he could swear to the man who gave him the mortal wound the smugglers were pursued immediately and taken when they were brought into the sick mans room james beheld amongst them three persons whom he little expected to meet in such a situation idle isaac wild will and bullying bob the wounded man swore positively to their persons bullying bob was the person who gave him the fatal blow but wild will began the assault and idle isaac shoved him overboard they were all implicated in the guilt and instead of expressing any contrition for their crime began to dispute about which was most to blame they appealed to james and as he would be subpoenaed on their trial each endeavoured to engage him in his favour idle isaac took him aside and said to him you have no reason to befriend my brothers i can tell you a secret they are the greatest enemies your family ever had it was they who set fire to your fathers hayrick will was provoked by your sister fannys refusing him so he determined as he told me to carry her off and he meant to have done so in the confusion that was caused by the fire but bob and he quarrelled the very hour that she was to have been carried off so that part of the scheme failed now i had no hand in all this being fast asleep in my bed so i have more claim to your good word at any rate than my brothers can have and so when we come to trial i hope youll speak to my character wild will next tried his eloquence as soon as he found that his brother isaac had betrayed the secret he went to james and assured him the mischief that had been done was a mere accident that it was true he had intended for the frolics sake to raise a cry of fire in order to draw fanny out of the house but that he was shocked when he found how the jest ended as to bullying bob he brazened the matter out declaring he had been affronted by the franklands and that he was glad he had taken his revenge of them that if the thing was to be done over again he would do it that james might give him what character he pleased upon trial for that a man could be hanged but once such were the absurd bravadoing speeches he made while he had an alehouse audience round him to admire his spirit but a few hours changed his tone he and his brothers were taken before a magistrate till the committal was actually made out they had hopes of being bailed they had despatched a messenger to admiral tipsey whose men they called themselves and expected he would offer bail for them to any amount but the bail of their friend admiral tipsey was not deemed sufficient by the magistrate in the first place i could not bail these men and if i could do you think it possible said the magistrate i could take the bail of such a man as that i understood that he was worth a deal of money whispered james you are mistaken sir said the magistrate he is what he deserves to be a ruined man i have good reasons for knowing this he has a nephew a mr raikes who is a gamester whilst the uncle has been carrying on the smuggling trade here at the hazard of his life the nephew who was bred up at oxford to be a fine gentleman has gamed away all the money his uncle has made during twenty years by his contraband traffic at the long run these fellows never thrive tipsey is not worth a groat james was much surprised by this information and resolved to return immediately to mr cleghorn to tell him what he had heard and put him on his guard early in the morning he went to his houseyou look as if you were not pleased to see me again said he to mr cleghorn and perhaps you will impute what i am going to say to bad motives but my regard to you sir determines me to acquaint you with what i have heard you will make what use of the information you please james then related what had passed at the magistrates and when mr cleghorn had heard all that he had to say he thanked him in the strongest manner for this instance of his regard and begged he would remain in monmouth a few days longer alarmed by the information he received from james mr cleghorn privately made inquiries concerning young raikes and his uncle the distress into which the young man had plunged himself by gambling had been kept a profound secret from his relations it was easy to deceive them as to his conduct because his time had been spent at a distance from them he had but just returned home after completing his education the magistrate from whom james first heard of his extravagance happened to have a son at oxford who gave him this intelligence he confirmed all he had said to mr cleghorn who trembled at the danger to which he had exposed his daughter the match with young raikes was immediately broken off and all connexion with admiral tipsey and the smugglers was for ever dissolved by mr cleghorn his gratitude to james was expressed with all the natural warmth of his character come back and live with me said he you have saved me and my daughter from ruin you shall not be my shopman any longer you shall be my partner and you know when you are my partner there can be nothing said against your thinking of my daughter but all in good time i would not have seen the girl again if she had married my shopman but my partner will be quite another thing you have worked your way up in the world by your own deserts and i give you joy i believe now its over it would have gone nigh to break my heart to part with you but you must be sensible i was right to keep up my authority in my own family now things are changed i give my consent nobody has a right to say a word when i am pleased with my daughters choice that is enough theres only one thing that goes against my pride your father oh sir interrupted james if you are going to say any thing disrespectful of my father do not say it to me i beseech you do not for i cannot bear it indeed i cannot and will not he is the best of fathers i am sure he has the best of children and a greater blessing there cannot be in this world i was not going to say any thing disrespectful of him i was only going to lament that he should be in an almshouse said mr cleghorn he has determined to remain there said james till his children have earned money enough to support him without hurting themselves i my brother and both my sisters are to meet at the almshouse on the first day of next month which is my fathers birthday then we shall join all our earnings together and see what can be done remember you are my partner said mr cleghorn on that day you must take me along with you my goodwill is part of your earnings and my goodwill shall never be shown merely in words chapter vi it is now time to give some account of the bettesworth family the history of their indolence extravagance quarrels and ruin shall be given as shortly as possible the fortune left to them by captain bettesworth was nearly twenty thousand pounds when they got possession of this sum they thought it could never be spent and each individual of the family had separate plans of extravagance for which they required separate supplies old bettesworth in his youth had seen a house of squire somebody which had struck his imagination and he resolved he would build just such another this was his favourite scheme and he was delighted with the thoughts that it would be realized his wife and his sons opposed the plan merely because it was his and consequently he became more obstinately bent upon having his own way as he said for once in his life he was totally ignorant of building and no less incapable from his habitual indolence of managing workmen the house might have been finished for one thousand five hundred pounds it cost him two thousand pounds and when it was done the roof let in the rain in sundry places the new ceilings and cornices were damaged so that repairs and a new roof with leaden gutters and leaden statues cost him some additional hundreds the furnishing of the house mrs bettesworth took upon herself and sally took upon herself to find fault with every article that her mother bought the quarrels were loud bitter and at last irreconcilable there was a lookingglass which the mother wanted to have in one room and the daughter insisted upon putting it into another the lookingglass was broken between them in the heat of battle the blame was laid on sally who in a rage declared she would not and could not live in the house with her mother her mother was rejoiced to get rid of her and she went to live with a lieutenants lady in the neighbourhood with whom she had been acquainted three weeks and two days half by scolding half by cajoling her father she prevailed upon him to give her two thousand pounds for her fortune promising never to trouble him any more for any thing as soon as she was gone mrs bettesworth gave a housewarming as she called it to all her acquaintance a dinner a ball and a supper in her new house the house was not half dry and all the company caught cold mrs bettesworths cold was the most severe it happened at this time to be the fashion to go almost without clothes and as this lady was extremely vain and fond of dress she would absolutely appear in the height of fashion the sunday after her ball whilst she had still the remains of a bad cold she positively would go to church equipped in one petticoat and a thin muslin gown that she might look as young as her daughter jessy every body laughed and jessy laughed more than any one else but in the end it was no laughing matter mrs bettesworth caught her death of cold she was confined to her bed on monday and was buried the next sunday jessy who had a great notion that she should marry a lord if she could but once get into company with one went to live with blind mrs cheviott where according to her mothers instructions she laid herself out for goodness she also took two thousand pounds with her upon her promise never to trouble her father more her brothers perceived how much was to be gained by tormenting a father who gave from weakness and not from a sense of justice or a feeling of kindness and they soon rendered themselves so troublesome that he was obliged to buy off their reproaches idle isaac was a sportsman and would needs have a pack of hounds they cost him two hundred a year then he would have racehorses and by them he soon lost some thousands he was arrested for the money and his father was forced to pay it bob and will soon afterwards began to think it was very hard that so much was to be done for isaac and nothing for them wild will kept a mistress and bullying bob was a cockfighter their demands for money were frequent and unconscionable and their continual plea was why isaac lost a thousand by his racehorses and why should not we have our share the mistress and the cockpit had their share and the poor old father at last had only one thousand left he told his sons this with tears in his eyes i shall die in a jail after all said he they listened not to what he said for they were intent upon the banknotes of this last thousand which were spread upon the table before him will half in jest half in earnest snatched up a parcel of the notes and bob insisted on dividing the treasure will fled out of the house bob pursued him and they fought at the end of their own avenue this was on the day that frankland and his family were returning from poor georges funeral and saw the battle betwixt the brothers they were shamed into a temporary reconciliation and soon afterwards united against their father whom they represented to all the neighbours as the most cruel and the most avaricious of men because he would not part with the very means of subsistence to supply their profligacy whilst their minds were in this state will happened to become acquainted with a set of smugglers whose disorderly life struck his fancy he persuaded his brothers to leave home with him and to list in the service of admiral tipsey their manners then became more brutal and they thought felt and lived like men of desperate fortunes the consequence we have seen in a quarrel about a keg of brandy at an alehouse their passions got the better of them and on entering their boat they committed the offence for which they were now imprisoned mr barlow was the attorney to whom they applied and they endeavoured to engage him to manage their cause on their trial but he absolutely refused from the moment he heard from james that will and bob bettesworth were the persons who set fire to franklands haystack he urged frank to prosecute them for this crime when you only suspected them my dear frank i strongly dissuaded you from going to law but now you cannot fail to succeed and you will recover ample damages that is impossible my dear sir replied frank for the bettesworths i understand are ruined i am sorry for that on your account but i still think you ought to carry on this prosecution for the sake of public justice such pests of society should not go unpunished they will probably be punished sufficiently for this unfortunate assault for which they are now to stand their trial i cannot in their distress revenge either my own or my fathers wrongs i am sure he would be sorry if i did for i have often and often heard him say never trample upon the fallen you are a good generous young man cried mr barlow and no wonder you love the father who inspired you with such sentiments and taught you such principles but what a shame it is that such a father should be in an almshouse you say he will not consent to be dependent upon any one and that he will not accept of relief from any but his own children this is pride but it is an honourable species of pride fit for an english yeoman i cannot blame it but my dear frank tell your father he must accept of your friends credit as well as of yours your credit with me is such that you may draw upon me for five hundred pounds whenever you please no thanks my boy half the money i owe you for your services as my clerk and the other half is well secured to me by the certainty of your future diligence and success in business you will be able to pay me in a year or two so i put you under no obligation remember i will take your bond for half the money if that will satisfy you and your proud father the manner in which this favour was conferred touched frank to the heart he had a heart which could be strongly moved by kindness he was beginning to express his gratitude when mr barlow interrupted him with come come why do we waste our time here talking sentiment when we ought to be writing law here is work to be done which requires some expedition a marriage settlement to be drawn guess for whom frank guessed all the probable matches amongst his monmouth acquaintance but he was rather surprised when told that the bridegroom was to be young mr folingsby as it was scarcely two months since this gentleman was in love with fanny frankland frank proceeded to draw the settlement whilst he and mr barlow were writing they were interrupted by the entrance of mr josiah crumpe he came to announce mrs crumpes death and to request mr barlows attendance at the opening of her will this poor lady had lingered out many months longer than it was thought she could possibly live and during all her sufferings patty with indefatigable goodness and temper bore with the caprice and peevishness of disease those who thought she acted merely from interested motives expected to find she had used her power over her mistresss mind entirely for her own advantage they were certain a great part of the fortune would be left to her mrs crumpes relations were so persuaded of this that when they were assembled to hear her will read by mr barlow they began to say to one another in whispers well set the will aside well bring her into the courts mrs crumpe was not in her right senses when she made this will she had received two paralytic strokes we can prove that we can set aside the will mr josiah crumpe was not one of these whisperers he set apart from them leaning on his oaken stick in silence mr barlow broke the seals of the will opened it and read it to the eager company they were much astonished when they found that the whole fortune was left to mr josiah crumpe the reason for this bequest was given in these words mr josiah crumpe being the only one of my relations who did not torment me for my money even upon my deathbed i trust that he will provide suitably for that excellent girl patty frankland on this head he knows my wishes by her own desire i have not myself left her any thing i have only bequeathed fifty pounds for the use of her father mr josiah crumpe was the only person who heard unmoved the bequest that was made to him the rest of the relations were clamorous in their reproaches or hypocritical in their congratulations all thoughts of setting aside the will were however abandoned every legal form had been observed and with a technical nicety that precluded all hopes of successful litigation mr crumpe arose as soon as the tumult of disappointment had somewhat subsided and counted with his oaken stick the numbers that were present here are ten of you i think well you every soul of you hate me but that is nothing to the purpose i shall keep up to the notion i have of the character of a true british merchant for my own sakenot for yours i dont want this womans money i have enough of my own and of my own honest making without legacy hunting why did you torment the dying woman you would have been better off if you had behaved better but thats over now a thousand pounds apiece you shall have from me deducting fifty pounds which you must each of you give to that excellent girl patty frankland i am sure you must be all sensible of your injustice to her fully aware that it was their interest to oblige mr crumpe they now vied with each other in doing justice to patty some even declared they had never had any suspicions of her and others laid the blame on the false representations and information which they said they had had from the mischiefmaking mrs martha they very willingly accepted of a thousand pounds apiece and the fifty pounds deduction was paid as a tax by each to pattys merit mistress now of five hundred pounds she exclaimed oh my dear father you shall no longer live in an almshouse tomorrow will be the happiest day of my life i dont know how to thank you as i ought sir continued she turning to her benefactor you have thanked me as you ought and as i like best said this plainspoken merchant and now let us say no more about it in obedience to mr crumpes commands patty said no more to him but she was impatient to tell her brother frank and her lover mr mason of her good fortune she therefore returned to monmouth with mr barlow in hopes of seeing them immediately but frank was not at work at the marriage settlement soon after mr barlow left him he was summoned to attend the trial of the bettesworths these unfortunate young men depending on franks good nature well knowing he had refused to prosecute them for setting fire to his fathers hayrick thought they might venture to call upon him to give them a good character consider dear frank said will bettesworth a good word from one of your character might do a great deal for us you were so many years our neighbour if you would only just say that we were never counted wild idle quarrelsome fellows to your knowledge will you how can i do that said frank or how could i be believed if i did when it is so well known in the countryforgive me at such a time as this i cannot mean to taunt you but it is well known in the country that you were called wild will bullying bob and idle isaac theres the rub said the attorney who was employed for the bettesworths this will come out in open court and the judge and jury will think a great deal of it oh mr frank mr frank cried old bettesworth have pity upon us speak in favour of these boys of mine think what a disgrace it is to me in my old age to have my sons brought this way to a public trial and if they should be transported oh mr frank say what you can for them you were always a good young man and a goodnatured young man frank was moved by the entreaties and tears of the unhappy father but his goodnature could not make him consent to say what he knew to be false do not call me to speak to their characters upon this trial said he i cannot say any thing that would serve them i shall do them more harm than good still they had hopes his goodnature would at the last moment prevail over his sense of justice and they summoned him well sir said bettesworths counsel you appear in favour of the prisoners you have known them i understand from their childhood and your own character is such that whatever you say in their favour will doubtless make a weighty impression upon the jury the court was silent in expectation of what frank should say he was so much embarrassed betwixt his wish to serve his old neighbours and playfellows and his dread of saying what he knew to be false that he could not utter a syllable he burst into tears footnote this is drawn from real life this evidence is most strongly against the prisoners whispered a juryman to his fellows the verdict was brought in at lastguiltysentencetransportation as the judge was pronouncing this sentence old bettesworth was carried out of the court he had dropped senseless ill as his sons had behaved to him he could not sustain the sight of their utter disgrace and ruin when he recovered his senses he found himself sitting on the stone bench before the courthouse supported by frank many of the townspeople had gathered round but regardless of every thing but his own feelings the wretched father exclaimed in a voice of despair i have no children left me in my old age my sons are gone and where are my daughters at such a time as this why are not they near their poor old father have they no touch of natural affection in them no they have none and why should they have any for me i took no care of them when they were young no wonder they take none of me now i am old ay neighbour frankland was right he brought up his children in the way they should go now he has the credit and the comfort of them and see what mine are come to they bring their fathers grey hairs with sorrow to the grave the old man wept bitterly then looking round him he again asked for his daughters surely they are in the town and it cannot be much trouble to them to come to me even these strangers who have never seen me before pity me but my own have no feeling no not for one another do these girls know the sentence that has been passed upon their brothers where are they where are they jessy at least might be near me at such a time as this i was always an indulgent father to jessy there were people present who knew what was become of jessy but they would not tell the news to her father at this terrible moment two of mrs cheviotts servants were in the crowd and one of them whispered to frank you had best sir prevail on this poor old man to go to his home and not to ask for his daughter he will hear the bad news soon enough frank persuaded the father to go home to his lodgings and did every thing in his power to comfort him but alas the old man said too truly there is no happiness left for me in this world what a curse it is to have bad children my children have broken my heart and it is all my own fault i took no care of them when they were young and they take no care of me now i am old but tell me have you found out what is become of my daughter frank evaded the question and begged the old man to rest in peace this night he seemed quite exhausted by grief and at last sunk into a sort of stupefaction it could hardly be called sleep frank was obliged to return home to proceed with his business for mr barlow and he was glad to escape from the sight of misery which however he might pity he could not relieve it was happy indeed for frank that he had taken his fathers advice and had early broken off all connexion with jilting jessy after duping others she at length had become a greater dupe she had this morning gone off with a common serjeant with whom she had fallen suddenly and desperately in love he cared for nothing but her two thousand pounds and to complete her misfortune was a man of bad character whose extravagance and profligacy had reduced him to the sad alternative of either marrying for money or going to jail as for sally she was at this instant far from all thoughts either of her father or her brothers she was in the heat of a scolding match which terminated rather unfortunately for her matrimonial schemes ensign bloomington had reproached her with having forced him into his aunts room when she had absolutely refused to see him and thus being the cause of his losing a handsome legacy irritated by this charge the lady replied in no very gentle terms words ran high and so high at last that the gentleman finished by swearing that he would sooner marry the devil than such a vixen the match was thus broken off to the great amusement of all saucy sallys acquaintance her illhumour had made her hated by all the neighbours so that her disappointment at the loss of the ensign was embittered by their malicious raillery and by the prophecy which she heard more than whispered from all sides that she would never have another admirer either for love or money ensign bloomington was deaf to all overtures of peace he was rejoiced to escape from this virago and as we presume that none of our readers are much interested in her fate we shall leave her to wear the willow without following her history farther let us return to mr barlow whom we left looking over mr folingsbys marriage settlements when he had seen that they were rightly drawn he sent frank with them to folingsbyhall mr folingsby was alone when frank arrived sit down if you please sir said he though i have never had the pleasure of seeing you before your name is well known to me you are a brother of fanny franklands she is a charming and excellent young woman you have reason to be proud of your sister and i have reason to be obliged to her he then adverted to what had formerly passed between them at mrs hungerfords and concluded by saying it would give him real satisfaction to do any service to him or his family speak and tell me what i can do for you frank looked down and was silent for he thought mr folingsby must recollect the injustice that he or his agent had shown in turning old frankland out of his farm he was too proud to ask favours where he felt he had a claim to justice in fact mr folingsby had as he said left every thing to his agent and so little did he know either of the affairs of his tenants their persons or even their names that he had not at this moment the slightest idea that frank was the son of one of the oldest and the best of them he did not know that old frankland had been reduced to take refuge in an almshouse in consequence of his agents injustice surprised by franks cold silence he questioned him more closely and it was with astonishment and shame that he heard the truth good heavens cried he has my negligence been the cause of all this misery to your fatherto the father of fanny frankland i remember now that you recall it to my mind something of an old man with fine grey hair coming to speak to me about some business just as i was setting off for ascot races was that your father i recollect i told him i was in a great hurry and that mr deal my agent would certainly do him justice in this i was grossly mistaken and i have suffered severely for the confidence i had in that fellow thank god i shall now have my affairs in my own hands i am determined to look into them immediately my head is no longer full of horses and gigs and curricles there is a time for every thing my giddy days are over i only wish that my thoughtlessness had never hurt any one but myself all i now can do continued mr folingsby is to make amends as fast as possible for the past to begin with your father most fortunately i have the means in my power his farm is come back into my hands and it shall tomorrow be restored to him old bettesworth was with me scarcely an hour ago to surrender the farm on which there is a prodigious arrear of rent but i understand that he has built a good house on the farm and i am extremely glad of it for your fathers sake tell him it shall be his tell him i am ready i am eager to put him in possession of it and to repair the injustice i have done or which at least i have permitted to be done in my name frank was so overjoyed that he could scarcely utter one word of thanks in his way home he called at mrs hungerfords to tell the good news to his sister fanny this was the eve of their fathers birthday and they agreed to meet at the almshouse in the morning the happy morning came old frankland was busy in his little garden when he heard the voices of his children who were coming towards him fanny patty james frank welcome my children welcome i knew you would be so kind as to come to see your old father on this day so i was picking some of my currants for you to make you as welcome as i can but i wonder you are not ashamed to come to see me in an almshouse such gay lads and lasses i well know i have reason to be proud of you all why i think i never saw you one and all look so well in my whole life perhaps father said frank because you never saw us one and all so happy will you sit down dear father here in your arbour and we will all sit upon the grass at your feet and each tell you stories and all the good news my children said he do what you will with me it makes my old heart swim with joy to see you all again around me looking so happy the father sat down in his arbour and his children placed themselves at his feet first his daughter patty spoke and then fanny then james and at last frank when they had all told their little histories they offered to their father in one purse their common riches the rewards of their own good conduct my beloved children said frankland overpowered with his tears this is too much joy for me this is the happiest moment of my life none but the father of such children can know what i feel your success in the world delights me ten times the more because i know it is all owing to yourselves oh no dear father cried they with one accord no dear dear father our success is all owing to you every thing we have is owing to you to the care you took of us from our infancy upward if you had not watched for our welfare and taught us so well we should not now all be so happypoor bettesworth here they were interrupted by hannah the faithful maidservant who had always lived with old frankland she came running down the garden so fast that when she reached the arbour she was so much out of breath she could not speak dear heart god bless you all cried she as soon as she recovered breath but it is no time to be sitting here come in sir for mercys sake said she addressing herself to her old master come in to be ready come in all of you to be ready ready ready for what oh ready for fine things fine doings only come in and ill tell you as we go along how i have torn all my hand with this gooseberrybush but no matter for that so then you have not heard a word of what is going on no how could you and you did not miss me when you first came into the house forgive us for that good hannah we were in such a hurry to see my father we thought of nothing and nobody else very natural well miss fanny ive been up at the great house with your lady mrs hungerford a better lady cannot be do you know she sent for me on purpose to speak to me and i know things that you are not to know yet but this much i may tell you theres a carriage coming here to carry my master away to his new house and theres horses and sidesaddles beside for you and you and you and i and mrs hungerford is coming in her own coach and young mr folingsby is coming in his carriage and mr barlow in mr jos crumpes carriage and mr cleghorn and his pretty daughter in the gig andandand heaps of carriages besides friends of mrs hungerford and theres such crowds gathering in the streets and im going on to get breakfast oh my dear father cried frank make haste and take off this badgecoat before they come we have brought proper clothes for you frank pulled off the badgecoat as he called it and flung it from him saying my father shall never wear you more fanny had just tied on her fathers clean neckcloth and patty had smoothed his reverend grey locks when the sound of the carriages was heard all that hannah had told them was true mrs hungerford had engaged all her friends and all who were acquainted with the good conduct of the franklands to attend her on this joyful occasion triumphal cavalcades and processions said she are in general foolish thingsmere gratifications of vanity but this is not in honour of vanity but in honour of virtue we shall do good in the country by showing that we respect and admire it in whatever station it is to be found here is a whole family who have conducted themselves uncommonly well who have exerted themselves to relieve their aged father from a situation to which he was reduced without any fault or imprudence of his own their exertions have succeeded let us give them what they will value more than money sympathy convinced or persuaded by what mrs hungerford said all her friends and acquaintance attended her this morning to the almshouse crowds of people followed and old frankland was carried in triumph by his children to his new habitation the happy father lived many years to enjoy the increasing prosperity of his family footnote it may be necessary to inform some readers that patty and fanny were soon united to their lovers that james with mr cleghorns consent married miss cleghorn and that frank did not become an old bachelor he married an amiable girl who was ten times prettier than jilting jessy and of whom he was twenty times as fond those who wish to know the history of all the weddingclothes of the parties may have their curiosity gratified by directing a line of inquiry postpaid to the editor hereof may every good father have as grateful children may the grateful negro in the island of jamaica there lived two planters whose methods of managing their slaves were as different as possible mr jefferies considered the negroes as an inferior species incapable of gratitude disposed to treachery and to be roused from their natural indolence only by force he treated his slaves or rather suffered his overseer to treat them with the greatest severity jefferies was not a man of a cruel but of a thoughtless and extravagant temper he was of such a sanguine disposition that he always calculated upon having a fine season and fine crops on his plantation and never had the prudence to make allowance for unfortunate accidents he required as he said from his overseer produce and not excuses durant the overseer did not scruple to use the most cruel and barbarous methods of forcing the slaves to exertions beyond their strength footnote the negro slavesa fine drama by kotzebue it is to be hoped that such horrible instances of cruelty are not now to be found in nature bryan edwards in his history of jamaica says that most of the planters are humane but he allows that some facts can be cited in contradiction of this assertion complaints of his brutality from time to time reached his masters ears but though mr jefferies was moved to momentary compassion he shut his heart against conviction he hurried away to the jovial banquet and drowned all painful reflections in wine he was this year much in debt and therefore being more than usually anxious about his crop he pressed his overseer to exert himself to the utmost the wretched slaves upon his plantation thought themselves still more unfortunate when they compared their condition with that of the negroes on the estate of mr edwards this gentleman treated his slaves with all possible humanity and kindness he wished that there was no such thing as slavery in the world but he was convinced by the arguments of those who have the best means of obtaining information that the sudden emancipation of the negroes would rather increase than diminish their miseries his benevolence therefore confined itself within the bounds of reason he adopted those plans for the amelioration of the state of the slaves which appeared to him the most likely to succeed without producing any violent agitation or revolution footnote history of the west indies from which these ideas are adoptednot stolen for instance his negroes had reasonable and fixed daily tasks and when these were finished they were permitted to employ their time for their own advantage or amusement if they chose to employ themselves longer for their master they were paid regular wages for their extra work this reward for as such it was considered operated most powerfully upon the slaves those who are animated by hope can perform what would seem impossibilities to those who are under the depressing influence of fear the wages which mr edwards promised he took care to see punctually paid he had an excellent overseer of the name of abraham bayley a man of a mild but steady temper who was attached not only to his masters interests but to his virtues and who therefore was more intent upon seconding his humane views than upon squeezing from the labour of the negroes the utmost produce each negro had near his cottage a portion of land called his provisionground and one day in the week was allowed for its cultivation it is common in jamaica for the slaves to have provisiongrounds which they cultivate for their own advantage but it too often happens that when a good negro has successfully improved his little spot of ground when he has built himself a house and begins to enjoy the fruits of his industry his acquired property is seized upon by the sheriffs officer for the payment of his masters debts he is forcibly separated from his wife and children dragged to public auction purchased by a stranger and perhaps sent to terminate his miserable existence in the mines of mexico excluded for ever from the light of heaven and all this without any crime or imprudence on his part real or pretended he is punished because his master is unfortunate to this barbarous injustice the negroes on mr edwards plantation were never exposed he never exceeded his income he engaged in no wild speculations he contracted no debts and his slaves therefore were in no danger of being seized by a sheriffs officer their property was secured to them by the prudence as well as by the generosity of their master one morning as mr edwards was walking in that part of his plantation which joined to mr jefferies estate he thought he heard the voice of distress at some distance the lamentations grew louder and louder as he approached a cottage which stood upon the borders of jefferies plantation this cottage belonged to a slave of the name of caesar the best negro in mr jefferies possession such had been his industry and exertion that notwithstanding the severe tasks imposed by durant the overseer caesar found means to cultivate his provisionground to a degree of perfection no where else to be seen on this estate mr edwards had often admired this poor fellows industry and now hastened to inquire what misfortune had befallen him when he came to the cottage he found caesar standing with his arms folded and his eyes fixed upon the ground a young and beautiful female negro was weeping bitterly as she knelt at the feet of durant the overseer who regarding her with a sullen aspect repeated he must go i tell you woman he must go what signifies all this nonsense at the sight of mr edwards the overseers countenance suddenly changed and assumed an air of obsequious civility the poor woman retired to the farther corner of the cottage and continued to weep caesar never moved nothing is the matter sir said durant but that caesar is going to be sold that is what the woman is crying for they were to be married but well find clara another husband i tell her and shell get the better of her grief you know sir as i tell her in time never never said clara to whom is caesar going to be sold and for what sum for what can be got for him replied durant laughing and to whoever will buy him the sheriffs officer is here who has seized him for debt and must make the most of him at market poor fellow said mr edwards and must he leave this cottage which he has built and these bananas which he has planted caesar now for the first time looked up and fixing his eyes upon mr edwards for a moment advanced with an intrepid rather than an imploring countenance and said will you be my master will you be her master buy both of us you shall not repent of it caesar will serve you faithfully on hearing these words clara sprang forward and clasping her hands together repeated caesar will serve you faithfully mr edwards was moved by their entreaties but he left them without declaring his intentions he went immediately to mr jefferies whom he found stretched on a sofa drinking coffee as soon as mr edwards mentioned the occasion of his visit and expressed his sorrow for caesar jefferies exclaimed yes poor devil i pity him from the bottom of my soul but what can i do i leave all those things to durant he says the sheriffs officer has seized him and theres an end of the matter you know money must be had besides caesar is not worse off than any other slave sold for debt what signifies talking about the matter as if it were something that never happened before is not it a case that occurs every day in jamaica so much the worse replied mr edwards the worse for them to be sure said jefferies but after all they are slaves and are used to be treated as such and they tell me the negroes are a thousand times happier here with us than they ever were in their own country did the negroes tell you so themselves no but people better informed than negroes have told me so and after all slaves there must be for indigo and rum and sugar we must have granting it to be physically impossible that the world should exist without rum sugar and indigo why could they not be produced by freemen as well as by slaves if we hired negroes for labourers instead of purchasing them for slaves do you think they would not work as well as they do now does any negro under the fear of the overseer work harder than a birmingham journeyman or a newcastle collier who toil for themselves and their families of that i dont pretend to judge all i know is that the west india planters would be ruined if they had no slaves and i am a west india planter so am i yet i do not think they are the only people whose interests ought to be considered in this business their interests luckily are protected by the laws of the land and though they are rich men and white men and freemen they have as good a claim to their rights as the poorest black slave on any of our plantations the law in our case seems to make the right and the very reverse ought to be donethe right should make the law fortunately for us planters we need not enter into such nice distinctions you could not if you would abolish the trade slaves would be smuggled into the islands what if nobody would buy them you know that you cannot smuggle slaves into england the instant a slave touches english ground he becomes free glorious privilege why should it not be extended to all her dominions if the future importation of slaves into these islands were forbidden by law the trade must cease no man can either sell or possess slaves without its being known they cannot be smuggled like lace or brandy well well retorted jefferies a little impatiently as yet the law is on our side i can do nothing in this business nor can you yes we can do something we can endeavour to make our negroes as happy as possible i leave the management of these people to durant that is the very thing of which they complain forgive me for speaking to you with the frankness of an old acquaintance oh you cant oblige me more i love frankness of all things to tell you the truth i have heard complaints of durants severity but i make it a principle to turn a deaf ear to them for i know nothing can be done with these fellows without it you are partial to negroes but even you must allow they are a race of beings naturally inferior to us you may in vain think of managing a black as you would a white do what you please for a negro he will cheat you the first opportunity he finds you know what their maxim is god gives black men what white men forget to these commonplace desultory observations mr edwards made no reply but recurred to poor caesar and offered to purchase both him and clara at the highest price the sheriffs officer could obtain for them at market mr jefferies with the utmost politeness to his neighbour but with the most perfect indifference to the happiness of those whom he considered of a different species from himself acceded to this proposal nothing could be more reasonable he said and he was happy to have it in his power to oblige a gentleman for whom he had such a high esteem the bargain was quickly concluded with the sheriffs officer for mr edwards willingly paid several dollars more than the market price for the two slaves when caesar and clara heard that they were not to be separated their joy and gratitude were expressed with all the ardour and tenderness peculiar to their different characters clara was an eboe caesar a koromantyn negro the eboes are soft languishing and timid the koromantyns are frank fearless martial and heroic mr edwards took his new slaves home with him desired bayley his overseer to mark out a provisionground for caesar and to give him a cottage which happened at this time to be vacant now my good friend said he to caesar you may work for yourself without fear that what you earn may be taken from you or that you should ever be sold to pay your masters debts if he does not understand what i am saying continued mr edwards turning to his overseer you will explain it to him caesar perfectly understood all that mr edwards said but his feelings were at this instant so strong that he could not find expression for his gratitude he stood like one stupefied kindness was new to him it overpowered his manly heart and at hearing the words my good friend the tears gushed from his eyes tears which no torture could have extorted gratitude swelled in his bosom and he longed to be alone that he might freely yield to his emotions he was glad when the conchshell sounded to call the negroes to their daily labour that he might relieve the sensations of his soul by bodily exertion he performed his task in silence and an inattentive observer might have thought him sullen in fact he was impatient for the day to be over that he might get rid of a heavy load which weighed upon his mind the cruelties practised by durant the overseer of jefferies plantation had exasperated the slaves under his dominion they were all leagued together in a conspiracy which was kept profoundly secret their object was to extirpate every white man woman and child in the island their plans were laid with consummate art and the negroes were urged to execute them by all the courage of despair the confederacy extended to all the negroes in the island of jamaica excepting those on the plantation of mr edwards to them no hint of the dreadful secret had yet been given their countrymen knowing the attachment they felt to their master dared not trust them with these projects of vengeance hector the negro who was at the head of the conspirators was the particular friend of caesar and had imparted to him all his designs these friends were bound to each other by the strongest ties their slavery and their sufferings began in the same hour they were both brought from their own country in the same ship this circumstance alone forms amongst the negroes a bond of connexion not easily to be dissolved but the friendship of caesar and hector commenced even before they were united by the sympathy of misfortune they were both of the same nation both koromantyns in africa they had both been accustomed to command for they had signalized themselves by superior fortitude and courage they respected each other for excelling in all which they had been taught to consider as virtuous and with them revenge was a virtue revenge was the ruling passion of hector in caesars mind it was rather a principle instilled by education the one considered it as a duty the other felt it as a pleasure hectors sense of injury was acute in the extreme he knew not how to forgive caesars sensibility was yet more alive to kindness than to insult hector would sacrifice his life to extirpate an enemy caesar would devote himself for the defence of a friend and caesar now considered a white man as his friend he was now placed in a painful situation all his former friendships all the solemn promises by which he was bound to his companions in misfortune forbade him to indulge that delightful feeling of gratitude and affection which for the first time he experienced for one of that race of beings whom he had hitherto considered as detestable tyrantsobjects of implacable and just revenge caesar was most impatient to have an interview with hector that he might communicate his new sentiments and dissuade him from those schemes of destruction which he meditated at midnight when all the slaves except himself were asleep he left his cottage and went to jefferies plantation to the hut in which hector slept even in his dreams hector breathed vengeance spare none sons of africa spare none were the words he uttered in his sleep as caesar approached the mat on which he lay the moon shone full upon him caesar contemplated the countenance of his friend fierce even in sleep spare none oh yes there is one that must be spared there is one for whose sake all must be spared he wakened hector by this exclamation of what were you dreaming said caesar of that which sleeping or waking fills my soulrevenge why did you waken me from my dream it was delightful the whites were weltering in their blood but silence we may be overheard no every one sleeps but ourselves replied caesar i could not sleep without speaking to you ona subject that weighs upon my mind you have seen mr edwards yes he that is now your master he that is now my benefactormy friend friend can you call a white man friend cried hector starting up with a look of astonishment and indignation yes replied caesar with firmness and you would speak ay and would feel as i do hector if you knew this white man oh how unlike he is to all of his race that we have ever seen do not turn from me with so much disdain hear me with patience my friend i cannot replied hector listen with patience to one who between the rising and the setting sun can forget all his resolutions all his promises who by a few soft words can be so wrought upon as to forget all the insults all the injuries he has received from this accursed race and can even call a white man friend caesar unmoved by hectors anger continued to speak of mr edwards with the warmest expressions of gratitude and finished by declaring he would sooner forfeit his life than rebel against such a master he conjured hector to desist from executing his designs but all was in vain hector sat with his elbows fixed upon his knees leaning his head upon his hands in gloomy silence caesars mind was divided between love for his friend and gratitude to his master the conflict was violent and painful gratitude at last prevailed he repeated his declaration that he would rather die than continue in a conspiracy against his benefactor hector refused to except him from the general doom betray us if you will cried he betray our secrets to him whom you call your benefactor to him whom a few hours have made your friend to him sacrifice the friend of your youth the companion of your better days of your better self yes caesar deliver me over to the tormentors i can endure more than they can inflict i shall expire without a sigh without a groan why do you linger here caesar why do you hesitate hasten this moment to your master claim your reward for delivering into his power hundreds of your countrymen why do you hesitate away the cowards friendship can be of use to none who can value his gratitude who can fear his revenge hector raised his voice so high as he pronounced these words that he wakened durant the overseer who slept in the next house they heard him call out suddenly to inquire who was there and caesar had but just time to make his escape before durant appeared he searched hectors cottage but finding no one again retired to rest this mans tyranny made him constantly suspicious he dreaded that the slaves should combine against him and he endeavoured to prevent them by every threat and every stratagem he could devise from conversing with each other they had however taken their measures hitherto so secretly that he had not the slightest idea of the conspiracy which was forming in the island their schemes were not yet ripe for execution but the appointed time approached hector when he coolly reflected on what had passed between him and caesar could not help admiring the frankness and courage with which he had avowed his change of sentiments by this avowal caesar had in fact exposed his own life to the most imminent danger from the vengeance of the conspirators who might be tempted to assassinate him who had their lives in his power notwithstanding the contempt with which in the first moment of passion he had treated his friend he was extremely anxious that he should not break off all connexion with the conspirators he knew that caesar possessed both intrepidity and eloquence and that his opposition to their schemes would perhaps entirely frustrate their whole design he therefore determined to use every possible means to bend him to their purposes the enlightened inhabitants of europe may perhaps smile at the superstitious credulity of the negroes who regard those ignorant beings called obeah people with the most profound respect and dread who believe that they hold in their hands the power of good and evil fortune of health and sickness of life and death the instances which are related of their power over the minds of their countrymen are so wonderful that none but the most unquestionable authority could make us think them credible the following passage from edwards history of the west indies is inserted to give an idea of this strange infatuation in the year when a very formidable insurrection of the koromantyn or gold coast negroes broke out in the parish of st mary and spread through almost every other district of the island an old koromantyn negro the chief instigator and oracle of the insurgents in that parish who had administered the fetish or solemn oath to the conspirators and furnished them with a magical preparation which was to render them invulnerable was fortunately apprehended convicted and hung up with all his feathers and trumperies about him and his execution struck the insurgents with a general panic from which they never afterwards recovered the examinations which were taken at that period first opened the eyes of the public to the very dangerous tendency of the obeah practices and gave birth to the law which was then enacted for their suppression and punishment but neither the terror of this law the strict investigation which has since been made after the professors of obi nor the many examples of those who from time to time have been hanged or transported have hitherto produced the desired effect a gentleman on his returning to jamaica in the year found that a great many of his negroes had died during his absence and that of such as remained alive at least one half were debilitated bloated and in a very deplorable condition the mortality continued after his arrival and two or three were frequently buried in one day others were taken ill and began to decline under the same symptoms every means were tried by medicine and the most careful nursing to preserve the lives of the feeblest but in spite of all his endeavours this depopulation went on for a twelvemonth longer with more or less intermission and without his being able to ascertain the real cause though the obeah practice was strongly suspected as well by himself as by the doctor and other white persons upon the plantation as it was known to have been very common in that part of the island and particularly among the negroes of the popaw or popo country still he was unable to verify his suspicions because the patients constantly denied their having any thing to do with persons of that order or any knowledge of them at length a negress who had been ill for some time came and informed him that feeling it was impossible for her to live much longer she thought herself bound in duty before she died to impart a very great secret and acquaint him with the true cause of her disorder in hopes that the disclosure might prove the means of stopping that mischief which had already swept away such a number of her fellow slaves she proceeded to say that her stepmother a woman of the popo country above eighty years old but still hale and active had put obi upon her as she had upon those who had lately died and that the old woman had practised obi for as many years past as she could remember the other negroes of the plantation no sooner heard of this impeachment than they ran in a body to their master and confirmed the truth of itupon this he repaired directly with six white servants to the old womans house and forcing open the door observed the whole inside of the roof which was of thatch and every crevice of the wall stuck with the implements of her trade consisting of rags feathers bones of cats and a thousand other articlesthe house was instantly pulled down and with the whole of its contents committed to the flames amidst the general acclamations of all his other negroesfrom the moment of her departure his negroes seemed all to be animated with new spirits and the malady spread no farther among them the total of his losses in the course of about fifteen years preceding the discovery and imputable solely to the obeah practice he estimates at least at one hundred negroes esther an old koromantyn negress had obtained by her skill in poisonous herbs and her knowledge of venomous reptiles a high reputation amongst her countrymen she soon taught them to believe her to be possessed of supernatural powers and she then worked their imagination to what pitch and purpose she pleased she was the chief instigator of this intended rebellion it was she who had stimulated the revengeful temper of hector almost to frenzy she now promised him that her arts should be exerted over his friend and it was not long before he felt their influence caesar soon perceived an extraordinary change in the countenance and manner of his beloved clara a melancholy hung over her and she refused to impart to him the cause of her dejection caesar was indefatigable in his exertions to cultivate and embellish the ground near his cottage in hopes of making it an agreeable habitation for her but she seemed to take no interest in any thing she would stand beside him immoveable in a deep reverie but when he inquired whether she was ill she would answer no and endeavour to assume an air of gaiety but this cheerfulness was transient she soon relapsed into despondency at length she endeavoured to avoid her lover as if she feared his farther inquiries unable to endure this state of suspense he one evening resolved to bring her to an explanation clara said he you once loved me i have done nothing have i to forfeit your confidence i once loved you said she raising her languid eyes and looking at him with reproachful tenderness and can you doubt my constancy oh caesar you little know what is passing in my heart you are the cause of my melancholy she paused and hesitated as if afraid that she had said too much but caesar urged her with so much vehemence and so much tenderness to open to him her whole soul that at last she could not resist his eloquence she reluctantly revealed to him that secret of which she could not think without horror she informed him that unless he complied with what was required of him by the sorceress esther he was devoted to die what it was that esther required of him clara knew not she knew nothing of the conspiracy the timidity of her character was ill suited to such a project and every thing relating to it had been concealed from her with the utmost care when she explained to caesar the cause of her dejection his natural courage resisted these superstitious fears and he endeavoured to raise claras spirits he endeavoured in vain she fell at his feet and with tears and the most tender supplications conjured him to avert the wrath of the sorceress by obeying her commands whatever they might be clara replied he you know not what you ask i ask you to save your life said she i ask you for my sake to save your life while yet it is in your power but would you to save my life clara make me the worst of criminals would you make me the murderer of my benefactor clara started with horror do you recollect the day the moment when we were on the point of being separated for ever clara do you remember the white mans coming to my cottage do you remember his look of benevolencehis voice of compassion do you remember his generosity oh clara would you make me the murderer of this man heaven forbid said clara this cannot be the will of the sorceress it is said caesar but she shall not succeed even though she speaks with the voice of clara urge me no further my resolution is fixed i should be unworthy of your love if i were capable of treachery and ingratitude but is there no means of averting the wrath of esther said clara your life think first of my honour interrupted caesar your fears deprive you of reason return to this sorceress and tell her that i dread not her wrath my hands shall never be imbrued in the blood of my benefactor clara can you forget his look when he told us that we should never more be separated it went to my heart said clara bursting into tears cruel cruel esther why do you command us to destroy such a generous master the conch sounded to summon the negroes to their mornings work it happened this day that mr edwards who was continually intent upon increasing the comforts and happiness of his slaves sent his carpenter while caesar was absent to fit up the inside of his cottage and when caesar returned from work he found his master pruning the branches of a tamarind tree that overhung the thatch how comes it caesar said he that you have not pruned these branches caesar had no knife here is mine for you said mr edwards it is very sharp added he smiling but i am not one of those masters who are afraid to trust their negroes with sharp knives these words were spoken with perfect simplicity mr edwards had no suspicion at this time of what was passing in the negros mind caesar received the knife without uttering a syllable but no sooner was mr edwards out of sight than he knelt down and in a transport of gratitude swore that with this knife he would stab himself to the heart sooner than betray his master the principle of gratitude conquered every other sensation the mind of caesar was not insensible to the charms of freedom he knew the negro conspirators had so taken their measures that there was the greatest probability of their success his heart beat high at the idea of recovering his liberty but he was not to be seduced from his duty not even by this delightful hope nor was he to be intimidated by the dreadful certainty that his former friends and countrymen considering him as a deserter from their cause would become his bitterest enemies the loss of hectors esteem and affection was deeply felt by caesar since the night that the decisive conversation relative to mr edwards passed hector and he had never exchanged a syllable this visit proved the cause of much suffering to hector and to several of the slaves on jefferies plantation we mentioned that durant had been awakened by the raised voice of hector though he could not find any one in the cottage yet his suspicions were not dissipated and an accident nearly brought the whole conspiracy to light durant had ordered one of the negroes to watch a boiler of sugar the slave was overcome by the heat and fainted he had scarcely recovered his senses when the overseer came up and found that the sugar had fermented by having remained a few minutes too long in the boiler he flew into a violent passion and ordered that the negro should receive fifty lashes his victim bore them without uttering a groan but when his punishment was over and when he thought the overseer was gone he exclaimed it will soon be our turn durant was not out of hearing he turned suddenly and observed that the negro looked at hector when he pronounced these words and this confirmed the suspicion that hector was carrying on some conspiracy he immediately had recourse to that brutality which he considered as the only means of governing black men hector and three other negroes were lashed unmercifully but no confessions could be extorted mr jefferies might perhaps have forbidden such violence to be used if he had not been at the time carousing with a party of jovial west indians who thought of nothing but indulging their appetites in all the luxuries that art and nature could supply the sufferings which had been endured by many of the wretched negroes to furnish out this magnificent entertainment were never once thought of by these selfish epicures yet so false are the general estimates of character that all these gentlemen passed for men of great feeling and generosity the human mind in certain situations becomes so accustomed to ideas of tyranny and cruelty that they no longer appear extraordinary or detestable they rather seem part of the necessary and immutable order of things mr jefferies was stopped as he passed from his diningroom into his drawingroom by a little negro child of about five years old who was crying bitterly he was the son of one of the slaves who were at this moment under the torturers hand poor little devil said mr jefferies who was more than half intoxicated take him away and tell durant some of ye to pardon his fatherif he can the child ran eagerly to announce his fathers pardon but he soon returned crying more violently than before durant would not hear the boy and it was now no longer possible to appeal to mr jefferies for he was in the midst of an assembly of fair ladies and no servant belonging to the house dared to interrupt the festivities of the evening the three men who were so severely flogged to extort from them confessions were perfectly innocent they knew nothing of the confederacy but the rebels seized the moment when their minds were exasperated by this cruelty and injustice and they easily persuaded them to join the league the hope of revenging themselves upon the overseer was a motive sufficient to make them brave death in any shape another incident which happened a few days before the time destined for the revolt of the slaves determined numbers who had been undecided mrs jefferies was a languid beauty or rather a languid fine lady who had been a beauty and who spent all that part of the day which was not devoted to the pleasures of the table or to reclining on a couch in dress she was one day extended on a sofa fanned by four slaves two at her head and two at her feet when news was brought that a large chest directed to her was just arrived from london this chest contained various articles of dress of the newest fashions the jamaica ladies carry their ideas of magnificence to a high pitch they willingly give a hundred guineas for a gown which they perhaps wear but once or twice in the elegance and variety of her ornaments mrs jefferies was not exceeded by any lady in the island except by one who had lately received a cargo from england she now expected to outshine her competitor and desired that the chest should be unpacked in her presence in taking out one of the gowns it caught on a nail in the lid and was torn the lady roused from her natural indolence by this disappointment to her vanity instantly ordered that the unfortunate female slave should be severely chastised the woman was the wife of hector and this fresh injury worked up his temper naturally vindictive to the highest point he ardently longed for the moment when he might satiate his vengeance the plan the negroes had laid was to set fire to the canes at one and the same time on every plantation and when the white inhabitants of the island should run to put out the fire the blacks were to seize this moment of confusion and consternation to fall upon them and make a general massacre the time when this scheme was to be carried into execution was not known to caesar for the conspirators had changed their day as soon as hector told them that his friend was no longer one of the confederacy they dreaded he should betray them and it was determined that he and clara should both be destroyed unless they could be prevailed upon to join the conspiracy hector wished to save his friend but the desire of vengeance overcame every other feeling he resolved however to make an attempt for the last time to change caesars resolution for this purpose esther was the person he employed she was to work upon his mind by means of clara on returning to her cottage one night she found suspended from the thatch one of those strange fantastic charms with which the indian sorceresses terrify those whom they have proscribed clara unable to conquer her terror repaired again to esther who received her first in mysterious silence but after she had implored her forgiveness for the past and with all possible humility conjured her to grant her future protection the sorceress deigned to speak her commands were that clara should prevail upon her lover to meet her on this awful spot the ensuing night little suspecting what was going forward on the plantation of jefferies mr edwards that evening gave his slaves a holiday he and his family came out at sunset when the fresh breeze had sprung up and seated themselves under a spreading palmtree to enjoy the pleasing spectacle of this negro festival his negroes were all well clad and in the gayest colours and their merry countenances suited the gaiety of their dress while some were dancing and some playing on the tambourine others appeared amongst the distant trees bringing baskets of avocado pears grapes and pineapples the produce of their own provisiongrounds and others were employed in spreading their clean trenchers or the calabashes which served for plates and dishes the negroes continued to dance and divert themselves till late in the evening when they separated and retired to rest caesar recollecting his promise to clara repaired secretly to the habitation of this sorceress it was situated in the recess of a thick wood when he arrived there he found the door fastened and he was obliged to wait some time before it was opened by esther the first object he beheld was his beloved clara stretched on the ground apparently a corpse the sorceress had thrown her into a trance by a preparation of deadly nightshade the hag burst into an infernal laugh when she beheld the despair that was painted in caesars countenance wretch cried she you have defied my power behold its victim caesar in a transport of rage seized her by the throat but his fury was soon checked destroy me said the fiend and you destroy your clara she is not dead but she lies in the sleep of death into which she has been thrown by magic art and from which no power but mine can restore her to the light of life yes look at her pale and motionless never will she rise from the earth unless within one hour you obey my commands i have administered to hector and his companions the solemn fetish oath at the sound of which every negro in africa trembles you know my object fiend i do replied caesar eyeing her sternly but while i have life it shall never be accomplished look yonder cried she pointing to the moon in a few minutes that moon will set at that hour hector and his friends will appear they come armedarmed with weapons which i shall steep in poison for their enemies themselves i will render invulnerable look again continued she if my dim eyes mistake not yonder they come rash man you die if they cross my threshold i wish for death said caesar clara is dead but you can restore her to life by a single word caesar at this moment seemed to hesitate consider your heroism is vain continued esther you will have the knives of fifty of the conspirators in your bosom if you do not join them and after you have fallen the death of your master is inevitable here is the bowl of poison in which the negro knives are to be steeped your friends your former friends your countrymen will be in arms in a few minutes and they will bear down every thing before themvictory wealth freedom and revenge will be theirs caesar appeared to be more and more agitated his eyes were fixed upon clara the conflict in his mind was violent but his sense of gratitude and duty could not be shaken by hope fear or ambition nor could it be vanquished by love he determined however to appear to yield as if struck with panic at the approach of the confederate negroes he suddenly turned to the sorceress and said in a tone of feigned submission it is in vain to struggle with fate let my knife too be dipped in your magic poison the sorceress clapped her hands with infernal joy in her countenance she bade him instantly give her his knife that she might plunge it to the hilt in the bowl of poison to which she turned with savage impatience his knife was left in his cottage and under pretence of going in search of it he escaped esther promised to prepare hector and all his companions to receive him with their ancient cordiality on his return caesar ran with the utmost speed along a byepath out of the wood met none of the rebels reached his masters house scaled the wall of his bedchamber got in at the window and wakened him exclaiming armarm yourself my dear master arm all your slaves they will fight for you and die for you as i will the first the koromantyn yell of war will be heard in jefferies plantation this night armarm yourself my dear master and let us surround the rebel leaders while it is yet time i will lead you to the place where they are all assembled on condition that their chief who is my friend shall be pardoned mr edwards armed himself and the negroes on his plantation as well as the whites they were all equally attached to him he followed caesar into the recesses of the wood they proceeded with all possible rapidity but in perfect silence till they reached esthers habitation which they surrounded completely before they were perceived by the conspirators mr edwards looked through a hole in the wall and by the blue flame of a cauldron over which the sorceress was stretching her shrivelled hands he saw hector and five stout negroes standing intent upon her incantations these negroes held their knives in their hands ready to dip them into the bowl of poison it was proposed by one of the whites to set fire immediately to the hut and thus to force the rebels to surrender the advice was followed but mr edwards charged his people to spare their prisoners the moment the rebels saw that the thatch of the hut was in flames they set up the koromantyn yell of war and rushed out with frantic desperation yield you are pardoned hector cried mr edwards in a loud voice you are pardoned my friend repeated caesar hector incapable at this instant of listening to anything but revenge sprang forwards and plunged his knife into the bosom of caesar the faithful servant staggered back a few paces his master caught him in his arms i die content said he bury me with clara he swooned from loss of blood as they were carrying him home but when his wound was examined it was found not to be mortal as he recovered from his swoon he stared wildly round him trying to recollect where he was and what had happened he thought that he was still in a dream when he saw his beloved clara standing beside him the opiate which the pretended sorceress had administered to her had ceased to operate she wakened from her trance just at the time the koromantyn yell commenced caesars joywe must leave that to the imagination in the mean time what became of the rebel negroes and mr edwards the taking the chief conspirators prisoners did not prevent the negroes upon jefferies plantation from insurrection the moment they heard the warwhoop the signal agreed upon they rose in a body and before they could be prevented either by the whites on the estate or by mr edwards adherents they had set fire to the overseers house and to the canes the overseer was the principal object of their vengeancehe died in tortures inflicted by the hands of those who had suffered most by his cruelties mr edwards however quelled the insurgents before rebellion spread to any other estates in the island the influence of his character and the effect of his eloquence upon the minds of the people were astonishing nothing but his interference could have prevented the total destruction of mr jefferies and his family who as it was computed lost this night upwards of fifty thousand pounds he was never afterwards able to recover his losses or to shake off his constant fear of a fresh insurrection among his slaves at length he and his lady returned to england where they were obliged to live in obscurity and indigence they had no consolation in their misfortunes but that of railing at the treachery of the whole race of slaves our readers we hope will think that at least one exception may be made in favour of the grateful negro empty page tomorrow oh this detestable tomorrowa thing always expected yet never foundjohnson chapter i it has long been my intention to write my own history and i am determined to begin it today for half the good intentions of my life have been frustrated by my unfortunate habit of putting things off till tomorrow when i was a young man i used to be told that this was my only fault i believed it and my vanity or laziness persuaded me that this fault was but small and that i should easily cure myself of it in time that time however has not yet arrived and at my advanced age i must give up all thoughts of amendment hoping however that sincere repentance may stand instead of reformation my father was an eminent london bookseller he happened to be looking over a new biographical dictionary on the day when i was brought into the world and at the moment when my birth was announced to him he had his finger upon the name basil he read aloudbasil canonized bishop of caesarea a theological controversial and moral writer my boy continued my father shall be named after this great man and i hope and believe that i shall live to see him either a celebrated theological controversial and moral author or a bishop i am not so sanguine as to expect that he should be both these good things i was christened basil according to my fathers wishes and his hopes of my future celebrity and fortune were confirmed during my childhood by instances of wit and memory which were not perhaps greater than what could have been found in my little contemporaries but which appeared to the vanity of parental fondness extraordinary if not supernatural my father declared that it would be a sin not to give me a learned education and he went even beyond his means to procure for me all the advantages of the best modes of instruction i was stimulated even when a boy by the idea that i should become a great man and my masters had for some time reason to be satisfied but what they called the quickness of my parts continually retarded my progress the facility with which i learned my lessons encouraged me to put off learning them till the last moment and this habit of procrastinating which was begun in presumption ended in disgrace when i was sent to a public school i found among my companions so many temptations to idleness that notwithstanding the quickness of my parts i was generally flogged twice a week as i grew older my reason might perhaps have taught me to correct myself but my vanity was excited to persist in idleness by certain imprudent sayings or whisperings of my father when i came home from school at the holidays and when complaints were preferred against me in letters from my schoolmaster my father even while he affected to scold me for my negligence flattered me in the most dangerous manner by addingaside to some friend of the familymy basil is a strange fellowcan do any thing he pleasesall his masters say sobut he is a sad idle dogall your men of genius are soputs off business always to the last momentall your men of genius do so for instance there is whose third edition of odes i have just publishedwhat an idle dog he is yet who makes such a noise in the world as he doesput every thing off till tomorrow like my basilbut can do more at the last moment than any man in englandthat is if the fit seizes himfor he does nothing but by fitshas no applicationnonesays it would petrify him to a dunce i never knew a man of genius who was not an idle dog not a syllable of such speeches was lost upon me the idea of a man of genius and of an idle dog were soon so firmly joined together in my imagination that it was impossible to separate them either by my own reason or by that of my preceptors i gloried in the very habits which my tutors laboured to correct and i never was seriously mortified by the consequences of my own folly till at a public examination at eton i lost a premium by putting off till it was too late the finishing a copy of verses the lines which i had written were said by all my young and old friends to be beautiful the prize was gained by one johnson a heavy lad of no sort of genius but of great perseverance his verses were finished however at the stated time for dulness ever must be regular my fragment charming as it was was useless except to hand about afterward among my friends to prove what i might have done if i had thought it worth while my father was extremely vexed by my missing an opportunity of distinguishing myself at this public exhibition especially as the king had honoured the assembly with his presence and as those who had gained premiums were presented to his majesty it was supposed that their being thus early marked as lads of talents would be highly advantageous to their advancement in life all this my father felt and blaming himself for having encouraged me in the indolence of genius he determined to counteract his former imprudence and was resolved he said to cure me at once of my habit of procrastination for this purpose he took down from his shelves youngs night thoughts from which he remembered a line which has become a stock line among writingmasters copies procrastination is the thief of time he hunted the book for the words procrastination time today and tomorrow and made an extract of seven long pages on the dangers of delay now my dear basil said he this is what will cure you for life and this you must get perfectly by heart before i give you one shilling more pocketmoney the motive was all powerful and with pains iteration and curses i fixed the heterogeneous quotations so well in my memory that some of them have remained there to this day for instance time destroyed is suicide where more than blood is spilt time flies death urges knells call heavn invites hell threatens we push time from us and we wish him back man flies from time and time from man too soon in sad divorce this double flight must end and then where are we be wise today tis madness to defer c next day the fatal precedent will plead c lorenzoo for yesterdays to come today is yesterday returnd returnd full powered to cancel expiate raise adorn and reinstate us on the rock of peace let it not share its predecessors fate nor like its elder sisters die a fool where shall i find him angels tell me where you know him he is near you point him out shall i see glories beaming from his brow or trace his footsteps by the rising flowrs your golden wings now hovring oer him shed protection now are wavring in applause to that blest son of foresight lord of fate that awful independent on tomorrow whose work is done who triumphs in the past whose yesterdays look backward with a smile i spare you the rest of my task and i earnestly hope my dear reader that these citations may have a better effect upon you than they had upon me with shame i confess that even with the addition of shakspeares eloquent tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow c which i learnt by heart gratis not a bit the better was i for all this poetical morality what i wanted was not conviction of my folly but resolution to amend when i say that i was not a bit the better for these documentings i must not omit to observe to you that i was very near four hundred pounds a year the better for them being obliged to learn so much of youngs night thoughts by rote i was rather disgusted and my attention was roused to criticise the lines which had been forced upon my admiration afterward when i went to college i delighted to maintain in opposition to some of my companions who were enthusiastic admirers of young that he was no poet the more i was ridiculed the more i persisted i talked my self into notice i became acquainted with several of the literary men at cambridge i wrote in defence of my opinion or as some called it my heresy i maintained that what all the world had mistaken for sublimity was bombast that the night thoughts were fuller of witty conceits than of poetical images i drew a parallel between young and cowley and i finished by pronouncing young to be the cowley of the eighteenth century to do myself justice there was much ingenuity and some truth in my essay but it was the declamation of a partisan who can think only on one side of a question and who in the heat of controversy says more than he thinks and more than he originally intended it is often the fortune of literary partisans to obtain a share of temporary celebrity far beyond their deserts especially if they attack any writer of established reputation the success of my essay exceeded my most sanguine expectations and i began to think that my father was right that i was born to be a great genius and a great man the notice taken of me by a learned prelate who piqued himself upon being considered as the patron of young men of talents confirmed me at once in my selfconceit and my hopes of preferment i mentioned to you that my father in honour of my namesake basil bishop of caesarea and to verify his own presentiments had educated me for the church my present patron who seemed to like me the better the oftener i dined with him gave me reason to hope that he would provide for me handsomely i was not yet ordained when a living of four hundred per annum fell into his gift he held it over for some months as it was thought on purpose for me in the mean time he employed me to write a charity sermon for him which he was to preach as it was expected to a crowded congregation none but those who are themselves slaves to the habit of procrastination will believe that i could be so foolish as to put off writing this sermon till the saturday evening before it was wanted some of my young companions came unexpectedly to sup with me we sat late in the vanity of a young author who glories in the rapidity of composition i said to myself that i could finish my sermon in an hours notice but alas when my companions at length departed they left me in no condition to complete a sermon i fell fast asleep and was wakened in the morning by the bishops servant the dismay i felt is indescribable i started upit was nine oclock i began to write but my hand and my mind trembled and my ideas were in such confusion that i could not great genius as i was produce a beginning sentence in a quarter of an hour i kept the bishops servant forty minutes by his watch wrote and rewrote two pages and walked up and down the room tore my two pages and at last when the footman said he could wait no longer was obliged to let him go with an awkward note pleading sudden sickness for my apology it was true that i was sufficiently sick at the time when i penned this note my head ached terribly and i kept my room reflecting upon my own folly the whole of the day i foresaw the consequences the living was given away by my patron the next morning and all hopes of future favour were absolutely at an end my father overwhelmed me with reproaches and i might perhaps have been reformed by this disappointment but an unexpected piece of good fortune or what i then thought good fortune was my ruin among the multitude of my collegefriends was a young gentleman whose father was just appointed to go out upon the famous embassy to china he came to our shop to buy du halde and upon hearing me express an enthusiastic desire to visit china he undertook to apply to his father to take me in the ambassadors suite his representation of me as a young man of talents and literature and the view of some botanical drawings which i executed upon the spur of the occasion with tolerable neatness procured me the favour which i so ardently desired my father objected to my making this voyage he was vexed to see me quit the profession for which i had been educated and he could not without a severe struggle relinquish his hopes of seeing me a bishop but i argued that as i had not yet been ordained there could be no disgrace or impropriety in my avoiding a mode of life which was not suited to my genius this word genius had now as upon all other occasions a mighty effect upon my father and observing this i declared farther in a high tone of voice that from the experience i had already had i was perfectly certain that the drudgery of sermonwriting would paralyze my genius and that to expand and invigorate my intellectual powers it was absolutely necessary i should to use a great authors expression view in foreign countries varied modes of existence my fathers hopes that one half of his prophecy would at least be accomplished and that i should become a great author revived and he consented to my going to china upon condition that i should promise to write a history of my voyage and journey in two volumes octavo or one quarto with a folio of plates the promise was readily made for in the plenitude of confidence in my own powers octavos and quartos shrunk before me and a folio appeared too small for the various information and the useful reflections which a voyage to china must supply full of expectations and projects i talked from morning till night of my journey but notwithstanding my fathers hourly remonstrances i deferred my preparations till the last week then all was hurry and confusion tailors and sempstresses portmanteaus and trunks portfolios and drawingboxes watercolours crayons and notebooks wet from the stationers crowded my room i had a dozen small notebooks and a huge commonplacebook which was to be divided and kept in the manner recommended by the judicious and immortal locke in the midst of the last days bustle i sat down at the corner of a table with compass ruler and red ink to divide and rule my best of all possible commonplacebooks but the red ink was too thin and the paper was not well sized and it blotted continually because i was obliged to turn over the pages rapidly and ink will not dry nor blottingpaper suck it up more quickly for a genius than for any other man besides my attention was much distracted by the fear that the sempstress would not send home my dozen of new shirts and that a vile procrastinating bootmaker would never come with my boots every rap at the door i started up to inquire whether that was the shirts or the boots thrice i overturned the red and twice the black ink bottles by these starts and the execrations which i bestowed upon those tradespeople who will put off every thing to the last moment were innumerable i had orders to set off in the mailcoach for portsmouth to join the rest of the ambassadors suite the provoking watchman cried past eleven oclock before i had halffinished ruling my commonplacebook my shirts and my boots were not come the mailcoach as you may guess set off without me my poor father was in a terrible tremor and walked from room to room reproaching me and himself but i persisted in repeating that lord m would not set out the day he had intended that nobody since the creation of the world ever set out upon a long journey the day he first appointed besides there were at least a hundred chances in my favour that his lordship would break down on his way to portsmouth that the wind would not be fair when he arrived there that half the people in his suite would not be more punctual than myself c by these arguments or by mere dint of assertion i quieted my fathers apprehensions and my own and we agreed that as it was now impossible to go today it was best to stay till tomorrow upon my arrival at portsmouth the first thing i heard was that the lion and hindostan had sailed some hours before with the embassy for china despair deprived me of utterance a charitable waiter at the inn however seeing my consternation and absolute inability to think or act for myself ran to make farther inquiries and brought me back the joyful tidings that the jackal brig which was to carry out the remainder of the ambassadors suite was not yet under weigh that a gentleman who was to go in the jackal had dined at an hotel in the next street and that he had gone to the waterside but ten minutes ago i hurried after him the boat was gone i paid another exorbitantly to take me and my goods to the brig and reached the jackal just as she was weighing anchor bad education for me the moment i felt myself safe on board having recovered breath to speak i exclaimed here am i safe and sound just as well as if i had been here yesterday better indeed oh after this i shall always trust to my own good fortune i knew i should not be too late when i came to reflect coolly however i was rather sorry that i had missed my passage in the lion with my friend and protector and with most of the learned and ingenious men of the ambassadors suite to whom i had been introduced and who had seemed favourably disposed towards me all the advantage i might have derived from their conversation during this long voyage was lost by my own negligence the jackal lost company of the lion and hindostan in the channel as my friends afterwards told me they waited for us five days in praya bay but as no jackal appeared they sailed again without her at length to our great joy we descried on the beach of sumatra a board nailed to a post which our friends had set up there with a written notice to inform us that the lion and hindostan had touched on this shore on such a day and to point out to us the course that we should keep in order to join them at the sight of this writing my spirits revived the wind favoured us but alas in passing the straits of banka we were damaged so that we were obliged to return to port to refit and to take in fresh provision not a soul on board but wished it had been their fate to have had a berth in the other ships and i more loudly than any one else expressed this wish twenty times aday when my companions heard that i was to have sailed in the ambassadors ship if i had been time enough at spithead some pitied and some rallied me but most said i deserved to be punished for my negligence at length we joined the lion and hindostan at north island our friends had quite given up all hopes of ever seeing us again and had actually bought at batavia a french brig to supply the place of the jackal to my great satisfaction i was now received on board the lion and had an opportunity of conversing with the men of literature and science from whom i had been so unluckily separated during the former part of the voyage their conversation soon revived and increased my regret when they told me of all that i had missed seeing at the various places where they had touched they talked to me with provoking fluency of the culture of manioc of the root of cassada of which tapioca is made of the shrub called the cactus on which the cochineal insect swarms and feeds and of the ipecacuanhaplant all which they had seen at rio janeiro besides eight paintings representing the manner in which the diamond and gold mines in the brazils are worked indeed upon crossexamination i found that these pictures were miserably executed and scarcely worth seeing i regretted more the fine pineapples which my companions assured me were in such abundance that they cleaned their swords in them as being the cheapest acid that could be there procured but far beyond these vulgar objects of curiosity i regretted not having learned any thing concerning the celebrated upastree i was persuaded that if i had been at batavia i should have extracted some information more precise than these gentlemen obtained from the keepers of the medical garden i confess that my mortification at this disappointment did not arise solely from the pure love of natural history the upastree would have made a conspicuous figure in my quarto volume i consoled myself however by the determination to omit nothing that the vast empire of china could afford to render my work entertaining instructive interesting and sublime i anticipated the pride with which i should receive the compliments of my friends and the public upon my valuable and incomparable work i anticipated the pleasure with which my father would exult in the celebrity of his son and in the accomplishment of his own prophecies and with these thoughts full in my mind we landed at mettow in china i sat up late at night writing a sketch of my preface and notes for the heads of chapters i was tired fell into a profound sleep dreamed i was teaching the emperor of china to pronounce chrononhotonthologos and in the morning was wakened by the sound of the gong the signal that the accommodation junks were ready to sail with the embassy to pekin i hurried on my clothes and was in the junk before the gong had done beating i gloried in my celerity but before we had gone two leagues up the country i found reason to repent of my precipitation i wanted to note down my first impressions on entering the chinese territories but alas i felt in vain in my pocket for my pencil and notebook i had left them both behind me on my bed not only one notebook but my whole dozen which on leaving london i had stuffed into a bag with my nightgown bag nightgown notebooks all were forgotten however trifling it may appear this loss of the little notebooks was of material consequence to be sure it was easy to procure paper and make others but because it was so easy it was delayed from hour to hour and from day to day and i went on writing my most important remarks on scraps of paper which were always to be copied tomorrow into a notebook that was then to be made we arrived at pekin and were magnificently lodged in a palace in that city but here we were so strictly guarded that we could not stir beyond the courts of the palace you will say that in this confinement i had leisure sufficient to make a notebook and to copy my notes so i had and it was my firm intention so to have done but i put it off because i thought it would take up but a few hours time and it could be done any day besides the weather was so excessively hot that for the first week i could do nothing but unbutton my waistcoat and drink sherbet visits of ceremony from mandarins took up much of our time they spoke and moved like machines and it was with much difficulty that our interpreter made us understand the meaning of their formal sentences which were seldom worth the trouble of deciphering we saw them fan themselves drink tea eat sweetmeats and rice and chew betel but it was scarcely worth while to come all the way from europe to see this especially as any common chinese paper or screen would give an adequate idea of these figures in their accustomed attitudes i spent another week in railing at these abominably stupid or unnecessarily cautious creatures of ceremony and made memorandums for an eloquent chapter in my work one morning we were agreeably surprised by a visit from a mandarin of a very different description we were astonished to hear a person in the habit of a chinese and bearing the title of a mandarin address us in french he informed us that he was originally a french jesuit and came over to china with several missionaries from paris but as they were prohibited from promulgating their doctrines in this country most of them had returned to france a few remained assumed the dress and manners of the country and had been elevated to the rank of mandarins as a reward for their learning the conversation of our chinese jesuit was extremely entertaining and instructive he was delighted to hear news from europe and we were eager to obtain from him information respecting china i paid particular attention to him and i was so fortunate as to win his confidence as far as the confidence of a jesuit can be won he came frequently to visit me and did me the honour to spend some hours in my apartment as he made it understood that these were literary visits and as his character for propriety was well established with the government he excited no suspicion and we spent our time most delightfully between books and conversation he gave me by his anecdotes and descriptions an insight into the characters and domestic lives of the inhabitants of pekin which i could not otherwise have obtained his talent for description was admirable and his characters were so new to me that i was in continual ecstasy i called him the chinese la bruyere and anticipating the figure which his portraits would make in my future work thought that i could never sufficiently applaud his eloquence he was glad to lay aside the solemn gravity of a chinese mandarin and to indulge the vivacity of a frenchman his vanity was gratified by my praises and he exerted himself to the utmost to enhance my opinion of his talents at length we had notice that it was the emperors pleasure to receive the embassy at his imperial residence in tartary at jehol the seat of grateful coolness the garden of innumerable trees from the very name of this place i augured that it would prove favourable to the inspirations of genius and determined to date at least one of the chapters or letters of my future work from this delightful retreat the sans souci of china full of this intention i set out upon our expedition into tartary my good friend the jesuit who had a petition to present to the emperor relative to some chinese manuscripts determined to my infinite satisfaction to accompany us to jehol and our conducting mandarin vantadge arranged things so upon our journey that i enjoyed as much of my friends conversation as possible never european travelling in these countries had such advantages as mine i had a companion who was able and willing to instruct me in every minute particular of the manners and every general principle of the government and policy of the people i was in no danger of falling into the ridiculous mistakes of travellers who having but a partial view of things and persons argue absurdly and grossly misrepresent while they intend to be accurate many people as my french mandarin observed reason like voltaires famous traveller who happening to have a drunken landlord and a redhaired landlady at the first inn where he stopped in alsace wrote down among his memorandumsall the men of alsace drunkards all the women redhaired when we arrived at jehol the hurry of preparing for our presentation to the emperor the want of a convenient writingtable and perhaps my habit of procrastination prevented my writing the chapter for my future work or noting down any of the remarks which the jesuit had made upon our journey one morning when i collected my papers and the scraps of memorandums with which the pockets of all my clothes were stuffed i was quite terrified at the heap of confusion and thrust all these materials for my quarto into a canvas bag purposing to lay them smooth in a portfolio the next day but the next day i could do nothing of this sort for we had the british presents to unpack which had arrived from pekin the day after was taken up with our presentation to the emperor and the day after that i had a new scheme in my head the emperor with much solemnity presented with his own hand to our ambassador a casket which he said was the most valuable present he could make to the king of england it contained the miniature pictures of the emperors ancestors with a few lines of poetry annexed to each describing the character and recording the principal events of each monarchs reign it occurred to me that a set of similar portraits and poetical histories of the kings of england would be a proper and agreeable offering to the emperor of china i consulted my friend the french mandarin and he encouraged me by assurances that as far as he could pretend to judge it would be at present peculiarly suited to the emperors taste and that in all probability i should be distinguished by some mark of his approbation or some munificent reward my friend promised to have the miniatures varnished for me in the chinese taste and he undertook to present the work to the emperor when it should be finished as it was supposed that the embassy would spend the whole winter in pekin i thought that i should have time enough to complete the whole series of british sovereigns it was not necessary to be very scrupulous as to the resemblance of my portraits as the emperor of china could not easily detect any errors of this nature fortunately i had brought from london with me striking likenesses of all the kings of england with the principal events of their reign in one large sheet of paper which belonged to a joiningmap of one of my little cousins in the confusion of my packing up i had put it into my trunk instead of a sheet almanack which lay on the same table in the course of my life many lucky accidents have happened to me even in consequence of my own carelessness yet that carelessness has afterward prevented my reaping any permanent advantage from my good fortune upon this occasion i was however determined that no laziness of mine should deprive me of an opportunity of making my fortune i set to work immediately and astonished my friend by the facility with which i made verses it was my custom to retire from the noisy apartments of our palace to a sort of alcove at the end of a long gallery in one of the outer courts where our corps of artillery used to parade after their parade was over the place was perfectly quiet and solitary for the remainder of the day and night i used to sit up late writing and one fine moonlight night i went out of my alcove to walk in the gallery while i composed some lines on our great queen elizabeth i could not finish the last couplet to my fancy i sat down upon an artificial rock which was in the middle of the court leaned my head upon my hand and as i was searching for an appropriate rhyme to glory fell fast asleep a noise like that of a most violent clap of thunder awakened me i was thrown with my face flat upon the ground when i recovered my senses the court was filled with persons some european some chinese seemingly just risen from their beds with lanterns and torches in their hands all of them with faces of consternation asking one another what had happened the ground was covered with scattered fragments of wooden pillars mats and bamboo canework i looked and saw that one end of the gallery in which i had been walking and the alcove were in ruins there was a strong smell of gunpowder i now recollected that i had borrowed a powderhorn from one of the soldiers in the morning and that i had intended to load my pistols but i delayed doing so the horn full of gunpowder lay upon the table in the alcove all day and the pistols out of which i had shaken the old priming when i went out to walk in the gallery i left the candle burning and i suppose during my sleep a spark fell upon the loose gunpowder set fire to that in the horn and blew up the alcove it was built of light wood and cane and communicated only with a canework gallery otherwise the mischief would have been more serious as it was the explosion had alarmed not only all the ambassadors suite who lodged in the palace but many of the chinese in the neighbourhood who could not be made to comprehend how the accident had happened reproaches from all our own people were poured upon me without mercy and in the midst of my contrition i had not for some time leisure to lament the loss of all my kings of england no vestige of them remained and all the labour that i had bestowed upon their portraits and their poetical histories was lost to the emperor of china and to myself what was still worse i could not even utter a syllable of complaint for nobody would sympathize with me all my companions were so much provoked by my negligence and so apprehensive of the bad consequences which might ensue from this accident the chinese who had been alarmed and who departed evidently dissatisfied would certainly mention what had happened to the mandarins of the city and they would report it to the emperor i resolved to apply for advice to my friend the jesuit but he increased instead of diminished our apprehensions he said that the affair was much talked of and misrepresented at jehol and that the chinese naturally timid and suspicious of strangers could not believe that no injury was intended to them and that the explosion was accidental a child had been wounded by the fall of some of the ruins of the alcove which were thrown with great violence into a neighbouring house the butt end of one of my pistols was found in the street and had been carried to the magistrate by the enraged populace as evidence of our evil designs my jesuit observed to me that there was no possibility of reasoning with the prejudices of any nation and he confessed he expected that this unlucky accident would have the most serious consequences he had told me in confidence a circumstance that tended much to confirm this opinion a few days before when the emperor went to examine the british presents of artillery and when the brass mortars were tried though he admired the ingenuity of these instruments of destruction yet he said that he deprecated the spirit of the people who employed them and could not reconcile their improvements in the arts of war with the mild precepts of the religion which they professed my friend the mandarin promised he would do all in his power to make the exact truth known to the emperor and to prevent the evil impressions which the prejudices of the populace and perhaps the designing misrepresentations of the city mandarins might tend to create i must suppose that the good offices of my jesuit were ineffectual and that he either received a positive order to interfere no more in our affairs or that he was afraid of being implicated in our disgrace if he continued his intimacy with me for this was the last visit i ever received from him chapter ii in a few days the embassy had orders to return to pekin the ambassadors palace was fitted up for his winters residence and after our arrival he was arranging his establishment when by a fresh mandate from the emperor we were required to prepare with all possible expedition for our departure from the chinese dominions on monday we received an order to leave pekin the ensuing wednesday and all our remonstrances could procure only a delay of two days various causes were assigned for this peremptory order and among the rest my unlucky accident was mentioned however improbable it might seem that such a trifle could have had so great an effect the idea was credited by many of my companions and i saw that i was looked upon with an evil eye i suffered extremely i have often observed that even remorse for my past negligence has tended to increase the original defect of my character during our whole journey from pekin to canton my sorrow for the late accident was an excuse to myself for neglecting to make either notes or observations when we arrived at canton my time was taken up with certain commissions for my friends at home which i had delayed to execute while at pekin from the idea that we should spend the whole winter there the trunks were on board before all my commissions were ready and i was obliged to pack up several toys and other articles in a basket as to my papers they still remained in the canvass bag into which i had stuffed them at jehol but i was certain of having leisure during our voyage home to arrange them and to post my notes into lockes commonplacebook at the beginning of the voyage however i suffered much from seasickness toward the middle of the time i grew better and indulged myself in the amusement of fishing while the weather was fine when the weather was not inviting in idleness innumerable other petty causes of delay occurred there was so much eating and drinking so much singing and laughing and such frequent cardplaying in the cabin that though i produced my canvass bag above a hundred times i never could accomplish sorting its contents indeed i seldom proceeded farther than to untie the strings one day i had the state cabin fairly to myself and had really begun my work when the steward came to let me know that my chinese basket was just washed overboard in this basket were all the presents and commissions which i had bought at canton for my friends at home i ran to the cabin window and had the mortification to see all my beautiful scarlet calibash boxes the fan for my cousin lucy and the variety of toys which i had bought for my little cousins all floating on the sea far out of my reach i had been warned before that the basket would be washed overboard and had intended to put it into a safe place but unluckily i delayed to do so i was so much vexed with this accident that i could not go on with my writing if it had not been for this interruption i do believe i should that day have accomplished my long postponed task i will not indeed i cannot record all the minute causes which afterwards prevented my executing my intentions the papers were still in the same disorder stuffed into the canvass bag when i arrived in england i promised myself that i would sort them the very day after i got home but visits of congratulation from my friends upon my return induced me to delay doing any thing for the first week the succeeding week i had a multiplicity of engagements all my acquaintance curious to hear a man converse who was fresh from china invited me to dinner and tea parties and i could not possibly refuse these kind invitations and shut myself up in my room like a hackney author to write my father often urged me to begin my quarto for he knew that other gentlemen who went out with the embassy designed to write the history of the voyage and he being a bookseller and used to the ways of authors foresaw what would happen a fortnight after we came home the following advertisement appeared in the papers now in the press and speedily will be published a narrative of the british embassy to china containing the various circumstances of the embassy with accounts of the customs and manners of the chinese and a description of the country towns cities c i never saw my poor father turn so pale or look so angry as when he saw this advertisement he handed it across the breakfast table to me there basil cried he i told you what would happen and you would not believe me but this is the way you have served me all your life and this is the way you will go on to the day of your death putting things off till tomorrow this is the way you have lost every opportunity of distinguishing yourself every chance and you have had many of advancing yourself in the world what signifies all i have done for you or all you can do for yourself your genius and education are of no manner of use why there is that heavy dog as you used to call him at eton johnson look how he is getting on in the world by mere dint of application and sticking steadily to his profession he will beat you at every thing as he beat you at eton in writing verses only in copying them sir my verses every body said were far better than his only unluckily i had not mine finished and copied out in time well sir and that is the very thing i complain of i suppose you will tell me that your voyage to china will be far better than this which is advertised this morning to be sure it will father for i have had opportunities and collected materials which this man whoever he is cannot possibly have obtained i have had such assistance such information from my friend the missionary but what signifies your missionary your information your abilities and your materials cried my father raising his voice your book is not out your book will never be finished or it will be done too late and nobody will read it and then you may throw it into the fire here you have an opportunity of establishing your fame and making yourself a great author at once and if you throw it away basil i give you fair notice i never will pardon you i promised my father that i would set about my work tomorrow and pacified him by repeating that this hasty publication which had just been advertised must be a catchpenny and that it would serve only to stimulate instead of satisfying the public curiosity my quarto i said would appear afterwards with a much better grace and would be sought for by every person of science taste and literature soothed by these assurances my father recovered his goodhumour and trusted to my promise that i would commence my great work the ensuing day i was fully in earnest i went to my canvass bag to prepare my materials alas i found them in a terrible condition the seawater somehow or other had got to them during the voyage and many of my most precious documents were absolutely illegible the notes written in pencil were almost effaced and when i had smoothed the crumpled scraps i could make nothing of them it was with the utmost difficulty i could read even those that were written in ink they were so villainously scrawled and so terribly blotted when i had made out the words i was often at a loss for the sense because i had trusted so much to the excellence of my memory that my notes were never either sufficiently full or accurate ideas which i had thought could never be effaced from my mind were now totally forgotten and i could not comprehend my own mysterious elliptical hints and memorandums i remember spending two hours in trying to make out what the following words could mean hoyallahoyahoya hoyahoywaudihoya at last i recollected that they were merely the sounds of the words used by the chinese sailors in towing the junks and i was much provoked at having wasted my time in trying to remember what was not worth recording another day i was puzzled by the following memorandum w c f h b mmandarinc tradition before j c which after three quarters of an hours study i discovered to mean that the wall of china is feet high feet broad and miles long and that a mandarin told me that according to chinese tradition this wall had been built above years that is before the birth of our saviour on another scrap of paper at the very bottom of the bag i found the words wheazouchanchincuaboocowcaungcimmfoacallachottueng quanshanglincallachotre shansu c all which i found to be a list of towns and villages through which we had passed or palaces that we had seen but how to distinguish these asunder i knew not for all recollection of them was obliterated from my mind and no farther notes respecting them were to be found after many days tiresome attempts i was obliged to give up all hopes of deciphering the most important of my notes those which i had made from the information of the french missionary most of what i had trusted so securely to my memory was defective in some slight circumstances which rendered the whole useless my materials for my quarto shrunk into a very small compass i flattered myself however that the elegance of my composition and the moral and political reflections with which i intended to intersperse the work would compensate for the paucity of facts in my narrative that i might devote my whole attention to the business of writing i determined to leave london where i met with so many temptations to idleness and set off to pay a visit to my uncle lowe who lived in the country in a retired part of england he was a farmer a plain sensible affectionate man and as he had often invited me to come and see him i made no doubt that i should be an agreeable guest i had intended to have written a few lines the week before i set out to say that i was coming but i put it off till at last i thought that it would be useless because i should get there as soon as my letter i had soon reason to regret that i had been so negligent for my appearance at my uncles instead of creating that general joy which i had expected threw the whole house into confusion it happened that there was company in the house and all the beds were occupied while i was taking off my boots i had the mortification to hear my aunt lowe say in a voice of mingled distress and reproach come is hemy goodness what shall we do for a bedhow could he think of coming without writing a line beforehand my goodness i wish he was a hundred miles off im sure my uncle shook hands with me and welcomed me to old england again and to his house which he said should always be open to all his relations i saw that he was not pleased and as he was a man who according to the english phrase scorned to keep a thing long upon his mind he let me know before he had finished his first glass of ale to my good health that he was inclinable to take it very unkind indeed that after all he had said about my writing a letter now and then just to say how i did and how i was going on i had never put pen to paper to answer one of his letters since the day i first promised to write which was the day i went to eton school till this present time of speaking i had no good apology to make for myself but i attempted all manner of excuses that i had put off writing from day to day and from year to year till i was ashamed to write at all that it was not from want of affection c my uncle took up his pipe and puffed away while i spoke and when i had said all that i could devise i sat silent for i saw by the looks of all present that i had not mended the matter my aunt pursed up her mouth and wondered if she must tell the plain truth that so great a scholar as mr basil could not when it must give him so little trouble to indite a letter write a few lines to an uncle who had begged it so often and who had ever been a good friend say nothing of that said my uncle i scorn to have that put into account i loved the boy and all i could do was done of course thats nothing to the purpose but the longest day i have to live ill never trouble him with begging a letter from him no more for now i see he does not care a fig for me and of course i do not care a fig for he lucy hold up your head girl and dont look as if you were going to be hanged my cousin lucy was the only person present who seemed to have any compassion for me and as i lifted up my eyes to look at her when her father spoke she appeared to me quite beautiful i had always thought her a pretty girl but she never struck me as any thing very extraordinary till this moment i was very sorry that i had offended my uncle i saw he was seriously displeased and that his pride of which he had a large portion had conquered his affection for me tis easier to lose a friend than gain one young man said he and take my word for it as this world goes tis a foolish thing to lose a friend for want of writing a letter or so heres seven years i have been begging a letter now and then and could not get one never wrote a line to me before you went to china should not have known a word about it but for my wife who met you by mere chance in london and gave you some little commission for the children which it seems you forgot till it was too late then after you came back never wrote to me and even not to write a line to give one notice of his coming here tonight added my aunt oh as to that replied my uncle he can never find our larder at a nonplus we have no dishes for him dressed chinese fashion but as to roast beef of old england which i take it is worth all the foreign meats in the world he is welcome to it and to as much of it as he pleases i shall always be glad to see him as a relation and so forth as a good christian ought but not as the favourite he used to bethat is out of the question for things cannot be both done and undone and time thats past cannot come back again that is clear and cold water thrown on a warm heart puts it out and theres an end of the matter lucy bring me my nightcap lucy i think sighed once and i am sure i sighed above a dozen times but my uncle put on his red nightcap and heeded us not i was in hopes that the next morning he would have been better disposed towards me after having slept off his anger the moment that i appeared in the morning the children who had been in bed when i arrived the preceding night crowded round me and one cried cousin basil have you brought me the tumbler you promised me from china cousin basil wheres my boat o basil did you bring me the calibash box that you promised me and pray cried my aunt did you bring my lucy the fan that she commissioned you to get no ill warrant said my uncle he that cannot bring himself to write a letter in the course of seven years to his friends will not be apt to trouble his head about their foolish commissions when he is in foreign parts though i was abashed and vexed i summoned sufficient courage to reply that i had not neglected to execute the commissions of any of my friends but that by an unlucky accident the basket into which i had packed all their things was washed overboard hum said my uncle and pray said my aunt why were they all packed in a basket why were not they put into your trunks where they might have been safe i was obliged to confess that i had delayed to purchase them till after we left pekin and that the trunks were put on board before they were all procured at canton my vile habit of procrastination how did i suffer for it at this moment lucy began to make excuses for me which made me blame myself the more she said that as to her fan it would have been of little or no use to her that she was sure she should have broken it before it had been a week in her possession and that therefore she was glad that she had it not the children were clamorous in their grief for the loss of the boat the tumbler and the calibash boxes but lucy contrived to quiet them in time and to make my peace with all the younger part of the family to reinstate me in my uncles good graces was impossible he would only repeat to herthe young man has lost my good opinion he will never do any good from a child upward he has always put off doing every thing he ought to do he will never do any good he will never be any thing my aunt was not my friend because she suspected that lucy liked me and she thought her daughter might do much better than marry a man who had quitted the profession to which he was bred and was as it seemed little likely to settle to any other my pretensions to genius and my literary qualifications were of no advantage to me either with my uncle or my aunt the one being only a good farmer and the other only a good housewife they contented themselves with asking me coolly what i had ever made by being an author and when i was forced to answer nothing they smiled upon me in scorn my pride was roused and i boasted that i expected to receive at least l for my voyage to china which i hoped to complete in a few weeks my aunt looked at me with astonishment and to prove to her that i was not passing the bounds of truth i added that one of my travelling companions had as i was credibly informed received l for his narrative to which mine would certainly be far superior when it is done and when you have the money in your hand to show us i shall believe you said my aunt and then and not till then you may begin to think of my lucy he shall never have her said my uncle he will never come to good he shall never have her the time which i ought to have spent in composing my quarto i now wasted in fruitless endeavours to recover the good graces of my uncle love assisted as usual by the spirit of opposition took possession of my heart and how can a man in love write quartos i became more indolent than ever for i persuaded myself that no exertions could overcome my uncles prejudice against me and without his approbation i despaired of ever obtaining lucys hand during my stay at my uncles i received several letters from my father inquiring how my work went on and urging me to proceed as rapidly as possible lest another voyage to china which it was reported a gentleman of high reputation was now composing should come out and preclude mine for ever i cannot account for my folly the power of habit is imperceptible to those who submit passively to its tyranny from day to day i continued procrastinating and sighing till at last the fatal news came that sir george stauntons history of the embassy to china in two volumes quarto was actually published there was an end of all my hopes i left my uncles house in despair i dreaded to see my father he overwhelmed me with wellmerited reproaches all his expectations of my success in life were disappointed he was now convinced that i should never make my talents useful to myself or to my family a settled melancholy appeared in his countenance he soon ceased to urge me to any exertion and i idled away my time deploring that i could not marry my lucy and resolving upon a thousand schemes for advancing myself but always delaying their execution till tomorrow chapter iii two years passed away in this manner about the end of which time my poor father died i cannot describe the mixed sensations of grief and selfreproach which i felt at his death i knew that i had never fulfilled his sanguine prophecies and that disappointment had long preyed upon his spirits this was a severe shock to me i was roused from a state of stupefaction by the necessity of acting as my fathers executor among his bequests was one which touched me particularly because i was sensible that it was made from kindness to me i give and bequeath the fulllength picture of my son basil taken when a boy a very promising boy at eton school to my brother lowei should say to my sweet niece lucy lowe but am afraid of giving offence i sent the picture to my uncle lowe with a copy of the words of the will and a letter written in the bitterness of grief my uncle who was of an affectionate though positive temper returned me the following answer dear nephew basil taking it for granted you feel as much as i do it being natural you should and even more i shall not refuse to let my lucy have the picture bequeathed to me by my good brother who could not offend me dying never having done so living as to you basil this is no time for reproaches which would be cruel but without meaning to look back to the past i must add that i mean nothing by giving the picture to lucy but respect for my poor brothers memory my opinions remaining as heretofore i think it a duty to my girl to be steady in my determination convinced that no man not meaning you in particular of what i call a putting off temper could make her happy she being too mild to scold and bustle and do the mans business in a family this is the whole of my mind without malice for how could i if i were malicious which i am not bear malice and at such a time as this against my own nephew and as to anger that is soon over with me and though i said i never would forgive you basil for not writing to me for seven years i do now forgive you with all my heart so let that be off your conscience and now i hope we shall be very good friends all the rest of our lives that is to say putting lucy out of the question for in my opinion it is a disagreeable thing to have any bickerings between near relations so my dear nephew wishing you all health and happiness i hope you will now settle to business my wife tells me she hears you are left in a good way by my poor brothers care and industry and she sends her love to you in which all the family unite and hoping you will write from time to time i remain my dear nephew basil your affectionate uncle thomas lowe my aunt lowe added a postscript inquiring more particularly into the state of my affairs i answered by return of post that my good father had left me much richer than i either expected or deserved his credit in the booksellers line was extensive and well established his shop was well furnished and he had a considerable sum of money in bank beside many good debts due from authors to whom he had advanced cash my aunt lowe was governed by her interest as decidedly as my uncle was swayed by his humour and affection and of course became more favourable toward me when she found that my fortune was better than she had expected she wrote to exhort me to attend to my business and to prove to my uncle that i could cure myself of my negligent habits she promised to befriend me and to do every thing to obtain my uncles consent to my union with lucy upon condition that i would for six months steadily persevere or as she expressed herself show that i could come to good the motive was powerful sufficiently powerful to conquer the force of inveterate habit i applied resolutely to business and supported the credit which my fathers punctuality had obtained from his customers during the course of six entire months i am not conscious of having neglected or delayed to do anything of consequence that i ought to have done except whetting my razor my aunt lowe faithfully kept her word with me and took every opportunity of representing in the most favourable manner to my uncle the reformation that love had wrought in my character i went to the country full of hope at the end of my six probationary months my uncle however with a mixture of obstinacy and good sense replied to my aunt in my presence this reformation that you talk of wife wont last twas begun by love as you say and will end with love as i say you and i know my dear love lasts little longer than the honeymoon and lucy is not or ought not to be such a simpleton as to look only to what a husband will be for one short month of his life when she is to live with him for twenty thirty may be forty long years and no help for it let him turn out what he will i beg your pardon nephew basil but where my lucys happiness is at stake i must speak my mind as a father should my opinion lucy is that he is not a whit changed and so i now let you understand if you marry the man it must be without my consent lucy turned exceedingly pale and i grew extremely angry my uncle had as usual recourse to his pipe and to all the eloquence which love and indignation could inspire he would only answer between the whiffs of his smoking if my girl marries you nephew basil i say she must do so without my consent lucys affection for me struggled for some time with her sense of duty to her father her mother supported my cause with much warmth having once declared in my favour she considered herself as bound to maintain her side of the question it became a trial of power between my uncle and aunt and their passions rose so high in the conflict that lucy trembled for the consequences one day she took an opportunity of speaking to me in private my dear basil said she we must part you see that i can never be yours with my fathers consent and without it i could never be happy even in being united to you i will not be the cause of misery to all those whom i love best in the world i will not set my father and mother at variance i cannot bear to hear the altercations which rise higher and higher between them every day let us part and all will be right again it was in vain that i combated her resolution i alternately resented and deplored the weakness which induced lucy to sacrifice her own happiness and mine to the obstinate prejudices of a father yet i could not avoid respecting her the more for her adhering to what she believed to be her duty the sweetness of temper gentleness of disposition and filial piety which she showed on this trying occasion endeared her to me beyond expression her father notwithstanding his determination to be as immoveable as a rock began to manifest symptoms of internal agitation and one night after breaking his pipe and throwing down the tongs and poker twice which lucy twice replaced he exclaimed lucy girl you are a fool and what is worse you are grown into a mere shadow you are breaking my heart why i know this man this basil this cursed nephew of mine will never come to good but cannot you marry him without my consent upon this hint lucys scruples vanished and a few days afterward we were married prudence virtue pride love every strong motive which can act upon the human mind stimulated me to exert myself to prove that i was worthy of this most amiable woman a year passed away and my lucy said that she had no reason to repent of her choice she took the most affectionate pains to convince her father that she was perfectly happy and that he had judged of me too harshly his delight at seeing his daughter happy vanquished his reluctance to acknowledge that he had changed his opinion i never shall forget the pleasure i felt at hearing him confess that he had been too positive and that his lucy had made a good match for herself alas when i had obtained this testimony in my favour when i had established a character for exertion and punctuality i began to relax in my efforts to deserve it i indulged myself in my old habits of procrastination my customers and country correspondents began to complain that their letters were unanswered and that their orders were neglected their remonstrances became more and more urgent in process of time and nothing but actually seeing the dates of their letters could convince me that they were in the right and that i was in the wrong an old friend of my fathers a rich gentleman who loved books and bought all that were worth buying sent me in march an order for books to a considerable amount in april he wrote to remind me of his first letter my dear sir april last month i wrote to request that you would send me the following booksi have been much disappointed by not receiving them and i request you will be so good as to forward them immediately i am my dear sir yours sincerely j c in may he wrote to me again dear sir i am much surprised at not having yet received the books i wrote for last marchbeg to know the cause of this delay and am dear sir yours c j c a fortnight afterward as i was packing up the books for this gentleman i received the following sir as it is now above a quarter of a year since i wrote to you for books which you have not yet sent to me i have been obliged to apply to another bookseller i am much concerned at being compelled to this i had a great regard for your father and would not willingly break off my connexion with his son but really you have tried my patience too far last year i never had from you any one new publication until it was in the hands of all my neighbours and i have often been under the necessity of borrowing books which i had bespoken from you months before i hope you will take this as a warning and that you will not use any of your other friends as you have used sir your humble servant j c this reprimand had little effect upon me because at the time when i received it i was intent upon an object in comparison with which the trade of a bookseller appeared absolutely below my consideration i was inventing a set of new taxes for the minister for which i expected to be liberally rewarded i was ever searching for some short cut to the temple of fame instead of following the beaten road i was much encouraged by persons intimately connected with those high in power to hope that my new taxes would be adopted and i spent my time in attendance upon my patrons leaving the care of my business to my foreman a young man whose head the whole week was intent upon riding out on sunday with such a master and such a foreman affairs could not go on well my lucy notwithstanding her great respect for my abilities and her confidence in my promises often hinted that she feared ministers might not at last make me amends for the time i devoted to my system of taxation but i persisted the file of unanswered letters was filled even to the top of the wire the drawer of unsettled accounts made me sigh profoundly whenever it was accidentally opened i soon acquired a horror of business and practised all the arts of apology evasion and invisibility to which procrastinators must sooner or later be reduced my conscience gradually became callous and i could without compunction promise with a face of truth to settle an account tomorrow without having the slightest hope of keeping my word i was a publisher as well as a bookseller and was assailed by a tribe of rich and poor authors the rich complained continually of delays that affected their fame the poor of delays that concerned their interest and sometimes their very existence i was cursed with a compassionate as well as with a procrastinating temper and i frequently advanced money to my poor authors to compensate for my neglect to settle their accounts and to free myself from the torment of their reproaches they soon learned to take a double advantage of my virtues and my vices the list of my poor authors increased for i was an encourager of genius i trusted to my own judgment concerning every performance that was offered to me and i was often obliged to pay for having neglected to read or to send to press these multifarious manuscripts after having kept a poor devil of an author upon the tenterhooks of expectation for an unconscionable time i could not say to him sir i have never opened your manuscript there it is in that heap of rubbish take it away for heavens sake no hardened as i was i never failed to make some compliment or some retribution and my compliments were often in the end the most expensive species of retribution my rich authors soon deserted me and hurt my credit in the circles of literary fashion by their clamours i had ample experience yet i have never been able to decide whether i would rather meet the desperate misery of a famishing pamphleteer or the exasperated vanity of a rich amateur every one of my authors seemed convinced that the fate of europe or the salvation of the world depended upon the publication of their book on some particular day while i all the time was equally persuaded that their works were mere trash in comparison with my new system of taxation consequently i postponed their business and pursued my favourite tax scheme i have the pride and pleasure to say that all my taxes were approved and adopted and brought in an immense increase of revenue to the state but i have the mortification to be obliged to add that i never directly or indirectly received the slightest pecuniary reward and the credit of all i had proposed was snatched from me by a rogue who had no other merit than that of being shaved sooner than i was one frosty morning if i had not put off whetting my razor the preceding day this would not have happened to such a trifling instance of my unfortunate habit of procrastination must i attribute one of the most severe disappointments of my life a rival financier who laid claim to the prior invention and suggestion of my principal taxes was appointed to meet me at the house of my great man at ten oclock in the morning my opponent was punctual i was half an hour too late his claims were established mine were rejected because i was not present to produce my proofs when i arrived at my patrons the insolent porter shut the door in my face and so ended all hopes from my grand system of taxation i went home and shut myself up in my room to give vent to my grief at leisure but i was not permitted to indulge my sorrow long in peace i was summoned by my foreman to come down stairs to one of my enraged authors who positively refused to quit the shop without seeing me of the whole irritable race the man who was now waiting to see me was the most violent he was a man of some genius and learning with great pretensions and a vindictive spirit he was poor yet lived among the rich and his arrogance could be equalled only by his susceptibility he was known in our house by the name of thaumaturgos the retailer of wonders because he had sent me a manuscript with this title and once or twice a week we received a letter or message from him to inquire when it would be published i had unfortunately mislaid this precious manuscript under this circumstance to meet the author was almost as dreadful as to stand the shot of a pistol down stairs i went unprovided with any apology sir cried my angry man suppressing his passion as you do not find it worth your while to publish thaumaturges you will be so obliging as to let me have my manuscript pardon me my dear sir interrupted i it shall certainly appear this spring spring zounds sir dont talk to me of spring why you told me it should be out at christmas you said it should be out last june you promised to send it to press before last easter is this the way i am to be treated pardon me my dear sir i confess i have used you and the world very ill but the pressure of business must plead my apology look you mr basil lowe i am not come here to listen to commonplace excuses i have been ill used and know it and the world shall know it i am not ignorant of the designs of my enemies but no cabal shall succeed against me thaumaturgos shall not be suppressed thaumaturgos shall see the light thaumaturgos shall have justice in spite of all the machinations of malice sir i demand my manuscript sir it shall be sent to you tomorrow tomorrow sir will not do for me i have heard of tomorrow from you this twelvemonth past i will have my manuscript today i do not leave this spot without thaumaturgos thus driven to extremities i was compelled to confess that i could not immediately lay my hand upon it but i added that the whole house should be searched for it instantly it is impossible to describe the indignation which my author expressed i ran away to search the house he followed me and stood by while i rummaged in drawers and boxes full of papers and tossed over heaps of manuscripts no thaumaturges could be found the author declared that he had no copy of the manuscript that he had been offered l for it by another bookseller and that for his own part he would not lose it for twice that sum lost however it evidently was he stalked out of my house bidding me prepare to abide by the consequences i racked my memory in vain to discover what i had done with this bundle of wonders i could recollect only that i carried it a week in my greatcoat pocket resolving every day to lock it up and that i went to the mount coffeehouse in this coat several times these recollections were of little use a suit was instituted against me for the value of thaumaturgos and the damages were modestly laid by the author at eight hundred guineas the cause was highly interesting to all the tribe of london booksellers and authors the court was crowded at an early hour several people of fashion who were partisans of the plaintiff appeared in the gallery many more who were his enemies attended on purpose to hear my counsel ridicule and abuse the pompous thaumaturgos i had great hopes myself that we might win the day especially as the lawyer on the opposite side was my old competitor at eton that johnson whom i had always considered as a mere laborious drudge and a very heavy fellow how this heavy fellow got up in the world and how he contrived to supply by dint of study the want of natural talents i cannot tell but this i know to my cost that he managed his clients cause so ably and made a speech so full of sound law and clear sense as effectually to decide the cause against me i was condemned to pay l damages and costs of suit five hundred pounds lost by delaying to lock up a bundle of papers every body pitied me because the punishment seemed so disproportioned to the offence the pity of every body however did not console me for the loss of my money chapter iv the trial was published in the papers my uncle lowe read it and all my credit with him was lost for ever lucy did not utter a syllable of reproach or complaint but she used all her gentle influence to prevail upon me to lay aside the various schemes which i had formed for making a rapid fortune and urged me to devote my whole attention to my business the loss which i had sustained though great was not irremediable i was moved more by my wifes kindness than i could have been by the most outrageous invective but what is kindness what is affection what are the best resolutions opposed to allpowerful habit i put off settling my affairs till i had finished a pamphlet against government which my friends and the critics assured me would make my fortune by attaching to my shop all the opposition members my pamphlet succeeded was highly praised and loudly abused answers appeared and i was called upon to provide rejoinders time thus passed away and while i was gaining fame i every hour lost money i was threatened with bankruptcy i threw aside my pamphlets and in the utmost terror and confusion began too late to look into my affairs i now attempted too much i expected to repair by bustle the effects of procrastination the nervous anxiety of my mind prevented me from doing any thing well whatever i was employed about appeared to me of less consequence than a hundred other things which ought to be done the letter that i was writing or the account that i was settling was but one of a multitude which had all equal claims to be expedited immediately my courage failed i abandoned my business in despair a commission of bankruptcy was taken out against me all my goods were seized and i became a prisoner in the kings bench my wifes relations refused to give me any assistance but her father offered to receive her and her little boy on condition that she would part from me and spend the remainder of her days with them this she positively refused and i never shall forget the manner of her refusal her character rose in adversity with the utmost feminine gentleness and delicacy she had a degree of courage and fortitude which i have seldom seen equalled in any of my own sex she followed me to prison and supported my spirits by a thousand daily instances of kindness during eighteen months that she passed with me in a prison which we then thought must be my abode for life she never by word or look reminded me that i was the cause of our misfortunes on the contrary she drove this idea from my thoughts with all the address of female affection i cannot even at this distance of time recall these things to memory without tears what a woman what a wife had i reduced to distress i never saw her even in the first months of our marriage so cheerful and so tender as at this period she seemed to have no existence but in me and in our little boy of whom she was dotingly fond he was at this time just able to run about and talk his playful caresses his thoughtless gaiety and at times a certain tone of compassion for poor papa were very touching alas he little foresaw but let me go on with my history if i can without anticipation among my creditors was a mr nun a papermaker who from his frequent dealings with me had occasion to see something of my character and of my wifes he admired her and pitied me he was in easy circumstances and delighted in doing all the good in his power one morning my lucy came into my room with a face radiant with joy my love said she here is mr nun below waiting to see you but he says he will not see you till i have told you the good news he has got all our creditors to enter into a compromise and to set you at liberty i was transported with joy and gratitude our benevolent friend was waiting in a hackneycoach to carry us away from prison when i began to thank him he stopped me with a blunt declaration that i was not a bit obliged to him for that if i had been a man of straw he would have done just the same for the sake of my wife whom he looked upon to be one or other the best woman he had ever seen mrs nun always excepted he proceeded to inform me how he had settled my affairs and how he had obtained from my creditors a small allowance for the immediate support of myself and family he had given up the third part of a considerable sum due to himself as my own house was shut up he insisted upon taking us home with him mrs nun he said had provided a good dinner and he must not have her ducks and green peas upon the table and no friends to eat them never were ducks and green peas more acceptable never was a dinner eaten with more appetite or given with more goodwill i have often thought of this dinner and compared the hospitality of this simplehearted man with the ostentation of great folks who give splendid entertainments to those who do not want them in trifles and in matters of consequence this mr nun was one of the most liberal and unaffectedly generous men i ever knew but the generous actions of men in middle life are lost in obscurity no matter they do not act from a love of fame they act from a better motive and they have their reward in their own hearts as i was passing through mr nuns warehouse i was thinking of writing something on this subject but whether it should be a poetic effusion in the form of an ode to him who least expects it or a prose work under the title of modern parallels in the manner of plutarch i had not decided when i was roused from my reverie by my wife who pointing to a large bale of paper that was directed to ezekiel croft merchant philadelphia asked me if i knew that this gentleman was a very near relation of her mother is he indeed said mr nun then i can assure you that you have a relation of whom you have no occasion to be ashamed he is one of the most respectable merchants in philadelphia he was not very rich when he left this country about six years ago said lucy he has a very good fortune now answered mr nun and has he made this very good fortune in six years cried i my dear lucy i did not know that you had any relations in america i have a great mind to go over there myself away from all our friends said lucy i shall be ashamed replied i to see them after all that has happened a bankrupt cannot have many friends the best thing that i can possibly do is to go over to a new world where i may establish a new character and make a new fortune but we must not forget said mr nun that in the new world as in the old one a character and a fortune must be made by much the same means and forgive me if i add the same bad habits that are against a man in one country will be as much against him in another true thought i as i recollected at this instant my unfortunate voyage to china but now that the idea of going to america had come into my mind i saw so many chances of success in my favour and i felt so much convinced i should not relapse into my former faults that i could not abandon the scheme my lucy consented to accompany me she spent a week in the country with her father and friends by my particular desire and they did all they could to prevail upon her to stay with them promising to take the best possible care of her and her little boy during my absence but she steadily persisted in her determination to accompany her husband i was not too late in going on shipboard this time and during the whole voyage i did not lose any of my goods for in the first place i had very few goods to lose and in the next my wife took the entire charge of those few and now behold me safely landed at philadelphia with one hundred pounds in my pocketa small sum of money but many from yet more trifling beginnings had grown rich in america my wifes relation mr croft had not so much as i was told when he left england many passengers who came over in the same ship with me had not half so much several of them were indeed wretchedly poor among others there was an irishman who was known by the name of barny a contraction i believe for barnaby as to his surname he could not undertake to spell it but he assured me there was no better this man with many of his relatives had come to england according to their custom during harvesttime to assist in reaping because they gain higher wages than in their own country barny heard that he should get still higher wages for labour in america and accordingly he and his two sons lads of eighteen and twenty took their passage for philadelphia a merrier mortal i never saw we used to hear him upon deck continually singing or whistling his irish tunes and i should never have guessed that this mans life had been a series of hardships and misfortunes when we were leaving the ship i saw him to my great surprise crying bitterly and upon inquiring what was the matter he answered that it was not for himself but for his sons he was grieving because they were to be made redemptionmen that is they were to be bound to work during a certain time for the captain or for whomever he pleased till the money due for their passage should be paid though i was somewhat surprised at any ones thinking of coming on board a vessel without having one farthing in his pocket yet i could not forbear paying the money for this poor fellow he dropped down on the deck upon both his knees as suddenly as if he had been shot and holding up his hands to heaven prayed first in irish and then in english with fervent fluency that i and mine might never want that i might live long to reign over him that success might attend my honour wherever i went and that i might enjoy for evermore all sorts of blessings and crowns of glory as i had an english prejudice in favour of silent gratitude i was rather disgusted by all this eloquence i turned away abruptly and got into the boat which waited to carry me to shore as we rowed away i looked at my wife and child and reproached myself with having indulged in the luxury of generosity perhaps at their expense my wifes relation mr croft received us better than she expected and worse than i hoped he had the face of an acute moneymaking man his manners were methodical caution was in his eye and prudence in all his motions in our first half hours conversation he convinced me that he deserved the character he had obtained of being upright and exact in all his dealings his ideas were just and clear but confined to the objects immediately relating to his business as to his heart he seemed to have no notion of general philanthropy but to have perfectly learned by rote his duty to his neighbour he appeared disposed to do charitable and goodnatured actions from reason and not from feeling because they were proper not merely because they were agreeable i felt that i should respect but never love him and that he would never either love or respect me because the virtue which he held in the highest veneration was that in which i was most deficientpunctuality but i will give as nearly as i can my first conversation with him and from that a better idea of his character may be formed than i can afford by any description i presented to him mr nuns letter of introduction and mentioned that my wife had the honour of being related to him he perused mr nuns letter very slowly i was determined not to leave him in any doubt respecting who and what i was and i briefly told him the particulars of my history he listened with immoveable attention and when i had finished he said you have not yet told me what your views are in coming to america i replied that my plans were not yet fixed but of course said he you cannot have left home without forming some plan for the future may i ask what line of life you mean to pursue i answered that i was undetermined and meant to be guided by circumstances circumstances said he may i request you to explain yourself more fully for i do not precisely understand to what circumstances you allude i was provoked with the man for being so slow of apprehension but when driven to the necessity of explaining i found that i did not myself understand what i meant i changed my ground and lowering my tone of confidence said that as i was totally ignorant of the country i should wish to be guided by the advice of better informed persons and that i begged leave to address myself to him as having had the most successful experience after a considerable pause he replied it was a hazardous thing to give advice but that as my wife was his relation and as he held it a duty to assist his relations he should not decline giving meall the advice in his power i bowed and felt chilled all over by his manner and not only my advice continued he but my assistancein reason i said i was much obliged to him not in the least young man you are not in the least obliged to me yet for i have done nothing for you this was true and not knowing what to say i was silent and that which i may be able to do for you in future must depend as much upon yourself as upon me in the first place before i can give any advice i must know what you are worth in the world my worth in money i told him with a forced smile was but very trifling indeed with some hesitation i named the sum and you have a wife and child to support said he shaking his head and your child is too young and your wife too delicate to work they will be sad burdens upon your hands these are not the things for america why did you bring them with you but as that is done and cannot be mended continued he we must make the best of it and support them you say you are ignorant of the country i must explain to you then how money is to be made here and by whom the class of labourers make money readily if they are industrious because they have high wages and constant employment artificers and mechanics carpenters shipwrights wheelwrights smiths bricklayers masons get rich here without difficulty from the same causes but all these things are out of the question for you you have head not hands i perceive now mere head in the line of bookmaking or bookselling brings in but poor profit in this country the sale for imported books is extensive and our printers are doing something by subscription here in philadelphia and in new york they tell me but london is the place for a good bookseller to thrive and you come from london where you tell me you were a bankrupt i would not advise you to have any thing more to do with bookselling or bookmaking then as to becoming a planter our planters if they are skilful and laborious thrive well but you have not capital sufficient to clear land and build a house or hire servants to do the work for which you are not yourself sufficiently robust besides i do not imagine you know much of agricultural concerns or country business and even to oversee and guide others experience is necessary the life of a back settler i do not advise because you and your wife are not equal to it you are not accustomed to live in a loghouse or to feed upon racoons and squirrels not to omit the constant dread if not imminent danger of being burnt in your beds or scalped by the indians with whom you would be surrounded upon the whole i see no line of life that promises well for you but that of a merchant and i see no means of your getting into this line without property and without credit except by going into some established house as a clerk you are a good penman and ready accountant i think you tell me and i presume you have a sufficient knowledge of bookkeeping with sobriety diligence and honesty you may do well in this way and may look forward to being a partner and in a lucrative situation some years hence this is the way i managed and i raised myself by degrees to what you see it is true i was not at first encumbered with a wife and young child in due time i married my masters daughter which was a great furtherance to me but then on the other hand your wife is my relation and to be married to the relation of a rich merchant is next best to not being married at all in your situation i told you i thought it my duty to proffer assistance as well as advice so take up your abode with me for a fortnight in that time i shall be able to judge whether you are capable of being a clerk and if you and i should suit we will talk farther you understand that i enter into no engagement and make no promise but shall be glad to lodge you and your wife and little boy for a fortnight and it will be your own fault and must be your own loss if the visit turns out waste of timei cannot stay to talk to you any longer at present added he pulling out his watch for i have business and business waits for no man go back to your inn for my relation and her little one we dine at two precisely i left mr crofts house with a vague indescribable feeling of dissatisfaction and disappointment but when i arrived at my inn and repeated all that had passed to my wife she seemed quite surprised and delighted by the civil and friendly manner in which this gentleman had behaved she tried to reason the matter with me but there is no reasoning with imagination the fact was mr croft had destroyed certain vague and visionary ideas that i had indulged of making by some unknown means a rapid fortune in america and to be reduced to real life and sink into a clerk in a merchants countinghouse was mortification and misery lucy in vain dwelt upon the advantage of having found immediately upon my arrival in philadelphia a certain mode of employment and a probability of rising to be a partner in one of the first mercantile houses if i went on steadily for a few years i was forced to acknowledge that her relation was very good that i was certainly very fortunate and that i ought to think myself very much obliged to mr croft but after avowing all this i walked up and down the room in melancholy reverie for a considerable length of time my wife reminded me repeatedly that mr croft said he dined precisely at two oclock that he was a very punctual man that it was a long walk as i had found it from the inn to his house that i had better dress myself for dinner and that my clean shirt and cravat were ready for me i still walked up and down the room in reverie till my wife was completely ready had dressed the child and held up my watch before my eyes to show me that it wanted but ten minutes of two i then began to dress in the greatest hurry imaginable and unluckily as i was pulling on my silk stocking i tore a hole in the leg or as my wife expressed it a stitch dropped and i was forced to wait while she repaired the evil certainly this operation of taking up a stitch as i am instructed to call it is one of the slowest operations in nature or rather one of the most tedious and teazing manoeuvres of art though the most willing and the most dexterous fingers that ever touched a needle were employed in my service i thought the work would never be finished at last i was hosed and shod and out we set it struck a quarter past two as we left the house we came to mr crofts in the middle of dinner he had a large company at table every body was disturbed my lucy was a stranger to mrs croft and was to be introduced and nothing could be more awkward and embarrassing than our entree and introduction there were such compliments and apologies such changing of places such shuffling of chairs and running about of servants that i thought we should never be seated in the midst of the bustle my little chap began to roar most horribly and to struggle to get away from a black servant who was helping him up on his chair the childs terror at the sudden approach of the negro could not be conquered nor could he by any means be quieted mrs croft at last ordered the negro out of the room the roaring ceased and nothing but the childs sobs were heard for some instants the guests were all silent and had ceased eating mrs croft was vexed because every thing was cold mr croft was much discomfited and said not a syllable more than was absolutely necessary as master of the house i never ate or rather i was never at a more disagreeable dinner i was in pain for lucy as well as for myself her colour rose up to her temples i cursed myself a hundred times for not having gone to dress in time at length to my great relief the cloth was taken away but even when we came to the wine after dinner the cold formality of my host continued unabated and i began to fear that he had taken an insurmountable dislike to me and that i should lose all the advantages of his protection and assistance advantages which rose considerably in my estimation when i apprehended i was upon the point of losing them soon after dinner a young gentleman of the name of hudson joined the company his manners and appearance were prepossessing he was frank and wellbred and the effect of his politeness was soon felt as if by magic for every body became at their ease his countenance was full of life and fire and though he said nothing that showed remarkable abilities everything he said pleased as soon as he found that i was a stranger he addressed his conversation principally to me i recovered my spirits exerted myself to entertain him and succeeded he was delighted to hear news from england and especially from london a city which he said he had an ardent desire to visit when he took leave of me in the evening he expressed very warmly the wish to cultivate my acquaintance and i was the more flattered and obliged by this civility because i was certain that he knew exactly my situation and circumstances mrs croft having explained them to him very fully even in my hearing chapter v in the course of the ensuing week young mr hudson and i saw one another almost every day and our mutual liking for each others company increased he introduced me to his father who had been a planter and having made a large fortune came to reside at philadelphia to enjoy himself as he said for the remainder of his days he lived in what the sober americans called a most luxurious and magnificent style the best company in philadelphia met at his house and he delighted particularly in seeing those who had convivial talents and who would supply him with wit and gaiety in which he was naturally rather deficient on my first visit i perceived that his son had boasted of me as one of the best companions in the world and i determined to support the character that had been given of me i told two or three good stories and sang two or three good songs the company were charmed with me old mr hudson was particularly delighted he gave me a pressing general invitation to his house and most of the principal guests followed his example i was not a little elated with this success mr croft was with me at this entertainment and i own i was peculiarly gratified by feeling that i at once became conspicuous by my talents in a company where he was apparently of no consequence notwithstanding all his wealth and prudence as we went home together he said to me very gravely i would not advise you mr basil lowe to accept of all these invitations nor to connect yourself intimately with young hudson the society at mr hudsons is very well for those who have made a fortune and want to spend it but for those who have a fortune to make in my opinion it is not only useless but dangerous i was in no humour at this moment to profit by this sober advice especially as i fancied it might be dictated in some degree by envy of my superior talents and accomplishments my wife however supported his advice by many excellent and kind arguments she observed that these people who invited me to their houses as a good companion followed merely their own pleasure and would never be of any real advantage to me that mr croft on the contrary showed from the first hour when i applied to him a desire to serve me that he had pointed out the means of establishing myself and that in the advice he gave me he could be actuated only by a wish to be of use to me that it was more reasonable to suspect him of despising than of envying talents which were not directed to the grand object of gaining money good sense from the lips of a woman whom a man loves has a mighty effect upon his understanding especially if he sincerely believe that the woman has no desire to rule this was my singular case i promised lucy i would refuse all invitations for the ensuing fortnight and devote myself to whatever business mr croft might devise no one could be more assiduous than i was for ten days and i perceived that mr croft though it was not his custom to praise was well satisfied with my diligence unluckily on the eleventh day i put off in the morning making out an invoice which he left for me to do and i was persuaded in the evening to go out with young mr hudson i had expressed in conversation with him some curiosity about the american frogconcerts of which i had read in modern books of travels extraordinary accounts mr hudson persuaded me to accompany him to a swamp at some miles distance from philadelphia to hear one of these concerts the performance lasted some time and it was late before we returned to town i went to bed tired and waked in the morning with a cold which i had caught by standing so long in the swamp i lay an hour after i was called in hopes of getting rid of my cold when i was at last up and dressed i recollected my invoice and resolved to do it the first thing after breakfast but unluckily i put it off till i had looked for some lines in homers battle of the frogs and mice there was no homer as you may guess in mr crofts house and i went to a booksellers to borrow one he had popes iliad and odyssey but no battle of the frogs and mice i walked over half the town in search of it at length i found it and was returning in triumph with homer in each pocket when at the door of mr crofts house i found half a dozen porters with heavy loads upon their backs where are you going my good fellows said i to the quay sir with the cargo for the betsy my god cried i stop cant you stop a minute i thought the betsy was not to sail till tomorrow stop one minute no sir said they that we cant for the captain bade us make what haste we could to the quay to load her i ran into the house the captain of the betsy was bawling in the hall with his hat on the back of his head mr croft on the landingplace of the warehousestairs with open letters in his hand and two or three of the underclerks were running different ways with pens in their mouths mr basil the invoice exclaimed all the clerks at once the moment i made my appearance mr basil lowe the invoice and the copy if you please repeated mr croft we have sent three messengers after you very extraordinary to go out at this time of day and not even to leave word where you were to be found heres the captain of the betsy has been waiting this half hour for the invoice well sir will you go for it now and at the same time bring me the copy to enclose in this letter to our correspondent by post i stood petrified sir the invoice sirgood heavens i forgot it entirely you remember it now sir i suppose keep your apologies till we have leisure the invoices if you please the invoices my god sir i beg ten thousand pardons they are not drawn out not drawn out impossible said mr croft then im off cried the captain with a tremendous oath i cant wait another tide for any clerk breathing send back the porters captain if you please said mr croft coolly the whole cargo must be unpacked i took it for granted mr basil that you had drawn the invoice according to order yesterday morning and of course the goods were packed in the evening i was certainly wrong in taking it for granted that you would be punctual a man of business should take nothing for granted this is a thing that will not occur to me again as long as i live i poured forth expressions of contrition but apparently unmoved by them and without anger or impatience in his manner he turned from me as soon as the porters came back with the goods and ordered them all to be unpacked and replaced in the warehouse i was truly concerned i believe you spent your evening yesterday with young mr hudson said he turning to me yes siri am sincerely sorry sorrow in these cases does no good sir interrupted he i thought i had sufficiently warned you of the danger of forming that intimacy midnight carousing will not do for men of business carousing sir said i give me leave to assure you that we were not carousing we were only at a frogconcert mr croft who had at least suppressed his displeasure till now looked absolutely angry he thought i was making a joke of him when i convinced him that i was in earnest he changed from anger to astonishment with a large mixture of contempt in his nasal muscles a frogconcert repeated he and is it possible that any man could neglect an invoice merely to go to hear a parcel of frogs croaking in a swamp sir you will never do in a mercantile house he walked off to the warehouse and left me half mortified and half provoked from this time forward all hopes from mr crofts friendship were at an end he was coldly civil to me during the few remaining days of the fortnight that we stayed at his house he took the trouble however of looking out for a cheap and tolerably comfortable lodging for my wife and boy the rent of which he desired to pay for his relation he said as long as i should remain in philadelphia or till i should find myself in some eligible situation he seemed pleased with lucy and said she was a very properly conducted well disposed prudent young woman whom he was not ashamed to own for a cousin he repeated at parting that he should be happy to afford me every assistance in reason towards pursuing any feasible plan of advancing myself but it was his decided opinion that i could never succeed in a mercantile line i never liked mr croft he was much too punctual too much of an automaton for me but i should have felt more regret at leaving him and losing his friendship and should have expressed more gratitude for his kindness to lucy and my boy if my head had not at the time been full of young hudson he professed the warmest regard for me congratulated me on getting free from old crofts mercantile clutches and assured me that such a man as i was could not fail to succeed in the world by my own talents and the assistance of friends and good connexions i was now almost every day at his fathers house in company with numbers of rich and gay people who were all my friends i was the life of society was invited every where and accepted every invitation because i could not offend mr hudsons intimate acquaintance from day to day from week to week from month to month i went on in this style i was old hudsons grand favourite and every body told me he could do any thing he pleased for me i had formed a scheme a bold scheme of obtaining from government a large tract of territory in the ceded lands of louisiana and of collecting a subscription in philadelphia among my friends to make a settlement there the subscribers to be paid by instalments so much the first year so much the second and so onward till the whole should be liquidated i was to collect hands from the next ships which were expected to be full of emigrants from ireland and scotland i had soon a long list of subscribers who gave me their names always after dinner or after supper old hudson wrote his name at the head of the list with an ostentatiously large sum opposite to it as nothing could be done until the ensuing spring when the ships were expected i spent my time in the same convivial manner the spring came but there was no answer obtained from government respecting the ceded territory and a delay of a few months was necessary mr hudson the father was the person who had undertaken to apply for the grant and he spoke always of the scheme and of his own powers of carrying it into effect in the most confident manner from his conversation any body would have supposed that the mines of peru were upon his plantation and that in comparison with his the influence of the president of the united states was nothing i was a full twelvemonth before i was convinced that he was a boaster and a fabulist and i was another twelvemonth before i could persuade myself that he was one of the most selfish indolent and obstinate of human beings he was delighted to have me always at his table to entertain him and his guests but he had not the slightest real regard for me or care for my interests he would talk to me as long as i pleased of his possessions and his improvements and his wonderful crops but the moment i touched upon any of my own affairs he would begin to yawn throw himself on a sofa and seem going to sleep whenever i mentioned his subscription he would say with a frownwe will talk of that basil tomorrow of my whole list of subscribers not above four ever paid a shilling into my hands their excuse always was when government has given an answer about the ceded territory we will pay the subscriptions and the answer of government always waswhen the subscriptions are paid we will make out a grant of the land i was disgusted and out of spirits but i thought all my chance was to persevere and to keep my friends in goodhumour so that i was continually under the necessity of appearing the same jovial companion laughing singing and drinking when heaven knows my heart was heavy enough at the end of the second year of promises delays and disappointments my lucy who had always foretold how things would turn out urged me to withdraw myself from this idle society to give up my scheme and to take the management of a small plantation in conjunction with the brother of mr croft his regard for my wife who had won much upon this family by her excellent conduct induced him to make me this offer but i considered so long and hesitated so much whether i should accept of this proposal that the time for accepting it passed away i had still hopes that my friend young hudson would enable me to carry my grand project into execution he had a considerable plantation in jamaica left to him by his grandfather on the mothers side he was to be of age and to take possession of it the ensuing year and he proposed to sell it and to apply some of the purchasemoney to our scheme of the success of which he had as sanguine expectations as i had myself he was of a most enthusiastic generous temper i had obtained the greatest influence over him and i am convinced at this time there was nothing in the world he would not have sacrificed for my sake all that he required from me was to be his constant companion he was extravagantly fond of field sports and though a londoner i was a good shot and a good angler for during the time i was courting lucy i found it necessary to make myself a sportsman to win the favour of her brothers with these accomplishments my hold upon the esteem and affections of my friend was allpowerful every day in the season we went out shooting or fishing together then in the wintertime we had various employments i mean various excuses for idleness hudson was a great skaiter and he had infinite diversion in teaching me to skait at the hazard of my skull he was also to initiate me in the american pastime of sleighing or sledging many a desperately cold winters day i have submitted to be driven in his sledge when i would much rather i own have been safe and snug by my own fireside with my wife poor lucy spent her time in a disagreeable and melancholy way during these three years for while i was out almost every day and all day long she was alone in her lodging for numberless hours she never repined but always received me with a goodhumoured countenance when i came home even after sitting up half the night to wait for my return from hudsons suppers it grieved me to the heart to see her thus seemingly deserted but i comforted myself with the reflection that this way of life would last but for a short time that my friend would soon be of age and able to fulfil all his promises and that we should then all live together in happiness i assured lucy that the present idle if not dissipated manner in which i spent my days was not agreeable to my taste that i was often extremely melancholy even when i was forced to appear in the highest spirits and that i often longed to be quietly with her when i was obliged to sacrifice my time to friendship it would have been impossible that she and my child could have subsisted all this time independently but for her steadiness and exertions she would not accept of any pecuniary assistance except from her relation mr croft who regularly paid the rent of her lodgings she undertook to teach some young ladies whom mrs croft introduced to her various kinds of fine needlework in which she excelled and for this she was well paid i know that she never cost me one farthing during the three years and three months that we lived in philadelphia but even for this i do not give her so much credit as for her sweet temper during these trials and her great forbearance in never reproaching or disputing with me many wives who are called excellent managers make their husbands pay tenfold in suffering what they save in money this was not my lucys way and therefore with my esteem and respect she ever had my fondest affections i was in hopes that the hour was just coming when i should be able to prove this to her and when we should no longer be doomed to spend our days asunder but alas her judgment was better than mine my friend hudson was now within six weeks of being of age when unfortunately there arrived in philadelphia a company of players from england hudson who was eager for every thing that had the name of pleasure insisted upon my going with him to their first representation among the actresses there was a girl of the name of marion who seemed to be ordinary enough just fit for a company of strolling players but she danced passably well and danced a great deal between the acts that night hudson clapped his hands till i was quite out of patience he was in raptures and the more i depreciated the more he extolled the girl i wished her in nova zembla for i saw he was falling in love with her and had a kind of presentiment of all that was to follow to tell the matter briefly for what signifies dwelling upon past misfortunes the more young hudsons passion increased for this dancing girl the more his friendship for me declined for i had frequent arguments with him upon the subject and did all i could to open his eyes i saw that the damsel had art that she knew the extent of her power and that she would draw her infatuated lover in to marry her he was headstrong and violent in all his passions he quarrelled with me carried the girl off to jamaica married her the day he was of age and settled upon his plantation there was an end of all my hopes about the ceded territory lucy who was always my resource in misfortune comforted me by saying i had done my duty in combating my friends folly at the expense of my own interest and that though he had quarrelled with me she loved me the better for it reflecting upon my own history and character i have often thought it a pity that with certain good qualities and i will add talents which deserved a better fate i should have never succeeded in any thing i attempted because i could not conquer one seemingly slight defect in my disposition which had grown into a habit thoroughly determined by lucys advice to write to mr croft to request he would give me another trial i put off sending the letter till the next day and that very morning mr croft set off on a journey to a distant part of the country to see a daughter who was newly married i was vexed and from a want of something better to do went out ashooting to get rid of disagreeable thoughts i shot several pheasants and when i came home carried them as was my custom to old mr hudsons kitchen and gave them to the cook i happened to stay in the kitchen to feed a favourite dog while the cook was preparing the birds i had brought i observed in the crop of one of the pheasants some bright green leaves and some buds which i suspected to be the leaves and buds of the kalmia latifolia a poisonous shrub i was not quite certain for i had almost forgotten the little botany which i knew before i went to china i took the leaves home with me to examine them at leisure and to compare them with the botanical description and i begged that the cook would not dress the birds till she saw or heard from me again i promised to see her or send to her the next day but the next day when i went to the library to look into a book of botany my attention was caught by some new reviews which were just arrived from london i put off the examination of the kalmia latifolia till the day after tomorrow said i will do just as well for i know the cook will not dress the pheasants today old hudson does not like them till they have been kept a day or two tomorrow came and the leaves were forgotten till evening when i saw them lying on my table and put them out of the way lest my little boy should find and eat them i was sorry that i had not examined them this day but i satisfied myself in the same way as i had done before tomorrow will do as well the cook will not dress the pheasants today old hudson thinks them the better for being kept two or three days tomorrow came but as the leaves of the kalmia latifolia were out of my sight they went out of my mind i was invited to an entertainment this day at the mayors there was a large company and after dinner i was called upon as usual for a song the favourite song of dance and sing times on the wing life never knows return of spring when a gentleman came in pale and breathless to tell us that mr hudson and three gentlemen who had been dining with him were suddenly seized with convulsions after eating of a pheasant and that they were not expected to live my blood ran cold i exclaimed my god i am answerable for this on my making this exclamation there was immediate silence in the room and every eye turned upon me with astonishment and horror i fell back in my chair and what passed afterward i know not but when i came to myself i found two men in the room with me who were set to guard me the bottles and glasses were still upon the table but the company were all dispersed and the mayor as my guards informed me was gone to mr hudsons to take his dying deposition in this instance as in all cases of sudden alarm report had exaggerated the evil mr hudson though extremely ill was not dying his three guests after some hours illness were perfectly recovered mr hudson who had eaten the most plentifully of the pheasant was not himself as he said for two days the third day he was able to see company at dinner as usual and my mind was relieved from an insupportable state of anxiety upon examination the mayor was convinced that i was perfectly innocent the cook told the exact truth blamed herself for not sending to me before she dressed the birds but said that she concluded i had found the leaves i took home were harmless as i never came to tell her the contrary i was liberated and went home to my wife she clasped me in her arms but could not articulate a syllable by her joy at seeing me again she left me to judge of what she must have suffered during this terrible interval for some time after this unfortunate accident happened it continued to be the subject of general conversation in philadelphia the story was told a thousand different ways and the comments upon it were in various ways injurious to me some blamed me for what indeed i deserved to be most severely blamed my delaying one hour to examine the leaves found in the crop of the pheasant others affected to think it absolutely impossible that any human being could be so dilatory and negligent where the lives of fellowcreatures and friends and friends by whom i had been treated with the utmost hospitality for years were concerned others still more malicious hinted that though i had been favoured by the mayor and perhaps by the goodness of poor mr hudson there must be something more than had come to light in the business and some boldly pronounced that the story of the leaves of the kalmia latifolia was a mere blind for that the pheasant could not have been rendered poisonous by such means footnote in the severe winter of the years and there appeared to be such unequivocal reasons for believing that several persons in philadelphia had died in consequence of their eating pheasants in whose crops the leaves and buds of the kalmia latifolia were found that the mayor of the city thought it prudent and his duty to warn the people against the use of this bird by a public proclamation i know that by many persons especially by some lovers of pheasants flesh the circumstance just mentioned was supposed to be destitute of foundation but the foundation was a solid one vide a paper by b smith barton md american transactions vol li that a motive might not be wanting for the crime it was whispered that old mr hudson had talked of leaving me a considerable legacy which i was impatient to touch that i might carry my adventuring schemes into execution i was astonished as much as shocked at the sudden alteration in the manners of all my acquaintances the tide of popularity changed and i was deserted that those who had lived with me so long in convivial intimacy that those who had courted admired flattered me those who had so often professed themselves my friends could suddenly without the slightest probability believe me capable of the most horrible crime appeared to me scarcely credible in reality many would not give themselves the trouble to think about the matter but were glad of a pretence to shake off the acquaintance of a man of whose stories and songs they began to be weary and who had put their names to a subscription which they did not wish to be called upon to pay such is the world such is the fate of all good fellows and excellent bottle companions certain to be deserted by their dear friends at the least reverse of fortune chapter vi my situation in philadelphia was now so disagreeable and my disgust and indignation were so great that i determined to quit the country my real friend mr croft was absent all this time from town i am sure if he had been at home he would have done me justice for though he never liked me he was a just slowjudging man who would not have been run away with by the hurry of popular prejudice i had other reasons for regretting his absence i could not conveniently quit america without money and he was the only person to whom i could or would apply for assistance we had not many debts for which i must thank my excellent wife but when every thing to the last farthing was paid i was obliged to sell my watch and some trinkets to get money for our voyage i was not accustomed to such things and i was ashamed to go to the pawnbrokers lest i should be met and recognized by some of my friends i wrapped myself up in an old surtout and slouched my hat over my face as i was crossing the quay i met a party of gentlemen walking arm in arm i squeezed past them but one stopped to look after me and though i turned down another street to escape him he dogged me unperceived just as i came out of the pawnbrokers shop i saw him posted opposite to me i brushed by i could with pleasure have knocked him down for his impertinence by the time that i had reached the corner of the street i heard a child calling after me i stopped and a little boy put into my hands my watch saying sir the gentleman says you left your watch and these thingumbobs by mistake what gentleman i dont know but he was one that said i looked like an honest chap and hed trust me to run and give you the watch he is dressed in a blue coat he went toward the quay thats all i know on opening the paper of trinkets i found a card with these words barnywith kind thanks barny poor barny the irishman whose passage i paid coming to america three years ago is it possible i ran after him the way which the child directed and was so fortunate as just to catch a glimpse of the skirt of his coat as he went into a neat goodlooking house i walked up and down some time expecting him to come out again for i could not suppose that it belonged to barny i asked a grocer who was leaning over his hatch door if he knew who lived in the next house an irish gentleman of the name of ogrady and his christian name here it is in my books sirbarnaby ogrady i knocked at mr ogradys door and made my way into the parlour where i found him his two sons and his wife sitting very sociably at tea he and the two young men rose immediately to set me a chair you are welcome kindly welcome sir said he this is an honour i never expected any way be pleased to take the seat near the fire twould be hard indeed if you would footnote should not have the best seat thats to be had in this house where we none of us never should have sat nor had seats to sit upon but for you the sons pulled off my shabby great coat and took away my hat and the wife made up the fire there was something in their manner altogether which touched me so much that it was with difficulty i could keep myself from bursting into tears they saw this and barny for i shall never call him any thing else as he thought that i should like better to hear of public affairs than to speak of my own began to ask his sons if they had seen the days papers and what news there were as soon as i could command my voice i congratulated his family upon the happy situation in which i found them and asked by what lucky accidents they had succeeded so well the luckiest accident ever happened me before or since i came to america said barny was being on board the same vessel with such a man as you if you had not given me the first lift i had been down for good and all and trampled under foot long and long ago but after that first lift all was as easy as life my two sons here were not taken from megod bless you for i never can bless you enough for that the lads were left to work for me and with me and we never parted hand or heart but just kept working on together and put all our earnings as fast as we got them into the hands of that good woman and lived hard at first as we were bred and born to do thanks be to heaven then we swore against drink of all sorts entirely and as i had occasionally served the masons when i lived a labouring man in the county of dublin and knew something of that business why whatever i knew i made the most of and a trowel felt no ways strange to me so i went to work and had higher wages at first than i deserved the same with the two boys one was as much of a blacksmith as would shoe a horse and tother a bit of a carpenter and the one got plenty of work in the forges and tother in the dockyards as a ship carpenter so early and late morning and evening we were all at the work and just went this way struggling on even for a twelvemonth and found with the high wages and constant employ we had met that we were getting greatly better in the world besides the wife was not idle when a girl she had seen baking and had always a good notion of it and just tried her hand upon it now and found the loaves went down with the customers and the customers coming faster and faster for them and this was a great help then i grew master mason and had my men under me and took a house to build by the job and that did and then on to another and another and after building many for the neighbours twas fit and my turn i thought to build one for myself which i did out of theirs without wronging them of a penny and the boys grew mastermen in their line and when they got good coats nobody could say against them for they had come fairly by them and became them well perhaps for that reason so not to be tiring you too much we went on from good to better and better to best and if it pleased god to question me how it was we got on so well in the world i should answer upon my conscience myself does not know except it be that we never made saint monday footnote saint monday or saint crispin it is a custom in ireland among shoemakers if they intoxicate themselves on sunday to do no work on monday and this they call making a saint monday or keeping saint crispins day many have adopted this good custom from the example of the shoemakers nor never put off till the morrow what we could do the day i believe i sighed deeply at this observation notwithstanding the comic phraseology in which it was expressed but all this is no rule for a gentleman born pursued the goodnatured barny in answer i suppose to the sigh which i uttered nor is it any disparagement to him if he has not done as well in a place like america where he had not the means not being used to bricklaying and slaving with his hands and striving as we did would it be too much liberty to ask you to drink a cup of tea and to taste a slice of my good womans bread and butter and happy the day we see you eating it and only wish we could serve you in any way whatsoever i verily believe the generous fellow forgot at this instant that he had redeemed my watch and wifes trinkets he would not let me thank him as much as i wished but kept pressing upon me fresh offers of service when he found i was going to leave america he asked what vessel we should go in i was really afraid to tell him lest he should attempt to pay for my passage but for this he had as i afterwards found too much delicacy of sentiment he discovered by questioning the captains in what ship we were to sail and when we went on board we found him and his sons there to take leave of us which they did in the most affectionate manner and after they were gone we found in the state cabin directed to me every thing that could be useful or agreeable to us as seastores for a long voyage how i wronged this man when i thought his expressions of gratitude were not sincere because they were not made exactly in the mode and with the accent of my own countrymen i little thought that barny and his sons would be the only persons who would bid us a friendly adieu when we were to leave america we had not exhausted our bountiful provision of seastores when we were set ashore in england we landed at liverpool and i cannot describe the melancholy feelings with which i sat down in the little back parlour of the inn to count my money and to calculate whether we had enough to carry us to london is this thought i as i looked at the few guineas and shillings spread on the table is this all i have in this world i my wife and child and is this the end of three years absence from my native country as the negroes say of a fool who takes a voyage in vain i am come back with little more than the hair upon my head is this the end of all my hopes and all my talents what will become of my wife and child i ought to insist upon her going home to her friends that she may at least have the necessaries and comforts of life till i am able to maintain her the tears started from my eyes they fell upon an old newspaper which lay upon the table under my elbow i took it up to hide my face from lucy and my child who just then came into the room and as i read without well knowing what i came among the advertisements to my own name if mr basil lowe or his heir will apply to mr gregory attorney no cecilstreet he will hear of something to his advantage i started up with an exclamation of joy wiped my tears from the newspaper put it into lucys hand pointed to the advertisement and ran to take places in the london coach for the next morning upon this occasion i certainly did not delay nor did i when we arrived in london put off one moment going to mr gregorys no cecilstreet upon application to him i was informed that a very distant relation of mine a rich miser had just died and had left his accumulated treasures to me because i was the only one of his relations who had never cost him a single farthing other men have to complain of their ill fortune perhaps with justice and this is a great satisfaction which i have never enjoyed for i must acknowledge that all my disasters have arisen from my own folly fortune has been uncommonly favourable to me without any merit of my own or rather as it appeared in consequence of my negligent habits which prevented me from visiting a rich relation i was suddenly raised from the lowest state of pecuniary distress to the height of affluent prosperity i took possession of a handsome house in an agreeable part of the town and enjoyed the delight of sharing all the comforts and luxuries which wealth could procure with the excellent woman who had been my support in adversity i must do myself the justice to observe that i did not become dissipated or extravagant affection and gratitude to my lucy filled my whole mind and preserved me from the faults incident to those who rise suddenly from poverty to wealth i did not forget my good friend mr nun who had relieved me formerly from prison of course i paid the debt which he had forgiven and lost no opportunity of showing him kindness and gratitude i was now placed in a situation where the best parts of my character appeared to advantage and where the grand defect of my disposition was not apparently of any consequence i was not now obliged like a man of business to be punctual and delay in mere engagements of pleasure was a trifling offence and a matter of raillery among my acquaintance my talents in conversation were admired and if i postponed letterwriting my correspondents only tormented me a little with polite remonstrances i was conscious that i was not cured of my faults but i rejoiced that i was not now obliged to reform or in any danger of involving those i loved in distress by my negligence for one year i was happy and flattered myself that i did not waste my time for at my leisure i read with attention all the ancient and modern works upon education i resolved to select from them what appeared most judicious and practicable and so to form from the beauties of each a perfect system for the advantage of my son he was my only child he had lived with me eighteen months in prison he was the darling of his mother whom i adored and he was thought to be in mind and person a striking resemblance of myself how many reasons had i to love himi doted upon the child he certainly showed great quickness of intellect and gave as fair a promise of talents as could be expected at his age i formed hopes of his future excellence and success in the world as sanguine as those which my poor father had early formed of mine i determined to watch carefully over his temper and to guard him particularly against that habit of procrastination which had been the bane of my life one day while i was alone in my study leaning on my elbow and meditating upon the system of education which i designed for my son my wife came to me and said my dear i have just heard from our friend mr nun a circumstance that alarms me a good deal you know little harry nun was inoculated at the same time with our basil and by the same person mrs nun and all the family thought he had several spots just as much as our boy had and that that was enough but two years afterwards while we were in america harry nun caught the smallpox in the natural way and died now it seems the man who inoculated him was quite ignorant for two or three other children whom he attended have caught the disease since though he was positive that they were safe dont you think we had better have our boy inoculated again immediately by some proper person undoubtedly my dear undoubtedly but i think we had better have him vaccined i am not sure however but i will ask dr s opinion this day and be guided by that i shall see him at dinner he has promised to dine with us some accident prevented him from coming and i thought of writing to him the next day but afterward put it off lucy came again into my study where she was sure to find me in the morning my dear said she do you recollect that you desired me to defer inoculating our little boy till you could decide whether it be best to inoculate him in the common way or the vaccine yes my dear i recollect it perfectly well i am much inclined to the vaccine my friend mr l has had all his children vaccined and i just wait to see the effect oh my love said lucy do not wait any longer for you know we run a terrible risk of his catching the smallpox every day every hour we have run that risk and escaped for these three years past said i and in my opinion the boy has had the smallpox so mr and mrs nun thought and you see what has happened remember our boy was inoculated by the same man i am sure ever since mr nun mentioned this i never take little basil out to walk i never see him in a shop i never have him in the carriage with me without being in terror yesterday a woman came to the coachdoor with a child in her arms who had a breaking out on his face i thought it was the smallpox and was so terrified that i had scarcely strength or presence of mind enough to draw up the glass our little boy was leaning out of the door to give a halfpenny to the child my god if that child had the smallpox my love said i do not alarm yourself so terribly the boy shall be inoculated tomorrow tomorrow oh my dearest love do not put it off till tomorrow said lucy let him be inoculated today well my dear only keep your mind easy and he shall be inoculated today if possible surely you must know i love the boy as well as you do and am as anxious about him as you can be i am sure of it my love said lucy i meant no reproach but since you have decided that the boy shall be vaccined let us send directly for the surgeon and have it done and then he will be safe she caught hold of the bellcord to ring for a servant i stopped her no my dear dont ring said i for the men are both out i have sent one to the library for the new letters on education and the other to the rational toyshop for some things i want for the child then if the servants are out i had better walk to the surgeons and bring him back with me no my dear said i i must see mr ls children first i am going out immediately i will call upon them they are healthy children we can have the vaccine infection from them and i will inoculate the boy myself lucy submitted i take a melancholy pleasure in doing her justice by recording every argument that she used and every persuasive word that she said to me upon this occasion i am anxious to show that she was not in the least to blame i alone am guilty i alone ought to have been the sufferer it will scarcely be believedi can hardly believe it myself that after all lucy said to me i delayed two hours and stayed to finish making an extract from rousseaus emilius before i set out when i arrived at mr ls the children were just gone out to take an airing and i could not see them a few hours may sometimes make all the difference between health and sickness happiness and misery i put off till the next day the inoculation of my child in the mean time a coachman came to me to be hired my boy was playing about the room and as i afterward collected went close up to the man and while i was talking stood examining a greyhound upon his buttons i asked the coachman many questions and kept him for some time in the room just as i agreed to take him into my service he said he could not come to live with me till the next week because one of his children was ill of the smallpox these words struck me to the heart i had a dreadful presentiment of what was to follow i remember starting from my seat and driving the man out of the house with violent menaces my boy poor innocent victim followed trying to pacify me and holding me back by the skirts of my coat i caught him up in my arms i could not kiss him i felt as if i was his murderer i set him down again indeed i trembled so violently that i could not hold him the child ran for his mother i cannot dwell on these things our boy sickened the next week and the week afterward died in his mothers arms her health had suffered much by the trials which she had gone through since our marriage the disapprobation of her father the separation from all her friends who were at variance with me my imprisonment and then the death of her only child were too much for her fortitude she endeavoured to conceal this from me but i saw that her health was rapidly declining she was always fond of the country and as my sole object now in life was to do whatsoever i could to console and please her i proposed to sell our house in town and to settle somewhere in the country in the neighbourhood of her father and mother there was a pretty place to be let which i had often heard her mention with delight i determined to take it i had secret hopes

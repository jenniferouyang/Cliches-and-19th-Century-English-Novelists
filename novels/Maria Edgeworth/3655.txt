bent the trees inclined pope with illustrations by f a fraser london george routledge and sons limited broadway ludgate hill manchester glasgow and new york preface addressed to parents our great lexicographer in his celebrated eulogium on dr watts thus speaks in commendation of those productions which he so successfully penned for the pleasure and instruction of the juvenile portion of the community for children says dr johnson he condescended to lay aside the philosopher the scholar and the wit to write little poems of devotion and systems of instruction adapted to their wants and capacities from the dawn of reason to its gradation of advance in the morning of life every man acquainted with the common principles of human action will look with veneration on the writer who is at one time combating locke and at another time making a catechism for children in their fourth year a voluntary descent from the dignity of science is perhaps the hardest lesson which humility can teach it seems however no very easy task to write for children those only who have been interested in the education of a family who have patiently followed children through the first processes of reasoning who have daily watched over their thoughts and feelingsthose only who know with what ease and rapidity the early association of ideas are formed on which the future taste character and happiness depend can feel the dangers and difficulties of such an undertaking indeed in all sciences the grand difficulty has been to ascertain factsa difficulty which in the science of education peculiar circumstances conspire to increase here the objects of every experiment are so interesting that we cannot hold our minds indifferent to the result nor is it to be expected that many registers of experiments successful and unsuccessful should be kept much less should be published when we consider that the combined powers of affection and vanity of partiality to his child and to his theory will act upon the mind of a parent in opposition to the abstract love of justice and the general desire to increase the wisdom and happiness of mankind notwithstanding these difficulties an attempt to keep such a register has actually been made the design has from time to time been pursued though much has not been collected every circumstance and conversation that have been preserved are faithfully and accurately related and these notes have been of great advantage to the writer of the following stories the question whether society could exist without the distinction of ranks is a question involving a variety of complicated discussions which we leave to the politician and the legislator at present it is necessary that the education of different ranks should in some respects be different they have few ideas few habits in common their peculiar vices and virtues do not arise from the same causes and their ambition is to be directed to different objects but justice truth and humanity are confined to no particular rank and should be enforced with equal care and energy upon the minds of young people of every station and it is hoped that these principles have never been forgotten in the following pages as the ideas of children multiply the language of their books should become less simple else their taste will quickly be disgusted or will remain stationary children that live with people who converse with elegance will not be contented with a style inferior to what they hear from everybody near them all poetical allusions however have been avoided in this book such situations only are described as children can easily imagine and which may consequently interest their feelings such examples of virtue are painted as are not above their conception of excellence or their powers of sympathy and emulation it is not easy to give rewards to children which shall not indirectly do them harm by fostering some hurtful taste or passion in the story of lazy lawrence where the object was to excite a spirit of industry care has been taken to proportion the reward to the exertion and to demonstrate that people feel cheerful and happy whilst they are employed the reward of our industrious boy though it be money is only money considered as the means of gratifying a benevolent wish in a commercial nation it is especially necessary to separate as much as possible the spirit of industry and avarice and to beware lest we introduce vice under the form of virtue in the story of tarlton and loveit are represented the danger and the folly of that weakness of mind and that easiness to be led which too often pass for good nature and in the tale of the false key are pointed out some of the evils to which a well educated boy on first going to service is exposed from the profligacy of his fellow servants in the birthday present and in the character of mrs theresa tattle the parents assistant has pointed out the dangers which may arise in education from a bad servant or a common acquaintance in the barring out the errors to which a high spirit and the love of party are apt to lead have been made the subject of correction and it is hoped that the common fault of making the most mischievous characters appear the most active and the most ingenious has been as much as possible avoided unsuccessful cunning will not be admired and cannot induce imitation it has been attempted in these stories to provide antidotes against ill humour the epidemic rage for dissipation and the fatal propensity to admire and imitate whatever the fashion of the moment may distinguish were young people either in public schools or in private families absolutely free from bad examples it would not be advisable to introduce despicable and vicious characters in books intended for their improvement but in real life they must see vice and it is best that they should be early shocked with the representation of what they are to avoid there is a great deal of difference between innocence and ignorance to prevent the precepts of morality from tiring the ear and the mind it was necessary to make the stories in which they are introduced in some measure dramatic to keep alive hope and fear and curiosity by some degree of intricacy at the same time care has been taken to avoid inflaming the imagination or exciting a restless spirit of adventure by exhibiting false views of life and creating hopes which in the ordinary course of things cannot be realized contents page the orphans lazy lawrence the false key simple susan the white pigeon the

woman the orphans near the ruins of the castle of rossmore in ireland is a small cabin in which there once lived a widow and her four children as long as she was able to work she was very industrious and was accounted the best spinner in the parish but she overworked herself at last and fell ill so that she could not sit to her wheel as she used to do and was obliged to give it up to her eldest daughter mary mary was at this time about twelve years old one evening she was sitting at the foot of her mothers bed spinning and her little brothers and sisters were gathered round the fire eating their potatoes and milk for supper bless them the poor young creatures said the widow who as she lay on her bed which she knew must be her deathbed was thinking of what would become of her children after she was gone mary stopped her wheel for she was afraid that the noise of it had wakened her mother and would hinder her from going to sleep again no need to stop the wheel mary dear for me said her mother i was not asleep nor is it that which keeps me from sleep but dont overwork yourself mary oh no fear of that replied mary im strong and hearty so was i once said her mother and so you will be again i hope said mary when the fine weather comes again the fine weather will never come again to me said her mother tis a folly mary to hope for that but what i hope is that youll find some friendsome helporphans as youll soon all of you be and one thing comforts my heart even as i am lying here that not a soul in the wide world i am leaving has to complain of me though poor i have lived honest and i have brought you up to be the same mary and i am sure the little ones will take after you for youll be good to themas good to them as you can here the children who had finished eating their suppers came round the bed to listen to what their mother was saying she was tired of speaking for she was very weak but she took their little hands as they laid them on the bed and joining them all together she said bless you dears bless you love and help one another all you can good nightgood bye mary took the children away to their bed for she saw that their mother was too ill to say more but mary did not herself know how ill she was her mother never spoke rightly afterwards but talked in a confused way about some debts and one in particular which she owed to a schoolmistress for marys schooling and then she charged mary to go and pay it because she was not able to go in with it at the end of the week she was dead and buried and the orphans were left alone in their cabin the two youngest girls peggy and nancy were six and seven years old edmund was not yet nine but he was a stout grown healthy boy and well disposed to work he had been used to bring home turf from the bog on his back to lead cart horses and often to go on errands for gentlemens families who paid him a sixpence or a shilling according to the distance which he went so that edmund by some or other of these little employments was as he said likely enough to earn his bread and he told mary to have a good heart for that he should every year grow able to do more and more and that he should never forget his mothers words when she last gave him her blessing and joined their hands all together as for peggy and nancy it was little that they could do but they were good children and mary when she considered that so much depended upon her was resolved to exert herself to the utmost her first care was to pay those debts which her mother had mentioned to her for which she left money done up carefully in separate papers when all these were paid away there was not enough left to pay both the rent of the cabin and a years schooling for herself and sisters which was due to the schoolmistress in a neighbouring village mary was in hopes that the rent would not be called for immediately but in this she was disappointed mr harvey the gentleman on whose estate she lived was in england and in his absence all was managed by a mr hopkins an agent who was a hard man the driver came to mary about a week after her mothers death and told her that the rent must be brought in the next day and that she must leave the cabin for a new tenant was coming into it that she was too young to have a house to herself and that the only thing she had to do was to get some neighbour to take her and her brother and her sisters in for charitys sake the driver finished by hinting that she would not be so hardly used if she had not brought upon herself the ill will of miss alice the agents daughter mary it is true had refused to give miss alice a goat upon which she had set her fancy but this was the only offence of which she had been guilty and at the time she refused it her mother wanted the goats milk which was the only thing she then liked to drink mary went immediately to mr hopkins the agent to pay her rent and she begged of him to let her stay another year in her cabin but this he refused it was now september th and he said that the new tenant must come in on the th so that she must quit it directly mary could not bear the thoughts of begging any of the neighbours to take her and her brother and sisters in for charitys sake for the neighbours were all poor enough themselves so she bethought herself that she might find shelter in the ruins of the old castle of rossmore where she and her brother in better times had often played at hide and seek the kitchen and two other rooms near it were yet covered in tolerably well and a little thatch she thought would make them comfortable through the winter the agent consented to let her and her brother and sisters go in there upon her paying him half a guinea in hand and promising to pay the same yearly into these lodgings the orphans now removed taking with them two bedsteads a stool chair and a table a sort of press which contained what little clothes they had and a chest in which they had two hundred of meal the chest was carried for them by some of the charitable neighbours who likewise added to their scanty stock of potatoes and turf what would make it last through the winter these children were well thought of and pitied because their mother was known to have been all her life honest and industrious sure says one of the neighbours we can do no less than give a helping hand to the poor orphans that are so ready to help themselves so one helped to thatch the room in which they were to sleep and another took their cow to graze upon his bit of land on condition of having half the milk and one and all said they should be welcome to take share of their potatoes and buttermilk if they should find their own ever fall short the half guinea which mr hopkins the agent required for letting mary into the castle was part of what she had to pay to the schoolmistress to whom above a guinea was due mary went to her and took her goat along with her and offered it in part of payment of the debt but the schoolmistress would not receive the goat she said that she could afford to wait for her money till mary was able to pay it that she knew her to be an honest industrious little girl and she would trust her with more than a guinea mary thanked her and she was glad to take the goat home again as she was very fond of it being now settled in their house they went every day regularly to work maud spun nine cuts a day besides doing all that was to be done in the house edmund got fourpence a day by his work and peggy and annie earned twopence apiece at the paper mills near navan where they were employed to sort rags and to cut them into small pieces when they had done work one day annie went to the master of the paper mill and asked him if she might have two sheets of large white paper which were lying on the press she offered a penny for the paper but the master would not take anything from her but gave her the paper when he found that she wanted it to make a garland for her mothers grave annie and peggy cut out the garland and mary when it was finished went along with them and edmund to put it up it was just a month after their mothers death it happened at the time the orphans were putting up this garland that two young ladies who were returning home after their evening walk stopped at the gate of the churchyard to look at the red light which the setting sun cast upon the window of the church as the ladies were standing at the gate they heard a voice near them crying o mother mother are you gone for ever they could not see anyone so they walked softly round to the other side of the church and there they saw mary kneeling beside a grave on which her brothers and sisters were hanging their white garlands the children all stood still when they saw the two ladies passing near them but mary did not know anybody was passing for her face was hid in her hands isabella and caroline so these ladies were called would not disturb the poor children but they stopped in the village to inquire about them it was at the house of the schoolmistress that they stopped and she gave them a good account of these orphans she particularly commended marys honesty in having immediately paid all her mothers debts to the utmost farthing as far as her money would go she told the ladies how mary had been turned out of her house and how she had offered her goat of which she was very fond to discharge a debt due for her schooling and in short the schoolmistress who had known mary for several years spoke so well of her that these ladies resolved that they would go to the old castle of rossmore to see her the next day when they went there they found the room in which the children lived as clean and neat as such a ruined place could be made edmund was out working with a farmer mary was spinning and her little sisters were measuring out some bogberries of which they had gathered a basketful for sale isabella after telling mary what an excellent character she had heard of her inquired what it was she most wanted and mary said that she had just worked up all her flax and she was most in want of more flax for her wheel isabella promised that she would send her a fresh supply of flax and caroline bought the bogberries from the little girls and gave them money enough to buy a pound of coarse cotton for knitting as mary said that she could teach them how to knit the supply of flax which isabella sent the next day was of great service to mary as it kept her in employment for above a month and when she sold the yarn which she had spun with it she had money enough to buy some warm flannel for winter wear besides spinning well she had learned at school to do plain work tolerably neatly and isabella and caroline employed her to work for them by which she earned a great deal more than she could by spinning at her leisure hours she taught her sisters to read and write and edmund with part of the money which he earned by his work out of doors paid a schoolmaster for teaching him a little arithmetic when the winter nights came on he used to light his rush candles for mary to work by he had gathered and stripped a good provision of rushes in the month of august and a neighbour gave him grease to dip them in one evening just as he had lighted his candles a footman came in who was sent by isabella with some plain work to mary this servant was an englishman and he was but newly come over to ireland the rush candles caught his attention for he had never seen any of them before as he came from a part of england where they were not used edmund who was ready to oblige and proud that his candles were noticed showed the englishman how they were made and gave him a bundle of rushes the servant was pleased with his good nature in this trifling instance and remembered it long after it was forgotten by edmund whenever his master wanted to send a messenger anywhere gilbert for that was the servants name always employed his little friend edmund whom upon further acquaintance he liked better and better he found that edmund was both quick and exact in executing commissions one day after he had waited a great while at a gentlemans house for an answer to a letter he was so impatient to get home that he ran off without it when he was questioned by gilbert why he did not bring an answer he did not attempt to make any excuse he did not say there was no answer please your honour or they bid me not to wait etc but he told exactly the truth and though gilbert scolded him for being so impatient as not to wait yet his telling the truth was more to the boys advantage than any excuse he could have made after this he was always believed when he said there was no answer or they bid me not wait for gilbert knew that he would not tell a lie to save himself from being scolded the orphans continued to assist one another in their work according to their strength and abilities and they went on in this manner for three years with what mary got by her spinning and plain work and edmund by leading of cart horses going on errands etc and with little peggy and annes earnings the family contrived to live comfortably isabella and caroline often visited them and sometimes gave them clothes and sometimes flax or cotton for their spinning and knitting and these children did not expect that because the ladies did something for them they should do everything they did not grow idle or wasteful when edmund was about twelve years old his friend gilbert sent for him one day and told him that his master had given him leave to have a boy in the house to assist him and that his master told him he might choose one in the neighbourhood several were anxious to get into such a good place but gilbert said that he preferred edmund before them all because he knew him to be an industrious honest good natured lad who always told the truth so edmund went into service at the vicarage and his master was the father of isabella and caroline he found his new way of life very pleasant for he was well fed well clothed and well treated and he every day learned more of his business in which at first he was rather awkward he was mindful to do all that mr gilbert required of him and he was so obliging to all his fellow servants that they could not help liking him but there was one thing which was at first rather disagreeable to him he was obliged to wear shoes and stockings and they hurt his feet besides this when he waited at dinner he made such a noise in walking that his fellow servants laughed at him he told his sister mary of his distress and she made for him after many trials a pair of cloth shoes with soles of platted hemp in these he could walk without making the least noise and as these shoes could not be worn out of doors he was always sure to change them before he went out and consequently he had always clean shoes to wear in the house it was soon remarked by the men servants that he had left off clumping so heavily and it was observed by the maids that he never dirtied the stairs or passages with his shoes when he was praised for these things he said it was his sister mary who should be thanked and not he and he showed the shoes which she had made for him isabellas maid bespoke a pair immediately and sent mary a piece of pretty calico for the outside the last maker made a last for her and over this mary sewed the calico vamps tight her brother advised her to try platted packthread instead of hemp for the soles and she found that this looked more neat than the hemp soles and was likely to last longer she platted the packthread together in strands of about half an inch thick and these were served firmly together at the bottom of the shoe when they were finished they fitted well and the maid showed them to her mistress isabella and caroline were so well pleased with marys ingenuity and kindness to her brother that they bespoke from her two dozen of these shoes and gave her three yards of coloured fustian to make them of and galloon for the binding when the shoes were completed isabella and caroline disposed of them for her amongst their acquaintance and got three shillings a pair for them the young ladies as soon as they had collected the money walked to the old castle where they found everything neat and clean as usual they had great pleasure in giving to this industrious girl the reward of her ingenuity which she received with some surprise and more gratitude they advised her to continue the shoemaking trade as they found the shoes were liked and they knew that they could have a sale for them at the repository in dublin mary encouraged by these kind friends went on with her little manufacture with increased activity peggy and anne platted the packthread and basted the vamps and linings together ready for her edmund was allowed to come home for an hour every morning provided he was back again before eight oclock it was summer time and he got up early because he liked to go home to see his sisters and he took his share in the manufactory it was his business to hammer the soles flat and as soon as he came home every morning he performed his task with so much cheerfulness and sang so merrily at his work that the hour of his arrival was always an hour of joy to the family mary had presently employment enough upon her hands orders came to her for shoes from many families in the neighbourhood and she could not get them finished fast enough she however in the midst of her hurry found time to make a very pretty pair with neat roses as a present for her schoolmistress who now that she saw her pupil in a good way of business consented to receive the amount of her old debt several of the children who went to her school were delighted with the sight of marys present and went to the little manufactory at rossmore castle to find out how these shoes were made some went from curiosity others from idleness but when they saw how happy the little shoemakers seemed whilst busy at work they longed to take some share in what was going forward one begged mary to let her plat some packthread for the soles another helped peggy and anne to baste in the linings and all who could get employment were pleased for the idle ones were shoved out of the way it became a custom with the children of the village to resort to the old castle at their play hours and it was surprising to see how much was done by ten or twelve of them each doing but a little at a time one morning edmund and the little manufacturers were assembled very early and they were busy at their work all sitting round the meal chest which served them for a table my hands must be washed said george a little boy who came running in i ran so fast that i might be in time to go to work along with you all that i tumbled down and look how i have dirtied my hands most haste worst speed my hands must be washed before i can do anything whilst george was washing his hands two other little children who had just finished their mornings work came to him to beg that he would blow some soap bubbles for them and they were all three eagerly blowing bubbles and watching them mount into the air when suddenly they were startled by a noise as loud as thunder they were in a sort of outer court of the castle next to the room in which all their companions were at work and they ran precipitately into the room exclaiming did you hear that noise i thought i heard a clap of thunder said mary but why do you look so frightened as she finished speaking another and a louder noise and the walls round about them shook the children turned pale and stood motionless but edmund threw down his hammer and ran out to see what was the matter mary followed him and they saw that a great chimney of the old ruins at the farthest side of the castle had fallen down and this was the cause of the prodigious noise the part of the castle in which they lived seemed as edmund said to be perfectly safe but the children of the village were terrified and thinking that the whole would come tumbling down directly they ran to their homes as fast as they could edmund who was a courageous lad and proud of showing his courage laughed at their cowardice but mary who was very prudent persuaded her brother to ask an experienced mason who was building at his masters to come and give his opinion whether their part of the castle was safe to live in or not the mason came and gave it as his opinion that the rooms they inhabited might last through the winter but that no part of the ruins could stand another year mary was sorry to leave a place of which she had grown fond poor as it was having lived in it in peace and contentment ever since her mothers death which was now nearly four years but she determined to look out for some other place to live in and she had now money enough to pay the rent of a comfortable cabin without losing any time she went to the village that was at the end of the avenue leading to the vicarage for she wished to get a lodging in this village because it was so near to her brother and to the ladies who had been so kind to her she found that there was one newly built house in this village unoccupied it belonged to mr harvey her landlord who was still in england it was slated and neatly fitted up inside but the rent of it was six guineas a year and this was far above what mary could afford to pay three guineas a year she thought was the highest rent for which she could venture to engage besides she heard that several proposals had been made to mr harvey for this house and she knew that mr hopkins the agent was not her friend therefore she despaired of getting it there was no other to be had in this village her brother was still more vexed than she was that she could not find a place near him he offered to give a guinea yearly towards the rent out of his wages and mr gilbert spoke about it for him to the steward and inquired whether amongst any of those who had given in proposals there might not be one who would be content with a part of the house and who would join with mary in paying the rent none could be found but a woman who was a great scold and a man who was famous for going to law about every trifle with his neighbours mary did not choose to have anything to do with these people she did not like to speak either to miss isabella or caroline about it because she was not of an encroaching temper and when they had done so much for her she would have been ashamed to beg for more she returned home to the old castle mortified that she had no good news to tell anne and peggy who she knew expected to hear that she had found a nice house for them in the village near their brother bad news for you peggy cried she as soon as she got home and bad news for you mary replied her sisters who looked very sorrowful whats the matter your poor goat is dead replied peggy there she is yonder lying under the great corner stone you can just see her leg we cannot lift the stone from off her it is so heavy betsy one of the neighbours girls says she remembers when she came to us to work early this morning she saw the goat rubbing itself and butting with its horns against that old tottering chimney manys the time said mary that i have driven the poor thing away from that place i was always afraid she would shake that great ugly stone down upon her at last the goat who had long been the favourite of mary and her sisters was lamented by them all when edmund came he helped them to move the great stone from off the poor animal who was crushed so as to be a terrible sight as they were moving away this stone in order to bury the goat anne found an odd looking piece of money which seemed neither like a halfpenny nor a shilling nor a guinea here are more a great many more of them cried peggy and upon searching amongst the rubbish they discovered a small iron pot which seemed as if it had been filled with these coins as a vast number of them were found about the spot where it fell on examining these coins edmund thought that several of them looked like gold and the girls exclaimed with great joyoh mary mary this is come to us just in right timenow you can pay for the slated house never was anything so lucky but mary though nothing could have pleased her better than to have been able to pay for the house observed that they could not honestly touch any of this treasure as it belonged to the owner of the castle edmund agreed with her that they ought to carry it all immediately to mr hopkins the agent peggy and anne were convinced by what mary said and they begged to go along with her and their brother to take the coins to mr hopkins on their way they stopped at the vicarage to show the treasure to mr gilbert who took it to the young ladies isabella and caroline and told them how it had been found it is not only by their superior riches but it is yet more by their superior knowledge that persons in the higher rank of life may assist those in a lower condition isabella who had some knowledge of chemistry discovered by touching the coins with nitric acid that several of them were of gold and consequently of great value caroline also found out that many of the coins were very valuable as curiosities she recollected her fathers having shown to her the prints of the coins at the end of each kings reign in rapins history of england and upon comparing these impressions with the coins found by the orphans she perceived that many of them were of the reign of henry the seventh which from their scarcity were highly appreciated by numismatic collectors isabella and caroline knowing something of the character of mr hopkins the agent had the precaution to count the coins and to mark each of them with a cross so small that it was scarcely visible to the naked eye though it was easily to be seen through a magnifying glass they also begged that their father who was well acquainted with mr harvey the gentleman to whom rossmore castle belonged to write to him and tell him how well these orphans had behaved about the treasure which they had found the value of the coins was estimated at about thirty or forty guineas a few days after the fall of the chimney at rossmore castle as mary and her sisters were sitting at their work there came hobbling in an old woman leaning on a crab stick that seemed to have been newly cut she had a broken tobacco pipe in her mouth her head was wrapped up in two large red and blue handkerchiefs with their crooked corners hanging far down over the back of her neck no shoes on her broad feet nor stockings on her many coloured legs her petticoat was jagged at the bottom and the skirt of her gown turned up over her shoulders to serve instead of a cloak which she had sold for whisky this old woman was well known amongst the country people by the name of goody grope a because she had for many years been in the habit of groping in old castles and in moats b and at the bottom of a round tower c in the neighbourhood in search of treasure in her youth she had heard someone talking in a whisper of an old prophecy found in a bog which said that before many st patricks days should come about there would be found a treasure under ground by one within twenty miles round this prophecy made a deep impression upon her she also dreamed of it three times and as the dream she thought was a sure token that the prophecy was to come true she from that time forwards gave up her spinning wheel and her knitting and could think of nothing but hunting for the treasure that was to be found by one within twenty miles round year after year st patricks day came about without her ever finding a farthing by all her groping and as she was always idle she grew poorer and poorer besides to comfort herself for her disappointments and to give her spirits for fresh searches she took to drinking she sold all she had by degrees but still she fancied that the lucky day would come sooner or later that would pay for all goody grope however reached her sixtieth year without ever seeing this lucky day and now in her old age she was a beggar without a house to shelter her a bed to lie on or food to put into her mouth but what she begged from the charity of those who had trusted more than she had to industry and less to luck ah mary honey give me a potato and a sup of something for the love o mercy for not a bit have i had all day except half a glass of whisky and a halfpenny worth of tobacco mary immediately set before her some milk and picked a good potato out of the bowl for her she was sorry to see such an old woman in such a wretched condition goody grope said she would rather have spirits of some kind or other than milk but mary had no spirits to give her so she sat herself down close to the fire and after she had sighed and groaned and smoked for some time she said to mary well and what have you done with the treasure you had the luck to find mary told her that she had carried it to mr hopkins the agent thats not what i would have done in your place replied the old woman when good luck came to you what a shame to turn your back upon it but it is idle talking of whats donethats past but ill try my luck in this here castle before next st patricks day comes about i was told it was more than twenty miles from our bog or i would have been here long ago but better late than never mary was much alarmed and not without reason at this speech for she knew that if goody grope once set to work at the foundation of the old castle of rossmore she would soon bring it all down it was in vain to talk to goody grope of the danger of burying herself under the ruins or of the improbability of her meeting with another pot of gold coins she set her elbow upon her knees and stopping her ears with her hands bid mary and her sisters not to waste their breath advising their elders for that let them say what they would she would fall to work the next morning barring youll make it worth my while to let it alone and what will make it worth your while to let it alone said mary for she saw that she must either get into a quarrel or give up her habitation or comply with the conditions of this provoking old woman half a crown goody grope said was the least she could be content to take mary paid the half crown and was in hopes that she had got rid for ever of her tormentor but she was mistaken for scarcely was the week at an end before the old woman appeared before her again and repeated her threats of falling to work the next morning unless she had something given to her to buy tobacco the next day and the next and the next goody grope came on the same errand and poor mary who could ill afford to supply her constantly with halfpence at last exclaimed i am sure the finding of this treasure has not been any good luck to us but quite the contrary and i wish we never had found it mary did not yet know how much she was to suffer on account of this unfortunate pot of gold coins mr hopkins the agent imagined that no one knew of the discovery of this treasure but himself and these poor children so not being as honest as they were he resolved to keep it for his own use he was surprised some weeks afterwards to receive a letter from his employer mr harvey demanding from him the coins which had been discovered at rossmore castle hopkins had sold the gold coins and some of the others and he flattered himself that the children and the young ladies to whom he now found they had been shown could not tell whether what they had seen were gold or not and he was not in the least apprehensive that those of henry the sevenths reign should be reclaimed from him as he thought they had escaped attention so he sent over the silver coins and others of little value and apologized for his not having mentioned them before by saying that he considered them as mere rubbish mr harvey in reply observed that he could not consider as rubbish the gold coins which were amongst them when they were discovered and he inquired why these gold coins and those of the reign of henry the seventh were not now sent to him mr hopkins denied that he had ever received any such but he was thunderstruck when mr harvey in reply to this falsehood sent him a list of the coins which the orphans had deposited with him and exact drawings of those that were missing he informed him that this list and these drawings came from two ladies who had seen the coins in question mr hopkins thought that he had no means of escape but by boldly persisting in falsehood he replied that it was very likely such coins had been found at rossmore castle and that the ladies alluded to had probably seen them but he positively declared that they never came to his hands that he had restored all that were deposited with him and that as to the others he supposed they must have been taken out of the pot by the children or by edmund or mary on their way from the ladies house to his the orphans were shocked and astonished when they heard from isabella and caroline the charge that was made against them they looked at one another in silence for some moments then peggy exclaimedsure mr hopkins has forgotten himself strangely does not he remember edmunds counting the things to him upon the great table in his hall and we all standing by i remember it as well as if it was this instant and so do i cried anne and dont you recollect mary your picking out the gold ones and telling mr hopkins that they were gold and he said you knew nothing of the matter and i was going to tell him that miss isabella had tried them and knew that they were gold but just then there came in some tenants to pay their rent and he pushed us out and twitched from my hand the piece of gold which i had taken up to show him the bright spot which miss isabella had cleaned by the stuff that she had poured on it i believe he was afraid i should steal it he twitched it from my hand in such a hurry do edmund do marylet us go to him and put him in mind of all this ill go to him no more said edmund sturdily he is a bad manill never go to him again mary dont be cast downwe have no need to be cast downwe are honest true said mary but is not it a hard case that we who have lived as my mother did all her life before us in peace and honesty with all the world should now have our good name taken from us when marys voice faltered and stopped it cant be taken from us cried edmund poor orphans though we are and he a rich gentleman as he calls himself let him say and do what he will he cant hurt our good name edmund was mistaken alas and mary had but too much reason for her fears the affair was a great deal talked of and the agent spared no pains to have the story told his own way the orphans conscious of their own innocence took no pains about the matter and the consequence was that all who knew them well had no doubt of their honesty but many who knew nothing of them concluded that the agent must be in the right and the children in the wrong the buzz of scandal went on for some time without reaching their ears because they lived very retiredly but one day when mary went to sell some stockings of peggys knitting at the neighbouring fair the man to whom she sold them bid her write her name on the back of a note and exclaimed on seeing itho ho mistress id not have had any dealings with you had i known your name sooner wheres the gold that you found at rossmore castle it was in vain that mary related the fact she saw that she gained no belief as her character was not known to this man or to any of those who were present she left the fair as soon as she could and though she struggled against it she felt very melancholy still she exerted herself every day at her little manufacture and she endeavoured to console herself by reflecting that she had two friends left who would not give up her character and who continued steadily to protect her and her sisters isabella and caroline everywhere asserted their belief in the integrity of the orphans but to prove it was in this instance out of their power mr hopkins the agent and his friends constantly repeated that the gold coins were taken away in coming from their house to his and these ladies were blamed by many people for continuing to countenance those that were with great reason suspected to be thieves the orphans were in a worse condition than ever when the winter came on and their benefactresses left the country to spend some months in dublin the old castle it was true was likely to last through the winter as the mason said but though the want of a comfortable house to live in was a little while ago the uppermost thing in marys thoughts now it was not so one night as mary was going to bed she heard someone knocking hard at the door mary are you up let us in cried a voice which she knew to be the voice of betsy green the postmasters daughter who lived in the village near them she let betsy in and asked what she could want at such a time of night give me sixpence and ill tell you said betsy but waken anne and peggy heres a letter just come by post for you and i stepped over to you with it because i guessed youd be glad to have it seeing it is your brothers handwriting peggy and anne were soon roused when they heard that there was a letter from edmund it was by one of his rush candles that mary read it and the letter was as follows dear mary nancy and little peg joy joyi always said the truth would come out at last and that he could not take our good name from us but i will not tell you how it all came about till we meet which will be next week as we are i mean master and mistress and the young ladiesbless themand mr gilbert and i coming down to the vicarage to keep christmas and a happy christmas tis likely to be for honest folks as for they that are not honest it is not for them to expect to be happy at christmas or any other time you shall know all when we meet so till then fare ye well dear mary nancy and little peg your joyful and affectionate brother edmund to comprehend why edmund is joyful our readers must be informed of certain things which happened after isabella and caroline went to dublin one morning they went with their father and mother to see the magnificent library of a nobleman who took generous and polite pleasure in thus sharing the advantages of his wealth and station with all who had any pretensions to science or literature knowing that the gentleman who was now come to see his library was skilled in antiquities the nobleman opened a drawer of medals to ask his opinion concerning the age of some coins which he had lately purchased at a high price they were the very same which the orphans had found at rossmore castle isabella and caroline knew them again instantly and as the cross which isabella had made on each of them was still visible through a magnifying glass there could be no possibility of doubt the nobleman who was much interested both by the story of these orphans and the manner in which it was told to him sent immediately for the person from whom he had purchased the coins he was a jew broker at first he refused to tell them from whom he got them because he had bought them he said under a promise of secrecy being further pressed he acknowledged that it was made a condition in his bargain that he should not sell them to anyone in ireland but that he had been tempted by the high price the present noble possessor had offered at last when the jew was informed that the coins were stolen and that he would be proceeded against as a receiver of stolen goods if he did not confess the whole truth he declared that he had purchased them from a gentleman whom he had never seen before or since but he added that he could swear to his person if he saw him again now mr hopkins the agent was at this time in dublin and carolines father posted the jew the next day in the back parlour of a bankers house with whom mr hopkins had on this day appointed to settle some accounts mr hopkins camethe jew knew himswore that he was the man who had sold the coins to him and thus the guilt of the agent and the innocence of the orphans were completely proved a full account of all that happened was sent to england to mr harvey their landlord and a few posts afterwards there came a letter from him containing a dismissal of the dishonest agent and a reward for the honest and industrious orphans mr harvey desired that mary and her sisters might have the slated house rent free from this time forward under the care of ladies isabella and caroline as long as mary or her sisters should carry on in it any useful business this was the joyful news which edmund had to tell his sisters all the neighbours shared in their joy and the day of their removal from the ruins of rossmore castle to their new house was the happiest of the christmas holidays they were not envied for their prosperity because everybody saw that it was the reward of their good conduct everybody except goody grope she exclaimed as she wrung her hands with violent expressions of sorrowbad luck to me bad luck to mewhy didnt i go sooner to that there castle it is all luck all luck in this world but i never had no luck think of the luck of these childer that have found a pot of gold and such great grand friends and a slated house and all and here am i with scarce a rag to cover me and not a potato to put into my mouthi that have been looking under ground all my days for treasure not to have a halfpenny at the last to buy me tobacco that is the very reason that you have not a halfpenny said betsy here mary has been working hard and so have her two little sisters and her brother for these five years past and they have made money for themselves by their own industryand friends toonot by luck but by phoo phoo interrupted goody grope dont be prating dont i know as well as you do that they found a pot of gold by good luck and is not that the cause why they are going to live in a slated house now no replied the postmasters daughter this house is given to them as a rewardthat was the word in the letter for i saw it edmund showed it to me and will show it to anyone that wants to see this house was given to them as a reward for their honesty lazy lawrence in the pleasant valley of ashton there lived an elderly woman of the name of preston she had a small neat cottage and there was not a weed to be seen in her garden it was upon her garden that she chiefly depended for support it consisted of strawberry beds and one small border for flowers the pinks and roses she tied up in nice nosegays and sent either to clifton or bristol to be sold as to her strawberries she did not send them to market because it was the custom for numbers of people to come from clifton in the summer time to eat strawberries and cream at the gardens in ashton now the widow preston was so obliging active and good humoured that everyone who came to see her was pleased she lived happily in this manner for several years but alas one autumn she fell sick and during her illness everything went wrong her garden was neglected her cow died and all the money which she had saved was spent in paying for medicines the winter passed away while she was so weak that she could earn but little by her work and when the summer came her rent was called for and the rent was not ready in her little purse as usual she begged a few months delay and they were granted to her but at the end of that time there was no resource but to sell her horse lightfoot now lightfoot though perhaps he had seen his best days was a very great favourite in his youth he had always carried the dame to the market behind her husband and it was now her little son jems turn to ride him it was jems business to feed lightfoot and to take care of hima charge which he never neglected for besides being a very good natured he was a very industrious boy it will go near to break my jems heart said dame preston to herself as she sat one evening beside the fire stirring the embers and considering how she had best open the matter to her son who stood opposite to her eating a dry crust of bread very heartily for supper jem said the old woman what art hungry that i am brave and hungry ay no wonder youve been brave hard at workeh brave hard i wish it was not so dark mother that you might just step out and see the great bed ive dug i know youd say it was no bad days workand oh mother ive good news farmer truck will give us the giant strawberries and im to go for em to morrow morning and ill be back afore breakfast god bless the boy how he talksfour mile there and four mile back again afore breakfast ay upon lightfoot you know mother very easily maynt i ay child why do you sigh mother finish thy supper child ive done cried jem swallowing the last mouthful hastily as if he thought he had been too long at supperand now for the great needle i must see and mend lightfoots bridle afore i go to bed to work he set by the light of the fire and the dame having once more stirred it began again with jem dear does he go lame at all now what lightfoot oh la no not henever was so well of his lameness in all his life hes grown quite young again i think and then hes so fat he can hardly wag god bless himthats right we must see jem and keep him fat for what mother for monday fortnight at the fair hes to besold lightfoot cried jem and let the bridle fall from his hand and will mother sell lightfoot will no but i must jem must who says you must why must you mother i must i say child why must not i pay my debts honestly and must not i pay my rent and was not it called for long and long ago and have not i had time and did not i promise to pay it for certain monday fortnight and am not i two guineas short and where am i to get two guineas so what signifies talking child said the widow leaning her head upon her arm lightfoot must go jem was silent for a few minutestwo guineas thats a great great deal if i worked and worked and worked ever so hard i could no ways earn two guineas afore monday fortnightcould i mother lord help thee no not an work thyself to death but i could earn something though i say cried jem proudly and i will earn somethingif it be ever so little it will be somethingand i shall do my very best so i will that im sure of my child said his mother drawing him towards her and kissing him you were always a good industrious lad that i will say afore your face or behind your backbut it wont do nowlightfoot must go jem turned away struggling to hide his tears and went to bed without saying a word more but he knew that crying would do no good so he presently wiped his eyes and lay awake considering what he could possibly do to save the horse if i get ever so little he still said to himself it will be something and who knows but landlord might then wait a bit longer and we might make it all up in time for a penny a day might come to two guineas in time but how to get the first penny was the question then he recollected that one day when he had been sent to clifton to sell some flowers he had seen an old woman with a board beside her covered with various sparkling stones which people stopped to look at as they passed and he remembered that some people bought the stones one paid twopence another threepence and another sixpence for them and jem heard her say that she got them amongst the neighbouring rocks so he thought that if he tried he might find some too and sell them as she had done early in the morning he wakened full of this scheme jumped up dressed himself and having given one look at poor lightfoot in his stable set off to clifton in search of the old woman to inquire where she found her sparkling stones but it was too early in the morning the old woman was not at her seat so he turned back again disappointed he did not waste his time waiting for her but saddled and bridled lightfoot and went to farmer trucks for the giant strawberries a great part of the morning was spent in putting them into the ground and as soon as that was finished he set out again in quest of the old woman whom to his great joy he spied sitting at her corner of the street with her board before her but this old woman was deaf and cross and when at last jem made her hear his questions he could get no answer from her but that she found the fossils where he would never find any more but cant i look where you looked look away nobody hinders you replied the old woman and these were the only words she would say jem was not however a boy to be easily discouraged he went to the rocks and walked slowly along looking at all the stones as he passed presently he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosening some large rocks and one amongst the workmen was stooping down looking for something very eagerly jem ran up and asked if he could help him yes said the man you can ive just dropped amongst this heap of rubbish a fine piece of crystal that i got to day what kind of a looking thing is it said jem white and like glass said the man and went on working whilst jem looked very carefully over the heap of rubbish for a great while come said the man its gone for ever dont trouble yourself any more my boy its no trouble ill look a little longer well not give it up so soon said jem and after he had looked a little longer he found the piece of crystal thanke said the man you are a fine little industrious fellow jem encouraged by the tone of voice in which the man spoke this ventured to ask him the same questions which he had asked the old woman one good turn deserves another said the man we are going to dinner just now and shall leave off workwait for me here and ill make it worth your while jem waited and as he was very attentively observing how the workmen went on with their work he heard somebody near him give a great yawn and turning round he saw stretched upon the grass beside the river a boy about his own age who in the village of ashton as he knew went by the name of lazy lawrencea name which he most justly deserved for he never did anything from morning to night he neither worked nor played but sauntered or lounged about restless and yawning his father was an ale house keeper and being generally drunk could take no care of his son so that lazy lawrence grew every day worse and worse however some of the neighbours said that he was a good natured poor fellow enough and would never do anyone harm but himself whilst others who were wiser often shook their heads and told him that idleness was the root of all evil what lawrence cried jem to him when he saw him lying upon the grass what are you asleep not quite are you awake not quite what are you doing there nothing what are you thinking of nothing what makes you lie there i dont knowbecause i cant find anybody to play with me to day will you come and play no i cant im busy busy cried lawrence stretching himself you are always busy i would not be you for the world to have so much to do always and i said jem laughing would not be you for the world to have nothing to do they then parted for the workman just then called jem to follow him he took him home to his own house and showed him a parcel of fossils which he had gathered he said on purpose to sell but had never had time enough to sell them now however he set about the task and having picked out those which he judged to be the best he put them in a small basket and gave them to jem to sell upon condition that he should bring him half of what he got jem pleased to be employed was ready to agree to what the man proposed provided his mother had no objection when he went home to dinner he told his mother his scheme and she smiled and said he might do as he pleased for she was not afraid of his being from home you are not an idle boy said she so there is little danger of your getting into any mischief accordingly jem that evening took his stand with his little basket upon the bank of the river just at the place where people land from a ferry boat and the walk turns to the wells and numbers of people perpetually pass to drink the waters he chose his place well and waited nearly all the evening offering his fossils with great assiduity to every passenger but not one person bought any hallo cried some sailors who had just rowed a boat to land bear a hand here will you my little fellow and carry these parcels for us into yonder house jem ran down immediately for the parcels and did what he was asked to do so quickly and with so much good will that the master of the boat took notice of him and when he was going away stopped to ask him what he had got in his little basket and when he saw that they were fossils he immediately told jem to follow him for that he was going to carry some shells he had brought from abroad to a lady in the neighbourhood who was making a grotto she will very likely buy your stones into the bargain come along my lad we can but try the lady lived but a very little way off so that they were soon at her house she was alone in her parlour and was sorting a bundle of feathers of different colours they lay on a sheet of pasteboard upon a window seat and it happened that as the sailor was bustling round the table to show off his shells he knocked down the sheet of pasteboard and scattered all the feathers the lady looked very sorry which jem observing he took the opportunity whilst she was busy looking over the sailors bag of shells to gather together all the feathers and sort them according to their different colours as he had seen them sorted when he first came into the room where is the little boy you brought with you i thought i saw him here just now and here i am maam cried jem creeping from under the table with some few remaining feathers which he had picked from the carpet i thought added he pointing to the others i had better be doing something than standing idle maam she smiled and pleased with his activity and simplicity began to ask him several questions such as who he was where he lived what employment he had and how much a day he earned by gathering fossils this is the first day i ever tried said jem i never sold any yet and if you dont buy em now maam im afraid nobody else will for ive asked everybody else come then said the lady laughing if that is the case i think i had better buy them all so emptying all the fossils out of his basket she put half a crown into it jems eyes sparkled with joy oh thank you maam said he i will be sure and bring you as many more to morrow yes but i dont promise you said she to give you half a crown to morrow but perhaps though you dont promise it you will no said the lady do not deceive yourself i assure you that i will not that instead of encouraging you to be industrious would teach you to be idle jem did not quite understand what she meant by this but answered im sure i dont wish to be idle what i want is to earn something every day if i know how im sure i dont wish to be idle if you knew all youd know i did not how do you mean if i knew all why i mean if you knew about lightfoot whos lightfoot why mammys horse added jem looking out of the window i must make haste home and feed him afore it gets dark hell wonder whats gone with me let him wonder a few minutes longer said the lady and tell me the rest of your story ive no story maam to tell but as how mammy says he must go to the fair monday fortnight to be sold if she cant get the two guineas for her rent and i should be main sorry to part with him for i love him and he loves me so ill work for him i will all i can to be sure as mammy says i have no chance such a little fellow as i am of earning two guineas afore monday fortnight but are you willing earnestly to work said the lady you know there is a great deal of difference between picking up a few stones and working steadily every day and all day long but said jem i would work every day and all day long then said the lady i will give you work come here to morrow morning and my gardener will set you to weed the shrubberies and i will pay you sixpence a day remember you must be at the gates by six oclock jem bowed thanked her and went away it was late in the evening and jem was impatient to get home to feed lightfoot yet he recollected that he had promised the man who had trusted him to sell the fossils that he would bring him half of what he got for them so he thought that he had better go to him directly and away he went running along by the waterside about a quarter of a mile till he came to the mans house he was just come home from work and was surprised when jem showed him the half crown saying look what i got for the stones you are to have half you know no said the man when he had heard his story i shall not take half of that it was given to you i expected but a shilling at the most and the half of that is but sixpence and that ill take wife give the lad two shillings and take this half crown so the wife opened an old glove and took out two shillings and the man as she opened the glove put in his fingers and took out a little silver penny there he shall have that into the bargain for his honestyhonesty is the best policytheres a lucky penny for you that ive kept ever since i can remember dont you ever go to part with it do ye hear cried the woman let him do what he will with it wife said the man but argued the wife another penny would do just as well to buy gingerbread and thats what it will go for no that it shall not i promise you said jem and so he ran away home fed lightfoot stroked him went to bed jumped up at five oclock in the morning and went singing to work as gay as a lark four days he worked every day and all day long and every evening the lady when she came out to walk in her gardens looked at his work at last she said to her gardener this little boy works very hard never had so good a little boy about the grounds said the gardener hes always at his work let me come by when i will and he has got twice as much done as another would do yes twice as much maam for look herehe began at this ere rose bush and now hes got to where you stand maam and here is the days work that tother boy and hes three years older too did to dayi say measure jems fairly and its twice as much im sure well said the lady to her gardener show me how much is a fair days work for a boy of his age come at six oclock and go at six why about this much maam said the gardener marking off a piece of the border with his spade then little boy said the lady so much shall be your task every day the gardener will mark it off for you and when youve done the rest of the day you may do what you please jem was extremely glad of this and the next day he had finished his task by four oclock so that he had all the rest of the evening to himself he was as fond of play as any little boy could be and when he was at it he played with all the eagerness and gaiety imaginable so as soon as he had finished his task fed lightfoot and put by the sixpence he had earned that day he ran to the playground in the village where he found a party of boys playing and amongst them lazy lawrence who indeed was not playing but lounging upon a gate with his thumb in his mouth the rest were playing at cricket jem joined them and was the merriest and most active amongst them till at last when quite out of breath with running he was obliged to give up to rest himself and sat down upon the stile close to the gate on which lazy lawrence was swinging and why dont you play lawrence said he im tired said lawrence tired of what i dont know well what tires me grandmother says im ill and i must take somethingi dont know what ails me oh pugh take a good raceone two three and awayand youll find yourself as well as ever come runone two three and away ah no i cant run indeed said he hanging back heavily you know i can play all day long if i like it so i dont mind play as you do who have only one hour for it so much the worse for you come now im quite fresh again will you have one game at ball do no i tell you i cant im as tired as if i had been working all day long as hard as a horse ten times more said jem for i have been working all day long as hard as a horse and yet you see im not a bit tired only a little out of breath just now thats very odd said lawrence and yawned for want of some better answer then taking out a handful of halfpencesee what i got from father to day because i asked him just at the right time when he had drunk a glass or two then i can get anything i want out of himsee a penny twopence threepence fourpencetheres eightpence in all would not you be happy if you had eightpence why i dont know said jem laughing for you dont seem happy and you have eightpence that does not signify though im sure you only say that because you envy me you dont know what it is to have eightpence you never had more than twopence or threepence at a time in all your life jem smiled oh as to that said he you are mistaken for i have at this very time more than twopence threepence or eightpence either i havelet meseestones two shillings then five days workthats five sixpences thats two shillings and sixpence in all makes four shillings and sixpence and my silver penny is four and sevenpencefour and sevenpence you have not said lawrence roused so as absolutely to stand upright four and sevenpence have you show it me and then ill believe you follow me then cried jem and ill soon make you believe me come is it far said lawrence following half running half hobbling till he came to the stable where jem showed him his treasure and how did you come by ithonestly honestly to be sure i did i earned it all lord bless me earned it well ive a great mind to work but then its such hot weather besides grandmother says im not strong enough yet for hard work and besides i know how to coax daddy out of money when i want it so i need not work but four and sevenpence lets see what will you do with it all thats a secret said jem looking great i can guess i know what id do with it if it was mine first id buy pocketfuls of gingerbread then id buy ever so many apples and nuts dont you love nuts id buy nuts enough to last me from this time to christmas and id make little newton crack em for me for thats the worst of nuts theres the trouble of cracking em well you never deserve to have a nut but youll give me some of yours said lawrence in a fawning tone for he thought it easier to coax than to workyoull give me some of your good things wont you i shall not have any of those good things said jem then what will you do with all your money oh i know very well what to do with it but as i told you thats a secret and i shant tell it anybody come now lets go back and playtheir games up i daresay lawrence went back with him full of curiosity and out of humour with himself and his eightpence if i had four and sevenpence said he to himself i certainly should be happy the next day as usual jem jumped up before six oclock and went to his work whilst lazy lawrence sauntered about without knowing what to do with himself in the course of two days he laid out sixpence of his money in apples and gingerbread and as long as these lasted he found himself well received by his companions but at length the third day he spent his last halfpenny and when it was gone unfortunately some nuts tempted him very much but he had no money to pay for them so he ran home to coax his father as he called it when he got home he heard his father talking very loud and at first he thought he was drunk but when he opened the kitchen door he saw that he was not drunk but angry you lazy dog cried he turning suddenly upon lawrence and gave him such a violent box on the ear as made the light flash from his eyes you lazy dog see what youve done for melooklook look i say lawrence looked as soon as he came to the use of his senses and with fear amazement and remorse beheld at least a dozen bottles burst and the fine worcestershire cider streaming over the floor now did not i order you three days ago to carry these bottles to the cellar and did not i charge you to wire the corks answer me you lazy rascal did not i yes said lawrence scratching his head and why was not it done i ask you cried his father with renewed anger as another bottle burst at the moment what do you stand there for you lazy brat why dont you move i say no no catching hold of him i believe you cant move but ill make you and he shook him till lawrence was so giddy he could not stand what had you to think of what had you to do all day long that you could not carry my cider my worcestershire cider to the cellar when i bid you but go youll never be good for anything you are such a lazy rascalget out of my sight so saying he pushed him out of the house door and lawrence sneaked off seeing that this was no time to make his petition for halfpence the next day he saw the nuts again and wishing for them more than ever he went home in hopes that his father as he said to himself would be in a better humour but the cider was still fresh in his recollection and the moment lawrence began to whisper the word halfpenny in his ear his father swore with a loud oath i will not give you a halfpenny no not a farthing for a month to come if you want money go work for it ive had enough of your lazinessgo work at these terrible words lawrence burst into tears and going to the side of a ditch sat down and cried for an hour and when he had cried till he could cry no more he exerted himself so far as to empty his pockets to see whether there might not happen to be one halfpenny left and to his great joy in the farthest corner of his pocket one halfpenny was found with this he proceeded to the fruit womans stall she was busy weighing out some plums so he was obliged to wait and whilst he was waiting he heard some people near him talking and laughing very loud the fruit womans stall was at the gate of an inn yard and peeping through the gate in this yard lawrence saw a postilion and a stable boy about his own size playing at pitch farthing he stood by watching them for a few minutes i began but with one halfpenny cried the stable boy with an oath and now ive got twopence added he jingling the halfpence in his waistcoat pocket lawrence was moved at the sound and said to himself if i begin with one halfpenny i may end like him with having twopence and it is easier to play at pitch farthing than to work so he stepped forward presenting his halfpenny offering to toss up with the stable boy who after looking him full in the face accepted the proposal and threw his halfpenny into the air head or tail cried he head replied lawrence and it came up head he seized the penny surprised at his own success and would have gone instantly to have laid it out in nuts but the stable boy stopped him and tempted him to throw again this time lawrence lost he threw again and won and so he went on sometimes losing but most frequently winning till half the morning was lost at last however finding himself the master of three halfpence said he would play no more the stable boy grumbling swore he would have his revenge another time and lawrence went and bought his nuts it is a good thing said he to himself to play at pitch farthing the next time i want a halfpenny ill not ask my father for it nor go to work neither satisfied with this resolution he sat down to crack his nuts at his leisure upon the horse block in the inn yard here whilst he ate he overheard the conversation of the stable boys and postilions at first their shocking oaths and loud wrangling frightened and shocked him for lawrence though lazy had not yet learned to be a wicked boy but by degrees he was accustomed to the swearing and quarrelling and took a delight and interest in their disputes and battles as this was an amusement which he could enjoy without any sort of exertion he soon grew so fond of it that every day he returned to the stable yard and the horse block became his constant seat here he found some relief from the insupportable fatigue of doing nothing and here hour after hour with his elbows on his knees and his head on his hands he sat the spectator of wickedness gaming cheating and lying soon became familiar to him and to complete his ruin he formed a sudden and close intimacy with the stable boy a very bad boy with whom he had first begun to game the consequences of this intimacy we shall presently see but it is now time to inquire what little jem had been doing all this while one day after jem had finished his task the gardener asked him to stay a little while to help him to carry some geranium pots into the hall jem always active and obliging readily stayed from play and was carrying in a heavy flower pot when his mistress crossed the hall what a terrible litter said she you are making herewhy dont you wipe your shoes upon the mat jem turned to look for the mat but he saw none oh said the lady recollecting herself i cant blame you for there is no mat no maam said the gardener nor i dont know when if ever the man will bring home those mats you bespoke maam i am very sorry to hear that said the lady i wish we could find somebody who would do them if he cant i should not care what sort of mats they were so that one could wipe ones feet on them jem as he was sweeping away the litter when he heard these last words said to himself perhaps i could make a mat and all the way home as he trudged along whistling he was thinking over a scheme for making mats which however bold it may appear he did not despair of executing with patience and industry many were the difficulties which his prophetic eye foresaw but he felt within himself that spirit which spurs men on to great enterprises and makes them trample on impossibilities in the first place he recollected that he had seen lazy lawrence whilst he lounged upon the gate twist a bit of heath into different shapes and he thought that if he could find some way of plaiting heath firmly together it would make a very pretty green soft mat which would do very well for one to wipe ones shoes on about a mile from his mothers house on the common which jem rode over when he went to farmer trucks for the giant strawberries he remembered to have seen a great quantity of this heath and as it was now only six oclock in the evening he knew that he should have time to feed lightfoot stroke him go to the common return and make one trial of his skill before he went to bed lightfoot carried him swiftly to the common and there jem gathered as much of the heath as he thought he should want but what toil what time what pains did it cost him before he could make anything like a mat twenty times he was ready to throw aside the heath and give up his project from impatience of repeated disappointments but still he persevered nothing truly great can be accomplished without toil and time two hours he worked before he went to bed all his play hours the next day he spent at his mat which in all made five hours of fruitless attempts the sixth however repaid him for the labours of the other five he conquered his grand difficulty of fastening the heath substantially together and at length completely finished a mat which far surpassed his most sanguine expectations he was extremely happysang danced round itwhistledlooked at it again and again and could hardly leave off looking at it when it was time to go to bed he laid it by his bedside that he might see it the moment he awoke in the morning and now came the grand pleasure of carrying it to his mistress she looked fully as much surprised as he expected when she saw it and when she heard who made it after having duly admired it she asked how much he expected for his mat expectnothing maam said jem i meant to give it you if youd have it i did not mean to sell it i made it in my play hours i was very happy in making it and im very glad too that you like it and if you please to keep it maam thats all but thats not all said the lady spend your time no more in weeding in my garden you can employ yourself much better you shall have the reward of your ingenuity as well as of your industry make as many more such mats as you can and i will take care and dispose of them for you thanke maam said jem making his best bow for he thought by the ladys looks that she meant to do him a favour though he repeated to himself dispose of them what does that mean the next day he went to work to make more mats and he soon learned to make them so well and quickly that he was surprised at his own success in every one he made he found less difficulty so that instead of making two he could soon make four in a day in a fortnight he made eighteen it was saturday night when he finished and he carried at three journeys his eighteen mats to his mistress house piled them all up in the hall and stood with his hat off with a look of proud humility beside the pile waiting for his mistress appearance presently a folding door at one end of the hall opened and he saw his mistress with a great many gentlemen and ladies rising from several tables oh there is my little boy and his mats cried the lady and followed by all the rest of the company she came into the hall jem modestly retired whilst they looked at his mats but in a minute or two his mistress beckoned to him and when he came into the middle of the circle he saw that his pile of mats had disappeared well said the lady smiling what do you see that makes you look so surprised that all my mats are gone said jem but you are very welcome are we said the lady well take up your hat and go home then for you see that it is getting late and you know lightfoot will wonder whats become of you jem turned round to take up his hat which he had left on the floor but how his countenance changed the hat was heavy with shillings everyone who had taken a mat had put in two shillings so that for the eighteen mats he had got thirty six shillings thirty six shillings said the lady five and sevenpence i think you told me you had earned alreadyhow much does that make i must add i believe one other sixpence to make out your two guineas two guineas exclaimed jem now quite conquering his bashfulness for at the moment he forgot where he was and saw nobody that was by two guineas cried he clapping his hands togethero lightfoot o mother then recollecting himself he saw his mistress whom he now looked up to quite as a friend will you thank them all said he scarcely daring to glance his eyes round upon the company will you thank em for you know i dont know how to thank em rightly everybody thought however that they had been thanked rightly now we wont keep you any longer only said his mistress i have one thing to ask you that i may be by when you show your treasure to your mother come then said jem come with me now not now said the lady laughing but i will come to ashton to morrow evening perhaps your mother can find me a few strawberries that she will said jem ill search the garden myself he now went home but felt it a great restraint to wait till to morrow evening before he told his mother to console himself he flew to the stablelightfoot youre not to be sold on monday poor fellow said he patting him and then could not refrain from counting out his money whilst he was intent upon this jem was startled by a noise at the door somebody was trying to pull up the latch it opened and there came in lazy lawrence with a boy in a red jacket who had a cock under his arm they started when they got into the middle of the stable and when they saw jem who had been at first hidden by the horse wewewe came stammered lazy lawrencei mean i came tototo to ask you continued the stable boy in a bold tone whether you will go with us to the cock fight on monday see ive a fine cock here and lawrence told me you were a great friend of his so i came lawrence now attempted to say something in praise of the pleasures of cock fighting and in recommendation of his new companion but jem looked at the stable boy with dislike and a sort of dread then turning his eyes upon the cock with a look of compassion said in a low voice to lawrence shall you like to stand by and see its eyes pecked out i dont know said lawrence as to that but they say a cockfights a fine sight and its no more cruel in me to go than another and a great many go and ive nothing else to do so i shall go but i have something else to do said jem laughing so i shall not go but continued lawrence you know monday is the great bristol fair and one must be merry then of all the days in the year one day in the year sure theres no harm in being merry said the stable boy i hope not said jem for i know for my part i am merry every day in the year thats very odd said lawrence but i know for my part i would not for all the world miss going to the fair for at least it will be something to talk of for half a year after come youll go wont you no said jem still looking as if he did not like to talk before the ill looking stranger then what will you do with all your money ill tell you about that another time whispered jem and dont you go to see that cocks eyes pecked out it wont make you merry im sure if i had anything else to divert me said lawrence hesitating and yawning come cried the stable boy seizing his stretching arm come along cried he and pulling him away from jem upon whom he cast a look of extreme contempt leave him alone hes not the sort what a fool you are said he to lawrence the moment he got him out of the stable you might have known he would not go else we should soon have trimmed him out of his four and sevenpence but how came you to talk of four and sevenpence i saw in the manger a hat full of silver indeed exclaimed lawrence yes indeed but why did you stammer so when we first got in you had liked to have blown us all up i was so ashamed said lawrence hanging down his head ashamed but you must not talk of shame now you are in for it and i shant let you off you owe us half a crown recollect and i must be paid to night so see and get the money somehow or other after a considerable pause he added i answer for it hed never miss half a crown out of all that silver but to steal said lawrence drawing back with horror i never thought i should come to thatand from poor jem toothe money that he has worked so hard for too but it is not stealing we dont mean to steal only to borrow it and if we win which we certainly shall at the cock fight pay it back again and hell never know anything about the matter and what harm will it do him besides what signifies talking you cant go to the cock fight or the fair either if you dont and i tell ye we dont mean to steal it well pay it by monday night lawrence made no reply and they parted without his coming to any determination here let us pause in our story we are almost afraid to go on the rest is very shocking our little readers will shudder as they read but it is better that they should know the truth and see what the idle boy came to at last in the dead of the night lawrence heard somebody tap at his window he knew well who it was for this was the signal agreed upon between him and his wicked companion he trembled at the thoughts of what he was about to do and lay quite still with his head under the bedclothes till he heard the second tap then he got up dressed himself and opened his window it was almost even with the ground his companion said to him in a hollow voice are you ready he made no answer but got out of the window and followed when he got to the stable a black cloud was just passing over the moon and it was quite dark where are you whispered lawrence groping about where are you speak to me i am here give me your hand lawrence stretched out his hand is that your hand said the wicked boy as lawrence laid hold of him how cold it feels let us go back said lawrence it is time yet it is no time to go back replied the other opening the door youve gone too far now to go back and he pushed lawrence into the stable have you found it take care of the horse have you done what are you about make haste i hear a noise said the stable boy who watched at the door i am feeling for the half crown but i cant find it bring all together he brought jems broken flower pot with all the money in it to the door the black cloud had now passed over the moon and the light shone full upon them what do we stand here for said the stable boy snatching the flower pot out of lawrences trembling hands and pulled him away from the door good god cried lawrence you wont take all you said youd only take half a crown and pay it back on monday you said youd only take half a crown hold your tongue replied the other walking on deaf to all remonstrancesif ever i am to be hanged it shant be for half a crown lawrences blood ran cold in his veins and he felt as if all his hair stood on end not another word passed his accomplice carried off the money and lawrence crept with all the horrors of guilt upon him to his restless bed all night he was starting from frightful dreams or else broad awake he lay listening to every small noise unable to stir and scarcely daring to breathetormented by that most dreadful of all kinds of fear that fear which is the constant companion of an evil conscience he thought the morning would never come but when it was day when he heard the birds sing and saw everything look cheerful as usual he felt still more miserable it was sunday morning and the bell rang for church all the children of the village dressed in their sunday clothes innocent and gay and little jem the best and gayest amongst them went flocking by his door to church well lawrence said jem pulling his coat as he passed and saw lawrence leaning against his fathers door what makes you look so black i said lawrence starting why do you say that i look black nay then said jem you look white enough now if that will please you for youre turned as pale as death pale replied lawrence not knowing what he said and turned abruptly away for he dared not stand another look of jems conscious that guilt was written in his face he shunned every eye he would now have given the world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay upon his mind he longed to follow jem to fall upon his knees and confess all dreading the moment when jem should discover his loss lawrence dared not stay at home and not knowing what to do or where to go he mechanically went to his old haunt at the stable yard and lurked thereabouts all day with his accomplice who tried in vain to quiet his fears and raise his spirits by talking of the next days cock fight it was agreed that as soon as the dusk of the evening came on they should go together into a certain lonely field and there divide their booty in the meantime jem when he returned from church was very full of business preparing for the reception of his mistress of whose intended visit he had informed his mother and whilst she was arranging the kitchen and their little parlour he ran to search the strawberry beds why my jem how merry you are to day said his mother when he came in with the strawberries and was jumping about the room playfully now keep those spirits of yours jem till you want em and dont let it come upon you all at once have it in mind that to morrows fair day and lightfoot must go i bid farmer truck call for him to night he said hed take him along with his own and hell be here just nowand then i know how it will be with you jem so do i cried jem swallowing his secret with great difficulty and then tumbling head over heels four times running a carriage passed the window and stopped at the door jem ran out it was his mistress she came in smiling and soon made the old woman smile too by praising the neatness of everything in the house we shall pass over however important as they were deemed at the time the praises of the strawberries and of my grandmothers china plate another knock was heard at the door run jem said his mother i hope its our milk woman with cream for the lady no it was farmer truck come for lightfoot the old womans countenance fell fetch him out dear said she turning to her son but jem was gone he flew out to the stable the moment he saw the flap of farmer trucks great coat sit ye down farmer said the old woman after they had waited about five minutes in expectation of jems return youd best sit down if the lady will give you leave for hell not hurry himself back again my boys a fool madam about that there horse trying to laugh she added i knew how lightfoot and he would be loath enough to part he wont bring him out till the last minute so do sit ye down neighbour the farmer had scarcely sat down when jem with a pale wild countenance came back whats the matter said his mistress god bless the boy said his mother looking at him quite frightened whilst he tried to speak but could not she went up to him and then leaning his head against her he cried its goneits all gone and bursting into tears he sobbed as if his little heart would break whats gone love said his mother my two guineaslightfoots two guineas i went to fetch em to give you mammy but the broken flower pot that i put them in and alls gonequite gone repeated he checking his sobs i saw them safe last night and was showing em to lightfoot and i was so glad to think i had earned them all myself and i thought how surprised youd look and how glad youd be and how youd kiss me and all his mother listened to him with the greatest surprise whilst his mistress stood in silence looking first at the old woman and then at jem with a penetrating eye as if she suspected the truth of his story and was afraid of becoming the dupe of her own compassion this is a very strange thing said she gravely how came you to leave all your money in a broken flower pot in the stable how came you not to give it to your mother to take care of why dont you remember said jem looking up in the midst of his tearswhy dont you remember you your own self bid me not tell her about it till you were by and did you not tell her nay ask mammy said jem a little offended and when afterwards the lady went on questioning him in a severe manner as if she did not believe him he at last made no answer oh jem jem why dont you speak to the lady said his mother i have spoke and spoke the truth said jem proudly and she did not believe me still the lady who had lived too long in the world to be without suspicion maintained a cold manner and determined to wait the event without interfering saying only that she hoped the money would be found and advised jem to have done crying i have done said jem i shall cry no more and as he had the greatest command over himself he actually did not shed another tear not even when the farmer got up to go saying he could wait no longer jem silently went to bring out lightfoot the lady now took her seat where she could see all that passed at the open parlour window the old woman stood at the door and several idle people of the village who had gathered round the ladys carriage examining it turned about to listen in a minute or two jem appeared with a steady countenance leading lightfoot and when he came up without saying a word put the bridle into farmer trucks hand he has been a good horse said the farmer he is a good horse cried jem and threw his arm over lightfoots neck hiding his own face as he leaned upon him at this instant a party of milk women went by and one of them having set down her pail came behind jem and gave him a pretty smart blow upon the back he looked up and dont you know me said she i forget said jem i think i have seen your face before but i forget do you so and youll tell me just now said she half opening her hand that you forget who gave you this and who charged you not to part with it too here she quite opened her large hand and on the palm of it appeared jems silver penny where exclaimed jem seizing it oh where did you find it and have youoh tell me have you got the rest of my money i know nothing of your moneyi dont know what you would be at said the milk woman but wherepray tell me wheredid you find this with them that you gave it to i suppose said the milk woman turning away suddenly to take up her milk pail but now jems mistress called to her through the window begging her to stop and joining in his entreaties to know how she came by the silver penny why madam said she taking up the corner of her apron i came by it in an odd way too you must know my betty is sick so i came with the milk myself though its not what im used to for my bettyyou know my betty said she turning round to the old woman my betty serves you and shes a tight and stirring lassy maam i can assure yes i dont doubt it said the lady impatiently but about the silver penny why thats true as i was coming along all alone for the rest came round and i came a short cut across yon fieldno you cant see it madam where you standbut if you were here i see iti know it said jem out of breath with anxiety wellwelli rested my pail upon the stile and sets me down awhile and there comes out of the hedgei dont know well how for they startled me so id liked to have thrown down my milktwo boys one about the size of he said she pointing to jem and one a matter taller but ill looking like so i did not think to stir to make way for them and they were like in a desperate hurry so without waiting for the stile one of em pulled at the gate and when it would not open for it was tied with a pretty stout cord one of em whips out with his knife and cuts it now have you a knife about you sir continued the milk woman to the farmer he gave her his knife here now maam just sticking as it were here between the blade and the haft was the silver penny the lad took no notice but when he opened it out it falls still he takes no heed but cuts the cord as i said before and through the gate they went and out of sight in half a minute i picks up the penny for my heart misgave me that it was the very one husband had had a long time and had given against my voice to he pointing to jem and i charged him not to part with it and maam when i looked i knew it by the mark so i thought i would show it to he again pointing to jem and let him give it back to those it belongs to it belongs to me said jem i never gave it to anybodybut but cried the farmer those boys have robbed him it is they who have all his money oh which way did they go cried jem ill run after them no no said the lady calling to her servant and she desired him to take his horse and ride after them ay added farmer truck do you take the road and ill take the field way and ill be bound well have em presently whilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves the lady who was now thoroughly convinced of jems truth desired her coachman would produce what she had ordered him to bring with him that evening out of the boot of the carriage the coachman immediately produced a new saddle and bridle how jems eyes sparkled when the saddle was thrown upon lightfoots back put it on your horse yourself jem said the lady it is yours confused reports of lightfoots splendid accoutrements of the pursuit of thieves and of the fine and generous lady who was standing at dame prestons window quickly spread through the village and drew everybody from their houses they crowded round jem to hear the story the children especially who were fond of him expressed the strongest indignation against the thieves every eye was on the stretch and now some who had run down the lane came back shouting here they are theyve got the thieves the footman on horseback carried one boy before him and the farmer striding along dragged another the latter had on a red jacket which little jem immediately recollected and scarcely dared lift his eyes to look at the boy on horseback good god said he to himself it must beyet surely it cant be lawrence the footman rode on as fast as the people would let him the boys hat was slouched and his head hung down so that nobody could see his face at this instant there was a disturbance in the crowd a man who was half drunk pushed his way forwards swearing that nobody should stop him that he had a right to seeand he would see and so he did for forcing through all resistance he staggered up to the footman just as he was lifting down the boy he had carried before him i willi tell you i will see the thief cried the drunken man pushing up the boys hat it was his own son lawrence exclaimed the wretched father the shock sobered him at once and he hid his face in his hands there was an awful silence lawrence fell on his knees and in a voice that could scarcely be heard made a full confession of all the circumstances of his guilt such a young creature so wicked the bystanders exclaimed what could put such wickedness in your head bad company said lawrence and how came youwhat brought you into bad company i dont know except it was idleness while this was saying the farmer was emptying lazy lawrences pockets and when the money appeared all his former companions in the village looked at each other with astonishment and terror their parents grasped their little hands closer and cried thank god he is not my son how often when he was little we used as he lounged about to tell him that idleness was the root of all evil as for the hardened wretch his accomplice everyone was impatient to have him sent to gaol he put on a bold insolent countenance till he heard lawrences confession till the money was found upon him and he heard the milk woman declare that she would swear to the silver penny which he had dropped then he turned pale and betrayed the strongest signs of fear we must take him before the justice said the farmer and hell be lodged in bristol gaol oh said jem springing forwards when lawrences hands were going to be tied let him gowont youcant you let him go yes madam for mercys sake said jems mother to the lady think what a disgrace to his family to be sent to gaol his father stood by wringing his hands in an agony of despair its all my fault cried he i brought him up in idleness but hell never be idle any more said jem wont you speak for him maam dont ask the lady to speak for him said the farmer its better he should go to bridewell now than to the gallows by and by nothing more was said for everybody felt the truth of the farmers speech lawrence was eventually sent to bridewell for a month and the stable boy was sent for trial convicted and transported to botany bay during lawrences confinement jem often visited him and carried him such little presents as he could afford to give and jem could afford to be generous because he was industrious lawrences heart was touched by his kindness and his example struck him so forcibly that when his confinement was ended he resolved to set immediately to work and to the astonishment of all who knew him soon became remarkable for industry he was found early and late at his work established a new character and for ever lost the name of lazy lawrence the false key mr spencer a very benevolent and sensible man undertook the education of several poor children among the rest was a boy of the name of franklin whom he had bred up from the time he was five years old franklin had the misfortune to be the son of a man of infamous character and for many years this was a disgrace and reproach to his child when any of the neighbours children quarrelled with him they used to tell him that he would turn out like his father but mr spencer always assured him that he might make himself whatever he pleased that by behaving well he would certainly sooner or later secure the esteem and love of all who knew him even of those who had the strongest prejudice against him on his fathers account this hope was very delightful to franklin and he showed the strongest desire to learn and to do everything that was right so that mr spencer soon grew fond of him and took great pains to instruct him and to give him all the good habits and principles which might make him a useful respectable and happy man when he was about thirteen years of age mr spencer one day sent for him into his closet and as he was folding up a letter which he had been writing said to him with a very kind look but in a graver tone than usual franklin you are going to leave me sir said franklin you are now going to leave me and to begin the world for yourself you will carry this letter to my sister mrs churchill in queens square you know queens square franklin bowed you must expect continued mr spencer to meet with several disagreeable things and a great deal of rough work at your first setting out but be faithful and obedient to your mistress and obliging to your fellow servants and all will go well mrs churchill will make you a very good mistress if you behave properly and i have no doubt but you will thank you sir and you will alwaysi mean as long as you deserve itfind a friend in me thank you siri am sure you are there franklin stopped short for the recollection of all mr spencers goodness rushed upon him at once and he could not say another word bring me a candle to seal this letter said his master and he was very glad to get out of the room he came back with the candle and with a stout heart stood by whilst the letter was sealing and when his master put it into his hand said in a cheerful voice i hope you will let me see you again sir sometimes certainly whenever your mistress can spare you i shall be very glad to see you and remember if ever you get into any difficulty dont be afraid to come to me i have sometimes spoken harshly to you but you will not meet with a more indulgent friend franklin at this turned away with a full heart and after making two or three attempts to express his gratitude left the room without being able to speak he got to queens square about three oclock the door was opened by a large red faced man in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat to whom he felt afraid to give his message lest he should not be a servant well whats your business sir said the butler i have a letter for mrs churchill sir said franklin endeavouring to pronounce his sir in a tone as respectful as the butlers was insolent the man having examined the direction seal and edges of the letter carried it upstairs and in a few minutes returned and ordered franklin to rub his shoes well and follow him he was then shown into a handsome room where he found his mistressan elderly lady she asked him a few questions examining him attentively as she spoke and her severe eye at first and her gracious smile afterwards made him feel that she was a person to be both loved and feared i shall give you in charge said she ringing a bell to my housekeeper and i hope she will have no reason to be displeased with you the housekeeper when she first came in appeared with a smiling countenance but the moment she cast her eyes on franklin it changed to a look of surprise and suspicion her mistress recommended him to her protection saying pomfret i hope you will keep this boy under your own eye and she received him with a cold very well maam which plainly showed that she was not disposed to like him in fact mrs pomfret was a woman so fond of power and so jealous of favour that she would have quarrelled with an angel who had got so near her mistress without her introduction she smothered her displeasure however till night when as she attended her mistress toilette she could not refrain from expressing her sentiments she began cautiously maam is not this the boy mr spencer was talking of one daythat has been brought up by the villaintropic society i think they call it philanthropic society yes said her mistress and my brother gives him a high character i hope he will do very well im sure i hope so too observed mrs pomfret but i cant say for my part ive no great notion of those low people they say all those children are taken from the very lowest drugs and refuges of the town and surely they are like enough maam to take after their own fathers and mothers but they are not suffered to be with their parents rejoined the lady and therefore cannot be hurt by their example this little boy to be sure was unfortunate in his father but he has had an excellent education oh edication to be sure maam i know i dont say but what edication is a great thing but then maam edication cant change the natur thats in one they say and ones that born naturally bad and low they say all the edication in the world wont do no good and for my part maam i know you knows best but i should be afraid to let any of those villaintropic folks get into my house for nobody can tell the natur of them aforehand i declare it frights me pomfret i thought you had better sense how would this poor boy earn his bread he would be forced to starve or steal if everybody had such prejudices pomfret who really was a good woman was softened at this idea and said god forbid he should starve or steal and god forbid i should say anything prejudiciary of the boy for there may be no harm in him well said mrs churchill changing her tone but pomfret if we dont like the boy at the end of the month we have done with him for i have only promised mr spencer to keep him a month upon trial there is no harm done dear no maam to be sure and cook must put up with her disappointment thats all what disappointment about her nephew maam the boy she and i was speaking to you for when the day you called her up about the almond pudding maam if you remember you said you should have no objections to try the boy and upon that cook bought him new shirts but they are to the good as i tell her but i did not promise to take her nephew o no maam not at all she does not think to say that else i should be very angry but the poor woman never let fall a word any more than frets that the boy should miss such a good place well but since i did say that i should have no objection to try him i shall keep my word let him come to morrow let them both have a fair trial and at the end of the month i can decide which i like best and which we had better keep dismissed with these orders mrs pomfret hastened to report all that had passed to the cook like a favourite minister proud to display the extent of her secret influence in the morning felix the cooks nephew arrived and the moment he came into the kitchen every eye even the scullions was fixed upon him with approbation and afterwards glanced upon franklin with contemptcontempt which franklin could not endure without some confusion though quite unconscious of having deserved it nor upon the most impartial and cool self examination could he comprehend the justice of his judges he perceived indeedfor the comparisons were minutely made in audible and scornful whispersthat felix was a much handsomer or as the kitchen maid expressed it a much more genteeler gentlemanly looking like sort of person than he was and he was made to understand that he wanted a frill to his shirt a cravat a pair of thin shoes and above all shoe strings besides other nameless advantages which justly made his rival the admiration of the kitchen however upon calling to mind all that his friend mr spencer had ever said to him he could not recollect his having warned him that shoe strings were indispensable requisites to the character of a good servant so that he could only comfort himself with resolving if possible to make amends for these deficiencies and to dissipate the prejudices which he saw were formed against him by the strictest adherence to all that his tutor had taught him to be his duty he hoped to secure the approbation of his mistress by scrupulous obedience to all her commands and faithful care of all that belonged to her at the same time he flattered himself he should win the goodwill of his fellow servants by showing a constant desire to oblige them he pursued this plan of conduct steadily for nearly three weeks and found that he succeeded beyond his expectations in pleasing his mistress but unfortunately he found it more difficult to please his fellow servants and he sometimes offended when he least expected it he had made great progress in the affections of corkscrew the butler by working indeed very hard for him and doing every day at least half his business but one unfortunate night the butler was gone out the bell rang he went upstairs and his mistress asking where corkscrew was he answered that he was gone out where to said his mistress i dont know answered franklin and as he had told exactly the truth and meant to do no harm he was surprised at the butlers return when he repeated to him what had passed at receiving a sudden box on the ear and the appellation of a mischievous impertinent mean spirited brat mischievous impertinent mean repeated franklin to himself but looking in the butlers face which was a deeper scarlet than usual he judged that he was far from sober and did not doubt but that the next morning when he came to the use of his reason he would be sensible of his injustice and apologize for his box of the ear but no apology coming all day franklin at last ventured to request an explanation or rather to ask what he had best do on the next occasion why said corkscrew when mistress asked for me how came you to say i was gone out because you know i saw you go out and when she asked you where i was gone how came you to say that you did not know because indeed i did not you are a stupid blockhead could you not say i was gone to the washerwomans but were you said franklin was i cried corkscrew and looked as if he would have struck him again how dare you give me the lie mr hypocrite you would be ready enough ill be bound to make excuses for yourself why are not mistress clogs cleaned go along and blacken em this minute and send felix to me from this time forward felix alone was privileged to enter the butlers pantry felix became the favourite of corkscrew and though franklin by no means sought to pry into the mysteries of their private conferences nor ever entered without knocking at the door yet it was his fate once to be sent of a message at an unlucky time and as the door was half open he could not avoid seeing felix drinking a bumper of red liquor which he could not help suspecting to be wine and as the decanter which usually went upstairs after dinner was at this time in the butlers grasp without any stopper in it he was involuntarily forced to suspect they were drinking his mistress wine nor were the bumpers of port the only unlawful rewards which felix received his aunt the cook had occasion for his assistance and she had many delicious douceurs in her gift many a handful of currants many a half custard many a triangular remnant of pie besides the choice of his own meal at breakfast dinner and supper fell to the share of the favourite felix whilst franklin was neglected though he took the utmost pains to please the cook in all honourable service and when she was hot angry or hurried he was always at hand to help her and in the hour of adversity when the clock struck five and no dinner was dished and no kitchen maid with twenty pair of hands was to be had franklin would answer to her call with flowers to garnish her dishes and presence of mind to know in the midst of the commotion where everything that was wanting was to be found so that quick as lightning all difficulties vanished before him yet when the danger was over and the hour of adversity had past the ungrateful cook would forget her benefactor and when it came to his supper time would throw him with a carelessness that touched him sensibly anything which the other servants were too nice to eat all this franklin bore with fortitude nor did he envy felix the dainties which he ate sometimes close beside him for said he to himself i have a clear conscience and that is more than felix can have i know how he wins cooks favour too well and i fancy i know how i have offended her for since the day i saw the basket she has done nothing but huff me the history of the basket was this mrs pomfret the housekeeper had several times directly and indirectly given the world below to understand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigious quantity of meat eaten of late now when she spoke it was usually at dinner time she always looked or franklin imagined that she looked suspiciously at him other people looked more maliciously but as he felt himself perfectly innocent he went on eating his dinner in silence but at length it was time to explain one sunday there appeared a handsome sirloin of beef which before noon on monday had shrunk almost to the bare bone and presented such a deplorable spectacle to the opening eyes of mrs pomfret that her long smothered indignation burst forth and she boldly declared she was now certain there had been foul play and she would have the beef found or she would know why she spoke but no beef appeared till franklin with a look of sudden recollection cried did not i see something like a piece of beef in a basket in the dairyi think the cook as if somebody had smote her a deadly blow grew pale but suddenly recovering the use of her speech turned upon franklin and with a voice of thunder gave him the lie direct and forthwith taking mrs pomfret by the ruffle led the way to the dairy declaring she could defy the worldthat so she could and would there maam said she kicking an empty basket which lay on the floortheres malice for you ask him why he dont show you the beef in the basket i thought i saw poor franklin began you thought you saw cried the cook coming close up to him with kimboed arms and looking like a dragon and pray sir what business has such a one as you to think you see and pray maam will you be pleased to speakperhaps maam hell condescend to obey youmaam will you be pleased to forbid him my dairy for here he comes prying and spying about and how maam am i to answer for my butter and cream or anything at all im sure its what i cant pretend to unless you do me the justice to forbid him my places mrs pomfret whose eyes were blinded by her prejudices against the folks of the villaintropic society and also by her secret jealousy of a boy whom she deemed to be a growing favourite of her mistress took part with the cook and ended as she began with a firm persuasion that franklin was the guilty person let him alone let him alone said she he has as many turns and windings as a hare but we shall catch him yet ill be bound in some of his doublings i knew the nature of him well enough from the first time i ever set my eyes upon him but mistress shall have her own way and see the end of it these words and the bitter sense of injustice drew tears at length fast down the proud cheek of franklin which might possibly have touched mrs pomfret if felix with a sneer had not called them crocodile tears felix too thought he this is too much in fact felix had till now professed himself his firm ally and had on his part received from franklin unequivocal proofs of friendship for it must be told that every other morning when it was felixs turn to get breakfast felix never was up in decent time and must inevitably have come to public disgrace if franklin had not got all the breakfast things ready for him the bread and butter spread and the toast toasted and had not moreover regularly when the clock struck eight and mrs pomfrets foot was heard overhead run to call the sleeping felix and helped him constantly through the hurry of getting dressed one instant before the housekeeper came downstairs all this could not but be present to his memory but seeming to reproach him franklin wiped away his crocodile tears and preserved a magnanimous silence the hour of retribution was however not so far off as felix imagined cunning people may go on cleverly in their devices for some time but although they may escape once twice perhaps ninety nine times what does that signifyfor the hundredth time they come to shame and lose all their character grown bold by frequent success felix became more careless in his operations and it happened that one day he met his mistress full in the passage as he was going on one of the cooks secret errands where are you going felix said his mistress to the washerwomans maam answered he with his usual effrontery very well said she call at the booksellers instay i must write down the direction pomfret said she opening the housekeepers room door have you a bit of paper pomfret came with the writing paper and looked very angry to see that felix was going out without her knowledge so while mrs churchill was writing the direction she stood talking to him about it whilst he in the greatest terror imaginable looked up in her face as she spoke but was all the time intent on parrying on the other side the attacks of a little french dog of his mistress which unluckily for him had followed her into the passage manchon was extremely fond of felix who by way of pleasing his mistress had paid most assiduous court to her dog yet now his caresses were rather troublesome manchon leaped up and was not to be rebuffed poor fellowpoor fellowdown down poor fellow cried felix and put him away but manchon leaped up again and began smelling near the fatal pocket in a most alarming manner you will see by this direction where you are to go said his mistress manchon come hereand you will be so good as to bring medown down manchon be quiet but manchon knew betterhe had now got his head into felixs pocket and would not be quiet till he had drawn from thence rustling out of its brown paper half a cold turkey which had been missing since morning my cold turkey as im alive exclaimed the housekeeper darting upon it with horror and amazement what is all this said mrs churchill in a composed voice i dont know maam answered felix so confused that he knew not what to say but but what cried mrs pomfret indignation flashing from her eyes but what repeated his mistress waiting for his reply with a calm air of attention which still more disconcerted felix for though with an angry person he might have some chance of escape he knew that he could not invent any excuse in such circumstances which could stand the examination of a person in her sober senses he was struck dumb speak said mrs churchill in a still lower tone i am ready to hear all you have to say in my house everybody shall have justice speakbut what but stammered felix and after in vain attempting to equivocate confessed that he was going to take the turkey to his cousins but he threw all the blame upon his aunt the cook who he said had ordered him upon this expedition the cook was now summoned but she totally denied all knowledge of the affair with the same violence with which she had lately confounded franklin about the beef in the basket not entirely however with the same success for felix perceiving by his mistress eye that she was on the point of desiring him to leave the house immediately and not being very willing to leave a place in which he had lived so well with the butler did not hesitate to confront his aunt with assurance equal to her own he knew how to bring his charge home to her he produced a note in her own handwriting the purport of which was to request her cousins acceptance of some delicate cold turkey and to beg she would send her by the return of the bearer a little of her cherry brandy mrs churchill coolly wrote upon the back of the note her cooks discharge and informed felix she had no further occasion for his services but upon his pleading with many tears which franklin did not call crocodile tears that he was so young that he was under the dominion of his aunt he touched mrs pomfrets compassion and she obtained for him permission to stay till the end of the month to give him yet a chance of redeeming his character mrs pomfret now seeing how far she had been imposed upon resolved for the future to be more upon her guard with felix and felt that she had treated franklin with great injustice when she accused him of malpractices about the sirloin of beef good people when they are made sensible that they have treated anyone with injustice are impatient to have an opportunity to rectify their mistake and mrs pomfret was now prepared to see everything which franklin did in the most favourable point of view especially as the next day she discovered that it was he who every morning boiled the water for her tea and buttered her toastservices for which she had always thought she was indebted to felix besides she had rated felixs abilities very highly because he made up her weekly accounts for her but unluckily once when franklin was out of the way and she brought a bill in a hurry to her favourite to cast up she discovered that he did not know how to cast up pounds shillings and pence and he was obliged to confess that she must wait till franklin came home but passing over a number of small incidents which gradually unfolded the character of the two boys we must proceed to a more serious affair corkscrew frequently after he had finished taking away supper and after the housekeeper was gone to bed sallied forth to a neighbouring alehouse to drink with his friends the alehouse was kept by that cousin of felixs who was so fond of delicate cold turkey and who had such choice cherry brandy corkscrew kept the key of the house door so that he could return home whenever he thought proper and if he should by accident be called for by his mistress after supper felix knew where to find him and did not scruple to make any of those excuses which poor franklin had too much integrity to use all these precautions taken the butler was at liberty to indulge his favourite passion which so increased with indulgence that his wages were by no means sufficient to support him in this way of life every day he felt less resolution to break through his bad habits for every day drinking became more necessary to him his health was ruined with a red pimpled bloated face emaciated legs and a swelled diseased body he appeared the victim of intoxication in the morning when he got up his hands trembled his spirits flagged he could do nothing until he had taken a draman operation which he was obliged to repeat several times in the course of the day as all those wretched people must who once acquire this habit he had run up a long bill at the alehouse which he frequented and the landlord who grew urgent for his money refused to give further credit one night when corkscrew had drunk enough only to make him fretful he leaned with his elbow surlily upon the table began to quarrel with the landlord and swore that he had not of late treated him like a gentleman to which the landlord coolly replied that as long as he had paid like a gentleman he had been treated like one and that was as much as anyone could expect or at any rate as much as anyone would meet with in this world for the truth of this assertion he appealed laughing to a party of men who were drinking in the room the men however took part with corkscrew and drawing him over to their table made him sit down with them they were in high good humour and the butler soon grew so intimate with them that in the openness of his heart he soon communicated to them not only all his own affairs but all that he knew and more than all that he knew of his mistress his new friends were by no means uninterested by his conversation and encouraged him as much as possible to talk for they had secret views which the butler was by no means sufficiently sober to discover mrs churchill had some fine old family plate and these men belonged to a gang of housebreakers before they parted with corkscrew they engaged him to meet them again the next night their intimacy was still more closely cemented one of the men actually offered to lend corkscrew three guineas towards the payment of his debt and hinted that if he thought proper he could easily get the whole cleared off upon this hint corkscrew became all attention till after some hesitation on their part and repeated promises of secrecy on his they at length disclosed their plans to him they gave him to understand that if he would assist in letting them into his mistress house they would let him have an ample share in the booty the butler who had the reputation of being an honest man and indeed whose integrity had hitherto been proof against everything but his mistress port turned pale and trembled at this proposal drank two or three bumpers to drown thought and promised to give an answer the next day he went home more than half intoxicated his mind was so full of what had passed that he could not help bragging to felix whom he found awake at his return that he could have his bill paid off at the alehouse whenever he pleased dropping besides some hints which were not lost upon felix in the morning felix reminded him of the things which he had said and corkscrew alarmed endeavoured to evade his questions by saying that he was not in his senses when he talked in that manner nothing however that he could urge made any impression upon felix whose recollection on the subject was perfectly distinct and who had too much cunning himself and too little confidence in his companion to be the dupe of his dissimulation the butler knew not what to do when he saw that felix was absolutely determined either to betray their scheme or to become a sharer in the booty the next night came and he was now to make a final decision either to determine on breaking off entirely with his new acquaintances or taking felix with him to join in the plot his debt his love of drinking the impossibility of indulging it without a fresh supply of money all came into his mind at once and conquered his remaining scruples it is said by those whose fatal experience gives them a right to be believed that a drunkard will sacrifice anything everything sooner than the pleasure of habitual intoxication how much easier is it never to begin a bad custom than to break through it when once formed the hour of rendezvous came and corkscrew went to the alehouse where he found the housebreakers waiting for him and a glass of brandy ready poured out he sigheddrankhesitateddrank againheard the landlord talk of his bill saw the money produced which would pay it in a momentdrank againcursed himself and giving his hand to the villain who was whispering in his ear swore that he could not help it and must do as they would have him they required of him to give up the key of the house door that they might get another made by it he had left it with felix and was now obliged to explain the new difficulty which had arisen felix knew enough to ruin them and must therefore be won over this was no very difficult task he had a strong desire to have some worked cravats and the butler knew enough of him to believe that this would be a sufficient bribe the cravats were bought and shown to felix he thought them the only things wanting to make him a complete fine gentleman and to go without them especially when he had once seen himself in the glass with one tied on in a splendid bow appeared impossible even this paltry temptation working upon his vanity at length prevailed with a boy whose integrity had long been corrupted by the habits of petty pilfering and daily falsehood it was agreed that the first time his mistress sent him out on a message he should carry the key of the house door to his cousins and deliver it into the hands of one of the gang who were there in waiting for it such was the scheme felix the night after all this had been planned went to bed and fell fast asleep but the butler who had not yet stifled the voice of conscience felt in the silence of the night so insupportably miserable that instead of going to rest he stole softly into the pantry for a bottle of his mistress wine and there drinking glass after glass he stayed till he became so far intoxicated that though he contrived to find his way back to bed he could by no means undress himself without any power of recollection he flung himself upon the bed leaving his candle half hanging out of the candlestick beside him franklin slept in the next room to him and presently awaking thought he perceived a strong smell of something burning he jumped up and seeing a light under the butlers door gently opened it and to his astonishment beheld one of the bed curtains in flames he immediately ran to the butler and pulled him with all his force to rouse him from his lethargy he came to his senses at length but was so terrified and so helpless that if it had not been for franklin the whole house would soon inevitably have been on fire felix trembling and cowardly knew not what to do and it was curious to see him obeying franklin whose turn it now was to command franklin ran upstairs to awaken mrs pomfret whose terror of fire was so great that she came from her room almost out of her senses whilst he with the greatest presence of mind recollected where he had seen two large tubs of water which the maids had prepared the night before for their washing and seizing the wet linen which had been left to soak he threw them upon the flames he exerted himself with so much good sense that the fire was presently extinguished everything was now once more safe and quiet mrs pomfret recovering from her fright postponed all inquiries till the morning and rejoiced that her mistress had not been awakened whilst corkscrew flattered himself that he should be able to conceal the true cause of the accident dont you tell mrs pomfret where you found the candle when you came into the room said he to franklin if she asks me you know i must tell the truth replied he must repeated felix sneeringly what you must be a tell tale no i never told any tales of anybody and i should be very sorry to get anyone into a scrape but for all that i shall not tell a lie either for myself or anybody else let you call me what names you will but if i were to give you something that you would like said corkscrewsomething that i know you would like repeated felix nothing you can give me will do answered franklin steadily so it is useless to say any more about iti hope i shall not be questioned in this hope he was mistaken for the first thing mrs pomfret did in the morning was to come into the room to examine and deplore the burnt curtains whilst corkscrew stood by endeavouring to exculpate himself by all the excuses he could invent mrs pomfret however though sometimes blinded by her prejudices was no fool and it was absolutely impossible to make her believe that a candle which had been left on the hearth where corkscrew protested he had left it could have set curtains on fire which were at least six feet distant turning short round to franklin she desired that he would show her where he found the candle when he came into the room he took up the candlestick but the moment the housekeeper cast her eye upon it she snatched it from his hands how did this candlestick come here this was not the candlestick you found here last night cried she yes indeed it was answered franklin that is impossible retorted she vehemently for i left this candlestick with my own hands last night in the hall the last thing i did after you said she turning to the butler was gone to bedim sure of itnay dont you recollect my taking this japanned candlestick out of your hand and making you to go up to bed with the brass one and i bolted the door at the stair head after you this was all very true but corkscrew had afterwards gone down from his room by a back staircase unbolted that door and upon his return from the alehouse had taken the japanned candlestick by mistake upstairs and had left the brass one in its stead upon the hall table oh maam said felix indeed you forget for mr corkscrew came into my room to desire me to call him betimes in the morning and i happened to take particular notice and he had the japanned candlestick in his hand and that was just as i heard you bolting the door indeed maam you forget indeed sir retorted mrs pomfret rising in anger i do not forget im not come to be supperannuated yet i hope how do you dare to tell me i forget oh maam cried felix i beg your pardon i did noti did not mean to say you forgot but only i thought perhaps you might not particularly remember for if you please to recollect i wont please to recollect just whatever you please sir hold your tongue why should you poke yourself into this scrape what have you to do with it i should be glad to know nothing in the world oh nothing in the world im sure i beg your pardon maam answered felix in a soft tone and sneaking off left his friend corkscrew to fight his own battle secretly resolving to desert in good time if he saw any danger of the alehouse transactions coming to light corkscrew could make but very blundering excuses for himself and conscious of guilt he turned pale and appeared so much more terrified than butlers usually appear when detected in a lie that mrs pomfret resolved as she said to sift the matter to the bottom impatiently did she wait till the clock struck nine and her mistress bell rang the signal for her attendance at her levee how do you find yourself this morning maam said she undrawing the curtains very sleepy indeed answered her mistress in a drowsy voice i think i must sleep half an hour longershut the curtains as you please maam but i suppose i had better open a little of the window shutter for its past nine but just struck oh dear maam it struck before i came upstairs and you know we are twenty minutes slowlord bless us exclaimed mrs pomfret as she let fall the bar of the window which roused her mistress im sure i beg your pardon a thousand timesits only the barbecause i had this great key in my hand put down the key then or youll knock something else down and you may open the shutters now for im quite awake dear me im so sorry to think of disturbing you cried mrs pomfret at the same time throwing the shutters wide open but to be sure maam i have something to tell you which wont let you sleep again in a hurry i brought up this here key of the house door for reasons of my own which im sure youll approve of but im not come to that part of my story yet i hope you were not disturbed by the noise in the house last night maam i heard no noise i am surprised at that though continued mrs pomfret and proceeded to give a most ample account of the fire of her fears and her suspicions to be sure maam what i say is that without the spirit of prophecy one can nowadays account for what has passed im quite clear in my own judgment that mr corkscrew must have been out last night after i went to bed for besides the japanned candlestick which of itself im sure is strong enough to hang a man theres another circumstance maam that certifies it to methough i have not mentioned it maam to no one yet lowering her voicefranklin when i questioned him told me that he left the lantern in the outside porch in the court last night and this morning it was on the kitchen table now maam that lantern could not come without hands and i could not forget about that you know for franklin says hes sure he left the lantern out and do you believe him inquired her mistress to be sure maamhow can i help believing him i never found him out in the least symptom of a lie since ever he came into the house so one cant help believing in him like him or not without meaning to tell a falsehood however said the lady he might make a mistake no maam he never makes mistakes it is not his way to go gossiping and tattling he never tells anything till hes asked and then its fit he should about the sirloin of beef and all he was right in the end i found to do him justice and im sure hes right now about the lanternhes always right mrs churchill could not help smiling if you had seen him maam last night in the midst of the fireim sure we may thank him that we were not burned alive in our bedsand i shall never forget his coming to call me poor fellow he that i was always scolding and scolding enough to make him hate me but hes too good to hate anybody and ill be bound ill make it up to him now take care that you dont go from one extreme into another pomfret dont spoil the boy no maam theres no danger of that but im sure if you had seen him last night yourself you would think he deserved to be rewarded and so he shall be rewarded said mrs churchill but i will try him more fully yet theres no occasion i think for trying him any more maam said mrs pomfret who was as violent in her likings as in her dislikes pray desire continued her mistress that he will bring up breakfast this morning and leave the key of the house door pomfret with me when franklin brought the urn into the breakfast parlour his mistress was standing by the fire with the key in her hand she spoke to him of his last nights exertions in terms of much approbation how long have you lived with me said she pausing three weeks i think three weeks and four days madam that is but a short time yet you have conducted yourself so as to make me think i may depend upon you you know this key i believe madam it is the key of the house door it is i shall trust it in your care it is a great trust for so young a person as you are franklin stood silent with a firm but modest look if you take the charge of this key continued his mistress remember it is upon condition that you never give it out of your own hands in the daytime it must not be left in the door you must not tell anybody where you keep it at night and the house door must not be unlocked after eleven oclock at night unless by my orders will you take charge of the key upon these conditions i will madam do anything you order me said franklin and received the key from her hands when mrs churchills orders were made known they caused many secret marvellings and murmurings corkscrew and felix were disconcerted and dared not openly avow their discontent and they treated franklin with the greatest seeming kindness and cordiality everything went on smoothly for three days the butler never attempted his usual midnight visits to the alehouse but went to bed in proper time and paid particular court to mrs pomfret in order to dispel her suspicions she had never had any idea of the real fact that he and felix were joined in a plot with house breakers to rob the house but thought he only went out at irregular hours to indulge himself in his passion for drinking thus stood affairs the night before mrs churchills birthday corkscrew by the housekeepers means ventured to present a petition that he might go to the play the next day and his request was granted franklin came into the kitchen just when all the servants had gathered round the butler who with great importance was reading aloud the play bill everybody present soon began to speak at once and with great enthusiasm talked of the playhouse the actors and actresses and then felix in the first pause turned to franklin and said lord you know nothing of all this you never went to a play did you never said franklin and felt he did not know why a little ashamed and he longed extremely to go to one how should you like to go to the play with me to morrow said corkscrew oh exclaimed franklin i should like it exceedingly and do you think mistress would let you if i asked i think maybe she would if mrs pomfret asked her but then you have no money have you no said franklin sighing but stay said corkscrew what i am thinking of is that if mistress will let you go ill treat you myself rather than that you should he disappointed delight surprise and gratitude appeared in franklins face at these words corkscrew rejoiced to see that now at least he had found a most powerful temptation well then ill go just now and ask her in the meantime lend me the key of the house door for a minute or two the key answered franklin starting im sorry but i cant do that for ive promised my mistress never to let it out of my own hands but how will she know anything of the matter run run and get it for us no i cannot replied franklin resisting the push which the butler gave his shoulder you cant cried corkscrew changing his tone then sir i cant take you to the play very well sir said franklin sorrowfully but with steadiness very well sir said felix mimicking him you need not look so important nor fancy yourself such a great man because youre master of a key say no more to him interrupted corkscrew let him alone to take his own way felix you would have no objection i suppose to going to the play with me oh i should like it of all things if i did not come between anybody else but come come added the hypocrite assuming a tone of friendly persuasion you wont be such a blockhead franklin as to lose going to the play for nothing its only just obstinacy what harm can it do to lend mr corkscrew the key for five minutes hell give it to you back again safe and sound i dont doubt that answered franklin then it must be all because you dont wish to oblige mr corkscrew no but i cant oblige him in this for as i told you before my mistress trusted me i promised never to let the key out of my own hands and you would not have me break my trust mr spencer told me that was worse than robbing at the word robbing both corkscrew and felix involuntarily cast down their eyes and turned the conversation immediately saying that he did very right that they did not really want the key and had only asked for it just to try if he would keep his word shake hands said corkscrew i am glad to find you out to be an honest fellow i am sorry you did not think me an honest fellow before mr corkscrew said franklin giving his hand rather proudly and he walked away we shall make no hand of this prig said corkscrew but well have the key from him in spite of all his obstinacy said felix and let him make his story good as he can afterwards he shall repent of these airs to night ill watch him and find out where he hides the key and when hes asleep well get it without thanking him this plan felix put into execution they discovered the place where franklin kept the key at night stole it whilst he slept took off the impression in wax and carefully replaced it in franklins trunk exactly where they found it probably our young readers cannot guess what use they could mean to make of this impression of the key in wax knowing how to do mischief is very different from wishing to do it and the most innocent persons are generally the least ignorant by means of the impression which they had thus obtained corkscrew and felix proposed to get a false key made by picklock a smith who belonged to their gang of house breakers and with this false key knew they could open the door whenever they pleased little suspecting what had happened franklin the next morning went to unlock the house door as usual but finding the key entangled in the lock he took it out to examine it and perceived a lump of wax sticking in one of the wards struck with this circumstance it brought to his mind all that had passed the preceding evening and being sure that he had no wax near the key he began to suspect what had happened and he could not help recollecting what he had once heard felix say that give him but a halfpenny worth of wax and he could open the strongest lock that ever was made by hands all these things considered franklin resolved to take the key just as it was with the wax sticking to it to his mistress i was not mistaken when i thought i might trust you with this key said mrs churchill after she had heard his story my brother will be here to day and i shall consult him in the meantime say nothing of what has passed evening came and after tea mr spencer sent for franklin upstairs so mr franklin said he im glad to find you are in such high trust in this family franklin bowed but you have lost i understand the pleasure of going to the play to night i dont think anythingmuch i mean of that sir answered franklin smiling are corkscrew and felix gone to the play yes half an hour ago sir then i shall look into his room and examine the pantry and the plate that is under his care when mr spencer came to examine the pantry he found the large salvers and cups in a basket behind the door and the other things placed so as to be easily carried off nothing at first appeared in corkscrews bedchamber to strengthen their suspicions till just as they were going to leave the room mrs pomfret exclaimed why if there is not mr corkscrews dress coat hanging up there and if here isnt felixs fine cravat that he wanted in such a hurry to go to the play why sir they cant be gone to the play look at the cravat ah upon my word i am afraid they are not at the play no sir you may be sure that they are plotting with their barbarous gang at the alehouse and theyll certainly break into the house to night we shall all be murdered in our beds as sure as im a living woman sir but if youll only take my advice pray good mrs pomfret mr spencer observed dont be alarmed nay sir but i wont pretend to sleep in the house if franklin isnt to have a blunderbuss and i a baggonet you shall have both indeed mrs pomfret but dont make such a noise for everybody will hear you the love of mystery was the only thing which could have conquered mrs pomfrets love of talking she was silent and contented herself the rest of the evening with making signs looking ominous and stalking about the house like one possessed with a secret escaped from mrs pomfrets fears and advice mr spencer went to a shop within a few doors of the alehouse which he heard corkscrew frequented and sent to beg to speak to the landlord he came and when mr spencer questioned him confessed that corkscrew and felix were actually drinking in his house with two men of suspicious appearance that as he passed through the passage he heard them disputing about a key and that one of them said since weve got the key well go about it to night this was sufficient information mr spencer lest the landlord should give them information of what was going forwards took him along with him to bow street a constable and proper assistance was sent to mrs churchills they stationed themselves in a back parlour which opened on a passage leading to the butlers pantry where the plate was kept a little after midnight they heard the hall door open corkscrew and his accomplices went directly to the pantry and there mr spencer and the constable immediately secured them as they were carrying off their booty mrs churchill and pomfret had spent the night at the house of an acquaintance in the same street well maam said mrs pomfret who had heard all the news in the morning the villains are all safe thank god i was afraid to go to the window this morning but it was my luck to see them all go by to gaol they looked so shocking i am sure i never shall forget felixs look to my dying day but poor franklin maam that boy has the best heart in the world i could not get him to give a second look at them as they passed poor fellow i thought he would have dropped and he was so modest maam when mr spencer spoke to him and told him he had done his duty and did my brother tell him what reward i intend for him no maam and im sure franklin thinks no more of reward than i do i intend continued mrs churchill to sell some of my old useless plate and to lay it out in an annuity for franklins life la maam exclaimed mrs pomfret with unfeigned joy im sure you are very good and im very glad of it and continued mrs churchill here are some tickets for the play which i shall beg you pomfret to give him and to take him with you i am very much obliged to you indeed maam and ill go with him with all my heart and choose such plays as wont do no prejudice to his morality and maam continued mrs pomfret the night after the fire i left him my great bible and my watch in my will for i never was more mistaken at the first in any boy in my born days but he has won me by his own deserts and i shall from this time forth love all the villaintropic folks for his sake simple susan chapter i waked as her custom was before the day to do the observance due to sprightly may dryden in a retired hamlet on the borders of wales between oswestry and shrewsbury it is still the custom to celebrate the st of may the children of the village who look forward to this rural festival with joyful eagerness usually meet on the last day of april to make up their nosegays for the morning and to choose their queen their customary place of meeting is at a hawthorn which stands in a little green nook open on one side to a shady lane and separated on the other side by a thick sweet brier and hawthorn hedge from the garden of an attorney picture simple susan this attorney began the world with nothing but he contrived to scrape together a good deal of money everybody knew how he built a new house at the entrance of the village and had a large well fenced garden yet notwithstanding his fences he never felt himself secure such were his litigious habits and his suspicious temper that he was constantly at variance with his simple and peaceable neighbours some pig or dog or goat or goose was for ever trespassing his complaints and his extortions wearied and alarmed the whole hamlet the paths in his fields were at length unfrequented his stiles were blocked up with stones or stuffed with brambles and briers so that not a gosling could creep under or a giant get over them indeed so careful were even the village children of giving offence to this irritable man of the law that they would not venture to fly a kite near his fields lest it should entangle in his trees or fall upon his meadow mr case for this was the name of our attorney had a son and a daughter to whose education he had not time to attend as his whole soul was intent upon accumulating for them a fortune for several years he suffered his children to run wild in the village but suddenly on his being appointed to a considerable agency he began to think of making his children a little genteel he sent his son to learn latin he hired a maid to wait upon his daughter barbara and he strictly forbade her thenceforward to keep company with any of the poor children who had hitherto been her playfellows they were not sorry for this prohibition because she had been their tyrant rather than their companion she was vexed to observe that her absence was not regretted and she was mortified to perceive that she could not humble them by any display of airs and finery there was one poor girl amongst her former associates to whom she had a peculiar dislikesusan price a sweet tempered modest sprightly industrious lass who was the pride and delight of the village her father rented a small farm and unfortunately for him he lived near attorney case barbara used often to sit at her window watching susan at work sometimes she saw her in the neat garden raking the beds or weeding the borders sometimes she was kneeling at her beehive with fresh flowers for her bees sometimes she was in the poultry yard scattering corn from her sieve amongst the eager chickens and in the evening she was often seated in a little honeysuckle arbour with a clean light three legged deal table before her upon which she put her plain work susan had been taught to work neatly by her good mother who was very fond of her and to whom she was most gratefully attached mrs price was an intelligent active domestic woman but her health was not robust she earned money however by taking in plain work and she was famous for baking excellent bread and breakfast cakes she was respected in the village for her conduct as a wife and as a mother and all were eager to show her attention at her door the first branch of hawthorn was always placed on may morning and her susan was usually queen of the may it was now time to choose the queen the setting sun shone full upon the pink blossoms of the hawthorn when the merry group assembled upon their little green barbara was now walking in sullen state in her fathers garden she heard the busy voices in the lane and she concealed herself behind the high hedge that she might listen to their conversation wheres susan were the first unwelcome words which she overheard ay wheres susan repeated philip stopping short in the middle of a new tune that he was playing on his pipe i wish susan would come i want her to sing me this same tune over again i have not it yet and i wish susan would come im sure cried a little girl whose lap was full of primroses susan will give me some thread to tie up my nosegays and shell show me where the fresh violets grow and she has promised to give me a great bunch of her double cowslips to wear to morrow i wish she would come nothing can be done without susan she always shows us where the nicest flowers are to be found in the lanes and meadows said they she must make up the garlands and she shall be queen of the may exclaimed a multitude of little voices but she does not come said philip rose who was her particular friend now came forward to assure the impatient assembly that she would answer for it susan would come as soon as she possibly could and that she probably was detained by business at home the little electors thought that all business should give way to theirs and rose was dispatched to summon her friend immediately tell her to make haste cried philip attorney case dined at the abbey to dayluckily for us if he comes home and finds us here maybe hell drive us away for he says this bit of ground belongs to his garden though that is not true im sure for farmer price knows and says it was always open to the road the attorney wants to get our playground so he does i wish he and his daughter bab or miss barbara as she must now be called were a hundred miles off out of our way i know no later than yesterday she threw down my nine pins in one of her ill humours as she was walking by with her gown all trailing in the dust yes cried mary the little primrose girl her gown is always trailing she does not hold it up nicely like susan and with all her fine clothes she never looks half so neat mamma says she wishes i may be like susan when i grow up to be a great girl and so do i i should not like to look conceited as barbara does if i was ever so rich rich or poor said philip it does not become a girl to look conceited much less bold as barbara did the other day when she was at her fathers door without a hat upon her head staring at the strange gentleman who stopped hereabout to let his horse drink i know what he thought of bab by his looks and of susan too for susan was in her garden bending down a branch of the laburnum tree looking at its yellow flowers which were just come out and when the gentleman asked her how many miles it was from shrewsbury she answered him so modestnot bashful like as if she had never seen nobody beforebut just right and then she pulled on her straw hat which was fallen back with her looking up at the laburnum and she went her ways home and the gentleman says to me after she was gone pray who is that neat modest girl but i wish susan would come cried philip interrupting himself susan was all this time as her friend rose rightly guessed busy at home she was detained by her fathers returning later than usual his supper was ready for him nearly an hour before he came home and susan swept up the ashes twice and twice put on wood to make a cheerful blaze for him but at last when he did come in he took no notice of the blaze or of susan and when his wife asked him how he did he made no answer but stood with his back to the fire looking very gloomy susan put his supper upon the table and set his own chair for him but he pushed away the chair and turned from the table sayingi shall eat nothing child why have you such a fire to roast me at this time of the year you said yesterday father i thought that you liked a little cheerful wood fire in the evening and there was a great shower of hail your coat is quite wet we must dry it take it then child said he pulling it offi shall soon have no coat to dryand take my hat too said he throwing it upon the ground susan hung up his hat put his coat over the back of a chair to dry and then stood anxiously looking at her mother who was not well she had this day fatigued herself with baking and now alarmed by her husbands moody behaviour she sat down pale and trembling he threw himself into a chair folded his arms and fixed his eyes upon the fire susan was the first who ventured to break silence happy the father who has such a daughter as susanher unaltered sweetness of temper and her playful affectionate caresses at last somewhat dissipated her fathers melancholy he could not be prevailed upon to eat any of the supper which had been prepared for him however with a faint smile he told susan that he thought he could eat one of her guinea hens eggs she thanked him and with that nimble alacrity which marks the desire to please she ran to her neat chicken yard but alas her guinea hen was not thereit had strayed into the attorneys garden she saw it through the paling and timidly opening the little gate she asked miss barbara who was walking slowly by to let her come in and take her guinea hen barbara who was at this instant reflecting with no agreeable feelings upon the conversation of the village children to which she had recently listened started when she heard susans voice and with a proud ill humoured look and voice refused her request shut the gate said barbara you have no business in our garden and as for your hen i shall keep it it is always flying in here and plaguing us and my father says it is a trespasser and he told me i might catch it and keep it the next time it got in and it is in now then barbara called to her maid betty and bid her catch the mischievous hen oh my guinea hen my pretty guinea hen cried susan as they hunted the frightened screaming creature from corner to corner here we have got it said betty holding it fast by the legs now pay damages queen susan or good bye to your pretty guinea hen said barbara in an insulting tone damages what damages said susan tell me what i must pay a shilling said barbara oh if sixpence would do said susan i have but sixpence of my own in the world and here it is it wont do said barbara turning her back nay but hear me cried susan let me at least come in to look for its eggs i only want one for my fathers supper you shall have all the rest whats your father or his supper to us is he so nice that he can eat none but guinea hens eggs said barbara if you want your hen and your eggs pay for them and youll have them i have but sixpence and you say that wont do said susan with a sigh as she looked at her favourite which was in the maids grasping hands struggling and screaming in vain susan retired disconsolate at the door of her fathers cottage she saw her friend rose who was just come to summon her to the hawthorn bush they are all at the hawthorn and i am come for you we can do nothing without you dear susan cried rose running to meet her at the moment she saw her you are chosen queen of the maycome make haste but what is the matter why do you look so sad ah said susan dont wait for me i cant come to you but added she pointing to the tuft of double cowslips in the garden gather those for poor little mary i promised them to her and tell her the violets are under a hedge just opposite the turnstile on the right as we go to church good bye never mind me i cant comei cant stay for my father wants me but dont turn away your face i wont keep you a moment only tell me whats the matter said her friend following her into the cottage oh nothing not much said susan only that i wanted the egg in a great hurry for father it would not have vexed meto be sure i should have clipped my guinea hens wings and then she could not have flown over the hedge but let us think no more about it now added she twinkling away a tear when rose however learnt that her friends guinea hen was detained prisoner by the attorneys daughter she exclaimed with all the honest warmth of indignation and instantly ran back to tell the story to her companions barbara ay like father like daughter cried farmer price starting from the thoughtful attitude in which he had been fixed and drawing his chair closer to his wife you see something is amiss with me wifeill tell you what it is as he lowered his voice susan who was not sure that he wished she should hear what he was going to say retired from behind his chair susan dont go sit you down here my sweet susan said he making room for her upon his chair i believe i was a little cross when i came in first tonight but i had something to vex me as you shall hear about a fortnight ago you know wife continued he there was a balloting in our town for the militia now at that time i wanted but ten days of forty years of age and the attorney told me i was a fool for not calling myself plump forty but the truth is the truth and it is what i think fittest to be spoken at all times come what will of it so i was drawn for a militiaman but when i thought how loth you and i would be to part i was main glad to hear that i could get off by paying eight or nine guineas for a substituteonly i had not the nine guineasfor you know we had bad luck with our sheep this year and they died away one after anotherbut that was no excuse so i went to attorney case and with a power of difficulty i got him to lend me the money for which to be sure i gave him something and left my lease of our farm with him as he insisted upon it by way of security for the loan attorney case is too many for me he has found what he calls a flaw in my lease and the lease he tells me is not worth a farthing and that he can turn us all out of our farm to morrow if he pleases and sure enough he will please for i have thwarted him this day and he swears hell be revenged of me indeed he has begun with me badly enough already im not come to the worst part of my story yet here farmer price made a dead stop and his wife and susan looked up in his face breathless with anxiety it must come out said he with a short sigh i must leave you in three days wife must you said his wife in a faint resigned voice susan love open the window susan ran to open the window and then returned to support her mothers head when she came a little to herself she sat up begged that her husband would go on and that nothing might be concealed from her her husband had no wish indeed to conceal anything from a wife he loved so well but firm as he was and steady to his maxim that the truth was the thing the fittest to be spoken at all times his voice faltered and it was with great difficulty that he brought himself to speak the whole truth at this moment the fact was this case met farmer price as he was coming home whistling from a new ploughed field the attorney had just dined at the abbey the abbey was the family seat of an opulent baronet in the neighbourhood to whom mr case had been agent the baronet died suddenly and his estate and title devolved to a younger brother who was now just arrived in the country and to whom mr case was eager to pay his court in hopes of obtaining his favour of the agency he flattered himself that he was pretty secure and he thought that he might assume the tone of command towards the tenants especially towards one who was some guineas in debt and in whose lease there was a flaw accosting the farmer in a haughty manner the attorney began with so farmer price a word with you if you please walk on here man beside my horse and youll hear me you have changed your opinion i hope about that bit of landthat corner at the end of my garden as how mr case said the farmer as how man why you said something about its not belonging to me when you heard me talk of inclosing it the other day so i did said price and so i do provoked and astonished at the firm tone in which these words were pronounced the attorney was upon the point of swearing that he would have his revenge but as his passions were habitually attentive to the letter of the law he refrained from any hasty expression which might he was aware in a court of justice be hereafter brought against him my good friend mr price said he in a soft voice and pale with suppressed rage he forced a smile im under the necessity of calling in the money i lent you some time ago and you will please to take notice that it must be paid to morrow morning i wish you a good evening you have the money ready for me i daresay no said the farmer not a guinea of it but john simpson who was my substitute has not left our village yet ill get the money back from him and go myself if so be it must be so into the militiaso i will the attorney did not expect such a determination and he represented in a friendly hypocritical tone to price that he had no wish to drive him to such an extremity that it would be the height of folly in him to run his head against a wall for no purpose you dont mean to take the corner into your own garden do you price said he i said the farmer god forbid its none of mine i never take what does not belong to me true right very proper of course said mr case but then you have no interest in life in the land in question none then why so stiff about it price all i want of you to say to say that black is white which i wont do mr case the ground is a thing not worth talking of but its neither yours nor mine in my memory since the new lane was made it has always been open to the parish and no man shall inclose it with my good will truth is truth and must be spoken justice is justice and should be done mr attorney and law is law mr farmer and shall have its course to your cost cried the attorney exasperated by the dauntless spirit of this village hampden here they parted the glow of enthusiasm the pride of virtue which made our hero brave could not render him insensible as he drew nearer home many melancholy thoughts pressed upon his heart he passed the door of his own cottage with resolute steps however and went through the village in search of the man who had engaged to be his substitute he found him told him how the matter stood and luckily the man who had not yet spent the money was willing to return it as there were many others drawn for the militia who he observed would be glad to give him the same price or more for his services the moment price got the money he hastened to mr cases house walked straight forward into his room and laying the money down upon his desk there mr attorney are your nine guineas count them now i have done with you not yet said the attorney jingling the money triumphantly in his hand well give you a taste of the law my good sir or im mistaken you forgot the flaw in your lease which i have safe in this desk ah my lease said the farmer who had almost forgot to ask for it till he was thus put in mind of it by the attorneys imprudent threat give me my lease mr case ive paid my money you have no right to keep the lease any longer whether it is a bad one or a good one pardon me said the attorney locking his desk and putting the key into his pocket possession my honest friend cried he striking his hand upon the desk is nine points of the law good night to you i cannot in conscience return a lease to a tenant in which i know there is a capital flaw it is my duty to show it to my employer or in other words to your new landlord whose agent i have good reasons to expect i shall be you will live to repent your obstinacy mr price your servant sir price retired with melancholy feelings but not intimidated many a man returns home with a gloomy countenance who has not quite so much cause for vexation when susan heard her fathers story she quite forgot her guinea hen and her whole soul was intent upon her poor mother who notwithstanding her utmost exertion could not support herself under this sudden stroke of misfortune in the middle of the night susan was called up her mothers fever ran high for some hours but towards morning it abated and she fell into a soft sleep with susans hand locked fast in hers susan sat motionless and breathed softly lest she should disturb her the rushlight which stood beside the bed was now burnt low the long shadow of the tall wicker chair flitted faded appeared and vanished as the flame rose and sunk in the socket susan was afraid that the disagreeable smell might waken her mother and gently disengaging her hand she went on tiptoe to extinguish the candle all was silent the grey light of the morning was now spreading over every object the sun rose slowly and susan stood at the lattice window looking through the small leaded cross barred panes at the splendid spectacle a few birds began to chirp but as susan was listening to them her mother started in her sleep and spoke unintelligibly susan hung up a white apron before the window to keep out the light and just then she heard the sound of music at a distance in the village as it approached nearer she knew that it was philip playing upon his pipe and tabor she distinguished the merry voices of her companions carolling in honour of the may and soon she saw them coming towards her fathers cottage with branches and garlands in their hands she opened quick but gently the latch of the door and ran out to meet them here she isheres susan they exclaimed joyfully heres the queen of the may and heres her crown cried rose pressing forward but susan put her finger upon her lips and pointed to her mothers window philips pipe stopped instantly thank you said susan my mother is ill i cant leave her you know then gently putting aside the crown her companions bid her say who should wear it for her will you dear rose said she placing the garland upon her friends head its a charming may morning added she with a smile good bye we shant hear your voices or the pipe when you have turned the corner into the village so you need only stop till then philip i shall stop for all day said philip ive no mind to play any more good bye poor susan it is a pity you cant come with us said all the children and little mary ran after susan to the cottage door i forgot to thank you said she for the double cowslips look how pretty they are and smell how sweet the violets are in my bosom and kiss me quick for i shall be left behind susan kissed the little breathless girl and returned softly to the side of her mothers bed how grateful that child is to me for a cowslip only how can i be grateful enough to such a mother as this said susan to herself as she bent over her sleeping mothers pale countenance her mothers unfinished knitting lay upon a table near the bed and susan sat down in her wicker arm chair and went on with the row in the middle of which her hand stopped the preceding evening she taught me to knit she taught me everything that i know thought susan and the best of all she taught me to love her to wish to be like her her mother when she awakened felt much refreshed by her tranquil sleep and observing that it was a delightful morning said that she had been dreaming she heard music but that the drum frightened her because she thought it was the signal for her husband to be carried away by a whole regiment of soldiers who had pointed their bayonets at him but that was but a dream susan i awoke and knew it was a dream and i then fell asleep and have slept soundly ever since how painful it is to awake to the remembrance of misfortune gradually as this poor woman collected her scattered thoughts she recalled the circumstances of the preceding evening she was too certain that she had heard from her husbands own lips the words i must leave you in three days and she wished that she could sleep again and think it all a dream but hell want hell want a hundred things said she starting up i must get his linen ready for him im afraid its very late susan why did you let me lie so long everything shall be ready dear mother only dont hurry yourself said susan and indeed her mother was ill able to bear any hurry or to do any work this day susans affectionate dexterous sensible activity was never more wanted or more effectual she understood so readily she obeyed so exactly and when she was left to her own discretion judged so prudently that her mother had little trouble and no anxiety in directing her she said that susan never did too little or too much susan was mending her fathers linen when rose tapped softly at the window and beckoned to her to come out she went out how does your mother do in the first place said rose better thank you thats well and i have a little bit of good news for you besideshere said she pulling out a glove in which there was money well get the guinea hen back againwe have all agreed about it this is the money that has been given to us in the village this may morning at every door they gave silver see how generous they have beentwelve shillings i assure you now we are a match for miss barbara you wont like to leave home ill go to barbara and you shall see your guinea hen in ten minutes rose hurried away pleased with her commission and to accomplish her business miss barbaras maid betty was the first person that was visible at the attorneys house rose insisted upon seeing miss barbara herself and she was shown into a parlour to the young lady who was reading a dirty novel which she put under a heap of law papers as they entered dear how you startled me is it only you said she to her maid but as soon as she saw rose behind the maid she put on a scornful air could not ye say i was not at home betty well my good girl what brings you here something to borrow or beg i suppose may every ambassadorevery ambassador in as good a causeanswer with as much dignity and moderation as rose replied to barbara upon the present occasion she assured her that the person from whom she came did not send her either to beg or borrow that she was able to pay the full value of that for which she came to ask and producing her well filled purse i believe that this is a very good shilling said she if you dont like it i will change it and now you will be so good as to give me susans guinea hen it is in her name i ask for it no matter in whose name you ask for it replied barbara you will not have it take up your shilling if you please i would have taken a shilling yesterday if it had been paid at the time properly but i told susan that if it was not paid then i should keep the hen and so i shall i promise her you may go back and tell her so the attorneys daughter had whilst rose opened her negotiation measured the depth of her purse with a keen eye and her penetration discovered that it contained at least ten shillings with proper management she had some hopes that the guinea hen might be made to bring in at least half the money rose who was of a warm temper not quite so fit a match as she had thought herself for the wily barbara incautiously exclaimed whatever it costs us we are determined to have susans favourite hen so if one shilling wont do take two and if two wont do why take three the shillings sounded provoking upon the table as she threw them down one after another and barbara coolly replied three wont do have you no conscience miss barbara then take four barbara shook her head a fifth shilling was instantly proffered but bab who now saw plainly that she had the game in her own hands preserved a cold cruel silence rose went on rapidly bidding shilling after shilling till she had completely emptied her purse the twelve shillings were spread upon the table barbaras avarice was moved she consented for this ransom to liberate her prisoner rose pushed the money towards her but just then recollecting that she was acting for others more than for herself and doubting whether she had full powers to conclude such an extravagant bargain she gathered up the public treasure and with newly recovered prudence observed that she must go back to consult her friends her generous little friends were amazed at barbaras meanness but with one accord declared that they were most willing for their parts to give up every farthing of the money they all went to susan in a body and told her so theres our purse said they do what you please with it they would not wait for one word of thanks but ran away leaving only rose with her to settle the treaty for the guinea hen there is a certain manner of accepting a favour which shows true generosity of mind many know how to give but few know how to accept a gift properly susan was touched but not astonished by the kindness of her young friends and she received the purse with as much simplicity as she would have given it well said rose shall i go back for the guinea hen the guinea hen said susan starting from a reverie into which she had fallen as she contemplated the purse certainly i do long to see my pretty guinea hen once more but i was not thinking of her just theni was thinking of my father now susan had heard her mother often in the course of this day wish that she had but money enough in the world to pay john simpson for going to serve in the militia instead of her husband this to be sure will go but a little way thought susan but still it may be of some use to my father she told her mind to rose and concluded by saying decidedly that if the money was given to her to dispose of as she pleased she would give it to her father it is all yours my dear good susan cried rose with a look of warm approbation this is so like youbut im sorry that miss bab must keep your guinea hen i would not be her for all the guinea hens or guineas either in the whole world why ill answer for it the guinea hen wont make her happy and youll be happy even without because you are good let me come and help you to morrow continued she looking at susans work if you have any more mending work to doi never liked work till i worked with you i wont forget my thimble or my scissors added she laughingthough i used to forget them when i was a giddy girl i assure you i am a great hand at my needle nowtry me susan assured her friend that she did not doubt the powers of her needle and that she would most willingly accept of her services but that unluckily she had finished all the needle work immediately wanted but do you know said she i shall have a great deal of business to morrow but i wont tell you what it is that i have to do for i am afraid i shall not succeed but if i do succeed ill come and tell you directly because you will be so glad of it susan who had always been attentive to what her mother taught her and who had often assisted her when she was baking bread and cakes for the family at the abbey had now formed the courageous but not presumptuous idea that she could herself undertake to bake a batch of bread one of the servants from the abbey had been sent all round the village in the morning in search of bread and had not been able to procure any that was tolerable mrs prices last baking failed for want of good barm she was not now strong enough to attempt another herself and when the brewers boy came with eagerness to tell her that he had some fine fresh yeast she thanked him but sighed and said it would be of no use to her accordingly she went to work with much prudent care and when her bread the next morning came out of the oven it was excellent at least her mother said so and she was a good judge it was sent to the abbey and as the family there had not tasted any good bread since their arrival in the country they also were earnest and warm in its praise inquiries were made from the housekeeper and they heard with some surprise that this excellent bread was made by a young girl only twelve years old the housekeeper who had known susan from a child was pleased to have an opportunity in speaking in her favour she is the most industrious little creature maam in the world said she to her mistress little i cant so well call her now since shes grown tall and slender to look at and glad i am she is grown up likely to look at for handsome is that handsome does she thinks no more of her being handsome than i do myself yet she has as proper a respect for herself maam as you have and i always see her neat and with her mother maam or fit people as a girl should be as for her mother she dotes upon her as well she may for i should myself if i had half such a daughter and then she has two little brothers and shes as good to them and my boy philip says taught em to read more than the school mistress all with tenderness and good nature but i beg your pardon maam i cannot stop myself when i once begin to talk of susan you have really said enough to excite my curiosity said her mistress pray send for her immediately we can see her before we go out to walk the benevolent housekeeper despatched her boy philip for susan who never happened to be in such an untidy state as to be unable to obey a summons without a long preparation she had it is true been very busy but orderly people can be busy and neat at the same time she put on her usual straw hat and accompanied roses mother who was going with a basket of cleared muslin to the abbey the modest simplicity of susans appearance and the artless propriety of the answers she gave to all the questions that were asked her pleased the ladies at the abbey who were good judges of character and manners sir arthur somers had two sisters sensible benevolent women they were not of that race of fine ladies who are miserable the moment they come to the country nor yet were they of that bustling sort who quack and direct all their poor neighbours for the mere love of managing or the want of something to do they were judiciously generous and whilst they wished to diffuse happiness they were not peremptory in requiring that people should be happy precisely their own way with these dispositions and with a well informed brother who though he never wished to direct was always willing to assist in their efforts to do good there were reasonable hopes that these ladies would be a blessing to the poor villagers amongst whom they were now settled as soon as miss somers had spoken to susan she inquired for her brother but sir arthur was in his study and a gentleman was with him on business susan was desirous of returning to her mother and the ladies therefore would not detain her miss somers told her with a smile when she took leave that she would call upon her in the evening at six oclock it was impossible that such a grand event as susans visit to the abbey could long remain unknown to barbara case and her gossiping maid they watched eagerly for the moment of her return that they might satisfy their curiosity there she is i declare just come into her garden cried bab ill run in and get it all out of her in a minute bab could descend without shame whenever it suited her purposes from the height of insolent pride to the lowest meanness of fawning familiarity susan was gathering some marigolds and some parsley for her mothers broth so susan said bab who came close up to her before she perceived it how goes the world with you to day my mother is rather better to day she says maamthank you replies susan coldly but civilly maam dear how polite we are grown of a sudden cried bab winking at her maid one may see youve been in good company this morninghey susan come lets hear about it did you see the ladies themselves or was it only the housekeeper sent for you said the maid what room did you go into continued bab did you see miss somers or sir arthur miss somers la she saw miss somers betty i must hear about it cant you stop gathering those things for a minute and chat a bit with us susan i cant stay indeed miss barbara for my mothers broth is just wanted and im in a hurry susan ran home lord her head is full of broth now said bab to her maid and she has not a word for herself though she has been abroad my papa may well call her simple susan for simple she is and simple she will be all the world over for my part i think shes little better than a downright simpleton but however simple or not ill get what i want out of her shell be able to speak maybe when she has settled the grand matter of the broth ill step in and ask to see her mother that will put her in a good humour in a trice barbara followed susan into the cottage and found her occupied with the grand affair of the broth is it ready said bab peeping into the pot that was over the fire dear how savoury it smells ill wait till you go in with it to your mother for i must ask her how she does myself will you please to sit down then miss said simple susan with a smile for at this instant she forgot the guinea hen i have but just put the parsley into the broth but it soon will be ready during this interval bab employed herself much to her own satisfaction in cross questioning susan she was rather provoked indeed that she could not learn exactly how each of the ladies was dressed and what there was to be for dinner at the abbey and she was curious beyond measure to find out what miss somers meant by saying that she would call at mr prices cottage at six oclock in the evening what do you think she could mean i thought she meant what she said replied susan that she would come here at six oclock ay thats as plain as a pike staff said barbara but what else did she mean think you people you know dont always mean exactly downright neither more nor less than what they say not always said susan with an arch smile which convinced barbara that she was not quite a simpleton not always repeated barbara colouringoh then i suppose you have some guess at what miss somers meant no said susan i was not thinking about miss somers when i said not always how nice that broth does look resumed barbara after a pause susan had now poured the broth into a basin and as she strewed over it the bright orange marigolds it looked very tempting she tasted it and added now a little salt and now a little more till she thought it was just to her mothers taste oh i must taste it said bab taking the basin up greedily wont you take a spoon said susan trembling at the large mouthfuls which barbara sucked up with a terrible noise take a spoonful indeed exclaimed barbara setting down the basin in high anger the next time i taste your broth you shall affront me if you dare the next time i set my foot in this house you shall be as saucy to me as you please and she flounced out of the house repeating take a spoon pig was what you meant to say susan stood in amazement at the beginning of this speech but the concluding words explained to her the mystery some years before this time when susan was a very little girl and could scarcely speak plain as she was eating a basin of bread and milk for her supper at the cottage door a great pig came up and put his nose into the basin susan was willing that the pig should have some share of the bread and milk but as she ate with a spoon and he with his large mouth she presently discovered that he was likely to have more than his share and in a simple tone of expostulation she said to him take a poon pig the saying become proverbial in the village susans little companions repeated it and applied it upon many occasions whenever anyone claimed more than his share of anything good barbara who was then not miss barbara but plain bab and who had played with all the poor children in the neighbourhood was often reproved in her unjust methods of division by susans proverb susan as she grew up forgot the childish saying but the remembrance of it rankled in barbaras mind and it was to this that she suspected susan had alluded when she recommended a spoon to her whilst she was swallowing the basin of broth la miss said barbaras maid when she found her mistress in a passion upon her return from susans i only wondered you did her the honour to set your foot within her doors what need have you to trouble her for news about the abbey folks when your own papa has been there all the morning and is just come in and can tell you everything barbara did not know that her father meant to go to the abbey that morning for attorney case was mysterious even to his own family about his morning rides he never chose to be asked where he was going or where he had been and this made his servants more than commonly inquisitive to trace him barbara against whose apparent childishness and real cunning he was not sufficiently on his guard had often the art of drawing him into conversation about his visits she ran into her fathers parlour but she knew the moment she saw his face that it was no time to ask questions his pen was across his mouth and his brown wig pushed oblique upon his contracted forehead the wig was always pushed crooked whenever he was in a brown or rather a black study barbara who did not like susan bear with her fathers testy humour from affection and gentleness of disposition but who always humoured him from artifice tried all her skill to fathom his thoughts and when she found that it would not do she went to tell her maid so and to complain that her father was so cross there was no bearing him it is true that attorney case was not in the happiest mood possible for he was by no means satisfied with his mornings work at the abbey sir arthur somers the new man did not suit him and he began to be rather apprehensive that he should not suit sir arthur he had sound reasons for his doubts sir arthur somers was an excellent lawyer and a perfectly honest man this seemed to our attorney a contradiction in terms in the course of his practice the case had not occurred and he had no precedents ready to direct his proceedings sir arthur was also a man of wit and eloquence yet of plain dealing and humanity the attorney could not persuade himself to believe that his benevolence was anything but enlightened cunning and his plain dealing he one minute dreaded as the masterpiece of art and the next despised as the characteristic of folly in short he had not yet decided whether he was an honest man or a knave he had settled accounts with him for his late agency and had talked about sundry matters of business he constantly perceived however that he could not impose upon sir arthur but the idea that he could know all the mazes of the law and yet prefer the straight road was incomprehensible mr case having paid sir arthur some compliments on his great legal abilities and his high reputation at the bar he coolly replied i have left the bar the attorney looked in unfeigned astonishment that a man who was actually making pounds per annum at the bar should leave it i am come said sir arthur to enjoy that kind of domestic life in the country which i prefer to all others and amongst people whose happiness i hope to increase at this speech the attorney changed his ground flattering himself that he should find his man averse to business and ignorant of country affairs he talked of the value of land and of new leases sir arthur wished to enlarge his domain and to make a ride round it a map of it was lying upon the table and farmer prices garden came exactly across the new road for the ride sir arthur looked disappointed and the keen attorney seized the moment to inform him that prices whole land was at his disposal at my disposal how so cried sir arthur eagerly it will not be out of lease i believe these ten years ill look into the rent roll again perhaps i am mistaken you are mistaken my good sir and you are not mistaken said mr case with a shrewd smile in one sense the land will not be out of lease these ten years and in another it is out of lease at this present time to come to the point at once the lease is ab origine null and void i have detected a capital flaw in the body of it i pledge my credit upon it sir it cant stand a single term in law or equity the attorney observed that at these words sir arthurs eye was fixed with a look of earnest attention now i have him said the cunning tempter to himself neither in law nor equity repeated sir arthur with apparent incredulity are you sure of that mr case sure as i told you before sir id pledge my whole credit upon the thingid stake my existence thats something said sir arthur as if he was pondering upon the matter the attorney went on with all the eagerness of a keen man who sees a chance at one stroke of winning a rich friend and of ruining a poor enemy he explained with legal volubility and technical amplification the nature of the mistake in mr prices lease it was sir said he a lease for the life of peter price susanna his wife and to the survivor or survivors of them or for the full time and term of twenty years to be computed from the first day of may then next ensuing now sir this you see is a lease in reversion which the late sir benjamin somers had not by his settlement a right to make this is a curious mistake you see sir arthur and in filling up those printed leases theres always a good chance of some flaw i find it perpetually but i never found a better than this in the whole course of my practice sir arthur stood in silence my dear sir said the attorney taking him by the button you have no scruple of stirring in this business a little said sir arthur why then that can be done away in a moment your name shall not appear in it at all you have nothing to do but to make over the lease to me i make all safe to you with my bond now being in possession i come forward in my own proper person shall i proceed noyou have said enough replied sir arthur the case indeed lies in a nutshell said the attorney who had by this time worked himself up to such a pitch of professional enthusiasm that intent upon his vision of a lawsuit he totally forgot to observe the impression his words made upon sir arthur theres only one thing we have forgotten all this time said sir arthur what can that be sir that we shall ruin this poor man case was thunderstruck at these words or rather by the look which accompanied them he recollected that he had laid himself open before he was sure of sir arthurs real character he softened and said he should have had certainly more consideration in the case of any but a litigious pig headed fellow as he knew price to be if he be litigious said sir arthur i shall certainly be glad to get him fairly out of the parish as soon as possible when you go home you will be so good sir as to send me his lease that i may satisfy myself before we stir in this business the attorney brightening up prepared to take leave but he could not persuade himself to take his departure without making one push at sir arthur about the agency i will not trouble you sir arthur with this lease of prices said case ill leave it with your agent whom shall i apply to to myself sir if you please replied sir arthur the courtiers of louis the fourteenth could not have looked more astounded than our attorney when they received from their monarch a similar answer it was this unexpected reply of sir arthurs which had deranged the temper of mr case and caused his wig to stand so crooked upon his forehead and which had rendered him impenetrably silent to his inquisitive daughter barbara after having walked up and down his room conversing with himself for some time the attorney concluded that the agency must be given to somebody when sir arthur should have to attend his duty in parliament that the agency even for the winter season was not a thing to be neglected and that if he managed well he might yet secure it for himself he had often found that small timely presents worked wonderfully upon his own mind and he judged of others by himself the tenants had been in the reluctant but constant practice of making him continual petty offerings and he resolved to try the same course with sir arthur whose resolution to be his own agent he thought argued a close saving avaricious disposition he had heard the housekeeper at the abbey inquiring as he passed through the servants whether there was any lamb to be gotten she said that sir arthur was remarkably fond of lamb and that she wished she could get a quarter for him immediately he sallied into his kitchen as soon as the idea struck him and asked a shepherd who was waiting there whether he knew of a nice fat lamb to be had anywhere in the neighbourhood i know of one cried barbara susan price has a pet lamb thats as fat as fat could be the attorney easily caught at these words and speedily devised a scheme for obtaining susans lamb for nothing it would be something strange if an attorney of his talents and standing was not an over match for simple susan he prowled forth in search of his prey he found susan packing up her fathers little wardrobe and when she looked up as she knelt he saw that she had been in tears how is your mother to day susan inquired the attorney worse sir my father goes to morrow thats a pity it cant be helped said susan with a sigh it cant be helpedhow do you know that said case sir dear sir cried she looking up at him and a sudden ray of hope beamed in her ingenuous countenance and if you could help it susan said he susan clasped her hands in silence more expressive than words you can help it susan she started up in an ecstasy what would you give now to have your father at home for a whole week longer anythingbut i have nothing yes but you have a lamb said the hard hearted attorney my poor little lamb said susan but what can that do what good can any lamb do is not lamb good to eat why do you look so pale girl are not sheep killed every day and dont you eat mutton is your lamb better than anybody elses think you i dont know said susan but i love it better more fool you said he it feeds out of hand it follows me about i have always taken care of it my mother gave it to me well say no more about it then he cynically observed if you love your lamb better than both your father and your mother keep it and good morning to you stay oh stay cried susan catching the skirt of his coat with an eager trembling handa whole week did you say my mother may get better in that time no i do not love my lamb half so well the struggle of her mind ceased and with a placid countenance and calm voice take the lamb said she where is it said the attorney grazing in the meadow by the river side it must be brought up before night fall for the butcher remember i shall not forget it said susan steadily as soon however as her persecutor turned his back and quitted the house susan sat down and hid her face in her hands she was soon aroused by the sound of her mothers feeble voice who was calling susan from the inner room where she lay susan went in but did not undraw the curtain as she stood beside the bed are you there love undraw the curtain that i may see you and tell mei thought i heard some strange voice just now talking to my child somethings amiss susan said her mother raising herself as well as she was able in the bed to examine her daughters countenance would you think it amiss then my dear mother said susan stooping to kiss herwould you think it amiss if my father was to stay with us a week longer susan you dont say so he is indeed a whole weekbut how burning hot your hand is still are you sure he will stay inquired her mother how do you know who told you so tell me all quick attorney case told me so he can get him a weeks longer leave of absence and he has promised he will god bless him for it for ever and ever said the poor woman joining her hands may the blessing of heaven be with him susan closed the curtains and was silent she could not say amen she was called out of the room at this moment for a messenger was come from the abbey for the bread bills it was she who always made out the bills for though she had not a great number of lessons from the writing master she had taken so much pains to learn that she could write a very neat legible hand and she found this very useful she was not to be sure particularly inclined to draw out a long bill at this instant but business must be done she set to work ruled her lines for the pounds shillings and pence made out the bill for the abbey and despatched the impatient messenger she then resolved to make out all the bills for the neighbours who had many of them taken a few loaves and rolls of her baking i had better get all my business finished said she to herself before i go down to the meadow to take leave of my poor lamb this was sooner said than done for she found that she had a great number of bills to write and the slate on which she had entered the account was not immediately to be found and when it was found the figures were almost rubbed out barbara had sat down upon it susan pored over the number of loaves and the names of the persons who took them and she wrote and cast up sums and corrected and re corrected them till her head grew quite puzzled the table was covered with little square bits of paper on which she had been writing bills over and over again when her father came in with a bill in his hand hows this susan said he how can ye be so careless child what is your head running upon here look at the bill you were sending up to the abbey i met the messenger and luckily asked to see how much it was look at it susan looked and blushed it was written sir arthur somers to john price debtor six dozen lambs so much she altered it and returned it to her father but he had taken up some of the papers which lay upon the table what are all these child some of them are wrong and ive written them out again said susan some of them all of them i think seem to be wrong if i can read said her father rather angrily and he pointed out to her sundry strange mistakes her head indeed had been running upon her poor lamb she corrected all the mistakes with so much patience and bore to be blamed with so much good humour that her father at last said that it was impossible ever to scold susan without being in the wrong at the last as soon as all was set right price took the bills and said he would go round to the neighbours and collect the money himself for that he should be very proud to have it to say to them that it was all earned by his own little daughter susan resolved to keep the pleasure of telling him of his weeks reprieve till he should come home to sup as he had promised to do in her mothers room she was not sorry to hear him sigh as he passed the knapsack which she had been packing up for his journey how delighted he will be when he hears the good news said she to herself but i know he will be a little sorry too for my poor lamb as susan had now settled all her business she thought she could have time to go down to the meadow by the river side to see her favourite but just as she had tied on her straw hat the village clock struck four and this was the hour at which she always went to fetch her little brothers home from a dame school near the village she knew that they would be disappointed if she was later than usual and she did not like to keep them waiting because they were very patient good boys so she put off the visit to her lamb and went immediately for her brothers chapter ii evn in the spring and playtime of the year that calls th unwonted villager abroad with all her little ones a sportive train to gather king cups in the yellow mead and prink their heads with daisies cowper the dame school which was about a mile from the hamlet was not a showy edifice but it was reverenced as much by the young race of village scholars as if it had been the most stately mansion in the land it was a low roofed long thatched tenement sheltered by a few reverend oaks under which many generations of hopeful children had gambolled in their turn the close shaven green which sloped down from the hatch door of the schoolroom was paled round with a rude paling which though decayed in some parts by time was not in any place broken by violence the place bespoke order and peace the dame who governed was well obeyed because she was just and well beloved and because she was ever glad to give well earned praise and pleasure to her little subjects susan had once been under her gentle dominion and had been deservedly her favourite scholar the dame often cited her as the best example to the succeeding tribe of emulous youngsters she had scarcely opened the wicket which separated the green before the schoolroom door from the lane when she heard the merry voices of the children and saw the little troup issuing from the hatchway and spreading over the green oh theres susan cried her two little brothers running leaping and bounding up to her and many of the other rosy girls and boys crowded round her to talk of their plays for susan was easily interested in all that made others happy but she could not make them comprehend that if they all spoke at once it was not possible that she could hear what was said the voices were still raised one above another all eager to establish some important observation about ninepins or marbles or tops or bows and arrows when suddenly music was heard and the crowd was silenced the music seemed to be near the spot where the children were standing and they looked round to see whence it could come susan pointed to the great oak tree and they beheld seated under its shade an old man playing upon his harp the children all approachedat first timidly for the sounds were solemn but as the harper heard their little footsteps coming towards him he changed his hand and played one of his most lively tunes the circle closed and pressed nearer and nearer to him some who were in the foremost row whispered to each other he is blind what a pity and he looks very poorwhat a ragged coat he wears said others he must be very old for all his hair is white and he must have travelled a great way for his shoes are quite worn out observed another all these remarks were made whilst he was tuning his harp for when he once more began to play not a word was uttered he seemed pleased by their simple exclamations of wonder and delight and eager to amuse his young audience he played now a gay and now a pathetic air to suit their several humours susans voice which was soft and sweet expressive of gentleness and good nature caught his ear the moment she spoke he turned his face eagerly to the place where she stood and it was observed that whenever she said that she liked any tune particularly he played it over again i am blind said the old man and cannot see your faces but i know you all asunder by your voices and i can guess pretty well at all your humours and characters by your voices can you so indeed cried susans little brother william who had stationed himself between the old mans knees then you heard my sister susan speak just now can you tell us what sort of person she is that i can i think without being a conjurer said the old man lifting the boy up on his knee your sister susan is good natured the boy clapped his hands and good tempered right said little william with a louder clap of applause and very fond of the little boy who sits upon my knee o right right quite right exclaimed the child and quite right echoed on all sides but how came you to know so much when you are blind said william examining the old man attentively hush said john who was a year older than his brother and very sage you should not put him in mind of his being blind though i am blind said the harper i can hear you know and i heard from your sister herself all that i told you of her that she was good tempered and good natured and fond of you oh thats wrongyou did not hear all that from herself im sure said john for nobody ever hears her praising herself did not i hear her tell you said the harper when you first came round me that she was in a great hurry to go home but that she would stay a little while since you wished it so much was not that good natured and when you said you did not like the tune she liked best she was not angry with you but said then play williams first if you pleasewas not that good tempered oh interrupted william its all true but how did you find out that she was fond of me that is such a difficult question said the harper that i must take time to consider the harper tuned his instrument as he pondered or seemed to ponder and at this instant two boys who had been searching for birds nests in the hedges and who had heard the sound of the harp came blustering up and pushing their way through the circle one of them exclaimed whats going on here who are you my old fellow a blind harper well play us a tune if you can play ever a good oneplay melets see what shall he play bob added he turning to his companion bumper squire jones the old man though he did not seem quite pleased with the peremptory manner of the request played as he was desired bumper squire jones and several other tunes were afterwards bespoke by the same rough and tyrannical voice the little children shrunk back in timid silence and eyed the brutal boy with dislike this boy was the son of attorney case and as his father had neglected to correct his temper when he was a child as he grew up it became insufferable all who were younger and weaker than himself dreaded his approach and detested him as a tyrant when the old harper was so tired that he could play no more a lad who usually carried his harp for him and who was within call came up and held his masters hat to the company saying will you be pleased to remember us the children readily produced their halfpence and thought their wealth well bestowed upon this poor good natured man who had taken so much pains to entertain them better even than upon the gingerbread woman whose stall they loved to frequent the hat was held some time to the attorneys son before he chose to see it at last he put his hand surlily into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out a shilling there were sixpennyworth of halfpence in the hat ill take these halfpence said he and heres a shilling for you god bless you sir said the lad but as he took the shilling which the young gentleman had slily put into the blind mans hand he saw that it was not worth one farthing i am afraid it is not good sir said the lad whose business it was to examine the money for his master i am afraid then youll get no other said young case with an insulting laugh it never will do sir persisted the lad look at it yourself the edges are all yellow you can see the copper through it quite plain sir nobody will take it from us thats your affair said the brutal boy pushing away his hand you may pass it you know as well as i do if you look sharp you have taken it from me and i shant take it back again i promise you a whisper of thats very unjust was heard the little assembly though under evident constraint could no longer suppress their indignation who says its unjust cried the tyrant sternly looking down upon his judges susans little brothers had held her gown fast to prevent her from moving at the beginning of this contest and she was now so much interested to see the end of it that she stood still without making any resistance is anyone here amongst yourselves a judge of silver said the old man yes heres the butchers boy said the attorneys son show it to him he was a sickly looking boy and of a remarkably peaceful disposition young case fancied that he would be afraid to give judgment against him however after some moments hesitation and after turning the shilling round several times he pronounced that as far as his judgment went but he did not pretend to be a downright certain sure of it the shilling was not over and above good then to susan to screen himself from manifest danger for the attorneys son looked upon him with a vengeful mien but heres susan here who understands silver a great deal better than i do she takes a power of it for bread you know ill leave it to her said the old harper if she says the shilling is good keep it jack the shilling was handed to susan who though she had with becoming modesty forborne all interference did not hesitate when she was called upon to speak the truth i think that this shilling is a bad one said she and the gentle but firm tone in which she pronounced the words for a moment awed and silenced the angry and brutal boy theres another then cried he i have sixpences and shillings too in plenty thank my stars susan now walked away with her two little brothers and all the other children separated to go to their several homes the old harper called to susan and begged that if she was going towards the village she would be so kind as to show him the way his lad took up his harp and little william took the old man by the hand ill lead him i can lead him said he and john ran on before them to gather king cups in the meadow there was a small rivulet which they had to cross and as a plank which served for a bridge over it was rather narrow susan was afraid to trust the old blind man to his little conductor she therefore went on the tottering plank first herself and then led the old harper carefully over they were now come to a gate which opened upon the high road to the village there is the high road straight before you said susan to the lad who was carrying his masters harp you cant miss it now i must bid you a good evening for im in a great hurry to get home and must go the short way across the fields here which would not be so pleasant for you because of the stiles good bye the old harper thanked her and went along the high road whilst she and her brothers tripped on as fast as they could by the short way across the fields miss somers i am afraid will be waiting for us said susan you know she said she would call at six and by the length of our shadows im sure it is late when they came to their own cottage door they heard many voices and they saw when they entered several ladies standing in the kitchen come in susan we thought you had quite forsaken us said miss somers to susan who advanced timidly i fancy you forgot that we promised to pay you a visit this evening but you need not blush so much about the matter there is no great harm done we have only been here about five minutes and we have been well employed in admiring your neat garden and your orderly shelves is it you susan who keeps these things in such nice order continued miss somers looking round the kitchen before susan could reply little william pushed forward and answered yes maam it is my sister susan that keeps everything neat and she always comes to school for us too which was what caused her to be so late because as how continued john she was loth to refuse us the hearing a blind man play on the harp it was we kept her and we hopes maam as you areas you seem so good you wont take it amiss miss somers and her sister smiled at the affectionate simplicity with which susans little brothers undertook her defence and they were from this slight circumstance disposed to think yet more favourably of a family which seemed so well united they took susan along with them through the village many neighbours came to their doors and far from envying they all secretly wished susan well as she passed i fancy we shall find what we want here said miss somers stopping before a shop where unfolded sheets of pins and glass buttons glistened in the window and where rolls of many coloured ribbons appeared ranged in tempting order she went in and was rejoiced to see the shelves at the back of the counter well furnished with glossy tiers of stuffs and gay neat printed linens and calicoes now susan choose yourself a gown said miss somers you set an example of industry and good conduct of which we wish to take public notice for the benefit of others the shopkeeper who was father to susans friend rose looked much satisfied by this speech and as if a compliment had been paid to himself bowed low to miss somers and then with alertness which a london linen draper might have admired produced piece after piece of his best goods to his young customerunrolled unfolded held the bright stuffs and calendered calicoes in various lights now stretched his arm to the highest shelves and brought down in a trice what seemed to be beyond the reach of any but a giants arm now dived into some hidden recess beneath the counter and brought to light fresh beauties and fresh temptations susan looked on with more indifference than most of the spectators she was thinking much of her lamb and more of her father miss somers had put a bright guinea into her hand and had bid her pay for her own gown but susan as she looked at the guinea thought it was a great deal of money to lay out upon herself and she wished but did know like to ask that she might keep it for a better purpose some people are wholly inattentive to the lesser feelings and incapable of reading the countenances of those on whom they bestow their bounty miss somers and her sister were not of this roughly charitable class she does not like any of these things whispered miss somers to her sister her sister observed that susan looked as if her thoughts were far distant from gowns if you dont fancy any of these said the civil shopkeeper to susan we shall have a new assortment of calicoes for the spring season soon from town oh interrupted susan with a smile and a blush these are all pretty and too good for me but but what susan said miss somers tell us what is passing in your little mind susan hesitated well then we will not press you you are scarcely acquainted with us yet when you are you will not be afraid i hope to speak your mind put this shining yellow counter continued she pointing to the guinea in your pocket and make what use of it you please from what we know and from what we have heard of you we are persuaded that you will make a good use of it i think madam said the master of the shop with a shrewd good natured look i could give a pretty good guess myself what will become of that guinea but i say nothing no that is right said miss somers we leave susan entirely at liberty and now we will not detain her any longer good night susan we shall soon come again to your neat cottage susan curtsied with an expressive look of gratitude and with a modest frankness in her countenance which seemed to say i would tell you and welcome what i want to do with the guinea but i am not used to speak before so many people when you come to our cottage again you shall know all when susan had departed miss somers turned to the obliging shopkeeper who was folding up all the things he had opened you have had a great deal of trouble with us sir said she and since susan will not choose a gown for herself i must she selected the prettiest and whilst the man was rolling it in paper she asked him several questions about susan and her family which he was delighted to answer because he had now all opportunity of saying as much as he wished in her praise no later back maam than last may morning said he as my daughter rose was telling us susan did a turn in her quiet way by her mother that would not displease you if you were to hear it she was to have been queen of the may which in our little village amongst the younger tribe is a thing that is thought of a good deal but susans mother was ill and susan after sitting up with her all night would not leave her in the morning even when they brought the crown to her she put the crown upon my daughter roses head with her own hands and to be sure rose loves her as well as if she was her own sister but i dont speak from partiality for i am no relation whatever to the pricesonly a well wisher as everyone i believe who knows them is ill send the parcel up to the abbey shall i maam if you please said miss somers and as soon as you receive your new things from town let us know you will i hope find us good customers and well wishers added she with a smile for those who wish well to their neighbours surely deserve to have well wishers themselves a few words may encourage the benevolent passions and may dispose people to live in peace and happiness a few words may set them at variance and may lead to misery and lawsuits attorney case and miss somers were both equally convinced of this and their practice was uniformly consistent with their principles but now to return to susan she put the bright guinea carefully into the glove with the twelve shillings which she had received from her companions on may day besides this treasure she calculated that the amount of the bills for bread could not be less than eight or nine and thirty shillings and as her father was now sure of a weeks reprieve she had great hopes that by some means or other it would be possible to make up the whole sum necessary to pay for a substitute if that could but be done said she to herself how happy would my mother be she would be quite stout again for she certainly is a great deal better since i told her that father would stay a week longer ah but she would not have blessed attorney case though if she had known about my poor daisy susan took the path that led to the meadow by the waterside resolved to go by herself and take leave of her innocent favourite but she did not pass by unperceived her little brothers were watching for her return and as soon as they saw her they ran after her and overtook her as she reached the meadow what did that good lady want with you cried william but looking up in his sisters face he saw tears in her eyes and he was silent and walked on quietly susan saw her lamb by the water side who are those two men said william what are they going to do with daisy the two men were attorney case and the butcher the butcher was feeling whether the lamb was fat susan sat down upon the bank in silent sorrow her little brothers ran up to the butcher and demanded whether he was going to do any harm to the lamb the butcher did not answer but the attorney replied it is not your sisters lamb any longer its minemine to all intents and purposes yours cried the children with terror and will you kill it thats the butchers business the little boys now burst into piercing lamentations they pushed away the butchers hand they threw their arms round the neck of the lamb they kissed its foreheadit bleated it will not bleat to morrow said william and he wept bitterly the butcher looked aside and hastily rubbed his eyes with the corner of his blue apron the attorney stood unmoved he pulled up the head of the lamb which had just stooped to crop a mouthful of clover i have no time to waste said he butcher youll account with me if its fatthe sooner the better ive no more to say and he walked off deaf to the prayers of the poor children as soon as the attorney was out of sight susan rose from the bank where she was seated came up to her lamb and stooped to gather some of the fresh dewy trefoil to let it eat out of her hand for the last time poor daisy licked her well known hand now let us go said susan ill wait as long as you please said the butcher susan thanked him but walked away quickly without looking again at her lamb her little brothers begged the man to stay a few minutes for they had gathered a handful of blue speedwell and yellow crowsfoot and they were decking the poor animal as it followed the boys through the village the children collected as they passed and the butchers own son was amongst the number susans steadiness about the bad shilling was full in this boys memory it had saved him a beating he went directly to his father to beg the life of susans lamb i was thinking about it boy myself said the butcher its a sin to kill a pet lamb im thinkingany way its what im not used to and dont fancy doing and ill go and say as much to attorney case but hes a hard man theres but one way to deal with him and thats the way i must take though so be i shall be the loser thereby but well say nothing to the boys for fear it might be the thing would not take and then it would be worse again to poor susan who is a good girl and always was as well as she may being of a good breed and well reared from the first come lads dont keep a crowd and a scandal about my door continued he aloud to the children turn the lamb in here john in the paddock for to night and go your ways home the crowd dispersed but murmured and the butcher went to the attorney seeing that all you want is a good fat tender lamb for a present for sir arthur as you told me said the butcher i could let you have whats as good or better for your purpose betterif its better im ready to hear reason the butcher had choice tender lamb he said fit to eat the next day and as mr case was impatient to make his offering to sir arthur he accepted the butchers proposal though with such seeming reluctance that he actually squeezed out of him before he would complete the bargain a bribe of a fine sweetbread in the meantime susans brothers ran home to tell her that her lamb was put into the paddock for the night this was all they knew and even this was some comfort to her rose her good friend was with her and she had before her the pleasure of telling her father of his weeks reprieve her mother was better and even said she was determined to sit up to supper in her wicker armchair susan was getting this ready for supper when little william who was standing at the house door watching in the dusk for his fathers return suddenly exclaimed susan if here is not our old man yes said the old harper i have found my way to you the neighbours were kind enough to show me whereabouts you lived for though i didnt know your name they guessed who i meant by what i said of you all susan came to the door and the old man was delighted to hear her speak again if it would not be too bold said he im a stranger in this part of the country and come from afar off my boy has got a bed for himself here in the village but i have no place could you be so charitable as to give an old blind man a nights lodging susan said she would step in and ask her mother and she soon returned with an answer that he was heartily welcome if he could sleep upon the childrens bed which was but small the old man thankfully entered the hospitable cottage he struck his head against the low roof as he stepped over the doorsill many roofs that are twice as high are not half so good said he of this he had just had experience at the house of the attorney case while he had asked but had been roughly refused all assistance by miss barbara who was according to her usual custom standing staring at the hall door the old mans harp was set down in farmer prices kitchen and he promised to play a tune for the boys before they went to bed their mother giving them leave to sit up to supper with their father he came home with a sorrowful countenance but how soon did it brighten when susan with a smile said to him father weve good news for you good news for us allyou have a whole week longer to stay with us and perhaps continued she putting her little purse into his handsperhaps with whats here and the bread bills and what may somehow be got together before a weeks at an end we may make up the nine guineas for the substitute as they call him who knows dearest mother but we may keep him with us for ever as she spoke she threw her arms round her father who pressed her to his bosom without speaking for his heart was full he was some little time before he could perfectly believe that what he heard was true but the revived smiles of his wife the noisy joy of his little boys and the satisfaction that shone in susans countenance convinced him that he was not in a dream as they sat down to supper the old harper was made welcome to his share of the cheerful though frugal meal susans father as soon as supper was finished even before he would let the harper play a tune for his boys opened the little purse which susan had given him he was surprised at the sight of the twelve shillings and still more when he came to the bottom of the purse to see the bright golden guinea how did you come by all this money susan said he honestly and handsomely that im sure of beforehand said her proud mother but how i cant make out except by the baking hey susan is this your first baking oh no no said her father i have her first baking snug here besides in my pocket i kept it for a surprise to do your mothers heart good susan heres twenty nine shillings and the abbey bill which is not paid yet comes to ten more what think you of this wife have we not a right to be proud of our susan why continued he turning to the harper i ask your pardon for speaking out so free before strangers in praise of my own which i know is not mannerly but the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken as i think at all times therefore heres your good health susan why by and by shell be worth her weight in goldin silver at least but tell us child how came you by all this riches and how comes it that i dont go to morrow all this happy news makes me so gay in myself im afraid i shall hardly understand it rightly but speak on childfirst bringing us a bottle of the good mead you made last year from your own honey susan did not much like to tell the history of her guinea henof the gown and of her poor lamb part of this would seem as if she was vaunting of her own generosity and part of it she did not like to recollect but her mother pressed to know the whole and she related it as simply as she could when she came to the story of her lamb her voice faltered and everybody present was touched the old harper sighed once and cleared his throat several times he then asked for his harp and after tuning it for a considerable time he recollectedfor he had often fits of absencethat he sent for it to play the tune he had promised to the boys this harper came from a great distance from the mountains of wales to contend with several other competitors for a prize which had been advertised by a musical society about a year before this time there was to be a splendid ball given upon the occasion at shrewsbury which was about five miles from our village the prize was ten guineas for the best performer on the harp and the prize was now to be decided in a few days all this intelligence barbara had long since gained from her maid who often paid visits to the town of shrewsbury and she had long had her imagination inflamed with the idea of this splendid music meeting and ball often had she sighed to be there and often had she revolved in her mind schemes for introducing herself to some genteel neighbours who might take her to the ball in their carriage how rejoiced how triumphant was she when this very evening just about the time when the butcher was bargaining with her father about susans lamb a servant from the abbey rapped at the door and left a card for mr and miss barbara case there cried bab i and papa are to dine and drink tea at the abbey to morrow who knows i daresay when they see that im not a vulgar person and all that and if i go cunningly to work with miss somers as i shall to be sure i daresay shell take me to the ball with her to be sure said the maid its the least one may expect from a lady who demeans herself to visit susan price and goes about a shopping for her the least she can do for you is to take you in her carriage which costs nothing but is just a common civility to a ball then pray betty continued miss barbara dont forget to morrow the first thing you do to send off to shrewsbury for my new bonnet i must have it to dine in at the abbey or the ladies will think nothing of me and betty remember the mantua maker too i must see and coax papa to buy me a new gown against the ball i can see you know something of the fashions to morrow at the abbey i shall look the ladies well over i promise you and betty i have thought of the most charming present for miss somers as papa says its good never to go empty handed to a great house ill make miss somers who is fond as her maid told you of such thingsill make miss somers a present of that guinea hen of susans its of no use to me so do you carry it up early in the morning to the abbey with my compliments thats the thing in full confidence that her present and her bonnet would operate effectually in her favour miss barbara paid her first visit at the abbey she expected to see wonders she was dressed in all the finery which she had heard from her maid who had heard from the prentice of a shrewsbury milliner was the thing in london and she was much surprised and disappointed when she was shown into the room where the miss somerses and the ladies of the abbey were sitting to see that they did not in any one part of their dress agree with the picture her imagination had formed of fashionable ladies she was embarrassed when she saw books and work and drawings upon the table and she began to think that some affront was meant to her because the company did not sit with their hands before them when miss somers endeavoured to find out conversation that would interest her and spoke of walks and flowers and gardening of which she was herself fond miss barbara still thought herself undervalued and soon contrived to expose her ignorance most completely by talking of things which she did not understand those who never attempt to appear what they are notthose who do not in their manners pretend to anything unsuited to their habits and situation in life never are in danger of being laughed at by sensible well bred people of any rank but affectation is the constant and just object of ridicule miss barbara case with her mistaken airs of gentility aiming to be thought a woman and a fine lady whilst she was in reality a child and a vulgar attorneys daughter rendered herself so thoroughly ridiculous that the good natured yet discerning spectators were painfully divided between their sense of comic absurdity and a feeling of shame for one who could feel nothing for herself one by one the ladies dropped off miss somers went out of the room for a few minutes to alter her dress as it was the custom of the family before dinner she left a portfolio of pretty drawings and good prints for miss barbaras amusement but miss barbaras thoughts were so intent upon the harpers ball that she could not be entertained with such trifles how unhappy are those who spend their time in expectation they can never enjoy the present moment whilst barbara was contriving means of interesting miss somers in her favour she recollected with surprise that not one word had yet been said of her present of the guinea hen mrs betty in the hurry of her dressing her young lady in the morning had forgotten it but it came just whilst miss somers was dressing and the housekeeper came into her mistress room to announce its arrival maam said she heres a beautiful guinea hen just come with miss barbara cases compliments to you miss somers knew by the tone which the housekeeper delivered this message that there was something in the business which did not perfectly please her she made no answer in expectation that the housekeeper who was a woman of a very open temper would explain her cause of dissatisfaction in this she was not mistaken the housekeeper came close up to the dressing table and continued i never like to speak till im sure maam and im not quite sure to say certain in this case maam but still i think it right to tell you which cant wrong anybody what came across my mind about this same guinea hen maam and you can inquire into it and do as you please afterwards maam some time ago we had fine guinea fowls of our own and i made bold not thinking to be sure that all our own would die away from us as they have done to give a fine couple last christmas to susan price and very fond and pleased she was at the time and im sure would never have parted with the hen with her good will but if my eyes dont strangely mistake this hen that comes from miss barbara is the selfsame identical guinea hen that i gave to susan and how miss bab came by it is the thing that puzzles me if my boy philip was at home maybe as hes often at mrs prices which i dont disapprove he might know the history of the guinea hen i expect him home this night and if you have no objection i will sift the affair the shortest way i think said henrietta would be to ask miss case herself about it which i will do this evening if you please maam said the housekeeper coldly for she knew that miss barbara was not famous in the village for speaking truth dinner was now served attorney case expected to smell mint sauce and as the covers were taken from off the dishes looked around for lamb but no lamb appeared he had a dexterous knack of twisting the conversation to his point sir arthur was speaking when they sat down to dinner of a new carving knife which he lately had had made for his sister the attorney immediately went from carving knives to poultry thence to butchers meat some joints he observed were much more difficult to carve than others he never saw a man carve better than the gentleman opposite him who was the curate of the parish but sir said the vulgar attorney i must make bold to differ with you in one point and ill appeal to sir arthur sir arthur pray may i ask when you carve a forequarter of lamb do you when you raise the shoulder throw in salt or not this well prepared question was not lost upon sir arthur the attorney was thanked for his intended present but mortified and surprised to hear sir arthur say that it was a constant rule of his never to accept of any presents from his neighbours if we were to accept a lamb from a rich neighbour on my estate said he i am afraid we should mortify many of our poor tenants who can have little to offer though perhaps they may bear us thorough good will notwithstanding after the ladies left the dining room as they were walking up and down the large hall miss barbara had a fair opportunity of imitating her keen fathers method of conversing one of the ladies observed that this hall would be a charming place for music bab brought in harps and harpers and the harpers ball in a breath i know so much about itabout the ball i mean said she because a lady in shrewsbury a friend of papas offered to take me with her but papa did not like to give her the trouble of sending so far for me though she has a coach of her own barbara fixed her eyes upon miss somers as she spoke but she could not read her countenance as distinctly as she wished because miss somers was at this moment letting down the veil of her hat shall we walk out before tea said miss somers to her companions i have a pretty guinea hen to show you barbara secretly drawing propitious omens from the guinea hen followed with a confidential step the pheasantry was well filled with pheasants peacocks etc and susans pretty little guinea hen appeared well even in this high company it was much admired barbara was in glory but her glory was of short duration just as miss somers was going to inquire into the guinea hens history philip came up to ask permission to have a bit of sycamore to turn a nutmeg box for his mother he was an ingenious lad and a good turner for his age sir arthur had put by a bit of sycamore on purpose for him and miss somers told him where it was to be found he thanked her but in the midst of his bow of thanks his eye was struck by the sight of the guinea hen and he involuntarily exclaimed susans guinea hen i declare no its not susans guinea hen said miss barbara colouring furiously it is mine and i have made a present of it to miss somers at the sound of babs voice philip turnedsaw herand indignation unrestrained by the presence of all the amazed spectators flashed in his countenance what is the matter philip said miss somers in a pacifying tone but philip was not inclined to be pacified why maam said he may i speak out and without waiting for permission he spoke out and gave a full true and warm account of roses embassy and of miss barbaras cruel and avaricious proceedings barbara denied prevaricated stammered and at last was overcome with confusion for which even the most indulgent spectators could scarcely pity her miss somers however mindful of what was due to her guest was anxious to dispatch philip for his piece of sycamore bab recovered herself as soon as he was out of sight but she further exposed herself by exclaiming im sure i wish this pitiful guinea hen had never come into my possession i wish susan had kept it at home as she should have done perhaps she will be more careful now that she has received so strong a lesson said miss somers shall we try her continued she philip will i daresay take the guinea hen back to susan if we desire it if you please maam said barbara sullenly i have nothing more to do with it so the guinea hen was delivered to philip who set off joyfully with his prize and was soon in sight of farmer prices cottage he stopped when he came to the door he recollected rose and her generous friendship for susan he was determined that she should have the pleasure of restoring the guinea hen he ran into the village all the children who had given up their little purse on may day were assembled on the play green they were delighted to see the guinea hen once more philip took his pipe and tabor and they marched in innocent triumph towards the whitewashed cottage let me come with youlet me come with you said the butchers boy to philip stop one minute my father has something to say to you he darted into his fathers house the little procession stopped and in a few minutes the bleating of a lamb was heard through a back passage which led into the paddock behind the house they saw the butcher leading a lamb it is daisy exclaimed roseits daisy repeated all her companions susans lamb susans lamb and there was a universal shout of joy well for my part said the good butcher as soon as he could be heardfor my part i would not be so cruel as attorney case for the whole world these poor brute beasts dont know aforehand whats going to happen to them and as for dying its what we must all do some time or another but to keep wringing the hearts of the living that have as much sense as ones self is what i call cruel and is not this what attorney case has been doing by poor susan and her whole family ever since he took a spite against them but at anyrate heres susans lamb safe and sound id have taken it back sooner but i was off before day to the fair and am but just come back daisy however has been as well off in my paddock as he would have been in the field by the waterside the obliging shopkeeper who showed the pretty calicoes to susan was now at his door and when he saw the lamb and heard that it was susans and learned its history he said that he would add his mite and he gave the children some ends of narrow riband with which rose decorated her friends lamb the pipe and tabor now once more began to play and the procession moved on in joyful order after giving the humane butcher three cheers three cheers which were better deserved than loud huzzas usually are susan was working in her arbour with her little deal table before her when she heard the sound of the music she put down her work and listened she saw the crowd of children coming nearer and nearer they had closed round daisy so that she did not see it but as they came up to the garden gate she saw that rose beckoned to her philip played as loud as he could that she might not hear till the proper moment the bleating of the lamb susan opened the garden wicket and at this signal the crowd divided and the first thing that susan saw in the midst of her taller friends was little smiling mary with the guinea hen in her arms come on come on cried mary as susan started with joyful surprise you have more to see at this instant the music paused susan heard the bleating of a lamb and scarcely daring to believe her senses she pressed eagerly forward and beheld poor daisyshe burst into tears i did not shed one tear when i parted with you my dear little daisy said she it was for my father and mother i would not have parted with you for anything else in the whole world thank you thank you all added she to her companions who sympathized in her joy even more than they had sympathized in her sorrow now if my father was not to go away from us next week and if my mother was quite stout i should be the happiest person in the world as susan pronounced these words a voice behind the little listening crowd cried in a brutal tone let us pass if you please you have no right to stop up the public road this was the voice of attorney case who was returning with his daughter barbara from his visit to the abbey he saw the lamb and tried to whistle as he went on barbara also saw the guinea hen and turned her head another way that she might avoid the contemptuous reproachful looks of those whom she only affected to despise even her new bonnet in which she had expected to be so much admired was now only serviceable to hide her face and conceal her mortification i am glad she saw the guinea hen cried rose who now held it in her hands yes said philip shell not forget may day in a hurry nor i neither i hope said susan looking round upon her companions with a most affectionate smile i hope whilst i live i shall never forget your goodness to me last may day now ive my pretty guinea hen safe once more i should think of returning your money no no no was the general cry we dont want the moneykeep it keep ityou want it for your father well said susan i am not too proud to be obliged i will keep your money for my father perhaps some time or other i may be able to earn oh interrupted philip dont let us talk of earning dont let us talk to her of money now she has not had time hardly to look at poor daisy and her guinea hen come we must go about our business and let her have them all to herself the crowd moved away in consequence of philips considerate advice but it was observed that he was the very last to stir from the garden wicket himself he stayed first to inform susan that it was rose who tied the ribands on daisys head then he stayed a little longer to let her into the history of the guinea hen and to tell her who it was that brought the hen home from the abbey rose held the sieve and susan was feeding her long lost favourite whilst philip leaned over the wicket prolonging his narration now my pretty guinea hen said susanmy naughty guinea hen that flew away from me you shall never serve me so again i must cut your nice wings but i wont hurt you take care cried philip youd better indeed youd better let me hold her whilst you cut her wings when this operation was successfully performed which it certainly could never have been if philip had not held the hen for susan he recollected that his mother had sent him with a message to mrs price this message led to another quarter of an hours delay for he had the whole history of the guinea hen to tell over again to mrs price and the farmer himself luckily came in whilst it was going on so it was but civil to begin it afresh and then the farmer was so rejoiced to see his susan so happy again with her two little favourites that he declared he must see daisy fed himself and philip found that he was wanted to hold the jug full of milk out of which farmer price filled the pan for daisy happy daisy who lapped at his ease whilst susan caressed him and thanked her fond father and her pleased mother but philip said mrs price ill hold the jugyoull be late with your message to your mother well not detain you any longer philip departed and as he went out of the garden wicket he looked up and saw bab and her maid betty staring out of the window as usual on this he immediately turned back to try whether he had shut the gate fast lest the guinea hen might stray out and fall again into the hands of the enemy miss barbara in the course of this day felt considerable mortification but no contrition she was vexed that her meanness was discovered but she felt no desire to cure herself of any of her faults the ball was still uppermost in her vain selfish soul well said she to her confidante betty you hear how things have turned out but if miss somers wont think of asking me to go out with her ive a notion i know who will as papa says its a good thing to have two strings to ones bow now some officers who were quartered at shrewsbury had become acquainted with mr case they had gotten into some quarrel with a tradesman of the town and attorney case had promised to bring them through the affair as the man threatened to take the law of them upon the faith of this promise and with the vain hope that by civility they might dispose him to bring in a reasonable bill of costs these officers sometimes invited mr case to the mess and one of them who had lately been married prevailed upon his bride sometimes to take a little notice of miss barbara it was with this lady that miss barbara now hoped to go to the harpers ball the officers and mrs strathspey or more properly mrs strathspey and the officers are to breakfast here to morrow do you know said bab to betty one of them dined at the abbey to day and told papa that theyd all come they are going out on a party somewhere into the country and breakfast here on their way pray betty dont forget that mrs strathspey cant breakfast without honey i heard her say so myself then indeed said betty im afraid mrs strathspey will be likely to go without her breakfast here for not a spoonful of honey have we let her long for it ever so much but surely said bab we can contrive to get some honey in the neighbourhood theres none to be bought as i know of said betty but is there none to be begged or borrowed said bab laughing do you forget susans beehive step over to her in the morning with my compliments and see what you can do tell her its for mrs strathspey in the morning betty went with miss barbaras compliments to susan to beg some honey for mrs strathspey who could not breakfast without it susan did not like to part with her honey because her mother loved it and she therefore gave betty but a small quantity when barbara saw how little susan sent she called her a miser and she said she must have some more for mrs strathspey ill go myself and speak to her come with me betty said the young lady who found it at present convenient to forget her having declared the day that she sucked up the broth that she never would honour susan with another visit susan said she accosting the poor girl whom she had done everything in her power to injure i must beg a little more honey from you for mrs strathspeys breakfast you know on a particular occasion such as this neighbours must help one another to be sure they should added betty susan though she was generous was not weak she was willing to give to those she loved but not disposed to let anything be taken from her or coaxed out of her by those she had reason to despise she civilly answered that she was sorry she had no more honey to spare barbara grew angry and lost all command of herself when she saw that susan without regarding her reproaches went on looking through the glass pane in the beehive ill tell you what susan price said she in a high tone the honey i will have so you may as well give it to me by fair means yes or no speak will you give it me or not will you give me that piece of the honey comb that lies there that bit of honey comb is for my mothers breakfast said susan i cannot give it you cant you said bab then see if i dont take it she stretched across susan for the honey comb which was lying by some rosemary leaves that susan had freshly gathered for her mothers tea bab grasped but at her first effort she only reached the rosemary she made a second dart at the honey comb and in her struggle to obtain it she overset the beehive the bees swarmed about her her maid betty screamed and ran away susan who was sheltered by a laburnum tree called to barbara upon whom the black clusters of bees were now settling and begged her to stand still and not to beat them away if you stand quietly you wont be stung perhaps but instead of standing quietly bab buffeted and stamped and roared and the bees stung her terribly her arms and her face swelled in a frightful manner she was helped home by poor susan and treacherous mrs betty who now the mischief was done thought only of exculpating herself to her master indeed miss barbara said she this was quite wrong of you to go and get yourself into such a scrape i shall be turned away for it youll see i dont care whether you are turned away or not said barbara i never felt such pain in my life cant you do something for me i dont mind the pain either so much as being such a fright pray how am i to be fit to be seen at breakfast by mrs strathspey and i suppose i cant go to the ball either to morrow after all no that you cant expect to do indeed said betty the comforter you need not think of balls for those lumps and swellings wont go off your face this week thats not what pains me but im thinking of what your papa will say to me when he sees you miss whilst this amiable mistress and maid were in their adversity reviling one another susan when she saw that she could be of no further use was preparing to depart but at the house door she was met by mr case mr case had revolved things in his mind for his second visit at the abbey pleased him as little as his first owing to a few words which sir arthur and miss somers dropped in speaking of susan and farmer price mr case began to fear that he had mistaken his game in quarrelling with this family the refusal of his present dwelt upon the attorneys mind and he was aware that if the history of susans lamb ever reached the abbey he was undone he now thought that the most prudent course he could possibly follow would be to hush up matters with the prices with all convenient speed consequently when he met susan at his door he forced a gracious smile how is your mother susan said he is there anything in our house can be of service to her on hearing his daughter he cried out barbara barbarabab come downstairs child and speak to susan price but as no barbara answered her father stalked upstairs directly opened the door and stood amazed at the spectacle of her swelled visage betty instantly began to tell the story of barbaras mishap her own way bab contradicted her as fast as she spoke the attorney turned the maid away on the spot and partly with real anger and partly with feigned affectation of anger he demanded from his daughter how she dared to treat susan price so ill when as he said she was so neighbourly and obliging as to give you some of her honey couldnt you be content without seizing upon the honey comb by force this is scandalous behaviour and what i assure you i cant countenance susan now interceded for barbara and the attorney softening his voice said that susan was a great deal too good to her as you are indeed added he to everybody i forgive her for your sake susan curtsied in great surprise but her lamb could not be forgotten and she left the attorneys house as soon as she could to make her mothers rosemary tea breakfast mr case saw that susan was not so simple as to be taken in by a few fair words his next attempt was to conciliate farmer price the farmer was a blunt honest man and his countenance remained inflexibly contemptuous when the attorney addressed him in his softest tone so stood matters the day of the long expected harpers ball miss barbara case stung by susans bees could not after all her manuvres go with mrs strathspey to the ball the ballroom was filled early in the evening there was a numerous assembly the harpers who contended for the prize were placed under the music gallery at the lower end of the room amongst them was our old blind friend who as he was not so well clad as his competitors seemed to be disdained by many of the spectators six ladies and six gentlemen were now appointed to be judges of the performance they were seated in a semicircle opposite to the harpers the miss somerses who were fond of music were amongst the ladies in the semicircle and the prize was lodged in the hands of sir arthur there was now silence the first harp sounded and as each musician tried his skill the audience seemed to think that each deserved the prize the old blind man was the last he tuned his instrument and such a simple pathetic strain was heard as touched every heart all were fixed in delighted attention and when the music ceased the silence for some moments continued the silence was followed by a universal buzz of applause the judges were unanimous in their opinions and it was declared that the old blind harper who played the last deserved the prize the simple pathetic air which won the suffrages of the whole assembly was his own composition he was pressed to give the words belonging to the music and at last he modestly offered to repeat them as he could not see to write miss somers ready pencil was instantly produced and the old harper dictated the words of his ballad which he calledsusans lamentation for her lamb miss somers looked at her brother from time to time as she wrote and sir arthur as soon as the old man had finished took him aside and asked him some questions which brought the whole history of susans lamb and of attorney cases cruelty to light the attorney himself was present when the harper began to dictate his ballad his colour as sir arthur steadily looked at him varied continually till at length when he heard the words susans lamentation for her lamb he suddenly shrunk back skulked through the crowd and disappeared we shall not follow him we had rather follow our old friend the victorious harper no sooner had he received the ten guineas his well merited prize than he retired to a small room belonging to the people of the house asked for pen ink and paper and dictated in a low voice to his boy who was a tolerably good scribe a letter which he ordered him to put directly into the shrewsbury post office the boy ran with the letter to the post office he was but just in time for the postmans horn was sounding the next morning when farmer price his wife and susan were sitting together reflecting that his weeks leave of absence was nearly at an end and that the money was not yet made up for john simpson the substitute a knock was heard at the door and the person who usually delivered the letters in the village put a letter into susans hand saying a penny if you pleaseheres a letter for your father for me said farmer price heres the penny then but who can it be from i wonder who can think of writing to me in this world he tore open the letter but the hard name at the bottom of the page puzzled himyour obliged friend llewellyn and whats this said he opening a paper that was inclosed in the letter its a song seemingly it must be somebody that has a mind to make an april fool of me but it is not april it is may father said susan well let us read the letter and we shall come to the truth all in good time farmer price sat down in his own chair for he could not read entirely to his satisfaction in any other and read as follows my worthy friendi am sure you will be glad to hear that i have had good success this night i have won the ten guinea prize and for that i am in a great measure indebted to your sweet daughter susan as you will see by a little ballad i inclose for her your hospitality to me has afforded to me an opportunity of learning some of your family history you do not i hope forget that i was present when you were counting the treasure in susans little purse and that i heard for what purpose it was all destined you have not i know yet made up the full sum for your substitute john simpson therefore do me the favour to use the five guinea bank note which you will find within the ballad you shall not find me as hard a creditor as attorney case pay me the money at your own convenience if it is never convenient to you to pay it i shall never ask it i shall go my rounds again through this country i believe about this time next year and will call to see how you do and to play the new tune for susan and the dear little boys i should just add to set your heart at rest about the money that it does not distress me at all to lend it to you i am not quite so poor as i appear to be but it is my humour to go about as i do i see more of the world under my tattered garb than perhaps i should ever see in a better dress there are many of my profession who are of the same mind as myself in this respect and we are glad when it lies in our way to do any kindness to such a worthy family as yoursso fare ye well your obliged friend llewellyn susan now by her fathers desire opened the ballad he picked up the five guinea bank note whilst she read with surprise susans lamentation for her lamb her mother leaned over her shoulder to read the words but they were interrupted before they had finished the first stanza by another knock at the door it was not the postman with another letter it was sir arthur and his sisters they came with an intention which they were much disappointed to find that the old harper had rendered vainthey came to lend the farmer and his good family the money to pay for his substitute but since we are here said sir arthur let me do my own business which i had like to have forgotten mr price will you come out with me and let me show you a piece of your land through which i want to make a road look there said sir arthur pointing to the spot i am laying out a ride round my estate and that bit of land of yours stops me why sir said price the lands mine to be sure for that matter but i hope you dont look upon me to be that sort of person that would be stiff about a trifle or so the fact is said sir arthur i had heard you were a litigious pig headed fellow but you do not seem to deserve this character hope not sir said the farmer but about the matter of the land i dont want to take any advantage of your wishing for it you are welcome to it and i leave it to you to find me out another bit of land convenient to me that will be worth neither more nor less or else to make up the value to me some way or other i need say no more about it i hear something continued sir arthur after a short silencei hear something mr price of a flaw in your lease i would not speak to you about it whilst we were bargaining about your land lest i should over awe you but tell me what is this flaw in truth and the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken at all times said the farmer i didnt know myself what a flaw as they call it meant till i heard of the word from attorney case and i take it a flaw is neither more nor less than a mistake as one should say now by reason a man does not make a mistake on purpose it seems to me to be the fair thing that if a man finds out his mistake he might set it right but attorney case says this is not law and ive no more to say the man who drew up my lease made a mistake and if i must suffer for it i must said the farmer however i can show you sir arthur just for my own satisfaction and yours a few lines of a memorandum on a slip of paper which was given me by your relation the gentleman who lived here before and let me my farm youll see by that bit of paper what was meant but the attorney says the papers not worth a button in a court of justice and i dont understand these things all i understand is the common honesty of the matter ive no more to say this attorney whom you speak of so often said sir arthur you seem to have some quarrel with now would you tell me frankly what is the matter between the matter between us then said price is a little bit of ground not worth much that is there open to the lane at the end of mr cases garden sir and he wanted to take it in now i told him my mind that it belonged to the parish and that i never would willingly give my consent to his cribbing it in that way sir i was the more loath to see it shut into his garden which moreover is large enough of all conscience without it because you must know sir arthur the children in our village are fond of making a little play green of it and they have a custom of meeting on may day at a hawthorn that stands in the middle of it and altogether i was very loath to see em turned out of it by those who have no right let us go and see this nook said sir arthur it is not far off is it oh no sir just hard by here when they got to the ground mr case who saw them walking together was in a hurry to join them that he might put a stop to any explanations explanations were things of which he had a great dread but fortunately he was upon this occasion a little too late is this the nook in dispute said sir arthur yes this is the whole thing said price why sir arthur interposed the politic attorney with an assumed air of generosity dont let us talk any more about it let it belong to whom it will i give it up to you so great a lawyer mr case as you are replied sir arthur must know that a man cannot give up that to which he has no legal title and in this case it is impossible that with the best intentions to oblige me in the world you can give up this bit of land to me because it is mine already as i can convince you effectually by a map of the adjoining land which i have fortunately safe amongst my papers this piece of ground belonged to the farm on the opposite side of the road and it was cut off when the lane was made very possibly i daresay you are quite correct you must know best said the attorney trembling for the agency then said sir arthur mr price you will observe that i now promise this little green to the children for a play ground and i hope they may gather hawthorn many a may day at this their favourite bush mr price bowed low which he seldom did even when he received a favour himself and now mr case said sir arthur turning to the attorney who did not know which way to look you sent me a lease to look over ye ye yes stammered mr case i thought it my duty to do so not out of any malice or ill will to this good man you have done him no injury said sir arthur coolly i am ready to make him a new lease whenever he pleases of his farm and i shall be guided by a memorandum of the original bargain which he has in his possession i hope i never shall take an unfair advantage of anyone heaven forbid sir said the attorney sanctifying his face that i should suggest the taking an unfair advantage of any man rich or poor but to break a bad lease is not taking an unfair advantage you really think so said sir arthur certainly i do and i hope i have not hazarded your good opinion by speaking my mind concerning the flaw so plainly i always understood that there could be nothing ungentlemanlike in the way of business in taking advantage of a flaw in a lease now said sir arthur you have pronounced judgment undesignedly in your own case you intended to send me this poor mans lease but your son by some mistake brought me your own and i have discovered a fatal error in it a fatal error said the alarmed attorney yes sir said sir arthur pulling the lease out of his pocket here it is you will observe that it is neither signed nor sealed by the grantor but you wont take advantage of me surely sir arthur said mr case forgetting his own principles i shall not take advantage of you as you would have taken of this honest man in both cases i shall be guided by memoranda which i have in my possession i shall not mr case defraud you of one shilling of your property i am ready at a fair valuation to pay the exact value of your house and land but upon this conditionthat you quit the parish within one month attorney case was thus compelled to submit to the hard necessity of the case for he knew that he could not legally resist indeed he was glad to be let off so easily and he bowed and sneaked away secretly comforting himself with the hope that when they came to the valuation of the house and land he should be the gainer perhaps of a few guineas his reputation he justly held very cheap you are a scholar you write a good hand you can keep accounts cannot you said sir arthur to mr price as they walked home towards the cottage i think i saw a bill of your little daughters drawing out the other day which was very neatly written did you teach her to write no sir said price i cant say i did that for she mostly taught it herself but i taught her a little arithmetic as far as i knew on our winter nights when i had nothing better to do your daughter shows that she has been well taught said sir arthur and her good conduct and good character speak strongly in favour of her parents you are very good very good indeed sir to speak in this sort of way said the delighted father but i mean to do more than pay you with words said sir arthur you are attached to your own family perhaps you may become attached to me when you come to know me and we shall have frequent opportunities of judging of one another i want no agent to squeeze my tenants or do my dirty work i only want a steady intelligent honest man like you to collect my rents and i hope mr price you will have no objection to the employment i hope sir said price with joy and gratitude glowing in his honest countenance that youll never have cause to repent your goodness and what are my sisters about here said sir arthur entering the cottage and going behind his sisters who were busily engaged in measuring an extremely pretty coloured calico it is for susan my dear brother said they i know she did not keep that guinea for herself said miss somers i have just prevailed upon her mother to tell me what became of it susan gave it to her father but she must not refuse a gown of our choosing this time and i am sure she will not because her mother i see likes it and susan i hear that instead of becoming queen of the may this year you were sitting in your sick mothers room your mother has a little colour in her cheeks now oh maam interrupted mrs price im quite well joy i think has made me quite well then said miss somers i hope you will be able to come out on your daughters birthday which i hear is the th of this month make haste and get quite well before that day for my brother intends that all the lads and lassies of the village shall have a dance on susans birthday yes said sir arthur and i hope on that day susan you will be very happy with your little friends upon their play green i shall tell them that it is your good conduct which has obtained it for them and if you have anything to ask any little favour for any of your companions which we can grant now ask susan these ladies look as if they would not refuse you anything that is reasonable and i think you look as if you would not ask anything unreasonable sir said susan after consulting her mothers eyes there is to be sure a favour i should like to ask it is for rose well i dont know who rose is said sir arthur smiling but go on maam you have seen her i believe she is a very good girl indeed said mrs price and works very neatly indeed continued susan eagerly to miss somers and she and her mother heard you were looking out for someone to wait upon you say no more said miss somers your wish is granted tell rose to come to the abbey to morrow morning or rather come with her yourself for our housekeeper i know wants to talk to you about a certain cake she wishes susan that you should be the maker of the cake for the dance and she has good things ready looked out for it already i know it must be large enough for everybody to have a slice and the housekeeper will ice it for you i only hope your cake will be as good as your bread fare ye well how happy are those who bid farewell to a whole family silent with gratitude who will bless them aloud when they are far out of hearing how do i wish now said farmer price and its almost a sin for one that has had such a power of favours done him to wish for anything more but how i do wish wife that our good friend the harper was only here at this time it would do his old warm heart good well the best of it is we shall be able next year when he comes his rounds to pay him his money with thanks being all the time and for ever as much obliged to him as if we kept it i long so i do to see him in this house again drinking as he did just in this spot a glass of susans mead to her very good health yes said susan and the next time he comes i can give him one of my guinea hens eggs and i shall show my lamb daisy true love said her mother and he will play that tune and sing that pretty ballad where is it for i have not finished it rose ran away with it mother but ill step after her and bring it back to you this minute said susan susan found her friend rose at the hawthorn in the midst of a crowded circle of her companions to whom she was reading susans lamentation for her lamb the words are something but the tunethe tunei must have the tune cried philip ill ask my mother to ask sir arthur to try and find out which way that good old man went after the ball and if hes above ground well have him back by susans birthday and he shall sit herejust exactly here by this our bush and he shall playi mean if he pleasesthat same tune for us and i shall learn iti mean if i canin a minute the good news that farmer price was to be employed to collect the rents and that attorney case was to leave the parish in a month soon spread over the village many came out of their houses to have the pleasure of hearing the joyful tidings confirmed by susan herself the crowd on the play green increased every minute yes cried the triumphant philip i tell you its all true every word of it susans too modest to say it herself but i tell ye all sir arthur gave us this play green for ever on account of her being so good you see at last attorney case with all his cunning has not proved a match for simple susan the white pigeon the little town of somerville in ireland has within these few years assumed the neat and cheerful appearance of an english village mr somerville to whom this town belongs wished to inspire his tenantry with a taste for order and domestic happiness and took every means in his power to encourage industrious well behaved people to settle in his neighbourhood when he had finished building a row of good slated houses in his town he declared that he would let them to the best tenants he could find and proposals were publicly sent to him from all parts of the country by the best tenants mr somerville did not however mean the best bidders and many who had offered an extravagant price for the houses were surprised to find their proposals rejected amongst these was mr cox an alehouse keeper who did not bear a very good character please your honour sir said he to mr somerville i expected since i bid as fair and fairer for it than any other that you would have let me the house next the apothecarys was not it fifteen guineas i mentioned in my proposal and did not your honour give it against me for thirteen my honour did just so replied mr somerville calmly and please your honour but i dont know what it is i or mine have done to offend you im sure there is not a gentleman in all ireland id go further to sarve would not i go to cork to morrow for the least word from your honour i am much obliged to you mr cox but i have no business at cork at present answered mr somerville drily it is all i wish exclaimed mr cox that i could find out and light upon the man that has belied me to your honour no man has belied you mr cox but your nose belies you much if you do not love drinking a little and your black eye and cut chin belie you much if you do not love quarrelling a little quarrel i quarrel please your honour i defy any man or set of men ten mile round to prove such a thing and i am ready to fight him that dares to say the like of me id fight him here in your honours presence if hed only come out this minute and meet me like a man here mr cox put himself into a boxing attitude but observing that mr somerville looked at his threatening gesture with a smile and that several people who had gathered round him as he stood in the street laughed at the proof he gave of his peaceable disposition he changed his attitude and went on to vindicate himself against the charge of drinking and as to drink please your honour theres no truth in it not a drop of whisky good or bad have i touched these six months except what i took with jemmy mdoole the night i had the misfortune to meet your honour coming home from the fair of ballynagrish to this speech mr somerville made no answer but turned away to look at the bow window of a handsome new inn which the glazier was at this instant glazing please your honour that new inn is not let i hear as yet resumed mr cox if your honour recollects you promised to make me a compliment of it last seraphtide was twelvemonth impossible cried mr somerville for i had no thoughts of building an inn at that time oh i beg your honours pardon but if youd be just pleased to recollect it was coming through the gap in the bog meadows forenent thady oconnor you made me the promiseill leave it to him so i will but i will not leave it to him i assure you cried mr somerville i never made any such promise i never thought of letting this inn to you then your honour wont let me have it no you have told me a dozen falsehoods i do not wish to have you for a tenant well god bless your honour ive no more to say but god bless your honour said mr cox and he walked away muttering to himself as he slouched his hat over his face i hope ill live to be revenged on him mr somerville the next morning went with his family to look at the new inn which he expected to see perfectly finished but he was met by the carpenter who with a rueful face informed him that six panes of glass in the large bow window had been broken during the night ha perhaps mr cox has broken my windows in revenge for my refusing to let him my house said mr somerville and many of the neighbours who knew the malicious character of this mr cox observed that this was like one of his tricks a boy of about twelve years old however stepped forward and said i dont like mr cox im sure for once he beat me when he was drunk but for all that no one should be accused wrongfully he could not be the person that broke these windows last night for he was six miles off he slept at his cousins last night and he has not returned home yet so i think he knows nothing of the matter mr somerville was pleased with the honest simplicity of this boy and observing that he looked in eagerly at the staircase when the house door was opened he asked him whether he would like to go in and see the new house yes sir said the boy i should like to go up those stairs and to see what i should come to up with you then said mr somerville and the boy ran up the stairs he went from room to room with great expressions of admiration and delight at length as he was examining one of the garrets he was startled by a fluttering noise over his head and looking up he saw a white pigeon who frightened at his appearance began to fly round and round the room till it found its way out of the door and flew into the staircase the carpenter was speaking to mr somerville upon the landing place of the stairs but the moment he spied the white pigeon he broke off in the midst of a speech about the nose of the stairs and exclaimed there he is please your honour theres he that has done all the damage to our bow windowthats the very same wicked white pigeon that broke the church windows last sunday was sennight but hes down for it now we have him safe and ill chop his head off as he deserves this minute stay o stay dont chop his head off he does not deserve it cried the boy who came running out of the garret with the greatest eagernessi broke your window sir said he to mr somerville i broke your window with this ball but i did not know that i had done it till this moment i assure you or i should have told you before dont chop his head off added the boy to the carpenter who had now the white pigeon in his hands no said mr somerville the pigeons head shall not be chopped off nor yours either my good boy for breaking a window i am persuaded by your open honest countenance that you are speaking the truth but pray explain this matter to us for you have not made it quite clear how happened it that you could break my windows without knowing it and how came you to find it out at last sir said the boy if youll come up here ill show you all i know and how i came to know it mr somerville followed the boy into the garret who pointed to a pane of glass that was broken in a small window that looked out upon a piece of waste ground behind the house upon this piece of waste ground the children of the village often used to play we were playing there at ball yesterday evening continued the boy addressing himself to mr somerville and one of the lads challenged me to hit a mark in the wall which i did but he said i did not hit it and bade me give him up my ball as the forfeit this i would not do and when he began to wrestle with me for it i threw the ball as i thought over the house he ran to look for it in the street but could not find it which i was very glad of but i was very sorry just now to find it myself lying upon this heap of shavings sir under this broken window for as soon as i saw it lying there i knew i must have been the person that broke the window and through this window came the white pigeon heres one of his white feathers sticking in the gap yes said the carpenter and in the bow window room below theres plenty of his feathers to be seen for ive just been down to look it was the pigeon broke them windows sure enough but he could not have got in had i not broke this little window said the boy eagerly and i am able to earn sixpence a day and ill pay for all the mischief and welcome the white pigeon belongs to a poor neighbour a friend of ours who is very fond of him and i would not have him killed for twice as much money take the pigeon my honest generous lad said mr somerville and carry him back to your neighbour i forgive him all the mischief he has done me tell your friend for your sake as to the rest we can have the windows mended and do you keep all the sixpences you earn for yourself thats what he never did yet said the carpenter manys the sixpence he earns but not a halfpenny goes into his own pocket it goes every farthing to his poor father and mother happy for them to have such a son more happy for him to have such a father and mother exclaimed the boy their good days they took all the best care of me that was to be had for love or money and would if i would let them go on paying for my schooling now falling as they be in the world but i must learn to mind the shop now good morning to you sir and thank you kindly said he to mr somerville and where does this boy live and who are his father and mother they cannot live in town said mr somerville or i should have heard of them they are but just come into the town please your honour said the carpenter they lived formerly upon counsellor odonnels estate but they were ruined please your honour by taking a joint lease with a man who fell afterwards into bad company ran out all he had so could not pay the landlord and these poor people were forced to pay his share and their own too which almost ruined them they were obliged to give up the land and now they have furnished a little shop in this town with what goods they could afford to buy with the money they got by the sale of their cattle and stock they have the good will of all who know them and i am sure i hope they will do well the boy is very ready in the shop though he said only that he could earn sixpence a day he writes a good hand and is quick at casting up accounts for his age besides he is likely to do well in the world because he is never in idle company and ive known him since he was two foot high and never heard of his telling a lie this is an excellent character of the boy indeed said mr somerville and from his behaviour this morning i am inclined to think that he deserves all your praises mr somerville resolved to inquire more fully concerning this poor family and to attend to their conduct himself fully determined to assist them if he should find them such as they had been represented in the meantime this boy whose name was brian oneill went to return the white pigeon to its owner you have saved its life said the woman to whom it belonged and ill make you a present of it brian thanked her and he from that day began to grow fond of the pigeon he always took care to scatter some oats for it in his fathers yard and the pigeon grew so tame at last that it would hop about the kitchen and eat off the same trencher with the dog brian after the shop was shut up at night used to amuse himself with reading some little books which the schoolmaster who formerly taught him arithmetic was so good as to lend him amongst these he one evening met with a little book full of the history of birds and beasts he looked immediately to see whether the pigeon was mentioned amongst the birds and to his great joy he found a full description and history of his favourite bird so brian i see your schooling has not been thrown away upon you you like your book i see when you have no master over you to bid you read said his father when he came in and saw brian reading his book very attentively thank you for having me taught to read father said brian here ive made a great discovery ive found out in this book little as it looks father a most curious way of making a fortune and i hope it will make your fortune father and if youll sit down ill tell it to you mr oneill in hopes of pleasing his son rather than in the expectation of having his fortune made immediately sat down to listen and his son explained to him that he had found in his book an account of pigeons who carried notes and letters and father continued brian i find my pigeon is of this sort and i intend to make my pigeon carry messages why should not he if other pigeons have done so before him i think he is as good and i daresay will be as easy to teach as any pigeon in the world i shall begin to teach him to morrow morning and then father you know people often pay a great deal for sending messengers and no boy can run no horse can gallop so fast as a bird can fly therefore the bird must be the best messenger and i should be paid the best price hey father to be sure to be sure my boy said his father laughing i wish you may make the best messenger in ireland of your pigeon but all i beg my dear boy is that you wont neglect our shop for your pigeon for ive a notion we have a better chance of making a fortune by the shop than by the white pigeon brian never neglected the shop but in his leisure hours he amused himself with training his pigeon and after much patience he at last succeeded so well that one day he went to his father and offered to send him word by his pigeon what beef was a pound in the market of ballynagrish where he was going the pigeon will be home long before me father and he will come in at the kitchen window and light upon the dresser then you must untie the little note which i shall have tied under his left wing and youll know the price of beef directly the pigeon carried his message well and brian was much delighted with his success he soon was employed by the neighbours who were aroused by brians fondness of his swift messenger and soon the fame of the white pigeon was spread amongst all who frequented the markets and fairs of somerville at one of these fairs a set of men of desperate fortunes met to drink and to concert plans of robberies their place of meeting was at the ale house of mr cox the man who as our readers may remember was offended by mr somervilles hinting that he was fond of drinking and of quarrelling and who threatened vengeance for having been refused the new inn whilst these men were talking over their scheme one of them observed that one of their companions was not arrived another said no hes six miles off said another and a third wished that he could make him hear at that distance this turned the discourse upon the difficulties of sending messages secretly and quickly coxs son a lad of about nineteen who was one of this gang mentioned the white carrier pigeon and he was desired to try all means to get it into his possession accordingly the next day young cox went to brian oneill and tried at first by persuasion and afterwards by threats to prevail upon him to give up the pigeon brian was resolute in his refusal more especially when the petitioner began to bully him if we cant have it by fair means we will by foul said cox and a few days afterwards the pigeon was gone brian searched for it in vaininquired from all the neighbours if they had seen it and applied but to no purpose to cox he swore that he knew nothing about the matter but this was false for it was he who during the night time had stolen the white pigeon he conveyed it to his employers and they rejoiced that they had gotten it into their possession as they thought it would serve them for a useful messenger nothing can be more shortsighted than cunning the very means which these people took to secure secrecy were the means of bringing their plots to light they endeavoured to teach the pigeon which they had stolen to carry messages for them in a part of the country at some distance from somerville and when they fancied that it had forgotten its former habits and its old master they thought that they might venture to employ him nearer home the pigeon however had a better memory than they imagined they loosed him from a bag near the town of ballynagrish in hopes that he would stop at the house of coxs cousin which was on its road between ballynagrish and somerville but the pigeon though he had been purposely fed at this house for a week before this trial did not stop there but flew on to his old masters house in somerville and pecked at the kitchen window as he had formerly been taught to do his father fortunately was within hearing and poor brian ran with the greatest joy to open the window and to let him in o father heres my white pigeon come back of his own accord exclaimed brian i must run and show him to my mother at this instant the pigeon spread his wings and brian discovered under one of its wings a small and very dirty looking billet he opened it in his fathers presence the scrawl was scarcely legible but these words were at length deciphered thare are eight of uz sworn i send yo at botom thare names we meat at tin this nite at my faders and have harms and all in radiness to brak into the grate ouse mr summervill is to lye out to nitekip the pigeon untill to morrow for ever yours murtagh cox jun scarcely had they finished reading this note than both father and son exclaimed let us go and show it to mr somerville before they set out they had however the prudence to secure the pigeon so that he should not be seen by anyone but themselves mr somerville in consequence of this fortunate discovery took proper measures for the apprehension of the eight men who had sworn to rob his house when they were all safely lodged in the county gaol he sent for brian oneill and his father and after thanking them for the service they had done him he counted out ten bright guineas upon a table and pushed them towards brian saying i suppose you know that a reward of ten guineas was offered some weeks ago for the discovery of john mac dermod one of the eight men whom we have just taken up no sir said brian i did not know it and i did not bring that note to you to get ten guineas but because i thought it was right i dont want to be paid for doing it thats my own boy said his father we thank you sir but well not take the money i dont like to take the price of blood i know the difference my good friends said mr somerville between vile informers and courageous honest men why as to that please your honour though we are poor i hope we are honest and what is more said mr somerville i have a notion that you would continue to be honest even if you were rich will you my good lad continued mr somerville after a moments pausewill you trust me with your pigeon a few days o and welcome sir said the boy with a smile and he brought the pigeon to mr somerville when it was dark and nobody saw him a few days afterwards mr somerville called at oneills house and bid him and his son follow him they followed till he stopped opposite to the bow window of the new inn the carpenter had just put up a sign which was covered over with a bit of carpeting go up the ladder will you said mr somerville to brian and pull that sign straight for it hangs quite crooked there now it is straight now pull off the carpet and let us see the new sign the boy pulled off the cover and saw a white pigeon painted upon the sign and the name of oneill in large letters underneath take care you do not tumble down and break your neck upon this joyful occasion said mr somerville who saw that brians surprise was too great for his situation come down from the ladder and wish your father joy of being master of the new inn called the white pigeon and i wish him joy of having such a son as you are those who bring up their children well will certainly be rewarded for it be they poor or rich the birthday present mamma said rosamond after a long silence do you know what i have been thinking of all this time no my dearwhat why mamma about my cousin bells birthday do you know what day it is no i dont remember dear mother dont you remember its the nd of december and her birthday is the day after to morrow dont you recollect now but you never remember about birthdays mamma that was just what i was thinking of that you never remember my sister lauras birthday ororor mine mamma what do you mean my dear i remember your birthday perfectly well indeed but you never keep it though what do you mean by keeping your birthday oh mamma you know very wellas bells birthday is kept in the first place there is a great dinner and can bell eat more upon her birthday than upon any other day no nor i should not mind about the dinner except the mince pies but bell has a great many nice thingsi dont mean nice eatable things but nice new playthings given to her always on her birthday and everybody drinks her health and shes so happy but stay rosamond how you jumble things together is it everybodys drinking her health that makes her so happy or the new playthings or the nice mince pies i can easily believe that she is happy whilst she is eating a mince pie or whilst she is playing but how does everybodys drinking her health at dinner make her happy rosamond paused and then said she did not know but added she the nice new playthings mother picture the birthday present but why the nice new playthings do you like them only because they are new not onlyi do not like playthings only because they are new but bell does i believefor that puts me in minddo you know mother she had a great drawer full of old playthings that she never used and she said that they were good for nothing because they were old but i thought many of them were good for a great deal more than the new ones now you shall be judge mamma ill tell you all that was in the drawer nay rosamond thank you not just now i have not time to listen to you well then mamma the day after to morrow i can show you the drawer i want you to judge very much because i am sure i was in the right and mother added rosamond stopping her as she was going out of the room will younot now but when youve timewill you tell me why you never keep my birthdaywhy you never make any difference between that day and any other day and will you rosamondnot now but when you have time to think about ittell me why i should make any difference between your birthday and any other day rosamond thought but she could not find out any reason besides she suddenly recollected that she had not time to think any longer for there was a certain work basket to be finished which she was making for her cousin bell as a present upon her birthday the work was at a stand for want of some filigree paper and as her mother was going out she asked her to take her with her that she might buy some her sister laura went with them sister said rosamond as they were walking along what have you done with your half guinea i have it in my pocket dear you will keep it for ever in your pocket you know my godmother when she gave it to you said you would keep it longer than i should keep mine and i know what she thought by her look at the time i heard her say something to my mother yes said laura smiling she whispered so loud that i could not help hearing her too she said i was a little miser but did not you hear her say that i was very generous and shell see that she was not mistaken i hope shell be by when i give my basket to bellwont it be beautiful there is to be a wreath of myrtle you know round the handle and a frost ground and then the medallions stay interrupted her sister for rosamond anticipating the glories of her work basket talked and walked so fast that she had passed without perceiving it the shop where the filigree paper was to be bought they turned back now it happened that the shop was the corner house of a street and one of the windows looked out into a narrow lane a coach full of ladies stopped at the door just before they went in so that no one had time immediately to think of rosamond and her filigree paper and she went to the window where she saw her sister laura looking earnestly at something that was passing in the lane opposite to the window at the door of a poor looking house there was sitting a little girl weaving lace her bobbins moved as quick as lightning and she never once looked up from her work is not she very industrious said laura and very honest too added she in a minute afterwards for just then a baker with a basket of rolls on his head passed and by accident one of the rolls fell close to the little girl she took it up eagerly looked at it as if she was very hungry then put aside her work and ran after the baker to return it to him whilst she was gone a footman in a livery laced with silver who belonged to the coach that stood at the shop door as he was lounging with one of his companions chanced to spy the weaving pillow which she had left upon a stone before the door to divert himself for idle people do mischief often to divert themselves he took up the pillow and entangled all the bobbins the little girl came back out of breath to her work but what was her surprise and sorrow to find it spoiled she twisted and untwisted placed and replaced the bobbins while the footman stood laughing at her distress she got up gently and was retiring into the house when the silver laced footman stopped her saying insolently sit still child i must go to my mother sir said the child besides you have spoiled all my lace i cant stay cant you said the brutal footman snatching her weaving pillow again ill teach you to complain of me and he broke off one after another all the bobbins put them into his pocket rolled her weaving pillow down the dirty lane then jumped up behind his mistress coach and was out of sight in an instant poor girl exclaimed rosamond no longer able to restrain her indignation at this injustice poor little girl at this instant her mother said to rosamondcome now my dear if you want this filigree paper buy it yes madam said rosamond and the idea of what her godmother and her cousin bell would think of her generosity rushed again upon her imagination all her feelings of pity were immediately suppressed satisfied with bestowing another exclamation upon the poor little girl she went to spend her half guinea upon her filigree basket in the meantime she that was called the little miser beckoned to the poor girl and opening the window said pointing to the cushion is it quite spoiled quite quite spoiled and i cant nor mother neither buy another and i cant do anything else for my bread a few but very few tears fell as she said this how much would another cost said laura oh a greatgreat deal more than that said laura holding up her half guinea oh no then you can buy another with that said laura dropping the half guinea into her hand and she shut the window before the child could find words to thank her but not before she saw a look of joy and gratitude which gave laura more pleasure probably than all the praise which could have been bestowed upon her generosity late on the morning of her cousins birthday rosamond finished her work basket the carriage was at the doorlaura came running to call her her fathers voice was heard at the same instant so she was obliged to go down with her basket but half wrapped up in silver papera circumstance at which she was a good deal disconcerted for the pleasure of surprising bell would be utterly lost if one bit of the filigree should peep out before the proper time as the carriage went on rosamond pulled the paper to one side and to the other and by each of the four corners it will never do my dear said her father who had been watching her operations i am afraid you will never make a sheet of paper cover a box which is twice as large as itself it is not a box father said rosamond a little peevishly its a basket let us look at this basket said he taking it out of her unwilling hands for she knew of what frail materials it was made and she dreaded its coming to pieces under her fathers examination he took hold of the handle rather roughly when starting off the coach seat she cried oh sir father sir you will spoil it indeed said she with increased vehemence when after drawing aside the veil of silver paper she saw him grasp the myrtle wreathed handle indeed sir you will spoil the poor handle but what is the use of the poor handle said her father if we are not to take hold of it and pray continued he turning the basket round with his finger and thumb rather in a disrespectful manner pray is this the thing you have been about all this week i have seen you all this week dabbling with paste and rags i could not conceive what you were about is this the thing yes sir you think then that i have wasted my time because the basket is of no use but then it is a present for my cousin bell your cousin bell will be very much obliged to you for a present that is of no use you had better have given her the purple jar oh father i thought you had forgotten thatit was two years ago im not so silly now but bell will like the basket i know though it is of no use then you think bell is sillier now than you were two years agowell perhaps that is true but how comes it rosamond now that you are so wise that you are fond of such a silly person i father said rosamond hesitating i dont think i am very fond of her i did not say very fond well but i dont think i am at all fond of her but you have spent a whole week in making this thing for her yes and all my half guinea besides yet you think her silly and you are not fond of her at all and you say you know this thing will be of no use to her but it is her birthday sir and i am sure she will expect something and everybody else will give her something then your reason for giving is because she expects you to give her something and will you or can you or should you always give merely because others expect or because somebody else gives alwaysno not always oh only on birthdays rosamond laughing now you are making a joke of me papa i see but i thought you liked that people should be generousmy godmother said that she did so do i full as well as your godmother but we have not yet quite settled what it is to be generous why is it not generous to make presents said rosamond that is the question which it would take up a great deal of time to answer but for instance to make a present of a thing that you know can be of no use to a person you neither love nor esteem because it is her birthday and because everybody gives her something and because she expects something and because your godmother says she likes that people should be generous seems to me my dear rosamond to be since i must say it rather more like folly than generosity rosamond looked down upon the basket and was silent then i am a fool am i said she looking up at last because you have made one mistake no if you have sense enough to see your own mistakes and can afterwards avoid them you will never be a fool here the carriage stopped and rosamond recollected that the basket was uncovered now we must observe that rosamonds father had not been too severe upon bell when he called her a silly girl from her infancy she had been humoured and at eight years old she had the misfortune to be a spoiled child she was idle fretful and selfish so that nothing could make her happy on her birthday she expected however to be perfectly happy everybody in the house tried to please her and they succeeded so well that between breakfast and dinner she had only six fits of crying the cause of five of these fits no one could discover but the last and most lamentable was occasioned by a disappointment about a worked muslin frock and accordingly at dressing time her maid brought it to her exclaiming see here miss what your mamma has sent you on your birthday heres a frock fit for a queenif it had but lace round the cuffs and why has not it lace around the cuffs mamma said it should yes but mistress was disappointed about the lace it is not come home not come home indeed and didnt they know it was my birthday but then i say i wont wear it without the lacei cant wear it without the lace and i wont the lace however could not be had and bell at length submitted to let the frock be put on come miss bell dry your eyes said the maid who educated her dry your eyes and ill tell you something that will please you what then said the child pouting and sobbing whybut you must not tell that i told you nobut if i am asked why if you are asked you must tell the truth to be sure so ill hold my tongue miss nay tell me though and ill never tellif i am asked well then said the maid your cousin rosamond is come and has brought you the most beautifullest thing you ever saw in your life but you are not to know anything about it till after dinner because she wants to surprise you and mistress has put it into her wardrobe till after dinner till after dinner repeated bell impatiently i cant wait till then i must see it this minute the maid refused her several times till bell burst into another fit of crying and the maid fearing that her mistress would be angry with her if bells eyes were red at dinner time consented to show her the basket how prettybut let me have it in my own hands said bell as the maid held the basket up out of her reach oh no you must not touch it for if you should spoil it what would become of me become of you indeed exclaimed the spoiled child who never considered anything but her own immediate gratificationbecome of you indeed what signifies thati shant spoil it and i will have it in my own hands if you dont hold it down for me directly ill tell that you showed it to me then you wont snatch it no no i wont indeed said bell but she had learned from her maid a total disregard of truth she snatched the basket the moment it was within her reach a struggle ensued in which the handle and lid were torn off and one of the medallions crushed inwards before the little fury returned to her senses calmed at this sight the next question was how she should conceal the mischief which she had done after many attempts the handle and lid were replaced the basket was put exactly in the same spot in which it had stood before and the maid charged the child to look as if nothing was the matter we hope that both children and parents will here pause for a moment to reflect the habits of tyranny meanness and falsehood which children acquire from living with bad servants are scarcely ever conquered in the whole course of their future lives after shutting up the basket they left the room and in the adjoining passage they found a poor girl waiting with a small parcel in her hand whats your business said the maid i have brought home the lace madam that was bespoke for the young lady oh you have have you at last said bell and pray why didnt you bring it sooner the girl was going to answer but the maid interrupted her sayingcome come none of your excuses you are a little idle good for nothing thing to disappoint miss bell upon her birthday but now you have brought it let us look at it the little girl gave the lace without reply and the maid desired her to go about her business and not to expect to be paid for that her mistress could not see anybody because she was in a room full of company may i call again madam this afternoon said the child timidly lord bless my stars replied the maid what makes people so poor i wonders i wish mistress would buy her lace at the warehouse as i told her and not of these folks call again yes to be sure i believe youd call call call twenty times for twopence however ungraciously the permission to call again was granted it was received with gratitude the little girl departed with a cheerful countenance and bell teazed her maid till she got her to sew the long wished for lace upon her cuffs unfortunate bellall dinner time passed and people were so hungry so busy or so stupid that not an eye observed her favourite piece of finery till at length she was no longer able to conceal her impatience and turning to laura who sat next to her she said you have no lace upon your cuffs look how beautiful mine isis not it dont you wish your mamma could afford to give some like it but you cant get any if she would for this was made on purpose for me on my birthday and nobody can get a bit more anywhere if they would give the world for it but cannot the person who made it said laura make any more like it no no no cried bell for she had already learned either from her maid or her mother the mean pride which values things not for being really pretty or useful but for being such as nobody else can procure nobody can get any like it i say repeated bell nobody in all london can make it but one person and that person will never make a bit for anybody but me i am sure mamma wont let her if i ask her not very well said laura coolly i do not want any of it you need not be so violent i assure you that i dont want any of it yes but you do though said bell more angrily no indeed said laura smiling you do in the bottom of your heart but you say you dont to plague me i know cried bell swelling with disappointed vanity it is pretty for all that and it cost a great deal of money too and nobody shall have any like it if they cried their eyes out laura received this declaration in silencerosamond smiled and at her smile the ill suppressed rage of the spoiled child burst forth into the seventh and loudest fit of crying which had yet been heard on her birthday whats the matter my pet cried her mother come to me and tell me whats the matter bell ran roaring to her mother but no otherwise explained the cause of her sorrow than by tearing the fine lace with frantic gestures from her cuffs and throwing the fragments into her mothers lap oh the lace childare you mad said her mother catching hold of both her hands your beautiful lace my dear lovedo you know how much it cost i dont care how much it costit is not beautiful and ill have none of it replied bell sobbing for it is not beautiful but it is beautiful retorted her mother i chose the pattern myself who has put it into your head child to dislike it was it nancy no not nancy but them mamma said bell pointing to laura and rosamond oh fie dont point said her mother putting down her stubborn finger nor say them like nancy i am sure you misunderstood miss laura i am sure did not mean any such thing no madam and i did not say any such thing that i recollect said laura gently oh no indeed cried rosamond warmly rising in her sisters defence no defence or explanation however was to be heard for everybody had now gathered round bell to dry her tears and to comfort her for the mischief she had done to her own cuffs they succeeded so well that in about a quarter of an hour the young ladys eyes and the reddened arches over her eyebrows came to their natural colour and the business being thus happily hushed up the mother as a reward to her daughter for her good humour begged that rosamond would now be so good as to produce her charming present rosamond followed by all the company amongst whom to her great joy was her godmother proceeded to the dressing room now i am sure thought she bell will be surprised and my godmother will see she was right about my generosity the doors of the wardrobe were opened with due ceremony and the filigree basket appeared in all its glory well this is a charming present indeed said the godmother who was one of the company my rosamond knows how to make presents and as she spoke she took hold of the basket to lift it down to the admiring audience scarcely had she touched it when lo the basket fell to the ground and only the handle remained in her hand all eyes were fixed upon the wreck exclamations of sorrow were heard in various tones and who can have done this was all that rosamond could say bell stood in sullen silence which she obstinately preserved in the midst of the inquiries that were made about the disaster at length the servants were summoned and amongst them nancy miss bells maid and governess she affected much surprise when she saw what had befallen the basket and declared that she knew nothing of the matter but that she had seen her mistress in the morning put it quite safe into the wardrobe and that for her part she had never touched it or thought of touching it in her born days nor miss bell neither maami can answer for her for she never knew of its being there because i never so much as mentioned it to her that there was such a thing in the house because i knew miss rosamond wanted to surprise her with the secret so i never mentioned a sentence of itdid i miss bell bell putting on the deceitful look which her maid had taught her answered boldly no but she had hold of rosamonds hand and at the instant she uttered this falsehood she squeezed it terribly why do you squeeze my hand so said rosamond in a low voice what are you afraid of afraid of cried bell turning angrily im not afraid of anythingive nothing to be afraid about nay i did not say you had whispered rosamond but only if you did by accidentyou know what i meani should not be angry if you didonly say so i say i did not cried bell furiously mamma mamma nancy my cousin rosamond wont believe me thats very hard its very rude and i wont bear iti wont dont be angry love dont said the maid nobody suspects you darling said her mother but she has too much sensibility dont cry love nobody suspected you but you know continued she turning to the maid somebody must have done this and i must know how it was done miss rosamonds charming present must not be spoiled in this way in my house without my taking proper notice of it i assure you i am very angry about it rosamond rosamond did not rejoice in her anger and had nearly made a sad mistake by speaking aloud her thoughtsi was very foolish she began and stopped maam cried the maid suddenly ill venture to say i know who did it who said everyone eagerly who said bell trembling why miss dont you recollect that little girl with the lace that we saw peeping about in the passage im sure she must have done it for here she was by herself half an hour or more and not another creature has been in mistress dressing room to my certain knowledge since morning those sort of people have so much curiosity im sure she must have been meddling with it added the maid oh yes thats the thing said the mistress decidedly well miss rosamond for your comfort she shall never come into my house again oh that would not comfort me at all said rosamond besides we are not sure that she did it and if a single knock at the door was heard at this instant it was the little girl who came to be paid for her lace call her in said the lady of the house let us see her directly the maid who was afraid that the girls innocence would appear if she were produced hesitated but upon her mistress repeating her commands she was forced to obey the girl came in with a look of simplicity but when she saw a room full of company she was a little abashed rosamond and laura looked at her and one another with surprise for it was the same little girl whom they had seen weaving lace is not it she whispered rosamond to her sister yes it is but hush said laura she does not know us dont say a word let us hear what she will say laura got behind the rest of the company as she spoke so that the little girl could not see her vastly well said bells mother i am waiting to see how long you will have the assurance to stand there with that innocent look did you ever see that basket before yes maam said the girl yes maam cried the maid and what else do you know about it you had better confess it at once and mistress perhaps will say no more about it yes do confess it added bell earnestly confess what madam said the little girl i never touched the basket madam you never touched it but you confess interrupted bells mother that you did see it before and pray how came you to see it you must have opened my wardrobe no indeed maam said the little girl but i was waiting in the passage maam and this door was partly open and looking at the maid you know i could not help seeing it why how could you see through the doors of my wardrobe rejoined the lady the maid frightened pulled the little girl by the sleeve answer me said the lady where did you see this basket another stronger pull i saw it madam in her hands looking at the maid and well and what became of it afterwards maamhesitatingmiss pulled and by accidenti believe i saw maammiss you know what i saw i do not knowi do not know and if i did you had no business there and mamma wont believe you i am sure everybody else however did believe and their eyes were fixed upon bell in a manner which made her feel rather ashamed what do you all look at me so for why do you all look so and am i to be put to shame on my birthday cried she bursting into a roar of passion and all for this nasty thing added she pushing away the remains of the basket and looking angrily at rosamond bell bell o fie fienow i am ashamed of you thats quite rude to your cousin said her mother who was more shocked at her daughters want of politeness than at her falsehood take her away nancy till she has done crying added she to the maid who accordingly carried off her pupil rosamond during this scene especially at the moment when her present was pushed away with such disdain had been making reflections upon the nature of true generosity a smile from her father who stood by a silent spectator of the catastrophe of the filigree basket gave rise to these reflections nor were they entirely dissipated by the condolence of the rest of the company nor even by the praises of her godmother who for the purpose of condoling with her said well my dear rosamond i admire your generous spirit you know i prophesied that your half guinea would be gone the soonest did i not laura said she appealing in a sarcastic tone to where she thought laura was where is laura i dont see her laura came forward you are too prudent to throw away your money like your sister your half guinea ill answer for it is snug in your pocketis it not no madam answered she in a low voice but low as the voice of laura was the poor little lace girl heard it and now for the first time fixing her eyes upon laura recollected her benefactress oh thats the young lady she exclaimed in a tone of joyful gratitude the good good young lady who gave me the half guinea and would not stay to be thanked for it but i will thank her now the half guinea laura said her godmother what is all this ill tell you madam if you please said the little girl it was not in expectation of being praised for it that laura had been generous and therefore everybody was really touched with the history of the weaving pillow and whilst they praised felt a certain degree of respect which is not always felt by those who pour forth eulogiums respect is not an improper word even applied to a child of lauras age for let the age or situation of the person be what it may they command respect who deserve it ah madam said rosamond to her godmother now you seeyou see she is not a little miser im sure thats better than wasting half a guinea upon a filigree basket is it not maam said she with an eagerness which showed that she had forgotten all her own misfortunes in sympathy with her sister this is being really generous father is it not yes rosamond said her father and he kissed her this is being really generous it is not only by giving away money that we can show generosity it is by giving up to others anything that we like ourselves and therefore added he smiling it is really generous of you to give your sister the thing you like best of all others the thing i like the best of all others father said rosamond half pleased half vexed what is that i wonder you dont mean praise do you sir nay you must decide that yourself rosamond why sir said she ingenuously perhaps it was once the thing i liked best but the pleasure i have just felt makes me like something else much better eton montem extracted from the courier of may yesterday this triennial ceremony took place with which the public are too well acquainted to require a particular description a collection called salt is taken from the public which forms a purse to support the captain of the school in his studies at cambridge this collection is made by the scholars dressed in fancy dresses all round the country at eleven oclock the youths being assembled in their habiliments at the college the royal family set off from the castle to see them and after walking round the courtyard they proceeded to salt hill in the following order his majesty his royal highness the prince of wales and the earl of uxbridge their royal highnesses the dukes of kent and cumberland earl morton and general gwynne all on horseback dressed in the windsor uniform except the prince of wales who wore a suit of dark blue and a brown surtout over then followed the scholars preceded by the marechal serjeant the musicians of the staffordshire band and mr ford captain of the seminary the serjeant major serjeants colonels corporals musicians ensign lieutenant steward salt bearers polemen and runners the cavalcade was brought up by her majesty and her amiable daughters in two carriages and a numerous company of equestrians and pedestrians all eager to behold their sovereign and his family among the former lady lade was foremost in the throng only two others dared venture their persons on horseback in such a multitude the king and royal family were stopped on eton bridge by messrs young and mansfield the salt bearers to whom their majesties delivered their customary donation of fifty guineas each at salt hill his majesty with his usual affability took upon himself to arrange the procession round the royal carriages and even when the horses were taken off with the assistance of the duke of kent fastened the traces round the pole of the coaches to prevent any inconvenience an exceeding heavy shower of rain coming on the prince took leave and went to the windmill inn till it subsided the king and his attendants weathered it out in their great coats after the young gentlemen walked round the carriage ensign vince and the salt bearers proceeded to the summit of the hill but the wind being boisterous he could not exhibit his dexterity in displaying his flag and the space being too small before the carriages from the concourse of spectators the king kindly acquiesced in not having it displayed under such inconvenience their majesties and the princesses then returned home the king occasionally stopping to converse with the dean of windsor the earl of harrington and other noblemen the scholars partook of an elegant dinner at the windmill inn and in the evening walked on windsor terrace their royal highnesses the prince of wales and duke of cumberland after taking leave of their majesties set off for town and honoured the opera house with their presence in the evening the profit arising from the salt collected according to account amounted to pounds the stadtholder the duke of gordon lord and lady melbourne viscount brome and a numerous train of fashionable nobility were present the following is an account of their dresses made as usual very handsomely by mrs snow milliner of windsor mr ford captain with eight gentlemen to attend him as

in the evening all the boys returned in the order of procession and marching round the great square of eton were dismissed the captain then paid his respects to the royal family at the queens lodge windsor previously to his departure for kings college cambridge to defray which expense the produce of the montem was presented to him the day concluded by a brilliant promenade of beauty rank and fashion on windsor terrace enlivened by the performance of several bands of music the origin of the procession is from the custom by which the manor was held the custom of hunting the ram belonged to eton college as well as the custom of salt but it was discontinued by dr cook late dean of ely now this custom we know to have been entered on the register of the royal abbey of bec in normandy as one belonging to the manor of east or great wrotham in norfolk given by ralph de toni to the abbey of bec and was as followswhen the harvest was finished the tenants were to have half an acre of barley and a ram let loose and if they caught him he was their own to make merry with but if he escaped from them he was the lords the etonians in order to secure the ram houghed him in the irish fashion and then attacked him with great clubs the cruelty of this proceeding brought it into disuse and now it exists no longersee register of the royal abbey of bec folio after the dissolution of the alien priories in by the parliament of leicester they remained in the crown till henry vi who gave wrotham manor to eton college and if the eton fellows would search they would perhaps find the manor in their possession that was held by the custom of salt men alderman bursal father of young bursal lord john talbot wheeler bursal rory oryan young gentlemen of eton from to years of age mr newington

nobody would take me to be a landlady landlord very true indeed wifemrs newington i meani ask pardon but now to go on with what we were saying about the unpossibility of letting that old lady and the civil spoken young lady there above have them there rooms for another day landlady now mr newington let me hear no more about that old gentlewoman and that civil spoken young lady fair words cost nothing and ive a notion thats the cause they are so plenty with the young lady neither o them i take it by what theyve ordered since their coming into the house are such grand folk that one need be

wheel mr wheelercaptain wheeler if you please landlord you captain wheeler why i thought in former times it was always the oldest scholar at eton that was captain at the montems and didnt mr talbot

louisa laughing with what an air mrs landlady made her exit mrs talbot when i was young they say i was proud but i am humble enough now these petty mortifications do not vex me louisa it is well my brother was gone before mrs landlady made her entree for if he had heard her rude speech he would at least have given her the retort courteous mrs talb now tell me honestly my louisayou were a few days ago at bursal house since you have left it and have felt something of the difference that is made in this world between splendour and no splendour you have never regretted that you did not stay there and that you did not bear more patiently with miss bursals little airs louisa never for a moment at first miss bursal paid me a vast deal of attention but for what reason i know not she suddenly changed her manner grew first strangely cold then condescendingly familiar and at last downright rude i could not guess the cause of these variations mrs talb aside i guess the cause too well louisa but as i perceived the lady was out of tune i was in haste to leave her i should make a very bad and i am sure a miserable toad eater i had much rather if i were obliged to choose earn my own bread than live as toad eater with anybody mrs talb fine talking dear louisa louisa dont you believe me to be in earnest mother to be sure you cannot know what i would do unless i were put to the trial mrs talb nor you either my dear she sighs and is silent louisa takes her mothers hand what is the matter dear mother you used to say that seeing my brother always made you feel ten years younger yet even while he was here you had in spite of all your efforts to conceal them those sudden fits of sadness mrs talb the montemis not it to morrow ay but my boy is not sure of being captain louisa no there is one wheeler who as he says is most likely to be chosen captain he has taken prodigious pains to flatter and win over many to his interest my brother does not so much care about it he is not avaricious mrs talb i love your generous spirit and his but alas my dear people may live to want and wish for money without being avaricious i would not say a word to talbot full of spirits as he was this morning i would not say a word to him till after the montem of what has happened louisa and what has happened dear mother sit downyou tremble mrs talb sits down and puts a letter into louisas hand

scene iii landladys parlour landladymr finsbury a man milliner with bandboxesa fancy cap or helmet with feathers in the landladys handa satin bag covered with gold netting in the man milliners handa mantle hanging over his arm a rough looking farmer is sitting with his back towards them eating bread and cheese and reading a newspaper landlady well this to be sure will be the best dressed montem that ever was seen at eton and you lonon gentlemen have the most fashionablest notions and this is the most elegantest fancy cap finsbury why as you observe mam that is the most elegant fancy cap of them all that is mr hector hogmortons fancy cap mam and here mam is mr sauls rich satin bag covered with gold net he is college salt bearer i understand and has a prodigious superb white and gold dress but in my humble opinion mam the marshals white and purple and orange fancy dress trimmed with silver will bear the bell though indeed i shouldnt say thatfor the colonels and lieutenants and ensigns are beautiful in the extreme and to be sure nothing could be better imagined than mr marlboroughs lilac and silver with a roman cap and it must be allowed that nothing in nature can have a better effect than mr drakes flesh colour and blue with this spanish hat mam you see the farmer looks over his shoulder from time to time during this speech with contempt farmer reads the newspaper french fleet at seahum landlady o gemini mr drakes spanish hat is the sweetest tastiest thing mr finsbury i protest finsb why mam i knew a lady of your taste couldnt but approve of it my own invention entirely mam but its nothing to the captains cap mam indeed mam mr wheeler the captain that is to be has the prettiest taste in dress to be sure his sandals were my suggestion but the mantle he has the entire credit of to do him justice and when you see it mam you will be really surprised for for contrast and elegance and richness and lightness and propriety and effect and costume youve never yet seen anything at all to be compared to captain wheelers mantle mam farmer to the landlady why now pray mrs landlady how long may it have been the fashion for milliners to go about in mens clothes landlady aside to farmer lord mr hearty hush this is mr finsbury the great man milliner farm the great man milliner this is a sight i never thought to see in old england finsb packing up band boxes well mam im glad i have your approbation it has ever been my study to please the ladies farm throws a fancy mantle over his frieze coat and is this the way to please the ladies mrs landlady nowadays finsb taking off the mantle sir with your leavei ask pardonbut the least thing detriments these tender colours and as you have just been eating cheese with your hands farm tis my way to eat cheese with my mouth man finsb man farm i ask pardonman milliner i mean enter landlord landlord why wife landlady wife landlord i ask pardonmrs newington i mean do you know who them ladies are that you have been and turned out of the dolphin landlady alarmed not i indeed who are they pray why if they are quality its no fault of mine it is their own fault for coming like scrubs without four horses why if quality will travel the road this way incognito how can they expect to be known and treated as quality tis no fault of mine why didnt you find out sooner who they were mr newington what else in the versal world have you to do but to go basking about in the yards and places with your tankard in your hand from morning till night what have you else to ruminate all day long but to find out whos who i say farm clapper clapper clapper like my mill in a high wind landlord clapper clapper clapperenough to stun a body landlord that is not used to it but use is all they say landlady will you answer me mr newington who are the grandees that were in the dolphinand whats become on them landlord grandees was your own word wife they be not to call grandees but i reckon youd be sorry not to treat em civil when i tell you their name is talbot mother and sister to our young talbot of eton he that paid me so handsome for the hunter this very morning landlady mercy is that all what a combustion for nothing in life finsb for nothing in life as you say mam that is nothing in high life im sure mam nay i dare amost venture to swear would you believe it mr talbot is one of the few young gentlemen of eton that has not bespoke from me a fancy dress for this grand montem landlady there mr newington theres your talbot for you and theres your grandees o trust me i know your scrubs at first sight landlord scrubs i dont nor cant nor wont call them that pay their debts honestly scrubs i dont nor wont nor cant call them that behave as handsome as young mr talbot did here to me this morning about the hunter a scrub he is not wife fancy dress or no fancy dress mr finsbury this young gentleman is no scrub finsb dear me twas not i said scrub did i say scrub farm no matter if you did finsb no matter certainly and yet it is a matter for im confident i wouldnt for the world leave it in anyones power to say that i saidthat i calledany young gentleman of eton a scrub why you know sir it might breed a riot farm and a pretty figure youd make in a riot landlady pray let me hear nothing about riots in my house farm nor about scrubs finsb but i beg leave to explain gentlemen all i ventured to remark or suggest was that as there was some talk of mr talbots being captain to morrow i didnt conceive how he could well appear without any dress that was all upon my word and honour a good morning to you gentlemen it is time for me to be off mrs newington you were so obliging as to promise to accommodate me with a return chaise as far as eton finsbury bows and exit farm a good day to you and

hinder you from going farther astray and set your heart at ease like talb thanks good farmer you have set my heart at ease indeed but the truth is they did frighten me confoundedlymore fool i farm no fool at all to my notion i should at your age ay or at my age just the self same way have been frightened myself if so be that mention had been made to me that way of my own mothers having broke her leg or so and greater by a great deal the shame for them that frighted you than for you to be frighted how young gentlemen now can bring themselves for to tell such lies is to me now a matter of amazement like that i cant noways get over talb oh farmer such lies are very witty though you and i dont just now like the wit of them this is fun this is quizzing but you dont know what we young gentlemen mean by quizzing farm ay but i do though to my cost ever since last year look you now at yon fine field of wheat well it was just as fine and finer last year till a young eton jackanapes

very thick of my corn but he got a fall leaping the ditch out yonder which pacified me like at the minute so i goes up to see whether he was killed but he was not a whit the worse for his tumble so i should ha fell into a passion with him then to be sure about my corn but his horse had got such a terrible sprain i couldnt say anything to him for i was a pitying the poor animal as fine a hunter as ever you saw i am sartain sure he could never come to good after talb aside i do think from the description that this was wheeler and i have paid for the horse which he spoiled aloud should you know either the man or the horse again if you were to see them farm ay that i should to my dying day talb will you come with me then and youll do me some guineas worth of service farm ay that i will with a deal of pleasure for you be a civil spoken young gentleman and besides i dont think the worse on you for being frighted a little about your mother being what i might ha been at your age myself for i

out of his own head one self approving hour whole years outweighs of stupid starers and of loud huzzas curtain falls forgive and forget in the neighbourhood of a seaport town in the west of england there lived a gardener who had one son called maurice to whom he was very partial one day his father sent him to the neighbouring town to purchase some garden seeds for him when maurice got to the seed shop it was full of people who were all impatient to be served first a great tall man and next a great fat woman pushed before him and he stood quietly beside the counter waiting till somebody should be at leisure to attend to him at length when all the other people who were in the shop had got what they wanted the shopman turned to mauriceand what do you want my patient little fellow said he i want all these seeds for my father said maurice putting a list of seeds into the shopmans hand and i have brought money to pay for them all the seedsman looked out all the seeds that maurice wanted and packed them up in paper he was folding up some painted lady peas when from a door at the back of the shop there came in a square rough faced man who exclaimed the moment he came in are the seeds i ordered readythe winds fairthey ought to have been aboard yesterday and my china jar is it packed up and directed where is it it is up there on the shelf over your head sir answered the seedsman it is very safe you see but we have not had time to pack it yet it shall be done to day and we will get the seeds ready for you sir immediately immediately then stir about it the seeds will not pack themselves up make haste pray immediately sir as soon as i have done up the parcel for this little boy what signifies the parcel for this little boy he can wait and i cannotwind and tide wait for no man here my good lad take your parcel and sheer off said the impatient man and as he spoke he took up the parcel of seeds from the counter as the shopman stooped to look for a sheet of thick brown paper and packthread to tie it up the parcel was but loosely folded up and as the impatient man lifted it the weight of the peas which were withinside of it burst the paper and all the seeds fell out upon the floor whilst maurice in vain held his hands to catch them the peas rolled to all parts of the shop the impatient man swore at them but maurice without being out of humour set about collecting them as fast as possible whilst the boy was busied in this manner the man got what seeds he wanted and as he was talking about them a sailor came into the shop and said captain the wind has changed within these five minutes and it looks as if we should have ugly weather well im glad of it replied the rough faced man who was the captain of a ship i am glad to have a day longer to stay ashore and ive business enough on my hands the captain pushed forward towards the shop door maurice who was kneeling on the floor picking up his seeds saw that the captains foot was entangled in some packthread which hung down from the shelf on which the china jar stood maurice saw that if the captain took one more step forward he must pull the string so that it would throw down the jar round the bottom of which the packthread was entangled he immediately caught hold of the captains leg and stopped him stay stand still sir said he or you will break your china jar the man stood still looked and saw how the packthread had caught in his shoe buckle and how it was near dragging down his beautiful china jar i am really very much obliged to you my little fellow said he you have saved my jar which i would not have broken for ten guineas for it is for my wife and ive brought it safe from abroad many a league it would have been a pity if i had broken it just when it was safe landed i am really much obliged to you my little fellow this was returning good for evil i am sorry i threw down your seeds as you are such a good natured forgiving boy be so kind continued he turning to the shopman as to reach down that china jar for me the shopman lifted down the jar very carefully and the captain took off the cover and pulled out some tulip roots you seem by the quantity of seeds you have got to belong to a gardener are you fond of gardening said he to maurice yes sir replied maurice very fond of it for my father is a gardener and he lets me help him at his work and he has given me a little garden of my own then here are a couple of tulip roots for you and if you take care of them ill promise you that you will have the finest tulips in england in your little garden these tulips were given to me by a dutch merchant who told me that they were some of the rarest and finest in holland they will prosper with you im sure wind and weather permitting maurice thanked the gentleman and returned home eager to show his precious tulip roots to his father and to a companion of his the son of a nurseryman who lived near him arthur was the name of the nurserymans son the first thing maurice did after showing his tulip roots to his father was to run to arthurs garden in search of him their gardens were separated only by a low wall of loose stones arthur arthur where are you are you in your garden i want you but arthur made no answer and did not as usual come running to meet his friend i know where you are continued maurice and im coming to you as fast as the raspberry bushes will let me i have good news for yousomething youll be delighted to see arthurhabut here is something that i am not delighted to see i am sure said poor maurice who when he had got through the raspberry bushes and had come in sight of his own garden beheld his bell glasshis beloved bell glass under which his cucumbers were grown so finelyhis only bell glass broken to pieces i am sorry for it said arthur who stood leaning upon his spade in his own garden i am afraid you will be very angry with me why was it you arthur broke my bell glass oh how could you do so i was throwing weeds and rubbish over the wall and by accident a great lump of couch grass with stones hanging to the roots fell upon your bell glass and broke it as you see maurice lifted up the lump of couch grass which had fallen through the broken glass upon his cucumbers and he looked at his cucumbers for a moment in silenceoh my poor cucumbers you must all die now i shall see all your yellow flowers withered to morrow but it is done and it cannot be helped so arthur let us say no more about it you are very good i thought you would have been angry i am sure i should have been exceedingly angry if you had broken the glass if it had been mine oh forgive and forget as my father always says thats the best way look what i have got for you then he told arthur the story of the captain of the ship and the china jar the seeds having been thrown down and of the fine tulip roots which had been given to him and maurice concluded by offering one of the precious roots to arthur who thanked him with great joy and repeatedly said how good you were not to be angry with me for breaking your bell glass i am much more sorry for it than if you had been in a passion with me arthur now went to plant his tulip root and maurice looked at the beds which his companion had been digging and at all the things which were coming up in his garden i dont know how it is said arthur but you always seem as glad to see the things in my garden coming up and doing well as if they were all your own i am much happier since my father came to live here and since you and i have been allowed to work and to play together than i ever was before for you must know before we came to live here i had a cousin in the house with me who used to plague me he was not nearly so good natured as you are he never took pleasure in looking at my garden or at anything that i did that was well done and he never gave me a share of anything that he had and so i did not like him how could i but i believe that hating people makes us unhappy for i know i never was happy when i was quarrelling with him and i am always happy with you maurice you know we never quarrel it would be well for all the world if they could be convinced like arthur that to live in friendship is better than to quarrel it would be well for all the world if they followed maurices maxim of forgive and forget when they receive or when they imagine that they receive an injury arthurs father mr oakly the nurseryman was apt to take offence at trifles and when he thought that any of his neighbours disobliged him he was too proud to ask them to explain their conduct therefore he was often mistaken in his judgment of them he thought that it showed spirit to remember and to resent an injury and therefore though he was not an ill natured man he was sometimes led by this mistaken idea of spirit to do ill natured things a warm friend and a bitter enemy was one of his maxims and he had many more enemies than friends he was not very rich but he was proud and his favourite proverb was better live in spite than in pity when first he settled near mr grant the gardener he felt inclined to dislike him because he was told that mr grant was a scotchman and he had a prejudice against scotchmen all of whom he believed to be cunning and avaricious because he had once been over reached by a scotch peddler grants friendly manners in some degree conquered this prepossession but still he secretly suspected that this civility as he said was all show and that he was not nor could not being a scotchman be such a hearty friend as a true born englishman grant had some remarkably fine raspberries the fruit was so large as to be quite a curiosity when it was in season many strangers came from the neighbouring town which was a sea bathing place to look at these raspberries which obtained the name of brobdingnag raspberries how came you pray neighbour grant if a man may ask by these wonderful fine raspberries said mr oakly one evening to the gardener thats a secret replied grant with an arch smile oh in case its a secret ive no more to say for i never meddle with any mans secrets that he does not choose to trust me with but i wish neighbour grant you would put down that book you are always poring over some book or another when a man comes to see you which is not according to my notions being a plain unlarned englishman bred and born so civil and neighbourly as might be mr grant hastily shut his book but remarked with a shrewd glance at his son that it was in that book he found his brobdingnag raspberries you are pleased to be pleasant upon them that have not the luck to be as book larned as yourself mr grant but i take it being only a plain spoken englishman as i observed afore that one is to the full as like to find a raspberry in ones garden as in ones book mr grant grant observing that his neighbour spoke rather in a surly tone did not contradict him being well versed in the bible he knew that a soft word turneth away wrath and he answered in a good humoured voice i hear neighbour oakly you are likely to make a great deal of money of your nursery this year heres to the health of you and yours not forgetting the seedling larches which i see are coming on finely thank ye neighbour kindly the larches are coming on tolerably well thats certain and heres to your good health mr grantyou and yours not forgetting your what dye call em raspberriesdrinksand after a pause resumes im not apt to be a beggar neighbour but if you could give me here mr oakly was interrupted by the entrance of some strangers and he did finish making his requestmr oakly was not as he said of himself apt to ask favours and nothing but grants cordiality could have conquered his prejudices so far as to tempt him to ask a favour from a scotchman he was going to have asked for some of the brobdingnag raspberry plants the next day the thought of the raspberry plants recurred to his memory but being a bashful man he did not like to go himself on purpose to make his request and he desired his wife who was just setting out to market to call at grants gate and if he was at work in his garden to ask him for a few plants of his raspberries the answer which oaklys wife brought to him was that mr grant had not a raspberry plant in the world to give him and that if he had ever so many he would not give one away except to his own son oakly flew into a passion when he received such a message declared it was just such a mean shabby trick as might have been expected from a scotchmancalled himself a booby a dupe and a blockhead for ever having trusted to the civil speeches of a scotchmanswore that he would die in the parish workhouse before he would ever ask another favour be it ever so small from a scotchman related to his wife for the hundredth time the way in which he had been taken in by the scotch peddler ten years ago and concluded by forswearing all further intercourse with mr grant and all belonging to him son arthur said he addressing himself to the boy who just then came in from workson arthur do you hear me let me never again see you with grants son with maurice father with maurice grant i say i forbid you from this day and hour forward to have anything to do with him oh why dear father ask no questions but do as i bid you arthur burst out a crying and only said yes father ill do as you bid me to be sure why now what does the boy cry for is there no other boy simpleton think you to play with but this scotchmans son ill find out another play fellow for ye child if that be all thats not all father said arthur trying to stop himself from sobbing but the thing is i shall never have such another play fellowi shall never have such another friend as maurice grant like father like sonyou may think yourself well off to have done with him done with him oh father and shall i never go again to work in his garden and may not he come to mine no replied oakly sturdily his father has used me uncivil and no man shall use me uncivil twice i say no wife sweep up this hearth boy dont take on like a fool but eat thy bacon and greens and lets hear no more of maurice grant arthur promised to obey his father he only begged that he might once more speak to maurice and tell him that it was by his fathers orders he acted this request was granted but when arthur further begged to know what reason he might give for this separation his father refused to tell his reasons the two friends took leave of one another very sorrowfully mr grant when he heard of all this endeavoured to discover what could have offended his neighbour but all explanation was prevented by the obstinate silence of oakly now the message which grant really sent about the brobdingnag raspberries was somewhat different from that which mr oakly received the message was that the raspberries were not mr grants that therefore he had no right to give them away that they belonged to his son maurice and that this was not the right time of year for planting them this message had been unluckily misunderstood grant gave his answer to his wife she to a welsh servant girl who did not perfectly comprehend her mistress broad scotch and she in her turn could not make herself intelligible to mrs oakly who hated the welsh accent and whose attention when the servant girl delivered the message was principally engrossed by the management of her own horse the horse on which mrs oakly rode this day being ill broken would not stand still quietly at the gate and she was extremely impatient to receive her answer and to ride on to market oakly when he had once resolved to dislike his neighbour grant could not long remain without finding out fresh causes of complaint there was in grants garden a plum tree which was planted close to the loose stone wall that divided the garden from the nursery the soil in which the plum tree was planted happened not to be quite so good as that which was on the opposite side of the wall and the plum tree had forced its way through the wall and gradually had taken possession of the ground which it liked best oakly thought the plum tree as it belonged to mr grant had no right to make its appearance on his ground an attorney told him that he might oblige grant to cut it down but mr grant refused to cut down his plum tree at the attorneys desire and the attorney persuaded oakly to go to law about the business and the lawsuit went on for some months the attorney at the end of this time came to oakly with a demand for money to carry on his suit assuring him that in a short time it would be determined in his favour oakly paid his attorney ten golden guineas remarked that it was a great sum for him to pay and that nothing but the love of justice could make him persevere in this lawsuit about a bit of ground which after all said he is not worth twopence the plum tree does me little or no damage but i dont like to be imposed upon by a scotchman the attorney saw and took advantage of oaklys prejudice against the natives of scotland and he persuaded him that to show the spirit of a true born englishman it was necessary whatever it might cost him to persist in this law suit it was soon after this conversation with the attorney that mr oakly walked with resolute steps towards the plum tree saying to himself if it cost me a hundred pounds i will not let this cunning scotchman get the better of me arthur interrupted his fathers reverie by pointing to a book and some young plants which lay upon the wall i fancy father said he those things are for you for there is a little note directed to you in maurices handwriting shall i bring it to you yes let me read it child since i must it contained these words dear mr oaklyi dont know why you have quarrelled with us i am very sorry for it but though you are angry with me i am not angry with you i hope you will not refuse some of my brobdingnag raspberry plants which you asked for a great while ago when we were all good friends it was not the right time of the year to plant them which was the reason they were not sent to you but it is just the right time to plant them now and i send you the book in which you will find the reason why we always put seaweed ashes about their roots and i have got some seaweed ashes for you you will find the ashes in the flower pot upon the wall i have never spoken to arthur nor he to me since you bid us not so wishing your brobdingnag raspberries may turn out as well as ours and longing to be all friends again i am with love to dear arthur and self your affectionate neighbours son maurice grant psit is now about four months since the quarrel began and that is a very long while a great part of the effect of this letter was lost upon oakly because he was not very expert in reading writing and it cost him much trouble to spell it and put it together however he seemed affected by it and said i believe this maurice loves you well enough arthur and he seems a good sort of boy but as to the raspberries i believe all that he says about them is but an excuse and at anyrate as i could not get em when i asked for them ill not have em now do you hear me i say arthur what are you reading there arthur was reading the page that was doubled down in the book which maurice had left along with the raspberry plants upon the wall arthur read aloud as follows monthly magazine dec p there is a sort of strawberry cultivated at jersey which is almost covered with seaweed in the winter in like manner as many plants in england are with litter from the stable these strawberries are usually of the largeness of a middle sized apricot and the flavour is particularly grateful in jersey and guernsey situate scarcely one degree farther south than cornwall all kinds of fruit pulse and vegetables are produced in their seasons a fortnight or three weeks sooner than in england even on the southern shores and snow will scarcely remain twenty four hours on the earth although this may be attributed to these islands being surrounded with a salt and consequently a moist atmosphere yet the ashes seaweed ashes made use of as manure may also have their portion of influence and here continued arthur is something written with a pencil on a slip of paper and it is maurices writing i will read it to you when i read in this book what is said about the strawberries growing as large as apricots after they had been covered over with seaweed i thought that perhaps seaweed ashes might be good for my fathers raspberries and i asked him if he would give me leave to try them he gave me leave and i went directly and gathered together some seaweed that had been cast on shore and i dried it and burned it and then i manured the raspberries with it and the year afterwards the raspberries grew to the size that you have seen now the reason i tell you this is first that you may know how to manage your raspberries and next because i remember you looked very grave as if you were not pleased with my father mr grant when he told you that the way by which he came by his brobdingnag raspberries was a secret perhaps this was the thing that has made you so angry with us all for you never have come to see father since that evening now i have told you all i know and so i hope you will not be angry with us any longer mr oakly was much pleased by this openness and said why now arthur this is something like this is telling one the thing one wants to know without fine speeches this is like an englishman more than a scotchman pray arthur do you know whether your friend maurice was born in england or in scotland no indeed sir i dont knowi never askedi did not think it signified all i know is that wherever he was born he is very good look papa my tulip is blowing upon my word said his father this will be a beautiful tulip it was given to me by maurice and did you give him nothing for it was the fathers inquiry nothing in the world and he gave it to me just at the time when he had good cause to be angry with me just when i had broken his bell glass i have a great mind to let you play together again said arthurs father oh if you would cried arthur clapping his hands how happy we should be do you know father i have often sat for an hour at a time up in that crab tree looking at maurice at work in his garden and wishing that i was at work with him here arthur was interrupted by the attorney who came to ask mr oakly some question about the lawsuit concerning the plum tree oakly showed him maurices letter and to arthurs extreme astonishment the attorney had no sooner read it than he exclaimed what an artful little gentleman this is i never in the course of all my practice met with anything better why this is the most cunning letter i ever read wheres the cunning said oakly and he put on his spectacles my good sir dont you see that all this stuff about brobdingnag raspberries is to ward off your suit about the plum tree they knowthat is mr grant who is sharp enough knowsthat he will be worsted in that suit that he must in short pay you a good round sum for damages if it goes on damages said oakly staring round him at the plum tree but i dont know what you mean i mean nothing but whats honest i dont mean to ask for any good round sum for the plum tree has done me no great harm by coming into my garden but only i dont choose it should come there without my leave well well said the attorney i understand all that but what i want to make you mr oakly understand is that this grant and his son only want to make up matters with you and prevent the things coming to a fair trial by sending on in this underhand sort of way a bribe of a few raspberries a bribe exclaimed oakly i never took a bribe and i never will and with sudden indignation he pulled the raspberry plants from the ground in which arthur was planting them and he threw them over the wall into grants garden maurice had put his tulip which was beginning to blow in a flower pot on the top of the wall in hopes that his friend arthur would see it from day to day alas he knew not in what a dangerous situation he had placed it one of his own brobdingnag raspberry plants swung by the angry arm of oakly struck off the head of his precious tulip arthur who was full of the thought of convincing his father that the attorney was mistaken in his judgment of poor maurice did not observe the fall of the tulip the next day when maurice saw his raspberry plants scattered upon the ground and his favourite tulip broken he was in much astonishment and for some moments angry but anger with him never lasted long he was convinced that all this must be owing to some accident or mistake he could not believe that anyone could be so malicious as to injure him on purposeand even if they did all this on purpose to vex me said he to himself the best thing i can do is not to let it vex me forgive and forget this temper of mind maurice was more happy in enjoying than he could have been made without it by the possession of all the tulips in holland tulips were at this time things of great consequence in the estimation of the country several miles round where maurice and arthur lived there was a florists feast to be held at the neighbouring town at which a prize of a handsome set of gardening tools was to be given to the person who could produce the finest flower of its kind a tulip was the flower which was thought the finest the preceding year and consequently numbers of people afterwards endeavoured to procure tulip roots in hopes of obtaining the prize this year arthurs tulip was beautiful as he examined it from day to day and every day thought it improving he longed to thank his friend maurice for it and he often mounted into his crab tree to look into maurices garden in hopes of seeing his tulip also in full bloom and beauty he never could see it the day of the florists feast arrived and oakly went with his son and the fine tulip to the place of meeting it was on a spacious bowling green all the flowers of various sorts were ranged upon a terrace at the upper end of the bowling green and amongst all this gay variety the tulip which maurice had given to arthur appeared conspicuously beautiful to the owner of this tulip the prize was adjudged and as the handsome garden tools were delivered to arthur he heard a well known voice wish him joy he turned looked about him and saw his friend maurice but maurice where is your own tulip said mr oakly i thought arthur you told me that he kept one for himself so i did said maurice but somebody i suppose by accident broke it somebody who cried arthur and mr oakly at once somebody who threw the raspberry plants back again over the wall replied maurice that was methat somebody was me said oakly i scorn to deny it but i did not intend to break your tulip maurice dear maurice said arthuryou know i may call him dear mauricenow you are by papa here are all the garden tools take them and welcome not one of them said maurice drawing back offer them to the fatheroffer them to mr grant whispered oakly hell take them ill answer for it mr oakly was mistaken the father would not accept of the tools mr oakly stood surprisedcertainly said he to himself this cannot be such a miser as i took him for and he walked immediately up to grant and bluntly said to him mr grant your son has behaved very handsomely to my son and you seem to be glad of it to be sure i am said grant which continued oakly gives me a better opinion of you than ever i had beforei mean than ever i had since the day you sent me the shabby answer about those foolish what dye call em cursed raspberries what shabby answer said grant with surprise and oakly repeated exactly the message which he received and grant declared that he never sent any such message he repeated exactly the answer which he really sent and oakly immediately stretched out his hand to him saying i believe you no more need be said im only sorry i did not ask you about this four months ago and so i should have done if you had not been a scotchman till now i never rightly liked a scotchman we may thank this good little fellow continued he turning to maurice for our coming at last to a right understanding there was no holding out against his good nature im sure from the bottom of my heart im sorry i broke his tulip shake hands boys im glad to see you arthur look so happy again and hope mr grant will forgive oh forgive and forget said grant and his son at the same moment and from this time forward the two families lived in friendship with each other oakly laughed at his own folly in having been persuaded to go to law about the plum tree and he in process of time so completely conquered his early prejudice against scotchmen that he and grant became partners in business mr grants book larning and knowledge of arithmetic he found highly useful to him and he on his side possessed a great many active good qualities which became serviceable to his partner the two boys rejoiced in this family union and arthur often declared that they owed all their happiness to maurices favourite maxim forgive and forget waste not want not or two strings to your bow mr gresham a bristol merchant who had by honourable industry and economy accumulated a considerable fortune retired from business to a new house which he had built upon the downs near clifton mr gresham however did not imagine that a new house alone could make him happy he did not propose to live in idleness and extravagance for such a life would have been equally incompatible with his habits and his principles he was fond of children and as he had no sons he determined to adopt one of his relations he had two nephews and he invited both of them to his house that he might have an opportunity of judging of their dispositions and of the habits which they had acquired picture waste not want not hal and benjamin mr greshams nephews were about ten years old they had been educated very differently hal was the son of the elder branch of the family his father was a gentleman who spent rather more than he could afford and hal from the example of the servants in his fathers family with whom he had passed the first years of his childhood learned to waste more of everything than he used he had been told that gentlemen should be above being careful and saving and he had unfortunately imbibed a notion that extravagance was the sign of a generous disposition and economy of an avaricious one benjamin on the contrary had been taught habits of care and foresight his father had but a very small fortune and was anxious that his son should early learn that economy ensures independence and sometimes puts it in the power of those who are not very rich to be very generous the morning after these two boys arrived at their uncles they were eager to see all the rooms in the house mr gresham accompanied them and attended to their remarks and exclamations oh what an excellent motto exclaimed ben when he read the following words which were written in large characters over the chimney piece in his uncles spacious kitchen waste not want not waste not want not repeated his cousin hal in rather a contemptuous tone i think it looks stingy to servants and no gentlemans servants cooks especially would like to have such a mean motto always staring them in the face ben who was not so conversant as his cousin in the ways of cooks and gentlemens servants made no reply to these observations mr gresham was called away whilst his nephews were looking at the other rooms in the house some time afterwards he heard their voices in the hall boys said he what are you doing there nothing sir said hal you were called away from us and we did not know which way to go and have you nothing to do said mr gresham no sir nothing answered hal in a careless tone like one who was well content with the state of habitual idleness no sir nothing replied ben in a voice of lamentation come said mr gresham if you have nothing to do lads will you unpack those two parcels for me the two parcels were exactly alike both of them well tied up with good whip cord ben took his parcel to a table and after breaking off the sealing wax began carefully to examine the knot and then to untie it hal stood still exactly in the spot where the parcel was put into his hands and tried first at one corner and then at another to pull the string off by force i wish these people wouldnt tie up their parcels so tight as if they were never to be undone cried he as he tugged at the cord and he pulled the knot closer instead of loosening it ben why how did you get yours undone man whats in your parceli wonder what is in mine i wish i could get this string offi must cut it oh no said ben who now had undone the last knot of his parcel and who drew out the length of string with exultation dont cut it hallook what a nice cord this is and yours is the same its a pity to cut it waste not want not you know pooh said hal what signifies a bit of packthread it is whip cord said ben well whip cord what signifies a bit of whip cord you can get a bit of whip cord twice as long as that for twopence and who cares for twopence not i for one so here it goes cried hal drawing out his knife and he cut the cord precipitately in sundry places lads have you undone the parcels for me said mr gresham opening the parlour door as he spoke yes sir cried hal and he dragged off his half cut half entangled stringheres the parcel and heres my parcel uncle and heres the string said ben you may keep the string for your pains said mr gresham thank you sir said ben what an excellent whip cord it is and you hal continued mr gresham you may keep your string too if it will be of any use to you it will be of no use to me thank you sir said hal no i am afraid not if this be it said his uncle taking up the jagged knotted remains of hals cord a few days after this mr gresham gave to each of his nephews a new top but hows this said hal these tops have no strings what shall we do for strings i have a string that will do very well for mine said ben and he pulled out of his pocket the fine long smooth string which had tied up the parcel with this he soon set up his top which spun admirably well oh how i wish i had but a string said hal what shall i do for a string ill tell you what i can use the string that goes round my hat but then said ben what will you do for a hat band ill manage to do without one said hal and he took the string of his hat for his top it soon was worn through and he split his top by driving the pea too tightly into it his cousin ben let him set up his the next day but hal was not more fortunate or more careful when he meddled with other peoples things than when he managed his own he had scarcely played half an hour before he split it by driving the peg too violently ben bore this misfortune with good humour come said he it cant be helped but give me the string because that may still be of use for something else it happened some time afterwards that a lady who had been intimately acquainted with hals mother at baththat is to say who had frequently met her at the card table during the winternow arrived at clifton she was informed by his mother that hal was at mr greshams and her sons who were friends of his came to see him and invited him to spend the next day with them hal joyfully accepted the invitation he was always glad to go out to dine because it gave him something to do something to think of or at least something to say besides this he had been educated to think it was a fine thing to visit fine people and lady diana sweepstakes for that was the name of his mothers acquaintance was a very fine lady and her two sons intended to be very great gentlemen he was in a prodigious hurry when these young gentlemen knocked at his uncles door the next day but just as he got to the hall door little patty called to him from the top of the stairs and told him that he had dropped his pocket handkerchief pick it up then and bring it to me quick cant you child cried hal for lady dis sons are waiting for me little patty did not know anything about lady dis sons but as she was very good natured and saw that her cousin hal was for some reason or other in a desperate hurry she ran downstairs as fast as she possibly could towards the landing place where the handkerchief lay but alas before she reached the handkerchief she fell rolling down a whole flight of stairs and when her fall was at last stopped by the landing place she did not cry out she writhed as if she was in great pain where are you hurt my love said mr gresham who came instantly on hearing the noise of someone falling downstairs where are you hurt my dear here papa said the little girl touching her ankle which she had decently covered with her gown i believe i am hurt here but not much added she trying to rise only it hurts me when i move ill carry you dont move then said her father and he took her up in his arms my shoe ive lost one of my shoes said she ben looked for it upon the stairs and he found it sticking in a loop of whip cord which was entangled round one of the bannisters when this cord was drawn forth it appeared that it was the very same jagged entangled piece which hal had pulled off his parcel he had diverted himself with running up and downstairs whipping the bannisters with it as he thought he could convert it to no better use and with his usual carelessness he at last left it hanging just where he happened to throw it when the dinner bell rang poor little pattys ankle was terribly strained and hal reproached himself for his folly and would have reproached himself longer perhaps if lady di sweepstakes sons had not hurried him away in the evening patty could not run about as she used to do but she sat upon the sofa and she said that she did not feel the pain of her ankle so much whilst ben was so good as to play at jack straws with her thats right ben never be ashamed of being good natured to those who are younger and weaker than yourself said his uncle smiling at seeing him produce his whip cord to indulge his little cousin with a game at her favourite cats cradle i shall not think you one bit less manly because i see you playing at cats cradle with a little child of six years old hal however was not precisely of his uncles opinion for when he returned in the evening and saw ben playing with his little cousin he could not help smiling contemptuously and asked if he had been playing at cats cradle all night in a heedless manner he made some inquiries after pattys sprained ankle and then he ran on to tell all the news he had heard at lady diana sweepstakesnews which he thought would make him appear a person of vast importance do you know uncledo you know ben said hetheres to be the most famous doings that ever were heard of upon the downs here the first day of next month which will be in a fortnight thank my stars i wish the fortnight was over i shall think of nothing else i know till that happy day comes mr gresham inquired why the first of september was to be so much happier than any other day in the year why replied hal lady diana sweepstakes you know is a famous rider and archer and all that very likely said mr gresham soberly but what then dear uncle cried hal but you shall hear theres to be a race upon the downs on the first of september and after the race theres to be an archery meeting for the ladies and lady diana sweepstakes is to be one of them and after the ladies have done shootingnow ben comes the best part of it we boys are to have our turn and lady di is to give a prize to the best marksman amongst us of a very handsome bow and arrow do you know ive been practising already and ill show you to morrow as soon as it comes home the famous bow and arrow that lady diana has given me but perhaps added he with a scornful laugh you like a cats cradle better than a bow and arrow ben made no reply to this taunt at the moment but the next day when hals new bow and arrow came home he convinced him that he knew how to use it very well ben said his uncle you seem to be a good marksman though you have not boasted of yourself ill give you a bow and arrow and perhaps if you practise you may make yourself an archer before the first of september and in the meantime you will not wish the fortnight to be over for you will have something to do oh sir interrupted hal but if you mean that ben should put in for the prize he must have a uniform why must he said mr gresham why sir because everybody hasi mean everybody thats anybody and lady diana was talking about the uniform all dinner time and its settled all about it except the buttons the young sweepstakes are to get theirs made first for patternsthey are to be white faced with green and theyll look very handsome im sure and i shall write to mamma to night as lady diana bid me about mine and i shall tell her to be sure to answer my letter without fail by return of post and then if mamma makes no objection which i know she wont because she never thinks much about expense and all thatthen i shall bespeak my uniform and get it made by the same tailor that makes for lady diana and the young sweepstakes mercy upon us said mr gresham who was almost stunned by the rapid vociferation with which this long speech about a uniform was pronounced i dont pretend to understand these things added he with an air of simplicity but we will inquire ben into the necessity of the case and if it is necessaryor if you think it necessary that you shall have a uniformwhy ill give you one you uncle will you indeed exclaimed hal with amazement painted in his countenance well thats the last thing in the world i should have expected you are not at all the sort of person i should have thought would care about a uniform and now i should have supposed youd have thought it extravagant to have a coat on purpose only for one day and im sure lady diana sweepstakes thought as i do for when i told her of that motto over your kitchen chimney waste not want not she laughed and said that i had better not talk to you about uniforms and that my mother was the proper person to write to about my uniform but ill tell lady diana uncle how good you are and how much she was mistaken take care how you do that said mr gresham for perhaps the lady was not mistaken nay did not you say just now you would give poor ben a uniform i said i would if he thought it necessary to have one oh ill answer for it hell think it necessary said hal laughing because it is necessary allow him at least to judge for himself said mr gresham my dear uncle but i assure you said hal earnestly theres no judging about the matter because really upon my word lady diana said distinctly that her sons were to have uniforms white faced with green and a green and white cockade in their hats may be so said mr gresham still with the same look of calm simplicity put on your hats boys and come with me i know a gentleman whose sons are to be at this archery meeting and we will inquire into all the particulars from him then after we have seen him it is not eleven oclock yet we shall have time enough to walk on to bristol and choose the cloth for bens uniform if it is necessary i cannot tell what to make of all he says whispered hal as he reached down his hat do you think ben he means to give you this uniform or not i think said ben that he means to give me one if it is necessary or as he said if i think it is necessary and that to be sure you will wont you or else youll be a great fool i know after all ive told you how can anyone in the world know so much about the matter as i who have dined with lady diana sweepstakes but yesterday and heard all about it from beginning to end and as for this gentleman that we are going to im sure if he knows anything about the matter hell say exactly the same as i do we shall hear said ben with a degree of composure which hal could by no means comprehend when a uniform was in question the gentleman upon whom mr gresham called had three sons who were all to be at this archery meeting and they unanimously assured him in the presence of hal and ben that they had never thought of buying uniforms for this grand occasion and that amongst the number of their acquaintance they knew of but three boys whose friends intended to be at such an unnecessary expense hal stood amazed such are the varieties of opinion upon all the grand affairs of life said mr gresham looking at his nephews what amongst one set of people you hear asserted to be absolutely necessary you will hear from another set of people is quite unnecessary all that can be done my dear boys in these difficult cases is to judge for yourselves which opinions and which people are the most reasonable hal who had been more accustomed to think of what was fashionable than of what was reasonable without at all considering the good sense of what his uncle said to him replied with childish petulance indeed sir i dont know what other people think but i only know what lady diana sweepstakes said the name of lady diana sweepstakes hal thought must impress all present with respect he was highly astonished when as he looked round he saw a smile of contempt upon everyones countenance and he was yet further bewildered when he heard her spoken of as a very silly extravagant ridiculous woman whose opinion no prudent person would ask upon any subject and whose example was to be shunned instead of being imitated ay my dear hal said his uncle smiling at his look of amazement these are some of the things that young people must learn from experience all the world do not agree in opinion about characters you will hear the same person admired in one company and blamed in another so that we must still come round to the same point judge for yourself hals thoughts were however at present too full of the uniform to allow his judgment to act with perfect impartiality as soon as their visit was over and all the time they walked down the hill from princes buildings towards bristol he continued to repeat nearly the same arguments which he had formerly used respecting necessity the uniform and lady diana sweepstakes to all this mr gresham made no reply and longer had the young gentleman expatiated upon the subject which had so strongly seized upon his imagination had not his senses been forcibly assailed at this instant by the delicious odours and tempting sight of certain cakes and jellies in a pastrycooks shop oh uncle said he as his uncle was going to turn the corner to pursue the road to bristol look at those jellies pointing to a confectioners shop i must buy some of those good things for i have got some halfpence in my pocket your having halfpence in your pocket is an excellent reason for eating said mr gresham smiling but i really am hungry said hal you know uncle it is a good while since breakfast his uncle who was desirous to see his nephews act without restraint that he might judge their characters bid them do as they pleased come then ben if youve any halfpence in your pocket im not hungry said ben i suppose that means that youve no halfpence said hal laughing with the look of superiority which he had been taught to think the rich might assume towards those who were convicted either of poverty or economy waste not want not said ben to himself contrary to his cousins surmise he happened to have two pennyworth of halfpence actually in his pocket at the very moment hal stepped into the pastrycooks shop a poor industrious man with a wooden leg who usually sweeps the dirty corner of the walk which turns at this spot to the wells held his hat to ben who after glancing his eye at the petitioners well worn broom instantly produced his twopence i wish i had more halfpence for you my good man said he but ive only twopence hal came out of mr millars the confectioners shop with a hatful of cakes in his hand mr millars dog was sitting on the flags before the door and he looked up with a wistful begging eye at hal who was eating a queen cake hal who was wasteful even in his good nature threw a whole queen cake to the dog who swallowed it for a single mouthful there goes twopence in the form of a queen cake said mr gresham hal next offered some of his cakes to his uncle and cousin but they thanked him and refused to eat any because they said they were not hungry so he ate and ate as he walked along till at last he stopped and said this bun tastes so bad after the queen cakes i cant bear it and he was going to fling it from him into the river oh it is a pity to waste that good bun we may be glad of it yet said ben give it me rather than throw it away why i thought you said you were not hungry said hal true i am not hungry now but that is no reason why i should never be hungry again well there is the cake for you take it for it has made me sick and i dont care what becomes of it ben folded the refuse bit of his cousins bun in a piece of paper and put it into his pocket im beginning to be exceeding tired or sick or something said hal and as there is a stand of coaches somewhere hereabouts had not we better take a coach instead of walking all the way to bristol for a stout archer said mr gresham you are more easily tired than one might have expected however with all my heart let us take a coach for ben asked me to show him the cathedral yesterday and i believe i should find it rather too much for me to walk so far though i am not sick with eating good things the cathedral said hal after he had been seated in the coach about a quarter of an hour and had somewhat recovered from his sicknessthe cathedral why are we only going to bristol to see the cathedral i thought we came out to see about a uniform there was a dulness and melancholy kind of stupidity in hals countenance as he pronounced these words like one wakening from a dream which made both his uncle and his cousin burst out a laughing why said hal who was now piqued im sure you did say uncle you would go to mr halls to choose the cloth for the uniform very true and so i will said mr gresham but we need not make a whole mornings work need we of looking at a piece of cloth cannot we see a uniform and a cathedral both in one morning they went first to the cathedral hals head was too full of the uniform to take any notice of the painted window which immediately caught bens embarrassed attention he looked at the large stained figures on the gothic window and he observed their coloured shadows on the floor and walls mr gresham who perceived that he was eager on all subjects to gain information took this opportunity of telling him several things about the lost art of painting on glass gothic arches etc which hal thought extremely tiresome come come we shall be late indeed said hal surely youve looked long enough ben at this blue and red window im only thinking about these coloured shadows said ben i can show you when we go home ben said his uncle an entertaining paper upon such shadows hark cried ben did you hear that noise they all listened and they heard a bird singing in the cathedral its our old robin sir said the lad who had opened the cathedral door for them yes said mr gresham there he is boyslookperched upon the organ he often sits there and sings whilst the organ is playing and continued the lad who showed the cathedral he has lived here these many many winters they say he is fifteen years old and he is so tame poor fellow that if i had a bit of bread hed come down and feed in my hand ive a bit of bun here cried ben joyfully producing the remains of the bun which hal but an hour before would have thrown away pray let us see the poor robin eat out of your hand the lad crumbled the bun and called to the robin who fluttered and chirped and seemed rejoiced at the sight of the bread but yet he did not come down from his pinnacle on the organ he is afraid of us said ben he is not used to eat before strangers i suppose ah no sir said the young man with a deep sigh that is not the thing he is used enough to eat afore company time was hed have come down for me before ever so many fine folks and have eat his crumbs out of my hand at my first call but poor fellow its not his fault now he does not know me now sir since my accident because of this great black patch the young man put his hand to his right eye which was covered with a huge black patch ben asked what accident he meant and the lad told him that but a few weeks ago he had lost the sight of his eye by the stroke of a stone which reached him as he was passing under the rocks at clifton unluckily when the workmen were blasting i dont mind so much for myself sir said the lad but i cant work so well now as i used to do before my accident for my old mother who has had a stroke of the palsy and ive a many little brothers and sisters not well able yet to get their own livelihood though they be as willing as willing can be where does your mother live said mr gresham hard by sir just close to the church here it was her that always had the showing of it to strangers till she lost the use of her poor limbs shall we may we uncle go that way this is the house is not it said ben when they went out of the cathedral they went into the house it was rather a hovel than a house but poor as it was it was as neat as misery could make it the old woman was sitting up in her wretched bed winding worsted four meagre ill clothed pale children were all busy some of them sticking pins in paper for the pin maker and others sorting rags for the paper maker what a horrid place it is said hal sighing i did not know there were such shocking places in the world ive often seen terrible looking tumble down places as we drove through the town in mammas carriage but then i did not know who lived in them and i never saw the inside of any of them it is very dreadful indeed to think that people are forced to live in this way i wish mamma would send me some more pocket money that i might do something for them i had half a crown but continued he feeling in his pockets im afraid i spent the last shilling of it this morning upon those cakes that made me sick i wish i had my shilling now id give it to these poor people ben though he was all this time silent was as sorry as his talkative cousin for all these poor people but there was some difference between the sorrow of these two boys hal after he was again seated in the hackney coach and had rattled through the busy streets of bristol for a few minutes quite forgot the spectacle of misery which he had seen and the gay shops in wine street and the idea of his green and white uniform wholly occupied his imagination now for our uniforms cried he as he jumped eagerly out of the coach when his uncle stopped at the woollen drapers door uncle said ben stopping mr gresham before he got out of the carriage i dont think a uniform is at all necessary for me im very much obliged to you but i would rather not have one i have a very good coat and i think it would be waste well let me get out of the carriage and we will see about it said mr gresham perhaps the sight of the beautiful green and white cloth and the epaulettes have you ever considered the epaulettes may tempt you to change your mind oh no said ben laughing i shall not change my mind the green cloth and the white cloth and the epaulettes were produced to hals infinite satisfaction his uncle took up a pen and calculated for a few minutes then showing the back of the letter upon which he was writing to his nephews cast up these sums boys said he and tell me whether i am right ben do you do it said hal a little embarrassed i am not quick at figures ben was and he went over his uncles calculation very expeditiously it is right is it said mr gresham yes sir quite right then by this calculation i find i could for less than half the money your uniforms would cost purchase for each of you boys a warm great coat which you will want i have a notion this winter upon the downs oh sir said hal with an alarmed look but it is not winter yet it is not cold weather yet we shant want greatcoats yet dont you remember how cold we were hal the day before yesterday in that sharp wind when we were flying our kite upon the downs and winter will come though it is not come yeti am sure i should like to have a good warm great coat very much mr gresham took six guineas out of his purse and he placed three of them before hal and three before ben young gentlemen said he i believe your uniforms would come to about three guineas a piece now i will lay out this money for you just as you please hal what say you why sir said hal a great coat is a good thing to be sure and then after the great coat as you said it would only cost half as much as the uniform there would be some money to spare would not there yes my dear about five and twenty shillings five and twenty shillingsi could buy and do a great many things to be sure with five and twenty shillings but then the thing is i must go without the uniform if i have the great coat certainly said his uncle ah said hal sighing as he looked at the epaulettes uncle if you would not be displeased if i choose the uniform i shall not be displeased at your choosing whatever you like best said mr gresham well then thank you sir said hal i think i had better have the uniform because if i have not the uniform now directly it will be of no use to me as the archery meeting is the week after next you know and as to the great coat perhaps between this time and the very cold weather which perhaps wont be till christmas papa will buy a great coat for me and ill ask mamma to give me some pocket money to give away and she will perhaps to all this conclusive conditional reasoning which depended upon the word perhaps three times repeated mr gresham made no reply but he immediately bought the uniform for hal and desired that it should be sent to lady diana sweepstakes sons tailor to be made up the measure of hals happiness was now complete and how am i to lay out the three guineas for you ben said mr gresham speak what do you wish for first a great coat uncle if you please gresham bought the coat and after it was paid for five and twenty shillings of bens three guineas remained what next my boy said his uncle arrows uncle if you please three arrows my dear i promised you a bow and arrows no uncle you only said a bow well i meant a bow and arrows im glad you are so exact however it is better to claim less than more than what is promised the three arrows you shall have but go on how shall i dispose of these five and twenty shillings for you in clothes if you will be so good uncle for that poor boy who has the great black patch on his eye i always believed said mr gresham shaking hands with ben that economy and generosity were the best friends instead of being enemies as some silly extravagant people would have us think them choose the poor blind boys coat my dear nephew and pay for it theres no occasion for my praising you about the matter your best reward is in your own mind child and you want no other or im mistaken now jump into the coach boys and lets be off we shall be late im afraid continued he as the coach drove on but i must let you stop ben with your goods at the poor boys door when they came to the house mr gresham opened the coach door and ben jumped out with his parcel under his arm stay stay you must take me with you said his pleased uncle i like to see people made happy as well as you do and so do i too said hal let me come with you i almost wish my uniform was not gone to the tailors so i do and when he saw the look of delight and gratitude with which the poor boy received the clothes which ben gave him and when he heard the mother and children thank him he sighed and said well i hope mamma will give me some more pocket money soon upon his return home however the sight of the famous bow and arrow which lady diana sweepstakes had sent him recalled to his imagination all the joys of his green and white uniform and he no longer wished that it had not been sent to the tailors but i dont understand cousin hal said little patty why you call this bow a famous bow you say famous very often and i dont know exactly what it means a famous uniformfamous doings i remember you said there are to be famous doings the first of september upon the downs what does famous mean oh why famous meansnow dont you know what famous means it meansit is a word that people sayit is the fashion to say itit meansit means famous patty laughed and said this does not explain it to me no said hal nor can it be explained if you dont understand it thats not my fault everybody but little children i suppose understands it but theres no explaining those sort of words if you dont take them at once theres to be famous doings upon the downs the first of september that is grand fine in short what does it signify talking any longer patty about the matter give me my bow for i must go out upon the downs and practise ben accompanied him with the bow and the three arrows which his uncle had now given to him and every day these two boys went out upon the downs and practised shooting with indefatigable perseverance where equal pains are taken success is usually found to be pretty nearly equal our two archers by constant practice became expert marksmen and before the day of trial they were so exactly matched in point of dexterity that it was scarcely possible to decide which was superior the long expected lst of september at length arrived what sort of a day is it was the first question that was asked by hal and ben the moment that they wakened the sun shone bright but there was a sharp and high wind ha said ben i shall be glad of my good great coat to day for ive a notion it will be rather cold upon the downs especially when we are standing still as we must whilst all the people are shooting oh never mind i dont think i shall feel it cold at all said hal as he dressed himself in his new green and white uniform and he viewed himself with much complacency good morning to you uncle how do you do said he in a voice of exultation when he entered the breakfast room how do you do seemed rather to mean how do you like me in my uniform and his uncles cool very well i thank you hal disappointed him as it seemed only to say your uniform makes no difference in my opinion of you even little patty went on eating her breakfast much as usual and talked of the pleasure of walking with her father to the downs and of all the little things which interested her so that hals epaulettes were not the principal object in anyones imagination but his own papa said patty as we go up the hill where there is so much red mud i must take care to pick my way nicely and i must hold up my frock as you desired me and perhaps you will be so good if i am not troublesome to lift me over the very bad place where are no stepping stones my ankle is entirely well and im glad of that or else i should not be able to walk so far as the downs how good you were to me ben when i was in pain the day i sprained my ankle you played at jack straws and at cats cradle with me oh that puts me in mindhere are your gloves which i asked you that night to let me mend ive been a great while about them but are not they not very neatly mended papa look at the sewing i am not a very good judge of sewing my dear little girl said mr gresham examining the work with a close and scrupulous eye but in my opinion here is one stitch that is rather too long the white teeth are not quite even oh papa ill take out that long tooth in a minute said patty laughing i did not think that you would observe it so soon i would not have you trust to my blindness said her father stroking her head fondly i observe everything i observe for instance that you are a grateful little girl and that you are glad to be of use to those who have been kind to you and for this i forgive you the long stitch but its out its out papa said patty and the next time your gloves want mending ben ill mend them better they are very nice i think said ben drawing them on and i am much obliged to you i was just wishing i had a pair of gloves to keep my fingers warm to day for i never can shoot well when my hands are benumbed look hal you know how ragged these gloves were you said they were good for nothing but to throw away now look theres not a hole in them said he spreading his fingers now is it not very extraordinary said hal to himself that they should go on so long talking about an old pair of gloves without saying scarcely a word about my new uniform well the young sweepstakes and lady diana will talk enough about it thats one comfort is not it time to think of setting out sir said hal to his uncle the company you know are to meet at the ostrich at twelve and the race to begin at one and lady dianas horses i know were ordered to be at the door at ten mr stephen the butler here interrupted the hurrying young gentleman in his calculations theres a poor lad sir below with a great black patch on his right eye who is come from bristol and wants to speak a word with the young gentlemen if you please i told him they were just going out with you but he says he wont detain them more than half a minute show him up show him up said mr gresham but i suppose said hal with a sigh that stephen mistook when he said the young gentlemen he only wants to see ben i daresay im sure he has no reason to want to see me here he comesoh ben he is dressed in the new coat you gave him whispered hal who was really a good natured boy though extravagant how much better he looks than he did in the ragged coat ah he looked at you first benand well he may the boy bowed without any cringing servility but with an open decent freedom in his manner which expressed that he had been obliged but that he knew his young benefactor was not thinking of the obligation he made as little distinction as possible between his bows to the two cousins as i was sent with a message by the clerk of our parish to redland chapel out on the downs to day sir said he to mr gresham knowing your house lay in my way my mother sir bid me call and make bold to offer the young gentlemen two little worsted balls that she has worked for them continued the lad pulling out of his pocket two worsted balls worked in green and orange coloured stripes they are but poor things sir she bid me say to look at but considering she has but one hand to work with and that her left hand youll not despise em we hopes he held the balls to ben and hal they are both alike gentlemen said he if youll be pleased to take em theyre better than they look for they bound higher than your head i cut the cork round for the inside myself which was all i could do they are nice balls indeed we are much obliged to you said the boys as they received them and they proved them immediately the balls struck the floor with a delightful sound and rebounded higher than mr greshams head little patty clapped her hands joyfully but now a thundering double rap at the door was heard the master sweepstakes sir said stephen are come for master hal they say that all the young gentlemen who have archery uniforms are to walk together in a body i think they say sir and they are to parade along the well walk they desired me to say sir with a drum and fife and so up the hill by princes place and all to go upon the downs together to the place of meeting i am not sure im right sir for both the young gentlemen spoke at once and the wind is very high at the street door so that i could not well make out all they said but i believe this is the sense of it yes yes said hal eagerly its all right i know that is just what was settled the day i dined at lady dianas and lady diana and a great party of gentlemen are to ride well that is nothing to the purpose interrupted mr gresham dont keep these master sweepstakes waiting decidedo you choose to go with them or with us sirunclesir you know since all the uniforms agreed to go together off with you then mr uniform if you mean to go said mr gresham hal ran downstairs in such a hurry that he forgot his bow and arrows ben discovered this when he went to fetch his own and the lad from bristol who had been ordered by mr gresham to eat his breakfast before he proceeded to redland chapel heard ben talking about his cousins bow and arrows i know said ben he will be sorry not to have his bow with him because here are the green knots tied to it to match his cockade and he said that the boys were all to carry their bows as part of the show if youll give me leave sir said the poor bristol lad i shall have plenty of time and ill run down to the well walk after the young gentleman and take him his bow and arrows will you i shall be much obliged to you said ben and away went the boy with the bow that was ornamented with green ribands the public walk leading to the wells was full of company the windows of all the houses in st vincents parade were crowded with well dressed ladies who were looking out in expectation of the archery procession parties of gentlemen and ladies and a motley crowd of spectators were seen moving backwards and forwards under the rocks on the opposite side of the water a barge with coloured streamers flying was waiting to take up a party who were going upon the water the bargemen rested upon their oars and gazed with broad faces of curiosity upon the busy scene that appeared upon the public walk the archers and archeresses were now drawn up on the flags under the semicircular piazza just before mrs yearsleys library a little band of children who had been mustered by lady diana sweepstakes spirited exertions closed the procession they were now all in readiness the drummer only waited for her ladyships signal and the archers corps only waited for her ladyships word of command to march where are your bow and arrows my little man said her ladyship to hal as she reviewed her lilliputian regiment you cant march man without your arms hal had despatched a messenger for his forgotten bow but the messenger returned not he looked from side to side in great distressoh theres my bow coming i declare cried he look i see the bow and the ribands look now between the trees charles sweepstakes on the hotwell walk it is coming but youve kept us all waiting a confounded time said his impatient friend it is that good natured poor fellow from bristol i protest that has brought it me im sure i dont deserve it from him said hal to himself when he saw the lad with the black patch on his eye running quite out of breath towards him with his bow and arrows fall back my good friendfall back said the military lady as soon as he had delivered the bow to hal i mean stand out of the way for your great patch cuts no figure amongst us dont follow so close now as if you belonged to us pray the poor boy had no ambition to partake the triumph he fell back as soon as he understood the meaning of the ladys words the drum beat the fife played the archers marched the spectators admired hal stepped proudly and felt as if the eyes of the whole universe were upon his epaulettes or upon the facings of his uniform whilst all the time he was considered only as part of a show the walk appeared much shorter than usual and he was extremely sorry that lady diana when they were half way up the hill leading to princes place mounted her horse because the road was dirty and all the gentlemen and ladies who accompanied her followed her example we can leave the children to walk you know said she to the gentleman who helped her to mount her horse i must call to some of them though and leave orders where they are to join she beckoned and hal who was foremost and proud to show his alacrity ran on to receive her ladyships orders now as we have before observed it was a sharp and windy day and though lady diana sweepstakes was actually speaking to him and looking at him he could not prevent his nose from wanting to be blowed he pulled out his handkerchief and out rolled the new ball which had been given to him just before he left home and which according to his usual careless habits he had stuffed into his pockets in his hurry oh my new ball cried he as he ran after it as he stopped to pick it up he let go his hat which he had hitherto held on with anxious care for the hat though it had a fine green and white cockade had no band or string round it the string as we may recollect our wasteful hero had used in spinning his top the hat was too large for his head without this band a sudden gust of wind blew it off lady dianas horse started and reared she was a famous horse woman and sat him to the admiration of all beholders but there was a puddle of red clay and water in this spot and her ladyships uniform habit was a sufferer by the accident careless brat said she why cant he keep his hat upon his head in the meantime the wind blew the hat down the hill and hal ran after it amidst the laughter of his kind friends the young sweepstakes and the rest of the little regiment the hat was lodged at length upon a bank hal pursued it he thought this bank was hard but alas the moment he set his foot upon it the foot sank he tried to draw it back his other foot slipped and he fell prostrate in his green and white uniform into the treacherous bed of red mud his companions who had halted upon the top of the hill stood laughing spectators of his misfortune it happened that the poor boy with the black patch upon his eye who had been ordered by lady diana to fall back and to keep at a distance was now coming up the hill and the moment he saw our fallen hero he hastened to his assistance he dragged poor hal who was a deplorable spectacle out of the red mud the obliging mistress of a lodging house as soon as she understood that the young gentleman was nephew to mr gresham to whom she had formerly let her house received hal covered as he was with dirt the poor bristol lad hastened to mr greshams for clean stockings and shoes for hal he was unwilling to give up his uniform it was rubbed and rubbed and a spot here and there was washed out and he kept continually repeatingwhen its dry it will all brush offwhen its dry it will all brush off wont it but soon the fear of being too late at the archery meeting began to balance the dread of appearing in his stained habiliments and he now as anxiously repeated whilst the woman held the wet coat to the fire oh i shall be too late indeed i shall be too late make haste it will never dry hold it nearernearer to the fire i shall lose my turn to shoot oh give me the coat i dont mind how it is if i can but get it on holding it nearer and nearer to the fire dried it quickly to be sure but it shrunk it also so that it was no easy matter to get the coat on again however hal who did not see the red splashes which in spite of all these operations were too visible upon his shoulders and upon the skirts of his white coat behind was pretty well satisfied to observe that there was not one spot upon the facings nobody said he will take notice of my coat behind i daresay i think it looks as smart almost as everand under this persuasion our young archer resumed his bowhis bow with green ribands now no moreand he pursued his way to the downs all his companions were far out of sight i suppose said he to his friend with the black patchi suppose my uncle and ben had left home before you went for the shoes and stockings for me oh yes sir the butler said they had been gone to the downs a matter of a good half hour or more hal trudged on as fast as he possibly could when he got upon the downs he saw numbers of carriages and crowds of people all going towards the place of meeting at the ostrich he pressed forwards he was at first so much afraid of being late that he did not take notice of the mirth his motley appearance excited in all beholders at length he reached the appointed spot there was a great crowd of people in the midst he heard lady dianas loud voice betting upon someone who was just going to shoot at the mark so then the shooting is begun is it said hal oh let me in pray let me into the circle im one of the archersi am indeed dont you see my green and white uniform your red and white uniform you mean said the man to whom he addressed himself and the people as they opened a passage for him could not refrain laughing at the mixture of dirt and finery which it exhibited in vain when he got into the midst of the formidable circle he looked to his friends the young sweepstakes for their countenance and support they were amongst the most unmerciful of the laughers lady diana also seemed more to enjoy than to pity his confusion why could you not keep your hat upon your head man said she in her masculine tone you have been almost the ruin of my poor uniform habit but ive escaped rather better than you have dont stand there in the middle of the circle or youll have an arrow in your eyes just now ive a notion hal looked round in search of better friends oh wheres my unclewheres ben said he he was in such confusion that amongst the number of faces he could scarcely distinguish one from another but he felt somebody at this moment pull his elbow and to his great relief he heard the friendly voice and saw the good natured face of his cousin ben come back come behind these people said ben and put on my great coat here it is for you right glad was hal to cover his disgraced uniform with the rough great coat which he had formerly despised he pulled the stained drooping cockade out of his unfortunate hat and he was now sufficiently recovered from his vexation to give an intelligible account of his accident to his uncle and patty who anxiously inquired what had detained him so long and what had been the matter in the midst of the history of his disaster he was just proving to patty that his taking the hatband to spin his top had nothing to do with his misfortune and he was at the same time endeavouring to refute his uncles opinion that the waste of the whipcord that tied the parcel was the original cause of all his evils when he was summoned to try his skill with his famous bow my hands are benumbed i can scarcely feel said he rubbing them and blowing upon the ends of his fingers come come cried young sweepstakes im within one inch of the mark wholl go nearer i shall like to see shoot away hal but first understand our laws we settled them before you came upon the green you are to have three shots with your own bow and your own arrows and nobodys to borrow or lend under pretence of others bows being better or worse or under any pretence do you hear hal this young gentleman had good reasons for being so strict in these laws as he had observed that none of his companions had such an excellent bow as he had provided for himself some of the boys had forgotten to bring more than one arrow with them and by his cunning regulation that each person should shoot with their own arrows many had lost one or two of their shots you are a lucky fellow you have your three arrows said young sweepstakes come we cant wait whilst you rub your fingers manshoot away hal was rather surprised at the asperity with which his friend spoke he little knew how easily acquaintance who call themselves friends can change when their interest comes in the slightest degree in competition with their friendship hurried by his impatient rival and with his hands so much benumbed that he could scarcely feel how to fix the arrow in the string he drew the bow the arrow was within a quarter of an inch of master sweepstakes mark which was the nearest that had yet been hit hal seized his second arrow if i have any luck said he but just as he pronounced the word luck and as he bent his bow the string broke in two and the bow fell from his hands there its all over with you cried master sweepstakes with a triumphant laugh heres my bow for him and welcome said ben no no sir said master sweepstakes that is not fair thats against the regulation you may shoot with your own bow if you choose it or you may not just as you think proper but you must not lend it sir it was now bens turn to make his trial his first arrow was not successful his second was exactly as near as hals first you have but one more said master sweepstakesnow for it ben before he ventured his last arrow prudently examined the string of his bow and as he pulled it to try its strength it cracked master sweepstakes clapped his hands with loud exultations and insulting laughter but his laughter ceased when our provident hero calmly drew from his pocket an excellent piece of whip cord the everlasting whip cord i declare exclaimed hal when he saw that it was the very same that had tied up the parcel yes said ben as he fastened it to his bow i put it into my pocket to day on purpose because i thought i might happen to want it he drew his bow the third and last time oh papa cried little patty as his arrow hit the mark its the nearest is it not the nearest master sweepstakes with anxiety examined the hit there could be no doubt ben was victorious the bow the prize bow was now delivered to him and hal as he looked at the whip cord exclaimed how lucky this whip cord has been to you ben it is lucky perhaps you mean that he took care of it said mr gresham ay said hal very true he might well say waste not want not it is a good thing to have two strings to ones bow old poz lucy daughter

after dinner after they go out the justice stops tell this storyi dont know whether it tells well for me but ill never be positive any morethats poz the mimic chapter i mr and mrs montague spent the summer of the year at clifton with their son frederick and their two daughters sophia and marianne they had taken much care of the education of their children nor were they ever tempted by any motive of personal convenience or temporary amusement to hazard the permanent happiness of their pupils sensible of the extreme importance of early impressions and of the powerful influence of external circumstances in forming the characters and the manners they were now anxious that the variety of new ideas and new objects which would strike the minds of their children should appear in a just point of view let children see and judge for themselves is often inconsiderately said where children see only a part they cannot judge of the whole and from the superficial view which they can have in short visits and desultory conversation they can form only a false estimate of the objects of human happiness a false notion of the nature of society and false opinions of characters for the above reasons mr and mrs montague were particularly cautious in the choice of their acquaintances as they were well aware that whatever passed in conversation before children became part of their education when they came to clifton they wished to have a house entirely to themselves but as they came late in the season almost all the lodging houses were full and for a few weeks they were obliged to remain in a house where some of the apartments were already occupied during the first fortnight they scarcely saw or heard anything of one of the families who lodged on the same floor with them an elderly quaker and his sister bertha were their silent neighbours the blooming complexion of the lady had indeed attracted the attention of the children as they caught a glimpse of her face when she was getting into her carriage to go out upon the downs they could scarcely believe that she came to the wells on account of her health besides her blooming complexion the delicate white of her garments had struck them with admiration and they observed that her brother carefully guarded her dress from the wheel of the carriage as he handed her in from this circumstance and from the benevolent countenance of the old gentleman they concluded that he was very fond of his sister and that they were certainly very happy except that they never spoke and could be seen only for a moment not so the maiden lady who occupied the ground floor on the stairs in the passages at her window she was continually visible and she appeared to possess the art of being present in all these places at once her voice was eternally to be heard and it was not particularly melodious the very first day she met mrs montagues children on the stairs she stopped to tell marianne that she was a charming dear and a charming little dear to kiss her to inquire her name and to inform her that her own name was mrs theresa tattle a circumstance of which there was little danger of their long remaining in ignorance for in the course of one morning at least twenty single and as many double raps at the door were succeeded by vociferations of mrs theresa tattles servant mrs theresa tattle at home mrs theresa tattle not at home no person at the wells was oftener at home and abroad than mrs tattle she had as she deemed it the happiness to have a most extensive acquaintance residing at clifton she had for years kept a register of arrivals she regularly consulted the subscriptions to the circulating libraries and the lists at the ball and the pump rooms so that with a memory unencumbered with literature and free from all domestic cares she contrived to retain a most astonishing and correct list of births deaths and marriages together with all the anecdotes amusing instructive or scandalous which are necessary to the conversation of a water drinking place and essential to the character of a very pleasant woman a very pleasant woman mrs tattle was usually called and conscious of her accomplishments she was eager to introduce herself to the acquaintance of her new neighbours having with her ordinary expedition collected from their servants by means of her own all that could be known or rather all that could be told about them the name of montague at all events she knew was a good name and justified in courting the acquaintance she courted it first by nods and becks and smiles at marianne whenever she met her and marianne who was a very little girl began presently to nod and smile in return persuaded that a lady who smiled so much could not be ill natured besides mrs theresas parlour door was sometimes left more than half open to afford a view of a green parrot marianne sometimes passed very slowly by this door one morning it was left quite wide open when she stopped to say pretty poll and immediately mrs tattle begged she would do her the honour to walk in and see pretty poll at the same time taking the liberty to offer her a piece of iced plum cake the next day mrs theresa tattle did herself the honour to wait upon mrs montague to apologize for the liberty she taken in inviting mrs montagues charming miss marianne into her apartment to see pretty poll and for the still greater liberty she had taken in offering her a piece of plum cakeinconsiderate creature that she waswhich might possibly have disagreed with her and which certainly were liberties she never should have been induced to take if she had not been unaccountably bewitched by miss mariannes striking though highly flattering resemblance to a young gentleman an officer with whom she had danced now nearly twelve years ago of the name of montague a most respectable young man and of a most respectable family with which in a remote degree she might presume to say she herself was someway connected having the honour to be nearly related to the joneses of merionethshire who were cousins to the mainwarings of bedfordshire who married into the family of the griffiths the eldest branch of which she understood had the honour to be cousin german to mr montague on which account she had been impatient to pay a visit so likely to be productive of most agreeable consequences by the acquisition of an acquaintance whose society must do her infinite honour having thus happily accomplished her first visit there seemed little probability of escaping mrs tattles further acquaintance in the course of the first week she only hinted to mr montague that some people thought his system of education rather odd that she should be obliged to him if he would some time or other when he had nothing else to do just sit down and make her understand his notions that she might have something to say to her acquaintance as she always wished to have when she heard any friend attacked or any friends opinions mr montague declining to sit down and make this lady understand a system of education only to give her something to say and showing unaccountable indifference about the attacks with which he was threatened mrs tattle next addressed herself to mrs montague prophesying in a most serious whisper that the charming miss marianne would shortly and inevitably grow quite crooked if she were not immediately provided with a back board a french dancing master and a pair of stocks this alarming whisper could not however have a permanent effect upon mrs montagues understanding because three days afterwards mrs theresa upon the most anxious inspection entirely mistook the just and natural proportions of the hip and shoulder this danger vanishing mrs tattle presently with a rueful length of face and formal preface hesitated to assure mrs montague that she was greatly distressed about her daughter sophy that she was convinced her lungs were affected and that she certainly ought to drink the waters morning and evening and above all things must keep one of the patirosa lozenges constantly in her mouth and directly consult dr cardamum the best physician in the world and the person she would send for herself upon her death bed because to her certain knowledge he had recovered a young lady a relation of her own after she had lost one whole globe of her lungs the medical opinion of a lady of so much anatomical precision could not have much weight neither was this universal adviser more successful in an attempt to introduce a tutor to frederick who she apprehended must want some one to perfect him in the latin and greek and dead languages of which she observed it would be impertinent for a woman to talk only she might venture to repeat what she had heard said by good authority that a competency of the dead tongues could be had nowhere but at a public school or else from a private tutor who had been abroad after the advantage of a classical education finished in one of the universities with a good family without which introduction it was idle to think of reaping solid advantages from any continental tour all which requisites from personal knowledge she could aver to be concentrated in the gentleman she had the honour to recommend as having been tutor to a young nobleman who had now no further occasion for him having unfortunately for himself and his family been killed in an untimely duel all mrs theresa tattles suggestions being lost upon these stoical parents her powers were next tried upon the children and her success soon became apparent on sophy indeed she could not make any impression though she had expended on her some of her finest strokes of flattery sophy though very desirous of the approbation of her friends was not very desirous of winning the favour of strangers she was about thirteenthat dangerous age at which ill educated girls in their anxiety to display their accomplishments are apt to become dependent for applause upon the praise of every idle visitor when the habits not being formed and the attention being suddenly turned to dress and manners girls are apt to affect and imitate indiscriminately everything that they conceive to be agreeable sophy whose taste had been cultivated at the same time with her powers of reasoning was not liable to fall into these errors she found that she could please those whom she wished to please without affecting to be anything but what she really was and her friends listened to what she said though she never repeated the sentiments or adopted the phrases which she might easily have copied from the conversation of those who were older or more fashionable than herself this word fashionable mrs theresa tattle knew had usually a great effect even at thirteen but she had not observed that it had much power upon sophy nor were her remarks concerning grace and manners much attended to her mother had taught sophy that it was best to let herself alone and not to distort either her person or her mind in acquiring grimace which nothing but the fashion of the moment can support and which is always detected and despised by people of real good sense and politeness bless me said mrs tattle to herself if i had such a tall daughter and so unformed before my eyes from morning to night it would certainly break my poor heart thank heaven i am not a mother if i were miss marianne for me miss marianne had heard so often from mrs tattle that she was very charming that she could not help believing it and from being a very pleasing unaffected little girl she in a short time grew so conceited that she could neither speak look nor be silent without imagining that everybody was or ought to be looking at her and when mrs theresa saw that mrs montague looked very grave upon these occasions she to repair the ill she had done would say after praising mariannes hair or her eyes oh but little ladies should never think about their beauty you know nobody loves anybody for being handsome but for being good people must think children are very silly or else they can never have reflected upon the nature of belief in their own minds if they imagine that children will believe the words that are said to them by way of moral when the countenance manner and every concomitant circumstance tell them a different tale children are excellent physiognomiststhey quickly learn the universal language of looks and what is said of them always makes a greater impression than what is said to them a truth of which those prudent people surely cannot be aware who comfort themselves and apologize to parents by saying oh but i would not say so and so to the child mrs theresa had seldom said to frederick montague that he had a vast deal of drollery and was a most incomparable mimic but she had said so of him in whispers which magnified the sound to his imagination if not to his ear he was a boy of much vivacity and had considerable abilities but his appetite for vulgar praise had not yet been surfeited even mrs theresa tattles flattery pleased him and he exerted himself for her entertainment so much that he became quite a buffoon instead of observing characters and manners that he might judge of them and form his own he now watched every person he saw that he might detect some foible or catch some singularity in their gesture or pronunciation which he might successfully mimic alarmed by the rapid progress of these evils mr and mrs montague who from the first day that they had been honoured with mrs tattles visit had begun to look out for new lodgings were now extremely impatient to decamp they were not people who from the weak fear of offending a silly acquaintance would hazard the happiness of their family they had heard of a house in the country which was likely to suit them and they determined to go directly to look at it as they were to be absent all day they foresaw that their officious neighbour would probably interfere with their children they did not choose to exact any promise from them which they might be tempted to break and therefore they only said at parting if mrs theresa tattle should ask you to come to her do as you think proper scarcely had mrs montagues carriage got out of hearing when a note was brought directed to frederick montague junior esq which he immediately opened and read as follows mrs theresa tattle presents her very best compliments to the entertaining mr frederick montague she hopes he will have the charity to drink tea with her this evening and bring his charming sister miss marianne with him as mrs theresa will be quite alone with a shocking headache and is sensible her nerves are affected and dr cardamum says that especially in mrs t ts case it is downright death to nervous patients to be alone an instant she therefore trusts mr frederick will not refuse to come and make her laugh mrs theresa has taken care to provide a few macaroons for her little favourite who said she was particularly fond of them the other day mrs theresa hopes they will all come at six or before not forgetting miss sophy if she will condescend to be of the party at the first reading of this note the entertaining mr frederick and the charming miss marianne laughed heartily and looked at sophy as if they were afraid that she should think it possible they could like such gross flattery but upon a second perusal marianne observed that it certainly was very good natured of mrs theresa to remember the macaroons and frederick allowed that it was wrong to laugh at the poor woman because she had the headache then twisting the note in his fingers he appealed to sophy well sophy leave off drawing for an instant said frederick and tell us what answer can we send canwe can send what answer we please yes i know that said frederick i would refuse if i could but we ought not to do anything rude should we so i think we might as well go because we could not refuse if we would i say you have made such confusion replied sophy between couldnt and wouldnt and shouldnt that i cant understand you surely they are all different things different no cried frederickcould would should might and ought are all the same thing in the latin grammar all of em signs of the potential mood you know sophy whose powers of reasoning were not to be confounded even by quotations from the latin grammar looked up soberly from her drawing and answered that very likely those words might be signs of the same thing in the latin grammar but she believed that they meant perfectly different things in real life thats just as people please said her sophistical brother you know words mean nothing in themselves if i choose to call my hat my cadwallader you would understand me just as well after i had once explained it to you that by cadwallader i meant this black thing that i put upon my head cadwallader and hat would then be just the same thing to you then why have two words for the same thing said sophy and what has this to do with could and should you wanted to prove i wanted to prove interrupted frederick that its not worth while to dispute for two hours about two words do keep to the point sophy and dont dispute with me i was not disputing i was reasoning well reasoning or disputing women have no business to do either for how should they know how to chop logic like men at this contemptuous sarcasm upon her sex sophys colour rose there cried frederick exulting now we shall see a philosopheress in a passion id give sixpence half price for a harlequin entertainment to see sophy in a passion now marianne look at her brush dabbing so fast in the water sophy who could not easily bear to be laughed at with some little indignation said brother i wish there there cried frederick pointing to the colour which rose in her cheeks almost to her templesrising rising rising look at the thermometer blood heat blood fever heat boiling water heat marianne then said sophy smiling you should stand a little farther off both of you leave the thermometer to itself a little while give it time to cool it will come down to temperate by the time you look again oh brother cried marianne shes so good humoured dont tease her any more and dont draw heads upon her paper and dont stretch her india rubber and dont let us dirty any more of her brushes see the sides of her tumbler are all manner of colours oh i only mixed red blue green and yellow to show you marianne that all colours mixed together make white but she is temperate now and i wont plague her she shall chop logic if she likes it though she is a woman but thats not fair brother said marianne to say woman in that way im sure sophy found out how to tie that difficult knot which papa showed us yesterday long before you did though you are a man not long said frederick besides that was only a conjuring trick it was very ingenious though said marianne and papa said so besides she understood the rule of three which was no conjuring trick better than you did though she is a woman and she can reason too mamma says very well let her reason away said the provoking wit all i have to say is that shell never be able to make a pudding why not pray brother inquired sophy looking up again very gravely why you know papa himself the other day at dinner said that the woman who talks greek and latin as well as i do is a fool after all and that she had better have learned something useful and mrs tattle said shed answer for it she did not know how to make a pudding well but i am not talking greek and latin am i no but you are drawing and thats the same thing the same thing oh frederick said little marianne laughing you may laugh but i say it is the same sort of thing women who are always drawing and reasoning never know how to make puddings mrs theresa tattle said so when i showed her sophys beautiful drawing yesterday mrs theresa tattle might say so replied sophy calmly but i do not perceive the reason brother why drawing should prevent me from learning how to make a pudding well i say youll never learn how to make a good pudding i have learned continued sophy who was mixing her colours to mix such and such colours together to make the colour that i want and why should i not be able to learn to mix flour and butter and sugar and egg together to produce the taste that i want oh but mixing will never do unless you know the quantities like a cook and you would never learn the right quantities how did the cook learn them cannot i learn them as she did yes but youd never do it exactly and mind the spoonfuls right by the recipe like a cook indeed indeed but she would cried marianne eagerly and a great deal more exactly for mamma has taught her to weigh and measure things very carefully and when i was ill she always weighed the bark in nicely and dropped my drops so carefully better than the cook when mamma took me down to see the cook make a cake once i saw her spoonfuls and her ounces and her handfuls she dashed and splashed without minding exactness or the recipe or anything im sure sophy would make a much better pudding if exactness only were wanting well granting that she could make the best pudding in the whole world what does that signify i say she never would so it comes to the same thing never would how can you tell that brother why now look at her with her books and her drawings and all this apparatus do you think she would ever jump up with all her nicety too and put by all these things to go down into the greasy kitchen and plump up to the elbows in suet like a cook for a plum pudding i need not plump up to the elbows brother said sophy smiling nor is it necessary that i should be a cook but if it were necessary i hope i should be able to make a pudding yes yes cried marianne warmly and she would jump up and put by all her things in a minute if it were necessary and run down stairs and up again like lightning or do anything that was ever so disagreeable to her even about the suet with all her nicety brother i assure you as she used to do anything everything for me when i was ill last winter oh brother she can do anything and she could make the best plum pudding in the whole world im sure in a minute if it were necessary chapter ii a knock at the door from mrs theresa tattles servant recalled marianne to the business of the day there said frederick we have sent no answer all this time its necessary to think of that in a minute the servant came with his mistress compliments to let the young ladies and mr frederick know that she was waiting tea for them waiting then we must go said frederick the servant opened the door wider to let him pass and marianne thought she must follow her brother so they went downstairs together while sophy gave her own message to the servant and quietly stayed at her usual occupations mrs tattle was seated at her tea table with a large plate of macaroons beside her when frederick and marianne entered she was delighted they were come and grieved not to see miss sophy along with them marianne coloured a little for though she had precipitately followed her brother and though he had quieted her conscience for a moment by saying you know papa and mamma told us to do what we thought best yet she did not feel quite pleased with herself and it was not till after mrs theresa had exhausted all her compliments and half her macaroons that she could restore her spirits to their usual height come mr frederick said she after tea you promised to make me laugh and nobody can make me laugh so well as yourself oh brother said marianne show mrs theresa dr carbuncle eating his dinner and ill be mrs carbuncle marianne now my dear what shall i help you to frederick my dear she never calls him my dear you know but always doctor mar well then doctor what will you eat to day fred eat madam eat nothing nothing i dont see anything here i can eat maam mar heres eels sir let me help you to some eelstewed eelyou used to be fond of stewed eel

fred cut it maam i cant cut it i say its as hard as a deal board you might as well tell me to cut the table maam mutton indeed not a bit of fat roast mutton indeed not a drop of gravy mutton truly quite a cinder ill have none of it here take it away take it downstairs to the cook its a very hard case mrs carbuncle that i can never have a bit of anything that i can eat at my own table mrs carbuncle since i was married maam i that am the easiest man in the whole world to please about my dinner its really very extraordinary mrs carbuncle what have you at that corner there under the cover mar patties sir oyster patties fred patties maam kickshaws i hate kickshaws not worth putting under a cover maam and why not have glass covers that one may see ones dinner before one before it grows cold with asking questions mrs carbuncle and lifting up covers but nobody has any sense and i see no water plates anywhere lately mar do pray doctor let me help you to a bit of chicken before it gets cold my dear fred aside my dear again marianne mar yes brother because she is frightened you know and mrs carbuncle always says my dear to him when shes frightened and looks so pale from side to side and sometimes she cries before dinners done and then all the company are quite silent and dont know what to do oh such a little creature to have so much sense too exclaimed mrs theresa with rapture mr frederick youll make me die with laughing pray go on dr carbuncle fred well maam then if i must eat something send me a bit of fowl a leg and wing the liver wing and a bit of the breast oyster sauce and a slice of that ham if you please maam dr carbuncle eats voraciously with his head down to his plate and dropping the sauce he buttons up his coat tight across the breast fred here a plate knife and fork bit o bread a glass of dorchester ale oh admirable exclaimed mrs tattle clapping her hands now brother suppose that it is after dinner said marianne and show us how the doctor goes to sleep frederick threw himself back in an arm chair leaning his head back with his mouth open snoring nodded from time to time crossed and uncrossed his legs tried to awake himself by twitching his wig settling his collar blowing his nose and rapping on the lid of his snuff box all which infinitely diverted mrs tattle who when she could stop herself from laughing declared it made her sigh too to think of the life poor mrs carbuncle led with that man and all for nothing too for her jointure was nothing next to nothing though a great thing to be sure her friends thought for her when she was only sally ridgeway before she was married such a wife as she makes continued mrs theresa lifting up her hands and eyes to heaven and so much as she has gone through the brute ought to be ashamed of himself if he does not leave her something extraordinary in his will for turn it which way she will she can never keep a carriage or live like anybody else on her jointure after all she tells me poor soul a sad prospect after her husbands death to look forward to instead of being comfortable as her friends expected and she poor young thing knowing no better when they married her people should look into these things beforehand or never marry at all i say miss marianne miss marianne who did not clearly comprehend this affair of the jointure or the reason why mrs carbuncle would be so unhappy after her husbands death turned to frederick who was at that instant studying mrs theresa as a future character to mimic brother said marianne now sing an italian song for us like miss croker pray miss croker favour us with a song mrs theresa tattle has never had the pleasure of hearing you sing shes quite impatient to hear you sing yes indeed i am said mrs theresa frederick put his hands before him affectedly oh indeed maam indeed ladies i really am so hoarse it distresses me so to be pressed to sing besides upon my word i have quite left off singing ive never sung once except for very particular people this winter mar but mrs theresa tattle is a very particular person im sure youll sing for her fred certainly maam i allow that you use a powerful argument but i assure you now i would do my best to oblige you but i absolutely have forgotten all my english songs nobody hears anything but italian now and i have been so giddy as to leave my italian music behind me besides i make it a rule never to hazard myself without an accompaniment mar oh try miss croker for once frederick sings after much preluding violante in the pantry gnawing of a mutton bone how she gnawed it how she clawd it when she found herself alone charming exclaimed mrs tattle so like miss croker im sure i shall think of you mr frederick when i hear her asked to sing again her voice however introduces her to very pleasant parties and shes a girl thats very much taken notice of and i dont doubt will go off vastly well shes a particular favourite of mine you must know and i mean to do her a piece of service the first opportunity by saying something or other that shall go round to her relations in northumberland and make them do something for her as well they may for they are all rolling in gold and wont give her a penny mar now brother read the newspaper like counsellor puff oh pray do mr frederick for i declare i admire you of all things you are quite yourself to night heres a newspaper sir pray let us have counsellor puff its not late frederick reads in a pompous voice as a delicate white hand has ever been deemed a distinguishing ornament in either sex messrs valiant and wise conceive it to be their duty to take the earliest opportunity to advertise the nobility and gentry of great britain in general and their friends in particular that they have now ready for sale as usual at the hippocrates head a fresh assortment of new invented much admired primrose soap to prevent impositions and counterfeits the public are requested to take notice that the only genuine primrose soap is stamped on the outside valiant and wise oh you most incomparable mimic tis absolutely the counsellor himself i absolutely must show you some day to my friend lady battersby youd absolutely make her die with laughing and shed quite adore you said mrs theresa who was well aware that every pause must be filled with flattery pray go on pray go on i shall never be tired if i sit looking at you these hundred years stimulated by these plaudits frederick proceeded to show how colonel epaulette blew his nose flourished his cambric handkerchief bowed to lady diana periwinkle and admired her work saying done by no hands as you may guess but those of fairly fair whilst lady diana he observed simpered so prettily and took herself so quietly for fairly fair not perceiving that the colonel was admiring his own nails all the while next to colonel epaulette frederick at mariannes particular desire came into the room like sir charles slang very well brother cried she your hand down to the very bottom of your pocket and your other shoulder up to your ear but you are not quite wooden enough and you should walk as if your hip were out of joint there now mrs tattle are not those good eyes they stare so like his without seeming to see anything all the while excellent admirable mr frederick i must say that you are the best mimic of your age i ever saw and im sure lady battersby will think so too that is sir charles to the very life but with all that you must know hes a mighty pleasant fashionable young man when you come to know him and has a great deal of sense under all that and is of a very good familythe slangs you know sir charles will come into a fine fortune himself next year if he can keep clear of gambling which i hear is his foible poor young man pray go on i interrupt you mr frederick now brother said marianne no marianne i can do no more im quite tired and i will do no more said frederick stretching himself at full length upon a sofa even in the midst of laughter and whilst the voice of flattery yet sounded in his ear frederick felt sad displeased with himself and disgusted with mrs theresa what a deep sigh was there said mrs theresa what can make you sigh so bitterly you who make everybody else laugh oh such another sigh again marianne cried frederick do you remember the man in the mask what man in the mask brother the manthe actorthe buffoon that my father told us of who used to cry behind the mask that made everybody else laugh cry bless me said mrs theresa mighty odd very extraordinary but one cant be surprised at meeting with extraordinary characters amongst that race of people actors by profession you know for they are brought up from the egg to make their fortune or at least their bread by their oddities but my dear mr frederick you are quite pale quite exhausted no wonderwhat will you have a glass of cowslip wine oh no thank you maam said frederick oh yes indeed you must not leave me without taking something and miss marianne must have another macaroon i insist upon it said mrs theresa ringing the bell it is not late and my man christopher will bring up the cowslip wine in a minute but sophy and papa and mamma you know will come home presently said marianne oh miss sophy has her books and drawings you know shes never afraid of being alone besides to night it was her own choice and as to your papa and mamma they wont be home to night im pretty sure for a gentleman who had it from their own authority told me where they were going which is further off than they think but they did not consult me and i fancy theyll be obliged to sleep out so you need not be in a hurry about them well have candles the door opened just as mrs tattle was going to ring the bell again for candles and the cowslip wine christopher christopher said mrs theresa who was standing at the fire with her back to the door when it opened christopher pray bringdo you hear but no christopher answered and upon turning round mrs tattle instead of christopher beheld two little black figures which stood perfectly still and silent it was so dark that their forms could scarcely be discerned in the name of heaven who and what may you be speak i conjure you what are ye the chimney sweepers maam an please your ladyship chimney sweepers repeated frederick and marianne bursting out a laughing chimney sweepers repeated mrs theresa provoked at the recollection of her late solemn address to them chimney sweepers and could not you say so a little sooner pray what brings you here gentlemen at this time of night the bell rang maam answered a squeaking voice the bell rang yes for christopher the boys mad or drunk maam said the tallest of the chimney sweepers who had not yet spoken and who now began in a very blunt manner maam your brother desired us to come up when the bell rang so we did my brother i have no brother dunce said mrs theresa mr eden madam ho ho said mrs tattle in a more complacent tone the boy takes me for miss bertha eden i perceive and flattered to be taken in the dark by a chimney sweeper for a young and handsome lady mrs theresa laughed and informed him that they had mistaken the room and they must go up another pair of stairs and turn to the left the chimney sweeper with the squeaking voice bowed thanked her ladyship for this information said good night to ye quality and they both moved towards the door stay said mrs tattle whose curiosity was excited what can the edens want with chimney sweepers at this time o night i wonder christopher did you hear anything about it said the lady to her footman who was now lighting the candles upon my word maam said the servant i cant say but ill step down below and inquire i heard them talking about it in the kitchen but i only got a word here and there for i was hunting for the snuff dish as i knew it must be for candles when i heard the bell ring maam so i thought to find the snuff dish before i answered the bell for i knew it must be for candles you rang but if you please ill step down now maam and see about the chimney sweepers yes step down do and christopher bring up the cowslip wine and some more macaroons for my little marianne marianne withdrew rather coldly from a kiss which mrs tattle was going to give her for she was somewhat surprised at the familiarity with which this lady talked to her footman she had not been accustomed to these familiarities in her father and mother and she did not like them well said mrs tattle to christopher who was now returned what is the news maam the little fellow with the squeaking voice has been telling me the whole story the other morning maam early he and the other were down the hill sweeping in paradise row those chimneys they say are difficult and the square fellow maam the biggest of the two boys got wedged in the chimney the other little fellow was up at the top at the time and he heard the cry but in his fright and all he did not know what to do maam for he looked about from the top of the chimney and not a soul could he see stirring but a few that he could not make attend to his screech the boy within almost stifling too so he screeched and screeched all he could and by the greatest chance in life maam old mr eden was just going down the hill to fetch his morning walk ay interrupted mrs theresa friend ephraim is one of your early risers well said marianne impatiently so maam hearing the screech he turns and sees the sweep and at once he understands the matter im sure he must have taken some time to understand it interposed mrs tattle for hes the slowest creature breathing and the deafest in company go on christopher so the sweep did make him hear so he says maam and so the old gentleman went in and pulled the boy out of the chimney with much ado maam bless me exclaimed mrs theresa but did old eden go up the chimney himself after the boy wig and all why maam said christopher with a look of great delight that was all as one as the very dentical words i put to the boy myself when he telled me his story but maam that was what i couldnt get out of him neither rightly for he is a churlthe big boy that was stuck in the chimney i mean for when i put the question to him about the wig laughing like he wouldnt take it laughing like at all but would only make answer to us like a bear he saved my life thats all i know and this over again maam to all the kitchen round that cross questioned him but i finds him stupid and ill mannered like for i offered him a shilling maam myself to tell about the wig but he put it back in a way that did not become such as he to no ladys butler maam whereupon i turns to the slim fellow and hes smarterer and more mannerly maam with a tongue in his head for his betters but he could not resolve me my question either for he was up at the top of the chimney the best part o the time and when he came down mr eden had his wig on but had his arm all bare and bloody maam poor mr eden exclaimed marianne oh miss continued the servant and the chimney sweep himself was so bruised and must have been killed well well but hes alive now go on with your story christopher said mrs t chimney sweepers get wedged in chimneys every day its part of their trade and its a happy thing when they come off with a few bruises to be sure added she observing that both frederick and marianne looked displeased at this speech to be sure if one may believe this story there was some real danger real danger yes indeed said marianne and im sure i think mr eden was very good certainly it was a most commendable action and quite providential so i shall take an opportunity of saying when i tell the story in all companies and the boy may thank his kind stars im sure to the end of his days for such an escapebut pray christopher said she persisting in her conversation with christopher who was now laying the cloth for supper pray which house was it in paradise row where the eagles or the miss ropers lodge or which it was at my lady battersbys maam ha ha cried mrs theresa i thought we should get to the bottom of the affair at last this is excellent this will make an admirable story for my lady battersby the next time i see her these quakers are so sly old eden i know has long wanted to obtain an introduction into that house and a charming charitable expedient hit upon my lady battersby will enjoy this of all things chapter iii now continued mrs theresa turning to frederick as soon as the servant had left the room now mr frederick montague i have a favoursuch a favourto ask of you its a favour which only you can grant you have such talents and would do the thing so admirably and my lady battersby would quite adore you for it she will do me the honour to be here to spend an evening to morrow im convinced mr and mrs montague will find themselves obliged to stay out another day and i so long to show you off to her ladyship and your doctor carbuncle and your counsellor puff and your miss croker and all your charming characters you must let me introduce you to her ladyship to morrow evening promise me oh maam said frederick i cannot promise you any such thing indeed i am much obliged to you but indeed i cannot come why not my dear sir why not you dont think i mean you should promise if you are certain your papa and mamma will be home if they do come home i will ask them about it said frederick hesitating for though he by no means wished to accept the invitation he had not yet acquired the necessary power of decidedly saying no ask them repeated mrs theresa my dear sir at your age must you ask your papa and mamma about such things must no maam said frederick but i said i would i know i need not because my father and mother always let me judge for myself almost about everything and about this i am sure cried marianne papa and mamma you know just as they were going away said if mrs theresa asks you to come do as you think best well then said mrs theresa you know it rests with yourselves if you may do as you please to be sure i may madam said frederick colouring from that species of emotion which is justly called false shame and which often conquers real shame to be sure maam i may do as i please then i may make sure of you said mrs theresa for now it would be downright rudeness to tell a lady you wont do as she pleases mr frederick montague im sure is too wellbred a young gentleman to do so unpolite so ungallant a thing the jargon of politeness and gallantry is frequently brought by the silly acquaintance of young people to confuse their simple morality and clear good sense a new and unintelligible system is presented to them in a language foreign to their understanding and contradictory to their feelings they hesitate between new motives and old principles from the fear of being thought ignorant they become affected and from the dread of being thought to be children act like fools but all this they feel only when they are in the company of such people as mrs theresa tattle maam frederick began i dont mean to be rude but i hope youll excuse me from coming to drink tea with you to morrow because my father and mother are not acquainted with lady battersby and maybe they might not like take care take care said mrs theresa laughing at his perplexity you want to get off from obliging me and you dont know how you had very nearly made a most shocking blunder in putting it all upon poor lady battersby now you know its impossible that mr and mrs montague could have in nature the slightest objection to introducing you to my lady battersby at my own house for dont you know that besides her ladyships many unquestionable qualities which one need not talk of she is cousin but once removed to the trotters of lancashireyour mothers great favourites and there is not a person at the wells ill venture to say could be of more advantage to your sister sophy in the way of partners when she comes to go the balls which its to be supposed she will some time or other and as you are so good a brother thats a thing to be looked to you know besides as to yourself theres nothing her ladyship delights in so much as in a good mimic and shell quite adore you but i dont want her to adore me maam said frederick bluntly then correcting himself added i mean for being a mimic why not my love between friends can there be any harm in showing ones talents you that have such talents to show shell keep your secret ill answer for her and added she you neednt be afraid of her criticism for between you and me shes no great critic so youll come well thank you thats settled how you have made me beg and pray but you know your own value i see as you entertaining people always do one must ask a wit like a fine singer so often well but now for the favour i was going to ask you frederick looked surprised for he thought that the favour of his company was what she meant but she explained herself farther as to the old quaker who lodges above old ephraim edenmy lady battersby and i have so much diversion about him he is the best character the oddest creature if you were but to see him come into the rooms with those stiff skirts or walking with his eternal sister bertha and his everlasting broad brimmed hat one knows him a mile off but then his voice and way and altogether if one could get them to the life theyd be better than anything on the stage better even than anything ive seen to night and i think youd make a capital quaker for my lady battersby but then the thing is one can never get to hear the old quiz talk now you who have so much invention and clevernessi have no invention myself but could you not hit upon some way of seeing him so that you might get him by heart im sure you who are so quick would only want to see him and hear him for half a minute to be able to take him off so as to kill one with laughing but i have no invention oh as to the invention said frederick i know an admirable way of doing the thing if that is all but then remember i dont say i will do the thing for i will not but i know a way of getting up into his room and seeing him without his knowing me to be there oh tell it me you charming clever creature but remember i do not say i will do it well well let us hear it and you shall do as you please afterwards merciful goodness exclaimed mrs tattle do my ears deceive me i declare i looked round and thought i heard the squeaking chimney sweeper was in the room so did i frederick i declare cried marianne laughing i never heard anything so like his voice in my life frederick imitated the squeaking voice of this chimney sweeper to great perfection now continued he this fellow is just my height the old quaker if my face were blackened and if i were to change clothes with the chimney sweeper ill answer for it would never know me oh its an admirable invention i give you infinite credit for it exclaimed mrs theresa it shall it must be done ill ring and have the fellow up this minute oh no do not ring said frederick stopping her hand i dont mean to do it you know you promised that i should do as i pleased i only told you my invention well well but only let me ring and ask whether the chimney sweepers are below you shall do as you please afterwards christopher shut the door christopher said she to the servant who came up when she rang pray are the sweeps gone yet no maam but have they been up to old eden yet oh no maam nor be not to go till the bell rings for miss bertha maam was asleep a lying down and her brother wouldnt have her wakened on no account whatsomever he came down hisself to the kitchen to the sweeps though but wouldnt have as i heard him say his sister waked for no account but miss berthas bell will ring when she wakens for the sweeps maam twas she wanted to see the boy as her brother saved and i suppose sent for him to give him something charitable maam well never mind your suppositions said mrs theresa run down this very minute to the little squeaking chimney sweep and send him up to me quick but dont let the other bear come up with him christopher who had curiosity as well as his mistress when he returned with the chimney sweeper prolonged his own stay in the room by sweeping the hearth throwing down the tongs and shovel and picking them up again that will do christopher christopher that will do i say mrs theresa repeated in vain she was obliged to say christopher you may go before he would depart now said she to frederick step in here to the next room with this candle and youll be equipped in an instant only just change clothes with the boy only just let me see what a charming chimney sweeper youd make you shall do as you please afterwards well ill only change clothes with him just to show you for one minute but said marianne to mrs theresa whilst frederick was changing his clothes i think frederick is right about about what love i think he is in the right not to go up though he can do it so easily to see that gentleman i mean on purpose to mimic and laugh at him afterwards i dont think that would be quite right why pray miss marianne why because he is so good natured to his sister he would not let her be wakened dear its easy to be good in such little things and he wont have long to be good to her neither for i dont think she will trouble him long in this world anyhow what do you mean said marianne that shell die child die die with that beautiful colour in her cheeks how sorry her poor poor brother will be but she will not die im sure for she walks about and runs upstairs so lightly oh you must be quite mistaken i hope if im mistaken dr panado cardamums mistaken too then thats my comfort he says unless the waters work a miracle she stands a bad chance and she wont follow my advice and consult the doctor for her health he would frighten her to death perhaps said marianne i hope frederick wont go up to disturb her lud child you are turned simpleton all of a sudden how can your brother disturb her more than the real chimney sweeper but i dont think its right persisted marianne and i shall tell him so nay miss marianne i dont commend you now young ladies should not be so forward to give opinions and advice to their elder brothers unasked and i presume that mr frederick and i must know whats right as well as miss marianne hush here he is oh the capital figure cried mrs theresa bravo bravo cried she as frederick entered in the chimney sweepers dress and as he spoke saying im afraid please your ladyship to dirt your ladyships carpet she broke out into immoderate raptures calling him her charming chimney sweeper and repeating that she knew beforehand the character would do for him mrs theresa instantly rang the bell in spite of all expostulationordered christopher to send up the other chimney sweepertriumphed in observing that christopher did not know frederick when he came into the room and offered to lay any wager that the other chimney sweeper would mistake him for his companion and so he did and when frederick spoke the voice was so very like that it was scarcely possible that he should have perceived the difference marianne was diverted by this scene but she started when in the midst of it they heard a bell ring thats the ladys bell and we must go said the blunt chimney sweeper go then about your business said mrs theresa and heres a shilling for you to drink my honest fellow i did not know you were so much bruised when i first saw you i wont detain you go said she pushing frederick towards the door marianne sprang forward to speak to him but mrs theresa kept her off and though frederick resisted the lady shut the door upon him by superior force and having locked it there was no retreat mrs tattle and marianne waited impatiently for fredericks return i hear them cried marianne i hear them coming downstairs they listened again and all was silent at length they suddenly heard a great noise of many steps in the hall merciful exclaimed mrs theresa it must be your father and mother come back marianne ran to unlock the room door and mrs theresa followed her into the hall the hall was rather dark but under the lamp a crowd of people all the servants in the house having gathered together as mrs theresa approached the crowd opened in silence and in the midst she beheld frederick with blood streaming from his face his head was held by christopher and the chimney sweeper was holding a basin for him merciful what will become of me exclaimed mrs theresa bleeding hell bleed to death can nobody think of anything that will stop blood in a minute a key a large key down his backa keyhas nobody a key mr and mrs montague will be here before he has done bleeding a key cobwebs a puff ball for mercys sake can nobody think of anything that will stop blood in a minute gracious me hell bleed to death i believe hell bleed to death oh my brother cried marianne catching hold of the words and terrified she ran upstairs crying sophy oh sophy come down this minute or hell be dead my brothers bleeding to death sophy sophy come down or hell be dead let go the basin you said christopher pulling the basin out of the chimney sweepers hand who had all this time stood in silence you are not fit to hold the basin for a gentleman let him hold it said frederick he did not mean to hurt me thats more than he deserves im certain sure he might have known well enough it was mr frederick all the time and hed no business to go to fightsuch a one as hewith a gentleman i did not know he was a gentleman said the chimney sweeper how could i how could he indeed said frederick he shall hold the basin gracious me im glad to hear him speak like himself again at anyrate cried mrs theresa and here comes miss sophy too sophy cried frederick oh sophy dont you comedont look at me youll despise me my brother where where said sophy looking as she thought at the two chimney sweepers its frederick said marianne thats my brother miss sophy dont be alarmed mrs theresa began but gracious goodness i wish miss bertha at this instant a female figure in white appeared upon the stairs she passed swiftly on whilst everyone gave way before her oh miss bertha cried mrs theresa catching hold of her gown to stop her as she came near frederick oh miss eden your beautiful india muslin take care of the chimney sweeper for heavens sake but she pressed forward its my brother will he die cried marianne throwing her arms round her and looking up as if to a being of a superior order will he bleed to death no my love answered a sweet voice do not frighten thyself ive done bleeding said frederick dear me miss marianne if you would not make such a rout cried mrs tattle miss bertha its nothing but a frolic you see mr frederick montague only in a masquerade dress nothing in the world but a frolic maam you see hes stopped bleeding i was frightened out of my wits at first i thought it was his eye but i see its only his nose alls well that ends well mr frederick well keep your counsel pray maam let us ask no questions its only a boyish frolic come mr frederick this way into my room and ill give you a towel and some clean water and you can get rid of this masquerade dress make haste for fear your father and mother should drop in upon us do not be afraid of thy father and mother they are surely thy best friends said a voice it was the voice of an elderly gentleman who now stood behind frederick oh sir oh mr eden said frederick turning to him dont betray me for goodness sake whispered mrs tattle say nothing about me im not thinking about you let me speak cried he pushing away her hand which stopped his mouth i shall say nothing about you i promise you said frederick with a look of contempt no but for your own sake my dear sir your papa and mamma bless me is not that mrs montagues carriage my brother maam said sophy is not afraid of my father and mothers coming back let him speak he was going to speak the truth to be sure miss sophia i wouldnt hinder him from speaking the truth but its not proper i presume maam to speak truth at all times and in all places and before everybody servants and all i only wanted maam to hinder your brother from exposing himself a hall i apprehend is not a proper place for explanation here said mr eden opening the door of his room which was on the opposite side of the hall to mrs tattles here is a place said he to frederick where thou mayst speak the truth at all times and before everybody nay my rooms at mr frederick montagues service and my doors open too this way pray said she pulling his arm but frederick broke from her and followed mr eden oh sir will you forgive me cried he forgive theeand what have i to forgive forgive brother without asking what said bertha smiling he shall know all cried frederick all that concerns myself i mean sir i disguised myself in this dress i came up to your room to night on purpose to see you without your knowing it that i might mimic you the chimney sweeper where is he said frederick looking round and he ran into the hall to see for him may he come in he mayhe is a brave an honest good grateful boy he never guessed who i was after we left you we went down to the kitchen together and there fool as i was for the pleasure of making mr christopher and the servants laugh began to mimic you this boy said he would not stand by and hear you laughed at that you had saved his life that i ought to be ashamed of myself that you had just given me half a crown and so you had but i went on and told him id knock him down if he said another word he did i gave the first blow we fought i came to the ground the servants pulled me up again they found out i dont know how that i was not a chimney sweeper the rest you saw and now can you forgive me sir said frederick to mr eden seizing hold of his hand the other hand friend said the quaker gently withdrawing his right hand which everybody now observed was much swelled and putting it into his bosom again this and welcome offering his other hand to frederick and shaking his with a smile oh that other hand said frederick that was hurt i remember how ill i have behavedextremely ill but this is a lesson that i shall never forget as long as i live i hope for the future i shall behave like a gentleman and like a manand like a good man i am sure thou wilt said the good quaker shaking fredericks hand affectionately or i am much mistaken friend in that black countenance you are not mistaken cried marianne frederick will never be persuaded again by anybody to do what he does not think right and now brother you may wash your black countenance just when frederick had got rid of half his black countenance a double knock was heard at the door it was mr and mrs montague what will you do now whispered mrs theresa to frederick as his father and mother came into the room a chimney sweeper covered with blood exclaimed mr and mrs montague father i am frederick said he stepping forward towards them as they stood in astonishment frederick my son yes mother im not hurt half so much as i deserve ill tell you nay interrupted bertha let my brother tell the story this time thou hast told it once and told it well no one but my brother could tell it better a story never tells so well the second time to be sure said mrs theresa but mr eden will certainly make the best of it without taking any notice of mrs tattle or her apprehensive looks mr eden explained all he knew of the affair in a few words your son concluded he will quickly put off his dirty dress the dress hath not stained the mind that is fair and honourable when he found himself in the wrong he said so nor was he in haste to conceal his adventure from his father this made me think well of both father and son i speak plainly friend for that is best but what is become of the other chimney sweeper he will want to go home said mr eden turning to mrs theresa without making any reply she hurried out of the room as fast as possible and returned in a few moments with a look of extreme consternation here is a catastrophe indeed now indeed mr frederick your papa and mamma have reason to be angry a new suit of clothesthe bare faced villain gone no sign of them in my closet or anywhere the door was locked he must have gone up the chimney out upon the leads and so escaped but christopher is after him i protest mrs montague you take it too quietly the wretcha new suit of clothes blue coat and buff waistcoat i never heard of such a thing i declare mr montague you are vastly good not to be in a passion added mrs theresa madam replied mr montague with a look of much civil contempt i think the loss of a suit of clothes and even the disgrace that my son has been brought to this evening fortunate circumstances in his education he will i am persuaded judge and act for himself more wisely in future nor will he be tempted to offend against humanity for the sake of being called the best mimic in the world the barring out or party spirit the mother of mischief says an old proverb is no bigger than a midges wing at doctor middletons school there was a great tall dunce of the name of fisher who never could be taught how to look out a word in the dictionary he used to torment everybody withdo pray help me i cant make out this one word the person who usually helped him in his distress was a very clever good natured boy of the name of de grey who had been many years under dr middletons care and who by his abilities and good conduct did him great credit the doctor certainly was both proud and fond of him but he was so well beloved or so much esteemed by his companions that nobody had ever called him by the odious name of favourite until the arrival of a new scholar of the name of archer picture the barring out till archer came the ideas of favourites and parties were almost unknown at dr middletons but he brought all these ideas fresh from a great public school at which he had been educatedat which he had acquired a sufficient quantity of greek and latin and a superabundant quantity of party spirit his aim the moment he came to a new school was to get to the head of it or at least to form the strongest party his influence for he was a boy of considerable abilities was quickly felt though he had a powerful rival as he thought proper to call him in de grey and with him a rival was always an enemy de grey so far from giving him any cause of hatred treated him with a degree of cordiality which would probably have had an effect upon archers mind if it had not been for the artifices of fisher it may seem surprising that a great dunce should be able to work upon a boy like an archer who was called a great genius but when genius is joined to a violent temper instead of being united to good sense it is at the mercy even of dunces fisher was mortally offended one morning by de greys refusing to translate his whole lesson for him he went over to archer who considering him as a partisan deserting from the enemy received him with open arms and translated his whole lesson without expressing much contempt for his stupidity from this moment fisher forgot all de greys former kindness and considered only how he could in his turn mortify the person whom he felt to be so much his superior de grey and archer were now reading for a premium which was to be given in their class fisher betted on archers head who had not sense enough to despise the bet of a blockhead on the contrary he suffered him to excite the spirit of rivalship in its utmost fury by collecting the bets of all the school so that this premium now became a matter of the greatest consequence and archer instead of taking the means to secure a judgment in his favour was listening to the opinions of all his companions it was a prize which was to be won by his own exertions but he suffered himself to consider it as an affair of chance the consequence was that he trusted to chancehis partisans lost their wagers and he the premiumand his temper mr archer said dr middleton after the grand affair was decided you have done all that genius alone could do but you de grey have done all that genius and industry united could do well cried archer with affected gaiety as soon as the doctor had left the roomwell im content with my sentence genius alone for meindustry for those who want it added he with a significant look at de grey fisher applauded this as a very spirited speech and by insinuations that dr middleton always gave the premium to de grey and that those who had lost their bets might thank themselves for it for being such simpletons as to bet against the favourite he raised a murmur highly flattering to archer amongst some of the most credulous boys whilst others loudly proclaimed their belief in dr middletons impartiality these warmly congratulated de grey at this archer grew more and more angry and when fisher was proceeding to speak nonsense for him pushed forward into the circle to de grey crying i wish mr fisher you would let me fight my own battles and i wish said young townsend who was fonder of diversions than of premiums or battles or of anything elsei wish that we were not to have any battles after having worked like horses dont set about to fight like dogs come said he tapping de greys shoulder let us see your new playhouse doits a holiday and let us make the most of it let us have the school for scandal do and ill play charles for you and you de grey shall be my little premium come do open this new playhouse of yours to night come then said de grey and he ran across the playground to a waste building at the farthest end of it in which at the earnest request of the whole community and with the permission of dr middleton he had with much pain and ingenuity erected a theatre the new theatre is going to be opened follow the manager follow the manager echoed a multitude of voices follow the manager echoed very disagreeably in archers ear but as he could not be left alone he was also obliged to follow the manager the moment that the door was unlocked the crowd rushed in the delight and wonder expressed at the sight was great and the applause and thanks which were bestowed upon the manager were long and loud archer at least thought them long for he was impatient till his voice could be heard when at length the acclamations had spent themselves he walked across the stage with a knowing air and looking round contemptuously and is this your famous playhouse cried he i wish you had any of you seen the playhouse i have been used to these words made a great and visible change in the feelings and opinions of the public who would be a servant of the public or who would toil for popular applause a few words spoken in a decisive tone by a new voice operated as a charm and the playhouse was in an instant metamorphosed in the eyes of the spectators all gratitude for the past was forgotten and the expectation of something better justified to the capricious multitude their disdain of what they had so lately pronounced to be excellent everyone now began to criticise one observed that the green curtain was full of holes and would not draw up another attacked the scenes scenes they were not like real scenesarcher must know best because he was used to these things so everybody crowded to hear something of the other playhouse they gathered round archer to hear the description of his playhouse and at every sentence insulting comparisons were made when he had done his auditors looked round sighed and wished that archer had been their manager they turned from de grey as from a person who had done them an injury some of his friendsfor he had friends who were not swayed by the popular opinionfelt indignation at this ingratitude and were going to express their feelings but de grey stopped them and begged that he might speak for himself gentlemen said he coming forward as soon as he felt that he had sufficient command of himself my friends i see you are discontented with me and my playhouse i have done my best to please you but if anybody else can please you better i shall be glad of it i did not work so hard for the glory of being your manager you have my free leave to tear down here his voice faltered but he hurried onyou have my free leave to tear down all my work as fast as you please archer shake hands first however to show that theres no malice in the case archer who was touched by what his rival said and stopping the hand of his new partisan fisher cried no fisher nono pulling down we can alter it there is a great deal of ingenuity in it considering in vain archer would now have recalled the public to reasonthe time for reason was passed enthusiasm had taken hold of their minds down with it down with it archer for ever cried fisher and tore down the curtain the riot once begun nothing could stop the little mob till the whole theatre was demolished the love of power prevailed in the mind of archer he was secretly flattered by the zeal of his party and he mistook their love of mischief for attachment to himself de grey looked on superior i said i could bear to see all this and i can said he now it is all over and now it was all over there was silence the rioters stood still to take breath and to look at what they had done there was a blank space before them in this moment of silence there was heard something like a voice hush what strange voice is that said archer fisher caught fast hold of his arm everybody looked round to see where the voice came from it was dusk two window shutters at the farthest end of the building were seen to move slowly inwards de grey and in the same instant archer went forward and as the shutters opened there appeared through the hole the dark face and shrivelled hands of a very old gipsy she did not speak but she looked first at one and then at another at length she fixed her eyes on de grey well woman said he what do you want with me wantnothingwith you said the old woman do you want nothing with me nothing said de grey her eye immediately turned upon archeryou want something with me said she with emphasis iwhat do i want replied archer no said she changing her tone you want nothingnothing will you ever want or i am much mistaken in that face in that watch chain she should have said for her quick eye had espied archers watch chain he was the only person in the company who had a watch and she therefore judged him to be the richest had you ever your fortune told sir in your life not i said he looking at de grey as if he was afraid of his ridicule if he listened to the gipsy not you no for you will make your own fortune and the fortune of all that belong to you theres good news for my friends cried archer and im one of them remember that cried fisher and i and i joined a number of voices good luck to them cried the gipsy good luck to them all then as soon as they had acquired sufficient confidence in her good will they pressed up to the window there cried townsend as he chanced to stumble over the carpenters mitre box which stood in the way theres a good omen for me ive stumbled on the mitre box i shall certainly be a bishop happy he who had sixpence for he bid fair to be a judge upon the bench and happier he who had a shilling for he was in the high road to be one day upon the woolsack lord high chancellor of england no one had half a crown or no one would surely have kept it in his pocket upon such an occasion for he might have been an archbishop a king or what he pleased fisher who like all weak people was extremely credulous kept his post immovable in the front row all the time his mouth open and his stupid eyes fixed upon the gipsy in whom he felt implicit faith those who have least confidence in their own powers and who have least expectation from the success of their own exertions are always most disposed to trust in fortune tellers and fortune they hope to win when they cannot earn and as they can never be convinced by those who speak sense it is no wonder they are always persuaded by those who talk nonsense i have a question to put said fisher in a solemn tone put it then said archer what hinders you but they will hear me said he looking suspiciously at de grey i shall not hear you said de grey i am going everybody else drew back and left him to whisper his question in the gipsys ear what is become of my livy your sister livy do you mean said the gipsy no my latin livy the gipsy paused for information it had a leaf torn out in the beginning and i hate dr middleton written in it interrupted the gipsy rightthe very book cried fisher with joy but how could you know it was dr middletons name i thought i had scratched it so that nobody could make it out nobody could make it out but me replied the gipsy but never think to deceive me said she shaking her head at him in a manner that made him tremble i dont deceive you indeed i tell you the whole truth i lost it a week ago true and when shall i find it meet me here at this hour to morrow evening and i will answer you no more i must be gone not a word more to night she pulled the shutters towards her and left the youth in darkness all his companions were gone he had been so deeply engaged in this conference that he had not perceived their departure he found all the world at supper but no entreaties could prevail upon him to disclose his secret townsend rallied in vain as for archer he was not disposed to destroy by ridicule the effect which he saw that the old womans predictions in his favour had had upon the imagination of many of his little partisans he had privately slipped two good shillings into the gipsys hand to secure her for he was willing to pay any price for any means of acquiring power the watch chain had not deceived the gipsy for archer was the richest person in the community his friends had imprudently supplied him with more money than is usually trusted to boys of his age dr middleton had refused to give him a larger monthly allowance than the rest of his companions but he brought to school with him secretly the sum of five guineas this appeared to his friends and to himself an inexhaustible treasure riches and talents would he flattered himself secure to him that ascendancy of which he was so ambitious am i your manager or not was now his question i scorn to take advantage of a hasty moment but since last night you have had time to consider if you desire me to be your manager you shall see what a theatre i will make for you in this purse said he showing through the network a glimpse of the shining treasurein this purse is aladdins wonderful lamp am i your manager put it to the vote it was put to the vote about ten of the most reasonable of the assembly declared their gratitude and high approbation of their old friend de grey but the numbers were in favour of the new friend and as no metaphysical distinctions relative to the idea of a majority had ever entered their thoughts the most numerous party considered themselves as now beyond dispute in the right they drew off on one side in triumph and their leader who knew the consequence of a name in party matters immediately distinguished his partisans by the gallant name of archers stigmatizing the friends of de grey by the odious epithet of greybeards amongst the archers was a class not very remarkable for their mental qualifications but who by their bodily activity and by the peculiar advantages annexed to their way of life rendered themselves of the highest consequence especially to the rich and enterprising the judicious reader will apprehend that i allude to the persons called day scholars amongst these fisher was distinguished by his knowledge of all the streets and shops in the adjacent town and though a dull scholar he had such reputation as a man of business that whoever had commissions to execute at the confectioners was sure to apply to him some of the youngest of his employers had it is true at times complained that he made mistakes of halfpence and pence in their accounts but as these affairs could never be brought to a public trial fishers character and consequence were undiminished till the fatal day when his aunt barbara forbade his visits to the confectioners or rather till she requested the confectioner who had his private reasons for obeying her not to receive her nephews visits as he had made himself sick at his house and mrs barbaras fears for his health were incessant though his visits to the confectioners were thus at an end there were many other shops open to him and with officious zeal he offered his services to the new manager to purchase whatever might be wanting for the theatre since his fathers death fisher had become a boarder at dr middletons but his frequent visits to his aunt barbara afforded him opportunities of going into the town the carpenter de greys friend was discarded by archer for having said lack a daisy when he saw that the old theatre was pulled down a new carpenter and paper hanger recommended by fisher were appointed to attend with their tools for orders at two oclock archer impatient to show his ingenuity and his generosity gave his plan and his orders in a few minutes in a most decided manner these things he observed should be done with some spirit to which the carpenter readily assented and added that gentlemen of spirit never looked to the expense but always to the effect upon this principle mr chip set to work with all possible alacrity in a few hours time he promised to produce a grand effect high expectations were formed nothing was talked of but the new playhouse and so intent upon it was every head that no lessons could be got archer was obliged in the midst of his various occupations to perform the part of grammar and dictionary for twenty different people o ye athenians he exclaimed how hard do i work to obtain your praise impatient to return to the theatre the moment the hours destined for instruction or as they are termed by schoolboys school hours were over each prisoner started up with a shout of joy stop one moment gentlemen if you please said dr middleton in an awful voice mr archer return to your place are you all here the names of all the boys were called over and when each had answered to his name dr middleton said gentlemen i am sorry to interrupt your amusements but till you have contrary orders from me no one on pain of my serious displeasure must go into that building pointing to the place where the theatre was erecting mr archer your carpenter is at the door you will be so good as to dismiss him i do not think proper to give my reasons for these orders but you who know me said the doctor and his eye turned towards de grey will not suspect me of caprice i depend gentlemen upon your obedience to the dead silence with which these orders were received succeeded in a few minutes a universal groan so said townsend all our diversion is over so whispered fisher in the managers ear this is some trick of the greybeards did you not observe how he looked at de grey fired by this thought which had never entered his mind before archer started from his reverie and striking his hand upon the table swore that he would not be outwitted by any greybeard in europeno nor by all of them put together the archers were surely a match for them he would stand by them if they would stand by him he declared with a loud voice against the whole world and dr middleton himself with little premiums at his right hand everybody admired archers spirit but were a little appalled at the sound of standing against dr middleton why not resumed the indignant manager neither dr middleton nor any doctor upon earth shall treat me with injustice this you see is a stroke at me and my party and i wont bear it oh you are mistaken said de grey who was the only one who dared to oppose reason to the angry orator it cannot be a stroke aimed at you and your party for he does not know that you have a party ill make him know it and ill make you know it too said archer before i came here you reigned alone now your reign is over mr de grey remember my majority this morning and your theatre last night he has remembered it said fisher you see the moment he was not to be our manager we were to have no theatre no playhouse no plays we must all sit down with our hands before usall for good reasons of dr middletons which he does not vouchsafe to tell us i wont be governed by any mans reasons that he wont tell me cried archer he cannot have good reasons or why not tell them nonsense said de grey we shall not suspect him of caprice why not because we who know him have never known him capricious perhaps not i know nothing about him said archer no said de grey for that very reason i speak who do know him dont be in a passion archer i will be in a passion i wont submit to tyranny i wont be made a fool of by a few soft words you dont know me de grey ill go through with what ive begun i am manager and i will be manager and you shall see my theatre finished in spite of you and my party triumphant party repeated de grey i cannot imagine what is in the word party that seems to drive you mad we never heard of parties till you came amongst us no before i came i say nobody dared oppose you but i dare and i tell you to your face take care of mea warm friend and a bitter enemy is my motto i am not your enemy i believe you are out of your senses archer said he laughing out of my senses no you are my enemy are you not my rival did not you win the premium did not you want to be manager answer me are not you in one word a greybeard you called me a greybeard but my name is de grey said he still laughing laugh on cried the other furiously come archers follow me we shall laugh by and by i promise you at the door archer was stopped by mr chip oh mr chip i am ordered to discharge you yes sir and heres a little bill bill mr chip why you have not been at work for two hours not much over sir but if youll please to look into it youll see tis for a few things you ordered the stuff is all laid out and delivered the paper and the festoon bordering for the drawing room scene is cut out and left yander within yander within i wish you had not been in such a confounded hurrysix and twenty shillings cried he but i cant stay to talk about it now ill tell you mr chip said archer lowering his voice what you must do for me my good fellow then drawing mr chip aside he begged him to pull down some of the wood work which had been put up and to cut it into a certain number of wooden bars of which he gave him the dimensions with orders to place them all when ready under a haystack which he pointed out mr chip scrupled and hesitated and began to talk of the doctor archer immediately began to talk of the bill and throwing down a guinea and a half the conscientious carpenter pocketed the money directly and made his bow well master archer said he theres no refusing you nothing you have such a way of talking one out of it you manage me just like a child ay ay said archer knowing that he had been cheated and yet proud of managing a carpenter ay ay i know the way to manage everybody let the things be ready in an hours time and harke leave your tools by mistake behind you and a thousand of twenty penny nails ask no questions and keep your own counsel like a wise man off with you and take care of the doctor archers archers to the archers tree follow your leader cried he sounding his well known whistle as a signal his followers gathered round him and he raising himself upon the mount at the foot of the tree counted his numbers and then in a voice lower than usual addressed them thusmy friends is there a greybeard amongst us if there is let him walk off at once he has my free leave no one stirred then we are all archers and we will stand by one another join hands my friends they all joined hands promise me not to betray me and i will go on i ask no security but your honour they all gave their honour to be secret and faithful as he called it and he went on did you ever hear of such a thing as a barring out my friends they had heard of such a thing but they had only heard of it archer gave the history of a barring out in which he had been concerned at his school in which the boys stood out against the master and gained their point at last which was a weeks more holidays at easter but if we should not succeed said they dr middleton is so steady he never goes back from what he has said did you ever try to push him back let us be steady and hell tremble tyrants always tremble when oh interrupted a number of voices but he is not a tyrantis he all schoolmasters are tyrantsare not they replied archer and is not he a schoolmaster to this logic there was no answer but still reluctant they asked what they should get by a barring out geteverythingwhat we wantwhich is everything to lads of spiritvictory and liberty bar him out till he repeals his tyrannical law till he lets us into our own theatre again or till he tells us his good reasons against it but perhaps he has reasons for not telling us impossible cried archer thats the way we are always to be governed by a man in a wig who says he has good reasons and cant tell them are you fools go go back to de grey i see you are all greybeards go who goes first nobody would go first i will have nothing to do with ye if ye are resolved to be slaves we wont be slaves they all exclaimed at once then said archer stand out in the right and be free the right it would have taken up too much time to examine what the right was archer was always sure that the right was what his party chose to do that is what he chose to do himself and such is the influence of numbers upon each other in conquering the feelings of shame and in confusing the powers of reasoning that in a few minutes the right was forgotten and each said to himself to be sure archer is a very clever boy and he cant be mistaken or to be sure townsend thinks so and he would not do anything to get us into a scrape or to be sure everybody will agree to this but myself and i cant stand out alone to be pointed at as a greybeard and a slave everybody thinks it is right and everybody cant be wrong by some of these arguments which passed rapidly through the mind without his being conscious of them each boy decided and deceived himselfwhat none would have done alone none scrupled to do as a party it was determined then that there should be a barring out the arrangement of the affair was left to their new manager to whom they all pledged implicit obedience obedience it seems is necessary even from rebels to their ringleaders not reasonable but implicit obedience scarcely had the assembly adjourned to the ball alley when fisher with an important length of face came up to the manager and desired to speak one word to him my advice to you archer is to do nothing in this till we have consulted you know who about whether its right or wrong you know who whom do you mean make haste and dont make so many faces for im in a hurry who is you know who the old woman said fisher gravely the gipsy you may consult the old woman said archer bursting out a laughing about whats right and wrong if you please but no old woman shall decide for me no but you dont take me said fisher you dont take me by right and wrong i mean lucky and unlucky whatever i do will be lucky replied archer my gipsy told you that already i know i know said fisher and what she said about your friends being luckythat went a great way with many added he with a sagacious nod of his head i can tell you thatmore than you think do you know said he laying hold of archers button im in the secret there are nine of us have crooked our little fingers upon it not to stir a step till we get her advice and she has appointed me to meet her about particular business of my own at eight so im to consult her and to bring her answer archer knew too well how to govern fools to attempt to reason with them and instead of laughing any longer at fishers ridiculous superstition he was determined to take advantage of it he affected to be persuaded of the wisdom of the measure looked at his watch urged him to be exact to a moment conjured him to remember exactly the words of the oracle and above all things to demand the lucky hour and minute when the barring out should begin with these instructions archer put his watch into the solemn dupes hand and left him to count the seconds till the moment of his appointment whilst he ran off himself to prepare the oracle at a little gate which looked into a lane through which he guessed that the gipsy must pass he stationed himself saw her gave her half a crown and her instructions made his escape and got back unsuspected to fisher whom he found in the attitude in which he had left him watching the motion of the minute hand proud of his secret commission fisher slouched his hat he knew not why over his face and proceeded towards the appointed spot to keep as he had been charged by archer within the letter of the law he stood behind the forbidden building and waited some minutes through a gap in the hedge the old woman at length made her appearance muffled up and looking cautiously about her theres nobody near us said fisher and he began to be a little afraid what answer said he recollecting himself about my livy lost lost lost said the gipsy lifting up her hands never never never to be found but no matter for that now that is not your errand to night no tricks with me speak to me of what is next your heart fisher astonished put his hand upon his heart told her all that she knew before and received the answers that archer had dictated that the archers should be lucky as long as they stuck to their manager and to one another that the barring out should end in woe if not begun precisely as the clock should strike nine on wednesday night but if begun in that lucky moment and all obedient to their lucky leader all should end well a thought a provident thought now struck fisher for even he had some foresight where his favourite passion was concerned pray in our barring out shall we be starved no said the gipsy not if you trust to me for food and if you give me money enough silver wont do for so many gold is what must cross my hand i have no gold said fisher and i dont know what you mean by so many im only talking of number one you know i must take care of that first so as fisher thought it was possible that archer clever as he was might be disappointed in his supplies he determined to take secret measures for himself his aunt barbaras interdiction had shut him out of the confectioners shop but he flattered himself that he could outwit his aunt he therefore begged the gipsy to procure him twelve buns by thursday morning and bring them secretly to one of the windows of the schoolroom as fisher did not produce any money when he made this proposal it was at first absolutely rejected but a bribe at length conquered his difficulties and the bribe which fisher found himself obliged to givefor he had no pocket money left of his own he being as much restricted in that article as archer was indulgedthe bribe that he found himself obliged to give to quiet the gipsy was half a crown which archer had intrusted to him to buy candles for the theatre oh thought he to himself archers so careless about money he will never think of asking me for the half crown again and now hell want no candles for the theatre or at anyrate it will be some time first and maybe aunt barbara may be got to give me that much at christmas then if the worst comes to the worst one can pay archer my mouth waters for the buns and have em i must now so for the hope of twelve buns he sacrificed the money which had been intrusted to him thus the meanest motives in mean minds often prompt to the commission of those great faults to which one should think nothing but some violent passion could have tempted the ambassador having thus in his opinion concluded his own and the public business returned well satisfied with the result after receiving the gipsys reiterated promise to tap three times at the window on thursday morning the day appointed for the barring out at length arrived and archer assembling the confederates informed them that all was prepared for carrying their design into execution that he now depended for success upon their punctuality and courage he had within the last two hours got all their bars ready to fasten the doors and window shutters of the schoolroom he had with the assistance of two of the day scholars who were of the party sent into the town for provisions at his own expense which would make a handsome supper for that night he had also negotiated with some cousins of his who lived in the town for a constant supply in future bless me exclaimed archer suddenly stopping in this narration of his services theres one thing after all ive forgot we shall be undone without it fisher pray did you ever buy the candles for the playhouse no to be sure replied fisher extremely frightened you know you dont want candles for the playhouse now not for the playhouse but for the barring out we shall be in the dark man you must run this minute run for candles said fisher confused how manywhat sort stupidity exclaimed archer you are a pretty fellow at a dead lift lend me a pencil and a bit of paper do ill write down what i want myself well what are you fumbling for for money said fisher colouring money man didnt i give you half a crown the other day yes replied fisher stammering but i wasnt sure that that might be enough enough yes to be sure it will i dont know what you are at nothing nothing said fisher here write upon this then said fisher putting a piece of paper into archers hand upon which archer wrote his orders away away cried he away went fisher he returned but not until a considerable time afterwards they were at supper when he returned fisher always comes in at supper time observed one of the greybeards carelessly well and would you have him come in after supper time said townsend who always supplied his party with ready wit ive got the candles whispered fisher as he passed by archer to his place and the tinder box said archer yes i got back from my aunt barbara under pretence that i must study for repetition day an hour later to night so i got leave was not that clever a dunce always thinks it clever to cheat even by sober lies how mr fisher procured the candles and the tinder box without money and without credit we shall discover further on archer and his associates had agreed to stay the last in the schoolroom and as soon as the greybeards were gone out to bed he as the signal was to shut and lock one door townsend the other a third conspirator was to strike a light in case they should not be able to secure a candle a fourth was to take charge of the candle as soon as lighted and all the rest were to run to their bars which were secreted in a room then to fix them to the common fastening bars of the window in the manner in which they had been previously instructed by the manager thus each had his part assigned and each was warned that the success of the whole depended upon their order and punctuality order and punctuality it appears are necessary even in a barring out and even rebellion must have its laws the long expected moment at length arrived de grey and his friends unconscious of what was going forward walked out of the schoolroom as usual at bedtime the clock began to strike nine there was one greybeard left in the room who was packing up some of his books which had been left about by accident it is impossible to describe the impatience with which he was watched especially by fisher and the nine who depended upon the gipsy oracle when he had got all his books together under his arm he let one of them fall and whilst he stooped to pick it up archer gave the signal the doors were shut locked and double locked in an instant a light was struck and each ran to his post the bars were all in the same moment put up to the windows and archer when he had tried them all and seen that they were secure gave a loud huzzain which he was joined by all the party most manfullyby all but the poor greybeard who the picture of astonishment stood stock still in the midst of them with his books under his arm at which spectacle townsend who enjoyed the frolic of the fray more than anything else burst into an immoderate fit of laughter so my little greybeard said he holding a candle full in his eyes what think you of all thishow came you amongst the wicked ones i dont know indeed said the little boy very gravely you shut me up amongst you wont you let me out let you out no no my little greybeard said archer catching hold of him and dragging him to the window bars look ye heretouch theseput your hand to thempull push kickput a little spirit into it mankick like an archer if you can away with ye its a pity that the king of the greybeards is not here to admire me i should like to show him our fortifications but come my merry men all now to the feast out with the table into the middle of the room good cheer my jolly archers im your manager townsend delighted with the bustle rubbed his hands and capered about the room whilst the preparations for the feast were hurried forward four candlesfour candles on the table lets have things in style when we are about it mr manager cried townsend placesplaces theres nothing like a fair scramble my boys let everyone take care of himself hallo greybeard ive knocked greybeard down here in the scuffle get up again my lad and see a little life no no cried fisher he shant sup with us no no cried the manager he shant live with us a greybeard is not fit company for archers no no cried townsend evil communication corrupts good manners so with one unanimous hiss they hunted the poor little gentle boy into a corner and having pent him up with benches fisher opened his books for him which he thought the greatest mortification and set up a candle beside himthere now he looks like a greybeard as he is cried they tell me whats the latin for cold roast beef said fisher exultingly and they returned to their feast long and loud they revelled they had a few bottles of cider give me the corkscrew the cider shant be kept till its sour cried townsend in answer to the manager who when he beheld the provisions vanishing with surprising rapidity began to fear for the morrow hang to morrow cried townsend let greybeards think of to morrow mr manager heres your good health the archers all stood up as their cups were filled to drink the health of their chief with a universal cheer but at the moment that the cups were at their lips and as archer bowed to thank the company a sudden shower from above astonished the whole assembly they looked up and beheld the rose of a watering engine whose long neck appeared through a trap door in the ceiling your good health mr manager said a voice which was known to be the gardeners and in the midst of their surprise and dismay the candles were suddenly extinguished the trap door shut down and they were left in utter darkness the devil said archer dont swear mr manager said the same voice from the ceiling i hear every word you say mercy upon us exclaimed fisher the clock added he whispering must have been wrong for it had not done striking when we began only you remember archer it had just done before you had done locking your door hold your tongue blockhead said archer well boys were ye never in the dark before you are not afraid of a shower of rain i hope is anybody drowned no said they with a faint laugh but what shall we do here in the dark all night long and all day to morrow we cant unbar the shutters its a wonder nobody ever thought of the trap door said townsend the trap door had indeed escaped the managers observation as the house was new to him and the ceiling being newly white washed the opening was scarcely perceptible vexed to be out generalled and still more vexed to have it remarked archer poured forth a volley of incoherent exclamations and reproaches against those who were thus so soon discouraged by a trifle and groping for the tinder box he asked if anything could be easier than to strike a light again the light appeared but at the moment that it made the tinder box visible another shower from above aimed and aimed exactly at the tinder box drenched it with water and rendered it totally unfit for further service archer in a fury dashed it to the ground and now for the first time he felt what it was to be the unsuccessful head of a party he heard in his turn the murmurs of a discontented changeable populace and recollecting all his bars and bolts and ingenious contrivances he was more provoked at their blaming him for this one only oversight than he was grieved at the disaster itself oh my hair is all wet cried one dolefully wring it then said archer my hands cut with your broken glass cried another glass cried a third mercy is there broken glass and its all about i suppose amongst the supper and i had but one bit of bread all the time bread cried archer eat if you want it heres a piece here and no glass near it its all wet and i dont like dry bread by itself thats no feast heigh day what nothing but moaning and grumbling if these are the joys of a barring out cried townsend id rather be snug in my bed i expected that we should have sat up till twelve oclock talking and laughing and singing so you may still what hinders you said archer sing and well join you and i should be glad those fellows overhead heard us singing begin townsend come now all ye social powers spread your influence oer us or else rule britannia britannia rules the waves britons never will be slaves nothing can be more melancholy than forced merriment in vain they roared in chorus in vain they tried to appear gay it would not do the voices died away and dropped off one by one they had each provided himself with a great coat to sleep upon but now in the dark there was a peevish scrambling contest for the coats and half the company in very bad humour stretched themselves upon the benches for the night there is great pleasure in bearing anything that has the appearance of hardship as long as there is any glory to be acquired by it but when people feel themselves foiled there is no further pleasure in endurance and if in their misfortune there is any mixture of the ridiculous the motives for heroism are immediately destroyed dr middleton had probably considered this in the choice he made of his first attack archer who had spent the night as a man who had the cares of government upon his shoulders rose early in the morning whilst everybody else was fast asleep in the night he had resolved the affair of the trap door and a new danger had alarmed him it was possible that the enemy might descend upon them through the trap door the room had been built high to admit a free circulation of air it was twenty feet so that it was in vain to think of reaching to the trap door as soon as the daylight appeared archer rose softly that he might reconnoitre and devise some method of guarding against this new danger luckily there were round holes in the top of the window shutters which admitted sufficient light for him to work by the remains of the soaked feast wet candles and broken glass spread over the table in the middle of the room looked rather dismal this morning a pretty set of fellows i have to manage said archer contemplating the group of sleepers before him it is well they have somebody to think for them now if i wantedwhich thank goodness i dontbut if i did want to call a cabinet council to my assistance whom could i pitch upon not this stupid snorer who is dreaming of gipsies if he is dreaming of anything continued archer as he looked into fishers open mouth this next chap is quick enough but then he is so fond of having everything his own way and this curl pated monkey who is grinning in his sleep is all tongue and no brains here are brains though nobody would think it in this lump said he looking at a fat rolled up heavy breathing sleeper but what signify brains to such a lazy dog i might kick him for my football this half hour before i should get him awake this lank jawed harlequin beside him is a handy fellow to be sure but then if he has hands he has no headand hed be afraid of his own shadow too by this light he is such a coward and townsend why he has puns in plenty but when theres any work to be done hes the worst fellow to be near one in the worldhe can do nothing but laugh at his own puns this poor little fellow that we hunted into the corner has more sense than all of them put together but then he is a greybeard thus speculated the chief of a party upon his sleeping friends and how did it happen that he should be so ambitious to please and govern this set when for each individual of which it was composed he felt such supreme contempt he had formed them into a party had given them a name and he was at their head if these be not good reasons none better can be assigned for archers conduct i wish ye could all sleep on said he but i must waken ye though you will be only in my way the sound of my hammering must waken them so i may as well do the thing handsomely and flatter some of them by pretending to ask their advice accordingly he pulled two or three to waken them come townsend waken my boy heres some diversion for youup up diversion cried townsend im your man im upup to anything so under the name of diversion archer set townsend to work at four oclock in the morning they had nails a few tools and several spars still left from the wreck of the playhouse these by archers directions they sharpened at one end and nailed them to the ends of several forms all hands were now called to clear away the supper things to erect these forms perpendicularly under the trap door and with the assistance of a few braces a chevaux de frise was formed upon which nobody could venture to descend at the farthest end of the room they likewise formed a penthouse of the tables under which they proposed to breakfast secure from the pelting storm if it should again assail them through the trap door they crowded under the penthouse as soon as it was ready and their admiration of its ingenuity paid the workmen for the job lord i shall like to see the gardeners phiz through the trap door when he beholds the spikes under him cried townsend now for breakfast ay now for breakfast said archer looking at his watch past eight oclock and my town boys not come i dont understand this archer had expected a constant supply of provisions from two boys who lived in the town who were cousins of his and who had promised to come every day and put food in at a certain hole in the wall in which a ventilator usually turned this ventilator archer had taken down and had contrived it so that it could be easily removed and replaced at pleasure but upon examination it was now perceived that the hole had been newly stopped up by an iron back which it was impossible to penetrate or remove it never came into my head that anybody would ever have thought of the ventilator but myself exclaimed archer in great perplexity he listened and waited for his cousins but no cousins came and at a late hour the company were obliged to breakfast upon the scattered fragments of the last nights feast that feast had been spread with such imprudent profusion that little now remained to satisfy the hungry guests archer who well knew the effect which the apprehension of a scarcity would have upon his associates did everything that could be done by a bold countenance and reiterated assertions to persuade them that his cousins would certainly come at last and that the supplies were only delayed the delay however was alarming fisher alone heard the managers calculations and saw the public fears unmoved secretly rejoicing in his own wisdom he walked from window to window slily listening for the gipsys signal there it is cried he with more joy sparkling in his eyes than had ever enlightened them before come this way archer but dont tell anybody hark do ye hear those three taps at the window this is the old woman with twelve buns for me ill give you one whole one for yourself if you will unbar the window for me unbar the window interrupted archer no that i wont for you or the gipsy either but i have heard enough to get your buns without that but stay there is something of more consequence than your twelve buns i must think for ye all i see regularly so he summoned a council and proposed that everyone should subscribe and trust the subscription to the gipsy to purchase a fresh supply of provisions archer laid down a guinea of his own money for his subscription at which sight all the company clapped their hands and his popularity rose to a high pitch with their renewed hopes of plenty now having made a list of their wants they folded the money in the paper put it into a bag which archer tied to a long string and having broken the pane of glass behind the round hole in the window shutter he let down the bag to the gipsy she promised to be punctual and having filled the bag with fishers twelve buns they were drawn up in triumph and everybody anticipated the pleasure with which they should see the same bag drawn up at dinner time the buns were a little squeezed in being drawn through the hole in the window shutter but archer immediately sawed out a piece of the shutter and broke the corresponding panes in each of the other windows to prevent suspicion and to make it appear that they had all been broken to admit air what a pity that so much ingenuity should have been employed to no purpose it may have surprised the intelligent reader that the gipsy was so punctual to her promise to fisher but we must recollect that her apparent integrity was only cunning she was punctual that she might be employed again that she might be intrusted with the contribution which she foresaw must be raised amongst the famishing garrison no sooner had she received the money than her end was gained dinner time came it struck three four five six they listened with hungry ears but no signal was heard the morning had been very long and archer had in vain tried to dissuade them from devouring the remainder of the provisions before they were sure of a fresh supply and now those who had been the most confident were the most impatient of their disappointment archer in the division of the food had attempted by the most scrupulous exactness to content the public and he was both astonished and provoked to perceive that his impartiality was impeached so differently do people judge in different situations he was the first person to accuse his master of injustice and the least capable of bearing such an imputation upon himself from others he now experienced some of the joys of power and the delight of managing unreasonable numbers have not i done everything i could to please you have not i spent my money to buy you food have not i divided the last morsel with you i have not tasted one mouthful to day did not i set to work for you at sunrise did not i lie awake all night for you have not i had all the labour and all the anxiety look round and see my contrivances my work my generosity and after all you think me a tyrant because i want you to have common sense is not this bun which i hold in my hand my own did not i earn it by my own ingenuity from that selfish dunce pointing to fisher who could never have gotten one of his twelve buns if i had not shown him how eleven of them he has eaten since morning for his own share without offering anyone a morsel but i scorn to eat even what is justly my own when i see so many hungry creatures longing for it i was not going to touch this last morsel myself i only begged you to keep it till supper time when perhaps youll want it more and townsend who cant bear the slightest thing that crosses his own whims and who thinks theres nothing in this world to be minded but his own diversion calls me a tyrant you all of you promised to obey me the first thing i ask you to do for your own good and when if you had common sense you must know i can want nothing but your good you rebel against me traitors fools ungrateful fools archer walked up and down unable to command his emotion whilst for the moment the discontented multitude was silenced here said he striking his hand upon the little boys shoulder heres the only one amongst you who has not uttered one word of reproach or complaint and he has had but one bit of breada bit that i gave him myself this day here said he snatching the bun which nobody had dared to touch take itits minei give it to you though you are a greybeard you deserve it eat it and be an archer you shall be my captain will you said he lifting him up in his arm above the rest i like you now said the little boy courageously but i love de grey better he has always been my friend and he advised me never to call myself any of those names archer or greybeard so i wont though i am shut in here i have nothing to do with it i love dr middleton he was never unjust to me and i daresay that he has very good reasons as de grey said for forbidding us to go into that house besides its his own instead of admiring the good sense and steadiness of this little lad archer suffered townsend to snatch the untasted bun out of his hands he flung it at a hole in the window but it fell back the archers scrambled for it and fisher ate it archer saw this and was sensible that he had not done handsomely in suffering it a few moments ago he had admired his own generosity and though he had felt the injustice of others he had not accused himself of any he turned away from the little boy and sitting down at one end of the table hid his face in his hands he continued immovable in this posture for some time lord said townsend it was an excellent joke pooh said fisher what a fool to think so much about a bun never mind mr archer if you are thinking about me said the little boy trying gently to pull his hands from his face archer stooped down and lifted him up upon the table at which sight the partisans set up a general hiss he has forsaken us he deserts his party he wants to be a greybeard after he has got us all into this scrape he will leave us i am not going to leave you cried archer no one shall ever accuse me of deserting my party ill stick by the archers right or wrong i tell you to the last moment but this little fellowtake it as you please mutiny if you will and throw me out of the window call me traitor coward greybeardthis little fellow is worth you all put together and ill stand by him against anyone who dares to lay a finger upon him and the next morsel of food that i see shall be his touch him who dares the commanding air with which archer spoke and looked and the belief that the little boy deserved his protection silenced the crowd but the storm was only hushed no sound of merriment was now to be heardno battledore and shuttlecockno ball no marbles some sat in a corner whispering their wishes that archer would unbar the doors and give up others stretching their arms and gaping as they sauntered up and down the room wished for air or food or water fisher and his nine who had such firm dependence upon the gipsy now gave themselves up to utter despair it was eight oclock growing darker and darker every minute and no candles no light could they have the prospect of another long dark night made them still more discontented townsend at the head of the yawners and fisher at the head of the hungry malcontents gathered round archer and the few yet unconquered spirits demanding how long he meant to keep them in this dark dungeon and whether he expected that they should starve themselves for his sake the idea of giving up was more intolerable to archer than all the rest he saw that the majority his own convincing argument was against him he was therefore obliged to condescend to the arts of persuasion he flattered some with hopes of food from the town boys some he reminded of their promises others he praised for former prowess and others he shamed by the repetition of their high vaunts in the beginning of the business it was at length resolved that at all events they would hold out with this determination they stretched themselves again to sleep for the second night in weak and weary obstinacy archer slept longer and more soundly than usual the next morning and when he awoke he found his hands tied behind him three or four boys had just got hold of his feet which they pressed down whilst the trembling hands of fisher were fastening the cord round them with all the force which rage could inspire archer struggled and roared to his archershis friends his partyfor help against the traitors but all kept aloof townsend in particular stood laughing and looking on i beg your pardon archer but really you look so droll all alive and kicking dont be angry im so weak i cannot help laughing to day the packthread cracked his hands are free hes loose cried the least of the boys and ran away whilst archer leaped up and seizing hold of fisher with a powerful grasp sternly demanded what he meant by this ask my party said fisher terrified they set me on ask my party your party cried archer with a look of ineffable contempt you reptileyour party can such a thing as you have a party to be sure said fisher settling his collar which archer in his surprise had let go to be sure why not any man who chooses it may have a party as well as yourself i suppose i have nine fishermen at these words spoken with much sullen importance archer in spite of his vexation could not help laughing fishermen cried he fishermen and why not fishermen as well as archers cried they one party is just as good as another it is only a question which can get the upper hand and we had your hands tied just now thats right townsend said archer laugh on my boy friend or foe its all the same to you i know how to value your friendship now you are a mighty good fellow when the sun shines but let a storm come and how you slink away at this instant archer felt the difference between a good companion and a good friend a difference which some people do not discover till late in life have i no friendno real friend amongst you all and could ye stand by and see my hands tied behind me like a thiefs what signifies such a partyall mute we want something to eat answered the fishermen what signifies such a party indeed and such a manager who can do nothing for one and have i done nothing dont lets hear any more prosing said fisher we are too many for you ive advised my party if theyve a mind not to be starved to give you up for the ringleader as you were and dr middleton will not let us all off i daresay so depending upon the sullen silence of the assembly he again approached archer with a cord a cry of no no no dont tie him was feebly raised archer stood still but the moment fisher touched him he knocked him down to the ground and turning to the rest with eyes sparkling with indignation archers cried he a voice at this instant was heard at the door it was de greys voice i have got a large basket of provisions for your breakfast a general shout of joy was sent forth by the voracious public breakfast provisions a large basket de grey for ever huzza de grey promised upon his honour that if he would unbar the door nobody should come in with him and no advantage should be taken of them this promise was enough even for archer i will let him in said he myself for im sure hell never break his word he pulled away the bar the door opened and having bargained for the liberty of melson the little boy who had been shut in by mistake de grey entered with his basket of provisions when he locked and barred the door instantly joy and gratitude sparkled in every face when he unpacked his basket and spread the table with a plentiful breakfast a hundred questions were asked him at once eat first said he and we will talk afterwards this business was quickly despatched by those who had not tasted food for a long while their curiosity increased as their hunger diminished who sent us breakfast does dr middleton know were questions reiterated from every mouth he does know answered de grey and the first thing i have to tell you is that i am your fellow prisoner i am to stay here till you give up this was the only condition on which dr middleton would allow me to bring you food and he will allow no more everyone looked at the empty basket but archer in whom half vanquished party spirit revived with the strength he had got from his breakfast broke into exclamations in praise of de greys magnanimity as he now imagined that de grey had become one of themselves and you will join us will you thats a noble fellow no answered de grey calmly but i hope to persuade or rather to convince you that you ought to join me you would have found it no hard task to have persuaded or convinced us whichever you pleased said townsend if you had appealed to archers fasting but archers feasting are quite other animals even csar himself after breakfast is quite another thing added he pointing to archer you may speak for yourself mr townsend replied the insulted hero but not for me or for archers in general if you please we unbarred the door upon the faith of de greys promisethat was not giving up and it would have been just as difficult i promise you to persuade or convince me either that i should give up against my honour before breakfast as after this spirited speech was applauded by many who had now forgotten the feelings of famine not so fisher whose memory was upon this occasion very distinct what nonsense and the orator paused for a synonymous expression but none was at hand what nonsense andnonsense is here why dont you remember that dinner time and supper time and breakfast time will come again so what signifies mouthing about persuading and convincing we will not go through again what we did yesterday honour me no honour i dont understand it id rather be flogged at once as i have been manys the good time for a less thing i say wed better all be flogged at once which must be the end of it sooner or later than wait here to be without dinner breakfast and supper all only because mr archer wont give up because of his honour and nonsense many prudent faces amongst the fishermen seemed to deliberate at the close of this oration in which the arguments were brought so home to each mans business and bosom but said de grey when we yield i hope it will not be merely to get our dinner gentlemen when we yield archer dont address yourself to me interrupted archer struggling with his pride you have no further occasion to try to win me i have no power no party you see and now i find that i have no friends i dont care what becomes of myself i suppose im to be given up as a ringleader heres this fisher and a party of his fishermen were going to tie me hand and foot if i had not knocked him down just as you came to the door de grey and now perhaps you will join fishers party against me de grey was going to assure him that he had no intention of joining any party when a sudden change appeared on archers countenance silence cried archer in an imperious tone and there was silence someone was heard to whistle the beginning of a tune that was perfectly new to everybody present except to archer who immediately whistled the conclusion there cried he looking at de grey with triumph thats a method of holding secret correspondence whilst a prisoner which i learned from richard cur de lion i know how to make use of everything hallo friend are you there at last cried he going to the ventilator yes but we are barred out here round to the window then and fill our bag well let it down my lad in a trice bar me out who can archer let down the bag with all the expedition of joy and it was filled with all the expedition of fear pull away make haste for heavens sake said the voice from without the gardener will come from dinner else and we shall be caught he mounted guard all yesterday at the ventilator and though i watched and watched till it was darker than pitch i could not get near you i dont know what has taken him out of the way now make haste pull away the heavy bag was soon pulled up have you any more said archer yes plenty let down quick ive got the tailors bag full which is three times as large as yours and ive changed clothes with the tailors boy so nobody took notice of me as i came down the street theres my own cousin exclaimed archer theres a noble fellow theres my own cousin i acknowledge fill the bag then several times the bag descended and ascended and at every unlading of the crane fresh acclamations were heard i have no more at length the boy with the tailors bag cried off with you then weve enough and thank you a delightful review was now made of their treasure busy hands arranged and sorted the heterogeneous mass archer in the height of his glory looked on the acknowledged master of the whole townsend who in his prosperity as in adversity saw and enjoyed the comic foibles of his friends pushed de grey who was looking on with a more good natured and more thoughtful air friend said he you look like a great philosopher and archer a great hero and you townsend said archer may look like a wit if you will but you will never be a hero no no replied townsend wits were never heroes because they are wits you are out of your wits and therefore may set up for a hero laugh and welcome im not a tyrant i dont want to restrain anybodys wit but i cannot say i admire puns nor i either said the time serving fisher sidling up to the manager and picking the ice off a piece of plum cake nor i either i hate puns i can never understand townsends puns besides anybody can make puns and one doesnt want wit either at all times for instance when one is going to settle about dinner or business of consequence bless us all archer continued he with sudden familiarity what a sight of good things are here im sure we are much obliged to you and your cousin i never thought hed have come why now we can hold out as long as you please let us see said he dividing the provisions upon the table we can hold out to day and all to morrow and part of next day maybe why now we may defy the doctor and the greybeards the doctor will surely give up to us for you see he knows nothing of all this and hell think we are starving all this while and hed be afraid you see to let us starve quite in reality for three whole days because of what would be said in the town my aunt barbara for one would be at him long before that time was out and besides you know in that case hed be hanged for murder which is quite another thing in law from a barring out you know archer had not given to this harangue all the attention which it deserved for his eye was fixed upon de grey what is de grey thinking of he asked impatiently i am thinking said de grey that dr middleton must believe that i have betrayed his confidence in me the gardener was ordered away from his watch post for one half hour when i was admitted this half hour the gardener has made nearly a hour i never would have come near you if i had foreseen all this dr middleton trusted me and now he will repent of his confidence in me de grey cried archer with energy he shall not repent of his confidence in younor shall you repent of coming amongst us you shall find that we have some honour as well as yourself and i will take care of your honour as if it were my own hey day interrupted townsend are heroes allowed to change sides pray and does the chief of the archers stand talking sentiment to the chief of the greybeards in the middle of his own party too party repeated archer disdainfully i have done with parties i see what parties are made of i have felt the want of a friend and i am determined to make one if i can that you may do said de grey stretching out his hand unbar the doors unbar the windows exclaimed archer away with all these things i give up for de greys sake he shall not lose his credit on my account no said de grey you shall not give up for my sake well then ill give up to do what is honourable said archer why not to do what is reasonable said de grey reasonable oh the first thing that a man of spirit should think of is what is honourable but how will he find out what is honourable unless he can reason replied de grey oh said archer his own feelings always tell him what is honourable have not your feelings asked de grey changed within these few hours yes with circumstances replied archer but right or wrong as long as i think it honourable to do so and so im satisfied but you cannot think anything honourable or the contrary observed de grey without reasoning and as to what you call feeling its only a quick sort of reasoning the quicker the better said archer perhaps not said de grey we are apt to reason best when we are not in quite so great a hurry but said archer we have not always time enough to reason at first you must however acknowledge replied de grey smiling that no man but a fool thinks it honourable to be in the wrong at last is it not therefore best to begin by reasoning to find out the right at first to be sure said archer and did you reason with yourself at first and did you find out that it was right to bar dr middleton out of his own schoolroom because he desired you not to go into one of his own houses no replied archer but i should never have thought of heading a barring out if he had not shown partiality and if you had flown into a passion with me openly at once for pulling down your scenery which would have been quite natural and not have gone slily and forbid us the house out of revenge there would have been none of this work why said de grey should you suspect me of such a mean action when you have never seen or known me do anything mean and when in this instance you have no proofs will you give me your word and honour now de grey before everybody here that you did not do what i suspected i do assure you upon my honour i never indirectly spoke to dr middleton about the playhouse then said archer im as glad as if i had found a thousand pounds now you are my friend indeed and dr middletonwhy should you suspect him without reason any more than me as to that said archer he is your friend and you are right to defend him and i wont say another word against him will that satisfy you not quite not quite then indeed you are unreasonable no replied de grey for i dont wish you to yield out of friendship to me any more than to honour if you yield to reason you will be governed by reason another time well but then dont triumph over me because you have the best side of the argument not i how can i said de grey for now you are on the best side as well as myself are not you so we may triumph together you are a good friend said archer and with great eagerness he pulled down the fortifications whilst every hand assisted the room was restored to order in a few minutesthe shutters were thrown open the cheerful light let in the windows were thrown up and the first feeling of the fresh air was delightful the green playgound opened before them and the hopes of exercise and liberty brightened the countenances of these voluntary prisoners but alas they were not yet at liberty the idea of dr middleton and the dread of his vengeance smote their hearts when the rebels had sent an ambassador with their surrender they stood in pale and silent suspense waiting for their doom ah said fisher looking up at the broken panes in the windows the doctor will think the most of thathell never forgive us for that hush here he comes his steady step was heard approaching nearer and nearer archer threw open the door and dr middleton entered fisher instantly fell on his knees it is no delight to me to see people on their knees stand up mr fisher i hope you are all conscious that you have done wrong sir said archer they are conscious that they have done wrong and so am i i am the ringleader punish me as you think proper i submit your punishmentsyour vengeance ought to fall on me alone sir said dr middleton calmly i perceive that whatever else you may have learned in the course of your education you have not been taught the meaning of the word punishment punishment and vengeance do not with us mean the same thing punishment is pain given with the reasonable hope of preventing those on whom it is inflicted from doing in future what will hurt themselves or others vengeance never looks to the future but is the expression of anger for an injury that is past i feel no anger you have done me no injury here many of the little boys looked timidly up to the windows yes i see that you have broken my windows that is a small evil oh sir how good how merciful exclaimed those who had been most panic struck he forgives us stay resumed dr middleton i cannot forgive you i shall never revenge but it is my duty to punish you have rebelled against the just authority which is necessary to conduct and govern you whilst you have not sufficient reason to govern and conduct yourselves without obedience to the laws added he turning to archer as men you cannot be suffered in society you sir think yourself a man i observe and you think it the part of a man not to submit to the will of another i have no pleasure in making others whether men or children submit to my will but my reason and experience are superior to yours your parents at least think so or they would not have intrusted me with the care of your education as long as they do intrust you to my care and as long as i have any hopes of making you wiser and better by punishment i shall steadily inflict it whenever i judge it to be necessary and i judge it to be necessary now this is a long sermon mr archer not preached to show my own eloquence but to convince your understanding now as to your punishment name it sir said archer whatever it is i will cheerfully submit to it name it yourself said dr middleton and show me that you now understand the nature of punishment archer proud to be treated like a reasonable creature and sorry that he had behaved like a foolish schoolboy was silent for some time but at length replied that he would rather not name his own punishment he repeated however that he trusted he should bear it well whatever it might be i shall then said dr middleton deprive you for two months of pocket money as you have had too much and have made a bad use of it sir said archer i brought five guineas with me to school this guinea is all that i have left dr middleton received the guinea which archer offered him with a look of approbation and told him that it should be applied to the repairs of the schoolroom the rest of the boys waited in silence for the doctors sentence against them but not with those looks of abject fear with which boys usually expect the sentence of a schoolmaster you shall return from the playground all of you said dr middleton one quarter of an hour sooner for two months to come than the rest of your companions a bell shall ring at the appointed time i give you an opportunity of recovering my confidence by your punctuality oh sir we will come the instant the very instant the bell rings you shall have confidence in us cried they eagerly i deserve your confidence i hope said dr middleton for it is my first wish to make you all happy you do not know the pain that it has cost me to deprive you of food for so many hours here the boys with one accord ran to the place where they had deposited their last supplies archer delivered them up to the doctor proud to show that they were not reduced to obedience merely by necessity the reason resumed dr middleton having now returned to the usual benignity of his mannerthe reason why i desired that none of you should go to that building pointing out of the window was thisi had been informed that a gang of gipsies had slept there the night before i spoke to you one of whom was dangerously ill of a putrid fever i did not choose to mention my reason to you or your friends i have had the place cleaned and you may return to it when you please the gipsies were yesterday removed from the town de grey you were in the right whispered archer and it was i that was unjust the old woman continued the doctor whom you employed to buy food has escaped the fever but she has not escaped a gaol whither she was sent yesterday for having defrauded you of your money mr fisher said dr middleton as to you i shall not punish you i have no hope of making you either wiser or better do you know this paperthe paper appeared to be a bill for candles and a tinder box i desired him to buy those things sir said archer colouring and did you desire him not to pay for them no said archer he had half a crown on purpose to pay for them i know he had but he chose to apply it to his private use and gave it to the gipsy to buy twelve buns for his own eating to obtain credit for the tinder box and candles he made use of this name said he turning to the other side of the bill and pointing to de greys name which was written at the end of a copy of one of de greys exercises i assure you sir cried archer you need not assure me sir said dr middleton i cannot suspect a boy of your temper of having any part in so base an action when the people in the shop refused to let mr fisher have the things without paying for them he made use of de greys name who was known there suspecting some mischief however from the purchase of the tinder box the shopkeeper informed me of the circumstance nothing in this whole business gave me half so much pain as i felt for a moment when i suspected that de grey was concerned in it a loud cry in which archers voice was heard most distinctly declared de greys innocence dr middleton looked round at their eager honest faces with benevolent approbation archer said he taking him by the hand i am heartily glad to see that you have got the better of your party spirit i wish you may keep such a friend as you have now beside you one such friend is worth two such parties as for you mr fisher depart you must never return hither again in vain he solicited archer and de grey to intercede for him everybody turned away with contempt and he sneaked out whimpering in a doleful voice what shall i say to my aunt barbara the bracelets in a beautiful and retired part of england lived mrs villars a lady whose accurate understanding benevolent heart and steady temper peculiarly fitted her for the most difficult as well as most important of all occupationsthe education of youth this task she had undertaken and twenty young persons were put under her care with the perfect confidence of their parents no young people could be happier they were good and gay emulous but not envious of each other for mrs villars was impartially just her praise they felt to be the reward of merit and her blame they knew to be the necessary consequence of ill conduct to the one therefore they patiently submitted and in the other consciously rejoiced they rose with fresh cheerfulness in the morning eager to pursue their various occupations they returned in the evening with renewed ardour to their amusements and retired to rest satisfied with themselves and pleased with each other nothing so much contributed to preserve a spirit of emulation in this little society as a small honorary distinction given annually as a prize of successful application the prize this year was peculiarly dear to each individual as it was the picture of a friend whom they dearly loved it was the picture of mrs villars in a small bracelet it wanted neither gold pearls nor precious stones to give it value the two foremost candidates for this prize were cecilia and leonora cecilia was the most intimate friend of leonora but leonora was only the favourite companion of cecilia cecilia was of an active ambitious enterprising disposition more eager in the pursuit than happy in the enjoyment of her wishes leonora was of a contented unaspiring temperate character not easily roused to action but indefatigable when once excited leonora was proud cecilia was vain her vanity made her more dependent upon the approbation of others and therefore more anxious to please than leonora but that very vanity made her at the same time more apt to offend in short leonora was the most anxious to avoid what was wrong cecilia the most ambitious to do what was right few of her companions loved but many were led by cecilia for she was often successful many loved leonora but none were ever governed by her for she was too indolent to govern on the first day of may about six oclock in the evening a great bell rang to summon this little society into a hall where the prize was to be decided a number of small tables were placed in a circle in the middle of the hall seats for the young competitors were raised one above another in a semicircle some yards distant from the table and the judges chairs under canopies of lilacs and laburnums forming another semicircle closed the amphitheatre everyone put their writings their drawings their works of various kinds upon the tables appropriated for each how unsteady were the last steps to these tables how each little hand trembled as it laid down its claims till this moment everyone thought herself secure of success and the heart which exulted with hope now palpitated with fear the works were examined the preference adjudged and the prize was declared to be the happy cecilias mrs villars came forward smiling with the bracelet in her hand cecilia was behind her companions on the highest row all the others gave way and she was on the floor in an instant mrs villars clasped the bracelet on her arm the clasp was heard through the whole hall and a universal smile of congratulation followed mrs villars kissed cecilias little hand and now said she go and rejoice with your companions the remainder of the day is yours oh you whose hearts are elated with success whose bosoms beat high with joy in the moment of triumph command yourselves let that triumph be moderate that it may be lasting consider that though you are good you may be better and though wise you may be weak as soon as mrs villars had given her the bracelet all cecilias little companions crowded round her and they all left the hall in an instant she was full of spirits and vanity she ran on running down the flight of steps which led to the garden in her violent haste cecilia threw down the little louisa who had a china mandarin in her hand which her mother had sent her that very morning and which was all broken to pieces by her fall oh my mandarin cried louisa bursting into tears the crowd behind cecilia suddenly stopped louisa sat on the lowest step fixing her eyes upon the broken pieces then turning round she hid her face in her hands upon the step above her in turning louisa threw down the remains of the mandarin the head which she placed in the socket fell from the shoulders and rolled bounding along the gravel walk cecilia pointed to the head and to the socket and burst into laughter the crowd behind laughed too at any other time they would have been more inclined to cry with louisa but cecilia had just been successful and sympathy with the victorious often makes us forget justice leonora however preserved her usual consistency poor louisa said she looking first at her and then reproachfully at cecilia cecilia turned sharply round colouring half with shame and half with vexation i could not help it leonora said she but you could have helped laughing cecilia i didnt laugh at louisa and i surely may laugh for it does nobody any harm i am sure however replied leonora i should not have laughed if i had no to be sure you wouldnt because louisa is your favourite i can buy her another mandarin when the old peddler comes to the door if thats all i can do no more can i said she again turning round to her companions no to be sure said they thats all fair cecilia looked triumphantly at leonora leonora let go her hand she ran on and the crowd followed when she got to the end of the garden she turned round to see if leonora had followed her too but was vexed to see her still sitting on the steps with louisa im sure i can do no more than buy her another can i said she again appealing to her companions no to be sure said they eager to begin their play how many games did these juvenile playmates begin and leave off before cecilia could be satisfied with any her thoughts were discomposed and her mind was running upon something else no wonder then that she did not play with her usual address she grew still more impatient she threw down the ninepins come let us play at something elseat threading the needle said she holding out her hand they all yielded to the hand which wore the bracelet but cecilia dissatisfied with herself was discontented with everybody else her tone grew more and more peremptory one was too rude another too stiff one too slow another too quick in short everything went wrong and everybody was tired of her humours the triumph of success is absolute but short cecilias companions at length recollected that though she had embroidered a tulip and painted a peach better than they yet that they could play as well and keep their tempers better for she was discomposed walking towards the house in a peevish mood cecilia met leonora but passed on cecilia cried leonora well what do you want with me are we friends you know best said cecilia we are if you will let me tell louisa that you are sorry cecilia interrupting her oh pray let me hear no more about louisa what not confess that you were in the wrong oh cecilia i had a better opinion of you your opinion is of no consequence to me now for you dont love me no not when you are unjust cecilia unjust i am not unjust and if i were you are not my governess no but am not i your friend i dont desire to have such a friend who would quarrel with me for happening to throw down little louisa how could i tell that she had a mandarin in her hand and when it was broken could i do more than promise her another was that unjust but you know cecilia i know ironically i know leonora that you love louisa better than you love me thats the injustice if i did replied leonora gravely it would be no injustice if she deserved it better how can you compare louisa to me exclaimed cecilia indignantly leonora made no answer for she was really hurt at her friends conduct she walked on to join the rest of her companions they were dancing in a round upon the grass leonora declined dancing but they prevailed upon her to sing for them her voice was not so sprightly but it was sweeter than usual who sang so sweetly as leonora or who danced so nimbly as louisa away she was flying all spirits and gaiety when leonoras eyes full of tears caught hers louisa silently let go her companions hand and quitting the dance ran up to leonora to inquire what was the matter with her nothing replied she that need interrupt you go my dear go and dance again louisa immediately ran away to her garden and pulling off her little straw hat she lined it with the freshest strawberry leaves and was upon her knees before the strawberry bed when cecilia came by cecilia was not disposed to be pleased with louisa at that instant for two reasons because she was jealous of her and because she had injured her the injury however louisa had already forgotten perhaps to tell things just as they were she was not quite so much inclined to kiss cecilia as she would have been before the fall of her mandarin but this was the utmost extent of her malice if it can be called malice what are you doing there little one said cecilia in a sharp tone are you eating your early strawberries here all alone no said louisa mysteriously i am not eating them what are you doing with them cant you answer then im not playing with you child oh as to that cecilia you know i need not answer you unless i choose it not but what i would if you would only ask me civilly and if you would not call me child why should not i call you child becausebecausei dont know but i wish you would stand out of my light cecilia for you are trampling upon all my strawberries i have not touched one you covetous little creature indeedindeed cecilia i am not covetous i have not eaten one of them they are all for your friend leonora see how unjust you are unjust thats a cant word which you learnt of my friend leonora as you call her but she is not my friend now not your friend now exclaimed louisa then i am sure you must have done something very naughty how cried cecilia catching hold of her let me go let me go cried louisa struggling i wont give you one of my strawberries for i dont like you at all you dont dont you cried cecilia provoked and catching the hat from louisa she flung the strawberries over the hedge will nobody help me exclaimed louisa snatching her hat again and running away with all her force what have i done said cecilia recollecting herself louisa louisa she called very loud but louisa would not turn back she was running to her companions who were still dancing hand in hand upon the grass whilst leonora sitting in the middle was singing to them stop stop and hear me cried louisa breaking through them and rushing up to leonora she threw her hat at her feet and panting for breathit was fullalmost full of my own strawberries said she the first i ever got out of my garden they should all have been for you leonora but now i have not one left they are all gone said she and she hid her face in leonoras lap gone gone where said everyone at once running up to her cecilia cecilia said she sobbing cecilia repeated leonora what of cecilia yes it wasit was come with me said leonora unwilling to have her friend exposed come and i will get you some more strawberries oh i dont mind the strawberries indeed but i wanted to have had the pleasure of giving them to you leonora took her up in her arms to carry her away but it was too late what cecilia cecilia who won the prize it could not surely be cecilia whispered every busy tongue at this instant the bell summoned them in there she is there she is cried they pointing to an arbour where cecilia was standing ashamed and alone and as they passed her some lifted up their hands and eyes with astonishment others whispered and huddled mysteriously together as if to avoid her leonora walked on her head a little higher than usual leonora said cecilia timorously as she passed oh cecilia who would have thought that you had a bad heart cecilia turned her head aside and burst into tears oh no indeed she has not a bad heart cried louisa running up to her and throwing her arms around her neck shes very sorry are not you cecilia but dont cry any more for i forgive you with all my heartand i love you now though i said i did not when i was in a passion oh you sweet tempered girl how i love you said cecilia kissing her well then if you do come along with me and dry your eyes for they are so red go my dear and ill come presently then i will keep a place for you next to me but you must make haste or you will have to come in when we have all sat down to supper and then you will be so stared at so dont stay now cecilia followed louisa with her eyes till she was out of sight and is louisa said she to herself the only one who would stop to pity me mrs villars told me that this day should be mine she little thought how it would end saying these words cecilia threw herself down upon the ground her arm leaned upon a heap of turf which she had raised in the morning and which in the pride and gaiety of her heart she had called her throne at this instant mrs villars came out to enjoy the serenity of the evening and passing by the arbour where cecilia lay she started cecilia rose hastily who is there said mrs villars it is i madam and who is i cecilia why what keeps you here my dear where are your companions this is perhaps one of the happiest days of your life oh no madam said cecilia hardly able to repress her tears why my dear what is the matter cecilia hesitated speak my dear you know that when i ask you to tell me anything as your friend i never punish you as your governess therefore you need not be afraid to tell me what is the matter no madam i am not afraid but ashamed you asked me why i was not with my companions why madam because they have all left me and and what my dear and i see that they all dislike me and yet i dont know why they should for i take as much pains to please as any of them all my masters seem satisfied with me and you yourself madam were pleased this very morning to give me this bracelet and i am sure you would not have given it to anyone who did not deserve it certainly not said mrs villars you well deserve it for your applicationfor your successful application the prize was for the most assiduous not for the most amiable then if it had been for the most amiable it would not have been for me mrs villars smilingwhy what do you think yourself cecilia you are better able to judge than i am i can determine whether or no you apply to what i give you to learn whether you attend to what i desire you to do and avoid what i desire you not to do i know that i like you as a pupil but i cannot know that i should like you as a companion unless i were your companion therefore i must judge of what i should do by seeing what others do in the same circumstances oh pray dont madam for then you would not love me either and yet i think you would love me for i hope that i am as ready to oblige and as good natured as yes cecilia i dont doubt but that you would be very good natured to me but im afraid that i should not like you unless you were good tempered too but madam by good natured i mean good temperedits all the same thing no indeed i understand by them two very different things you are good natured cecilia for you are desirous to oblige and serve your companionsto gain them praise and save them from blameto give them pleasure and relieve them from pain but leonora is good tempered for she can bear with their foibles and acknowledge her own without disputing about the right she sometimes yields to those who are in the wrong in short her temper is perfectly good for it can bear and forbear i wish that mine could said cecilia sighing it may replied mrs villars but it is not wishes alone which can improve us in anything turn the same exertion and perseverance which have won you the prize to day to this object and you will meet with the same success perhaps not on the first the second or the third attempt but depend upon it that you will at last every new effort will weaken your bad habits and strengthen your good ones but you must not expect to succeed all at once i repeat it to you for habit must be counteracted by habit it would be as extravagant in us to expect that all our faults could be destroyed by one punishment were it ever so severe as it was in the roman emperor we were reading of a few days ago to wish that all the heads of his enemies were upon one neck that he might cut them off at one blow here mrs villars took cecilia by the hand and they began to walk home such was the nature of cecilias mind that when any object was forcibly impressed on her imagination it caused a temporary suspension of her reasoning faculties hope was too strong a stimulus for her spirits and when fear did take possession of her mind it was attended with total debility her vanity was now as much mortified as in the morning it had been elated she walked on with mrs villars in silence until they came under the shade of the elm tree walk and there fixing her eyes upon mrs villars she stopped short do you think madam said she with hesitationdo you think madam that i have a bad heart a bad heartmy dear why what put that into your head leonora said that i had madam and i felt ashamed when she said so but my dear how can leonora tell whether your heart be good or bad however in the first place tell me what you mean by a bad heart indeed i do not know what is meant by it madam but it is something which everybody hates and why do they hate it because they think that it will hurt them maam i believe and that those who have bad hearts take delight in doing mischief and that they never do anybody any good but for their own ends then the best definition said mrs villars which you can give me of a bad heart is that it is some constant propensity to hurt others and to do wrong for the sake of doing wrong yes madam but that is not all either there is still something else meant something which i cannot expresswhich indeed i never distinctly understood but of which therefore i was the more afraid well then to begin with what you do understand tell me cecilia do you really think it possible to be wicked merely for the love of wickedness no human being becomes wicked all at once a man begins by doing wrong because it is or because he thinks it for his interest if he continue to do so he must conquer his sense of shame and lose his love of virtue but how can you cecilia who feel such a strong sense of shame and such an eager desire to improve imagine that you have a bad heart indeed madam i never did until everybody told me so and then i began to be frightened about it this very evening madam when i was in a passion i threw little louisas strawberries away which i am sure i was very sorry for afterwards and leonora and everybody cried out that i had a bad heartbut i am sure i was only in a passion very likely and when you are in a passion as you call it cecilia you see that you are tempted to do harm to others if they do not feel angry themselves they do not sympathize with you they do not perceive the motive which actuates you and then they say that you have a bad heart i daresay however when your passion is over and when you recollect yourself you are very sorry for what you have done and said are not you yes indeed madamvery sorry then make that sorry of use to you cecilia and fix it steadily in your thoughts as you hope to be good and happy that if you suffer yourself to yield to your passion upon every occasion anger and its consequences will become familiar to your mind and in the same proportion your sense of shame will be weakened till what you began with doing from sudden impulse you will end with doing from habit and choice then you would indeed according to our definition have a bad heart oh madam i hopei am sure i never shall no indeed cecilia i do indeed believe that you never will on the contrary i think that you have a very good disposition and what is of infinitely more consequence to you an active desire of improvement show me that you have as much perseverance as you have candour and i shall not despair of your becoming everything that i could wish here cecilias countenance brightened and she ran up the steps in almost as high spirits as she ran down them in the morning good night to you cecilia said mrs villars as she was crossing the hall good night to you madam said cecilia and she ran upstairs to bed she could not go to sleep but she lay awake reflecting upon the events of the preceding day and forming resolutions for the future at the same time that she had resolved and resolved without effect she wished to give her mind some more powerful motive ambition she knew to be its most powerful incentive have i not said she to herself already won the prize of application and cannot the same application procure me a much higher prize mrs villars said that if the prize had been promised to the most amiable it would not have been given to me perhaps it would not yesterday perhaps it might not to morrow but that is no reason that i should despair of ever deserving it in consequence of this reasoning cecilia formed a design of proposing to her companions that they should give a prize the first of the ensuing month the st of june to the most amiable mrs villars applauded the scheme and her companions adopted it with the greatest alacrity let the prize said they be a bracelet of our own hair and instantly their shining scissors were produced and each contributed a lock of their hair they formed the most beautiful gradation of colours from the palest auburn to the brightest black who was to have the honour of plaiting them was now the question caroline begged that she might as she could plait very neatly she said cecilia however was equally sure that she could do it much better and a dispute would have inevitably ensued if cecilia recollecting herself just as her colour rose to scarlet had not yieldedyielded with no very good grace indeed but as well as could be expected for the first time for it is habit which confers ease and without ease even in moral actions there can be no grace the bracelet was plaited in the neatest manner by caroline finished round the edge with silver twist and on it was worked in the smallest silver letters this motto to the most amiable the moment it was completed everybody begged to try it on it fastened with little silver clasps and as it was made large enough for the eldest girls it was too large for the youngest of this they bitterly complained and unanimously entreated that it might be cut to fit them how foolish exclaimed cecilia dont you perceive that if any of you win it you have nothing to do but to put the clips a little further from the edge but if we get it we cant make it larger very true said they but you need not to have called us foolish cecilia it was by such hasty and unguarded expressions as these that cecilia offended a slight difference in the manner makes a very material one in the effect cecilia lost more love by general petulance than she could gain by the greatest particular exertions how far she succeeded in curing herself of this defecthow far she became deserving of the bracelet and to whom the bracelet was givenshall be told in the history of the first of june the first of june was now arrived and all the young competitors were in a state of the most anxious suspense leonora and cecilia continued to be the foremost candidates their quarrel had never been finally adjusted and their different pretensions now retarded all thoughts of a reconciliation cecilia though she was capable of acknowledging any of her faults in public before all her companions could not humble herself in private to leonora leonora was her equal they were her inferiors and submission is much easier to a vain mind where it appears to be voluntary than when it is the necessary tribute to justice or candour so strongly did cecilia feel this truth that she even delayed making any apology or coming to any explanation with leonora until success should once more give her the palm if i win the bracelet to day said she to herself i will solicit the return of leonoras friendship it will be more valuable to me than even the bracelet and at such a time and asked in such a manner she surely cannot refuse it to me animated with this hope of a double triumph cecilia canvassed with the most zealous activity by constant attention and exertion she had considerably abated the violence of her temper and changed the course of her habits her powers of pleasing were now excited instead of her abilities to excel and if her talents appeared less brilliant her character was acknowledged to be more amiable so great an influence upon our manners and conduct have the objects of our ambition cecilia was now if possible more than ever desirous of doing what was right but she had not yet acquired sufficient fear of doing wrong this was the fundamental error of her mind it arose in a great measure from her early education her mother died when she was very young and though her father had supplied her place in the best and kindest manner he had insensibly infused into his daughters mind a portion of that enterprising independent spirit which he justly deemed essential to the character of her brother this brother was some years older than cecilia but he had always been the favourite companion of her youth what her fathers precepts inculcated his example enforced and even cecilias virtues consequently became such as were more estimable in a man than desirable in a female all small objects and small errors she had been taught to disregard as trifles and her impatient disposition was perpetually leading her into more material faults yet her candour in confessing these she had been suffered to believe was sufficient reparation and atonement leonora on the contrary who had been educated by her mother in a manner more suited to her sex had a character and virtues more peculiar to a female her judgment had been early cultivated and her good sense employed in the regulation of her conduct she had been habituated to that restraint which as a woman she was to expect in life and early accustomed to yield compliance in her seemed natural and graceful yet notwithstanding the gentleness of her temper she was in reality more independent than cecilia she had more reliance upon her own judgment and more satisfaction in her own approbation the uniform kindness of her manner the consistency and equality of her character had fixed the esteem and passive love of her companions by passive love we mean that species of affection which makes us unwilling to offend rather than anxious to oblige which is more a habit than an emotion of the mind for cecilia her companions felt active love for she was active in showing her love to them active love arises spontaneously in the mind after feeling particular instances of kindness without reflection on the past conduct or general character it exceeds the merits of its object and is connected with a feeling of generosity rather than with a sense of justice without determining which species of love is the most flattering to others we can easily decide which is the most agreeable feeling to our minds we give our hearts more credit for being generous than for being just and we feel more self complacency when we give our love voluntarily than when we yield it as a tribute which we cannot withhold though cecilias companions might not know all this in theory they proved it in practice for they loved her in a much higher proportion to her merits than they loved leonora each of the young judges were to signify their choice by putting a red or a white shell into a vase prepared for the purpose cecilias colour was red leonoras white in the morning nothing was to be seen but these shells nothing talked of but the long expected event of the evening cecilia following leonoras example had made it a point of honour not to inquire of any individual her vote previously to their final determination they were both sitting together in louisas room louisa was recovering from the measles everyone during her illness had been desirous of attending her but leonora and cecilia were the only two that were permitted to see her as they alone had had the distemper they were both assiduous in their care of louisa but leonoras want of exertion to overcome any disagreeable feelings of sensibility often deprived her of presence of mind and prevented her from being so constantly useful as cecilia cecilia on the contrary often made too much noise and bustle with her officious assistance and was too anxious to invent amusements and procure comforts for louisa without perceiving that illness takes away the power of enjoying them as she was sitting at the window in the morning exerting herself to entertain louisa she heard the voice of an old peddler who often used to come to the house downstairs they ran immediately to ask mrs villars permission to bring him into the hall mrs villars consented and away cecilia ran to proclaim the news to her companions then first returning into the hall she found the peddler just unbuckling his box and taking it off his shoulders what would you be pleased to want miss said the peddler ive all kinds of tweezer cases rings and lockets of all sorts continued he opening all the glittering drawers successively oh said cecilia shutting the drawer of lockets which tempted her most these are not the things which i want have you any china figures any mandarins alack a day miss i had a great stock of that same chinaware but now im quite out of them kind of things but i believe said he rummaging one of the deepest drawers i believe i have one left and here it is oh that is the very thing whats its price only three shillings maam cecilia paid the money and was just going to carry off the mandarin when the peddler took out of his great coat pocket a neat mahogany case it was about a foot long and fastened at each end by two little clasps it had besides a small lock in the middle what is that said cecilia eagerly its only a china figure miss which i am going to carry to an elderly lady who lives nigh hand and who is mighty fond of such things could you let me look at it and welcome miss said he and opened the case oh goodness how beautiful exclaimed cecilia it was a figure of flora crowned with roses and carrying a basket of flowers in her hand cecilia contemplated it with delight how i should like to give this to louisa said she to herself and at last breaking silence did you promise it to the old lady oh no miss i didnt promise itshe never saw it and if so be that youd like to take it id make no more words about it and how much does it cost why miss as to that ill let you have it for half a guinea cecilia immediately produced the box in which she kept her treasure and emptying it upon the table she began to count the shillings alas there were but six shillings how provoking said she then i cant have it wheres the mandarin oh i have it said she taking it up and looking at it with the utmost disgust is this the same that i had before yes miss the very same replied the peddler who during this time had been examining the little box out of which cecilia had taken her moneyit was of silver why maam said he since youve taken such a fancy to the piece if youve a mind to make up the remainder of the money i will take this here little box if you care to part with it now this box was a keepsake from leonora to cecilia no said cecilia hastily blushing a little and stretching out her hand to receive it oh miss said he returning it carelessly i hope theres no offence i meant but to serve you thats all such a rare piece of china work has no cause to go a begging added he then putting the flora deliberately into the case and turning the key with a jerk he let it drop into his pocket when lifting up his box by the leather straps he was preparing to depart oh stay one minute said cecilia in whose mind there had passed a very warm conflict during the peddlers harangue louisa would so like this flora said she arguing with herself besides it would be so generous in me to give it to her instead of that ugly mandarin that would be doing only common justice for i promised it to her and she expects it though when i come to look at this mandarin it is not even so good as hers was the gilding is all rubbed off so that i absolutely must buy this for her oh yes i will and she will be so delighted and then everybody will say it is the prettiest thing they ever saw and the broken mandarin will be forgotten for ever here cecilias hand moved and she was just going to decide oh but stop said she to herself considerleonora gave me this box and it is a keepsake however we have now quarrelled and i dare say that she would not mind my parting with it im sure that i should not care if she was to give away my keepsake the smelling bottle or the ring which i gave her then what does it signify besides is it not my own and have i not a right to do what i please with it at this moment so critical for cecilia a party of her companions opened the door she knew that they came as purchasers and she dreaded her floras becoming the prize of some higher bidder here said she hastily putting the box into the peddlers hand without looking at it take it and give me the flora her hand trembled though she snatched it impatiently she ran by without seeming to mind any of her companions let those who are tempted to do wrong by the hopes of future gratification or the prospect of certain concealment and impunity remember that unless they are totally depraved they bear in their own hearts a monitor who will prevent their enjoying what they ill obtained in vain cecilia ran to the rest of her companions to display her present in hopes that the applause of others would restore her own self complacency in vain she saw the flora pass in due pomp from hand to hand each vying with the other in extolling the beauty of the gift and the generosity of the giver cecilia was still displeased with herself with them and even with their praise from louisas gratitude however she yet expected much pleasure and immediately she ran upstairs to her room in the meantime leonora had gone into the hall to buy a bodkin she had just broken hers in giving her change the peddler took out of his pocket with some halfpence the very box which cecilia had sold to him leonora did not in the least suspect the truth for her mind was above suspicion and besides she had the utmost confidence in cecilia i should like to have that box said she for it is like one of which i was very fond the peddler named the price and leonora took the box she intended to give it to little louisa on going to her room she found her asleep and she sat softly down by her bedside louisa opened her eyes i hope i didnt disturb you said leonora oh no i didnt hear you come in but what have you got there only a little box would you like to have it i bought on purpose for you as i thought perhaps it would please you because its like that which i gave cecilia oh yes that out of which she used to give me barbary drops i am very much obliged to you i always thought that exceedingly pretty and this indeed is as like it as possible i cant unscrew it will you try leonora unscrewed it goodness exclaimed louisa this must be cecilias box look dont you see a great l at the bottom of it leonoras colour changed yes she replied calmly i see that but it is no proof that it is cecilias you know that i bought this box just now of the peddler that may be said louisa but i remember scratching that l with my own needle and cecilia scolded me for it too do go and ask her if she has lost her boxdo repeated louisa pulling her by the ruffle as she did not seem to listen leonora indeed did not hear for she was lost in thought she was comparing circumstances which had before escaped her attention she recollected that cecilia had passed her as she came into the hall without seeming to see her but had blushed as she passed she remembered that the peddler appeared unwilling to part with the box and was going to put it again in his pocket with the halfpence and why should he keep it in his pocket and not show it with his other things combining all these circumstances leonora had no longer any doubt of the truth for though she had honourable confidence in her friends she had too much penetration to be implicitly credulous louisa she began but at this instant she heard a step which by its quickness she knew to be cecilias coming along the passage if you love me louisa said leonora say nothing about the box nay but why not i daresay she had lost it no my dear im afraid she has not louisa looked surprised but i have reasons for desiring you not to say anything about it well then i wont indeed cecilia opened the door came forward smiling as if secure of a good reception and taking the flora out of the case she placed it on the mantlepiece opposite to louisas bed dear how beautiful cried louisa starting up yes said cecilia and guess who its for for me perhaps said the ingenuous louisa yes take it and keep it for my sake you know that i broke your mandarin oh but this is a great deal prettier and larger than that yes i know it is and i meant that it should be so i should only have done what i was bound to do if i had only given you a mandarin well replied louisa and that would have been enough surely but what a beautiful crown of roses and then that basket of flowers they almost look as if i could smell them dear cecilia im very much obliged to you but i wont take it by way of payment for the mandarin you broke for im sure you could not help that and besides i should have broken it myself by this time you shall give it to me entirely and as your keepsake ill keep it as long as i live louisa stopped short and coloured the word keepsake recalled the box to her mind and all the train of ideas which the flora had banished but said she looking up wistfully in cecilias face and holding the flora doubtfully did you leonora who was just quitting the room turned her head back and gave louisa a look which silenced her cecilia was so infatuated with her vanity that she neither perceived leonoras sign nor louisas confusion but continued showing off her present by placing it in various situations till at length she put it into the case and laying it down with an affected carelessness upon the bed i must go now louisa good bye said she running up and kissing her but ill come again presently then clapping the door after her she went but as soon as the formentation of her spirits subsided the sense of shame which had been scarcely felt when mixed with so many other sensations rose uppermost in her mind what said she to herself is it possible that i have sold what i promised to keep for ever and what leonora gave me and i have concealed it too and have been making a parade of my generosity oh what would leonora what would louisawhat would everybody think of me if the truth were known humiliated and grieved by these reflections cecilia began to search in her own mind for some consoling idea she began to compare her conduct with that of others of her own age and at length fixing her comparison upon her brother george as the companion of whom from her infancy she had been habitually the most emulous she recollected that an almost similar circumstance had once happened to him and that he had not only escaped disgrace but had acquired glory by an intrepid confession of his fault her fathers word to her brother on the occasion she also perfectly recollected come to me george he said holding out his hand you are a generous brave boy they who dare to confess their faults will make great and good men these were his words but cecilia in repeating them to herself forgot to lay that emphasis on the word men which would have placed it in contradistinction to the word women she willingly believed that the observation extended equally to both sexes and flattered herself that she should exceed her brother in merit if she owned a fault which she thought that it would be so much more difficult to confess yes but said she stopping herself how can i confess it this very evening in a few hours the prize will be decided leonora or i shall win it i have now as good a chance as leonora perhaps a better and must i give up all my hopesall that i have been labouring for this month past oh i never can if it were but to morrow or yesterday or any day but this i would not hesitate but now i am almost certain of the prize and if i win itwell why then i willi think i will tell allyes i will i am determined said cecilia here a bell summoned them to dinner leonora sat opposite to her and she was not a little surprised to see cecilia look so gay and unconstrained surely said she to herself if cecilia had done that which i suspect she would not she could not look as she does but leonora little knew the cause of her gaiety cecilia was never in higher spirits or better pleased with herself than when she had resolved upon a sacrifice or a confession must not this evening be given to the most amiable whose then will it be all eyes glanced first at cecilia and then at leonora cecilia smiled leonora blushed i see that it is not yet decided said mrs villars and immediately they ran upstairs amidst confused whisperings cecilias voice could be distinguished far above the rest how can she be so happy said leonora to herself oh cecilia there was a time when you could not have neglected me so when we were always together the best of friends and companions our wishes tastes and pleasures the same surely she did once love me said leonora but now she is quite changed she has even sold my keepsake and she would rather win a bracelet of hair from girls whom she did not always think so much superior to leonora than have my esteem my confidence and my friendship for her whole lifeyes for her whole life for i am sure she will be an amiable woman oh that this bracelet had never been thought of or that i were certain of her winning it for i am sure that i do not wish to win it from her i would rathera thousand times ratherthat we were as we used to be than have all the glory in the world and how pleasing cecilia can be when she wishes to pleasehow candid she ishow much she can improve herself let me be just though she has offended me she is wonderfully improved within this last month for one fault and that against myself shall i forget all her merits as leonora said these last words she could but just hear the voices of her companions they had left her alone in the gallery she knocked softly at louisas door come in said louisa im not asleep oh said she starting up with the flora in her hand the instant that the door was opened im so glad you are come leonora for i did so long to hear what you all were making such a noise about have you forgot that the bracelet oh yes is this the evening inquired leonora well heres my white shell for you said louisa ive kept it in my pocket this fortnight and though cecilia did give me this flora i still love you a great deal better i thank you louisa said leonora gratefully i will take your shell and i shall value it as long as i live but here is a red one and if you wish to show me that you love me you will give this to cecilia i know that she is particularly anxious for your preference and i am sure that she deserves it yes if i could i would choose both of you said louisa but you know i can only choose which i like the best if you mean my dear louisa said leonora that you like me the best i am very much obliged to you for indeed i wish you to love me but it is enough for me to know it in private i should not feel the least more pleasure at hearing it in public or in having it made known to all my companions especially at a time when it would give poor cecilia a great deal of pain but why should it give her pain asked louisa i dont like her for being jealous of you nay louisa surely you dont think cecilia jealous she only tries to excel and to please she is more anxious to succeed than i am it is true because she has a great deal more activity and perhaps more ambition and it would really mortify her to lose this prizeyou know that she proposed it herself it has been her object for this month past and i am sure she has taken great pains to obtain it but dear leonora why should you lose it indeed my dear it would be no loss to me and if it were i would willingly suffer it for cecilia for though we seem not to be such good friends as we used to be i love her very much and she will love me againim sure she will when she no longer fears me as a rival she will again love me as a friend here leonora heard a number of her companions running along the gallery they all knocked hastily at the door calling leonora leonora will you never come cecilia has been with us this half hour leonora smiled well louisa said she smiling will you promise me oh i am sure by the way they speak to you that they wont give you the prize said the little louisa and the tears started into her eyes they love me though for all that said leonora and as for the prize you know whom i wish to have it leonora leonora called her impatient companions dont you hear us what are you about oh she never will take any trouble about anything said one of the party lets go away oh go go make haste cried louisa dont stay they are so angry remember then that you have promised me said leonora and she left the room during all this time cecilia had been in the garden with her companions the ambition which she had felt to win the first prizethe prize of superior talents and superior applicationwas not to be compared to the absolute anxiety which she now expressed to win this simple testimony of the love and approbation of her equals and rivals to employ her exuberant activity cecilia had been dragging branches of lilacs and laburnums roses and sweet briar to ornament the bower in which her fate was to be decided it was excessively hot but her mind was engaged and she was indefatigable she stood still at last to admire her works her companions all joined in loud applause they were not a little prejudiced in her favour by the great eagerness which she expressed to win their prize and by the great importance which she seemed to affix to the preference of each individual at last where is leonora cried one of them and immediately as we have seen they ran to call her cecilia was left alone overcome with heat and too violent exertion she had hardly strength to support herself each moment appeared to her intolerably long she was in a state of the utmost suspense and all her courage failed her even hope forsook her and hope is a cordial which leaves the mind depressed and enfeebled the time is now come said cecilia in a few moments all will be decided in a few momentsgoodness how much do i hazard if i should not win the prize how shall i confess what i have done how shall i beg leonora to forgive me i who hoped to restore my friendship to her as an honour they are gone to seek for her the moment she appears i shall be forgotten whatwhat shall i do said cecilia covering her face with her hands such was cecilias situation when leonora accompanied by her companions opened the hall door they most of them ran forwards to cecilia as leonora came into the bower she held out her hand to cecilia we are not rivals but friends i hope said she cecilia clasped her hand but she was in too great agitation to speak the table was now set in the arbourthe vase was now placed in the middle well said cecilia eagerly who begins caroline one of her friends came forward first and then all the others successively cecilias emotion was hardly conceivable now they are all in count them caroline one two three four the numbers are both equal there was a dead silence no they are not exclaimed cecilia pressing forward and putting a shell into a vase i have not given mine and i give it to leonora then snatching the bracelet it is yours leonora said she take it and give me back your friendship the whole assembly gave one universal clap and a general shout of applause i cannot be surprised at this from you cecilia said leonora and do you then still love me as you used to do oh leonora stop dont praise me i dont deserve this said she turning to her loudly applauding companions you will soon despise me oh leonora you will never forgive me i have deceived you i have sold at this instant mrs villars appeared the crowd divided she had heard all that passed from her window i applaud your generosity cecilia said she but i am to tell you that in this instance it is unsuccessful you have not it in your power to give the prize to leonora it is yours i have another vote to give to you you have forgotten louisa louisa exclaimed cecilia but surely maam louisa loves leonora better than she does me she commissioned me however said mrs villars to give you a red shell and you will find it in this box cecilia started and turned as pale as death it was the fatal box mrs villars produced another box she opened it it contained the flora and louisa also desired me said she to return to you this flora she put it into cecilias hand cecilia trembled so that she could not hold it leonora caught it oh madam oh leonora exclaimed cecilia now i have no hope left i intendedi was just going to tell dear cecilia said leonora you need not tell it me i know it already and i forgive you with all my heart yes i can prove to you said mrs villars that leonora has forgiven you it is she who has given you the prize it was she who persuaded louisa to give you her vote i went to see her a little while ago and perceiving by her countenance that something was the matter i pressed her to tell me what it was why madam said she leonora has made me promise to give my shell to cecilia now i dont love cecilia half so well as i do leonora besides i would not have cecilia think i vote for her because she gave me a flora whilst louisa was speaking continued mrs villars i saw this silver box lying on the bed i took it up and asked if it was not yours and how she came by it indeed madam said louisa i could have been almost certain that it was cecilias but leonora gave it me and she said that she bought it of the peddler this morning if anybody else had told me so i could not have believed them because i remember the box so well but i cant help believing leonora but did not you ask cecilia about it said i no madam replied louisa for leonora forbade me i guessed her reason well said i give me the box and i will carry your shell in it to cecilia then madam said she if i must give it her pray do take the flora and return it to her first that she may not think it is for that i do it oh generous louisa exclaimed cecilia but indeed leonora i cannot take your shell then dear cecilia accept of mine instead of it you cannot refuse it i only follow your example as for the bracelet added leonora taking cecilias hand i assure you i dont wish for it and you do and you deserve it no said cecilia indeed i do not deserve it next to you surely louisa deserves it best louisa oh yes louisa exclaimed everybody with one voice yes said mrs villars and let cecilia carry the bracelet to her she deserves that reward for one fault i cannot forget all your merits cecilia nor i am sure will your companions then surely not your best friend said leonora kissing her everybody present was moved they looked up to leonora with respectful and affectionate admiration oh leonora how i love you and how i wish to be like you exclaimed ceciliato be as good as generous rather wish cecilia interrupted mrs villars to be as just to be as strictly honourable and as invariably consistent remember that many of our sex are capable of great effortsof making what they call great sacrifices to virtue or to friendship but few treat their friends with habitual gentleness or uniformly conduct themselves with prudence and good sense the little merchants chapter i chi di gallina nasce convien che rozole as the old cock crows so crows the young those who have visited italy give us an agreeable picture of the cheerful industry of the children of all ages in the celebrated city of naples their manner of living and their numerous employments are exactly described in the following extract from a travellers journal the children are busied in various ways a great number of them bring fish for sale to town from santa lucia others are very often seen about the arsenals or wherever carpenters are at work employed in gathering up the chips and pieces of wood or by the sea side picking up sticks and whatever else has drifted ashore which when their basket is full they carry away children of two or three years old who can scarcely crawl along upon the ground in company with boys of five or six are employed in this pretty trade hence they proceed with their baskets into the heart of the city where in several places they form a sort of little market sitting round with their stock of wood before them labourers and the lower order of citizens buy it of them to burn in the tripods for warming themselves or to use in their scanty kitchens other children carry about for sale the water of the sulphurous wells which particularly in the spring season is drunk in great abundance others again endeavour to turn a few pence by buying a small matter of fruit of pressed honey cakes and comfits and then like little peddlers offer and sell them to other children always for no more profit than that they may have their share of them free of expense picture the little merchants it is really curious to see how an urchin whose whole stock and property consist in a board and a knife will carry about a water melon or a half roasted gourd collect a troup of children round him set down his board and proceed to divide the fruit into small pieces among them the buyers keep a sharp look out to see that they have enough for their little piece of copper and the lilliputian tradesmen act with no less caution as the exigencies of the case may require to prevent his being cheated out of a morsel the advantages of truth and honesty and the value of a character for integrity are very early felt amongst these little merchants in their daily intercourse with each other the fair dealer is always sooner or later seen to prosper the most cunning cheat is at last detected and disgraced numerous instances of the truth of this common observation were remarked by many neapolitan children especially by those who were acquainted with the characters and history of piedro and francisco two boys originally equal in birth fortune and capacity but different in their education and consequently in their habits and conduct francisco was the son of an honest gardener who from the time he could speak taught him to love to speak the truth showed him that liars are never believedthat cheats and thieves cannot be trusted and that the shortest way to obtain a good character is to deserve it youth and white paper as the proverb says take all impressions the boy profited much by his fathers precepts and more by his example he always heard his father speak the truth and saw that he dealt fairly with everybody in all his childish traffic francisco imitating his parents was scrupulously honest and therefore all his companions trusted himas honest as francisco became a sort of proverb amongst them as honest as francisco repeated piedros father when he one day heard this saying let them say so i say as sharp as piedro and let us see which will go through the world best with the idea of making his son sharp he made him cunning he taught him that to make a good bargain was to deceive as to the value and price of whatever he wanted to dispose of to get as much money as possible from customers by taking advantage of their ignorance or of their confidence he often repeated his favourite proverbthe buyer has need of a hundred eyes the seller has need but of one and he took frequent opportunities of explaining the meaning of this maxim to his son he was a fisherman and as his gains depended more upon fortune than upon prudence he trusted habitually to his good luck after being idle for a whole day he would cast his line or his nets and if he was lucky enough to catch a fine fish he would go and show it in triumph to his neighbour the gardener you are obliged to work all day long for your daily bread he would say look here i work but five minutes and i have not only daily bread but daily fish upon these occasions our fisherman always forgot or neglected to count the hours and days which were wasted in waiting for a fair wind to put to sea or angling in vain on the shore little piedro who used to bask in the sun upon the sea shore beside his father and to lounge or sleep away his time in a fishing boat acquired habits of idleness which seemed to his father of little consequence whilst he was but a child what will you do with piedro as he grows up neighbour said the gardener he is smart and quick enough but he is always in mischief scarcely a day has passed for this fortnight but i have caught him amongst my grapes i track his footsteps all over my vineyard he is but a child yet and knows no better replied the fisherman but if you dont teach him better now he is a child how will he know when he is a man said the gardener a mighty noise about a bunch of grapes truly cried the fisherman a few grapes more or less in your vineyard what does it signify i speak for your sons sake and not for the sake of my grapes said the gardener and i tell you again the boy will not do well in the world neighbour if you dont look after him in time hell do well enough in the world you will find answered the fisherman carelessly whenever he casts my nets they never come up empty it is better to be lucky than wise a this was a proverb which piedro had frequently heard from his father and to which he most willingly trusted because it gave him less trouble to fancy himself fortunate than to make himself wise come here child said his father to him when he returned home after the preceding conversation with the gardener how old are you my boytwelve years old is not it as old as francisco and older by six months said piedro and smarter and more knowing by six years said his father here take these fish to naples and let us see how youll sell them for me venture a small fish as the proverb says to catch a great one b i was too late with them at the market yesterday but nobody will know but what they are just fresh out of the water unless you go and tell them not i trust me for that im not such a fool replied piedro laughing i leave that to francisco do you know i saw him the other day miss selling a melon for his father by turning the bruised side to the customer who was just laying down the money for it and who was a raw servant boy moreoverone who would never have guessed there were two sides to a melon if he had not as you say father been told of it off with you to market you are a droll chap said his father and will sell my fish cleverly ill be bound as to the rest let every man take care of his own grapes you understand me piedro perfectly said the boy who perceived that his father was indifferent as to his honesty provided he sold fish at the highest price possible he proceeded to the market and he offered his fish with assiduity to every person whom he thought likely to buy it especially to those upon whom he thought he could impose he positively asserted to all who looked at his fish that they were just fresh out of the water good judges of men and fish knew that he said what was false and passed him by with neglect but it was at last what he called good luck to meet with the very same young raw servant boy who would have bought the bruised melon from francisco he made up to him directly crying fish fine fresh fish fresh fish was it caught to day said the boy yes this morning not an hour ago said piedro with the greatest effrontery the servant boy was imposed upon and being a foreigner speaking the italian language but imperfectly and not being expert at reckoning the italian money he was no match for the cunning piedro who cheated him not only as to the freshness but as to the price of the commodity piedro received nearly half as much again for his fish as he ought to have done on his road homewards from naples to the little village of resina where his father lived he overtook francisco who was leading his fathers ass the ass was laden with large panniers which were filled with the stalks and leaves of cauliflowers cabbages broccoli lettuces etcall the refuse of the neapolitan kitchens which are usually collected by the gardeners boys and carried to the gardens round naples to be mixed with other manure well filled panniers truly said piedro as he overtook francisco and the ass the panniers were indeed not only filled to the top but piled up with much skill and care so that the load met over the animals back it is not a very heavy load for the ass though it looks so large said francisco the poor fellow however shall have a little of this water added he leading the ass to a pool by the roadside i was not thinking of the ass boy i was not thinking of any ass but of you when i said well filled panniers truly this is your mornings work i presume and youll make another journey to naples to day on the same errand i warrant before your father thinks you have done enough not before my father thinks i have done enough but before i think so myself replied francisco i do enough to satisfy myself and my father too said piedro without slaving myself after your fashion look here producing the money he had received for the fish all this was had for asking it is no bad thing youll allow to know how to ask for money properly i should be ashamed to beg or borrow either said francisco neither did i get what you see by begging or borrowing either said piedro but by using my wits not as you did yesterday when like a novice you showed the bruised side of your melon and so spoiled your market by your wisdom wisdom i think it still said francisco and your father asked piedro and my father said francisco mine is of a different way of thinking said piedro he always tells me that the buyer has need of a hundred eyes and if one can blind the whole hundred so much the better you must know i got off the fish to day that my father could not sell yesterday in the marketgot it off for fresh just out of the rivergot twice as much as the market price for it and from whom think you why from the very booby that would have bought the bruised melon for a sound one if you would have let him youll allow im no fool francisco and that im in a fair way to grow rich if i go on as i have begun stay said francisco you forgot that the booby you took in to day will not be so easily taken in to morrow he will buy no more fish from you because he will be afraid of your cheating him but he will be ready enough to buy fruit from me because he will know i shall not cheat himso youll have lost a customer and i gained one with all my heart said piedro one customer does not make a market if he buys no more from me what care i there are people enough to buy fish in naples and do you mean to serve them all in the same manner asked francisco if they will be only so good as to give me leave said piedro laughing and repeating his fathers proverb venture a small fish to catch a large one he had learned to think that to cheat in making bargains was witty and clever and you have never considered then said francisco that all these people will one after another find you out in time ay in time but it will be some time first there are a great many of them enough to last me all the summer if i lose a customer a day said piedro and next summer observed francisco what will you do next summer is not come yet there is time enough to think what i shall do before next summer comes why now suppose the blockheads after they had been taken in and found it out all joined against me and would buy none of our fishwhat then are there no trades but that of a fisherman in naples are there not a hundred ways of making money for a smart lad like me as my father says what do you think of turning merchant and selling sugar plums and cakes to the children in their market would they be hard to deal with think you i think not said francisco but i think the children would find out in time if they were cheated and would like it as little as the men i dont doubt them then in time i could you know change my tradesell chips and sticks in the wood markethand about the lemonade to the fine folks or twenty other things there are trades enough boy yes for the honest dealer said francisco but for no other for in all of them youll find as my father says that a good character is the best fortune to set up with change your trade ever so often youll be found out for what you are at last and what am i pray said piedro angrily the whole truth of the matter is francisco that you envy my good luck and cant bear to hear this money jingle in my hand ay stroke the long ears of your ass and look as wise as you please its better to be lucky than wise as my father says good morning to you when i am found out for what i am or when the worst comes to the worst i can drive a stupid ass with his panniers filled with rubbish as well as you do now honest francisco not quite so well unless you were honest francisco you would not fill his panniers quite so readily this was certain that francisco was so well known for his honesty amongst all the people at naples with whom his father was acquainted that everyone was glad to deal with him and as he never wronged anyone all were willing to serve himat least as much as they could without loss to themselves so that after the market was over his panniers were regularly filled by the gardeners and others with whatever he wanted his industry was constant his gains small but certain and he every day had more and more reason to trust to his fathers maximthat honesty is the best policy the foreign servant lad to whom francisco had so honestly or as piedro said so sillily shown the bruised side of the melon was an englishman he left his native country of which he was extremely fond to attend upon his master to whom he was still more attached his master was in a declining state of health and this young lad waited on him a little more to his mind than his other servants we must in consideration of his zeal fidelity and inexperience pardon him for not being a good judge of fish though he had simplicity enough to be easily cheated once he had too much sense to be twice made a dupe the next time he met piedro in the market he happened to be in company with several english gentlemens servants and he pointed piedro out to them all as an arrant knave they heard his cry of fresh fish fresh fish fine fresh fish with incredulous smiles and let him pass but not without some expressions of contempt though uttered in english he tolerably well understood for the tone of contempt is sufficiently expressive in all languages he lost more by not selling his fish to these people than he had gained the day before by cheating the english booby the market was well supplied and he could not get rid of his cargo is not this truly provoking said piedro as he passed by francisco who was selling fruit for his father look my basket is as heavy as when i left home and look at em yourself they really are fine fresh fish to day and yet because that revengeful booby told how i took him in yesterday not one of yonder crowd would buy them and all the time they really are fresh to day so they are said franscisco but you said so yesterday when they were not and he that was duped then is not ready to believe you to day how does he know that you deserve it better he might have looked at the fish repeated piedro they are fresh to day i am sure he need not have been afraid ay said francisco but as my father said to you oncethe scalded dog fears cold water here their conversation was interrupted by the same english lad who smiled as he came up to francisco and taking up a fine pine apple he said in a mixture of bad italian and englishi need not look at the other side of this you will tell me if it is not as good as it looks name your price i know you have but one and that an honest one and as to the rest i am able and willing to pay for what i buy that is to say my master is which comes to the same thing i wish your fruit could make him well and it would be worth its weight in gold to me at least we must have some of your grapes for him is he not well inquired francisco we must then pick out the best for him at the same time singling out a tempting bunch i hope he will like these but if you could some day come as far as resina it is a village but a few miles out of town where we have our vineyard you could there choose for yourself and pluck them fresh from the vines for your poor master bless you my good boy i should take you for an englishman by your way of dealing ill come to your village only write me down the name for your italian names slip through my head ill come to the vineyard if it was ten miles off and all the time we stay in naples may it not be so long as i fear it will with my masters leave which he never refuses me to anything thats proper ill deal with you for all our fruit as sure as my names arthur and with none else with my good will i wish all your countrymen would take after you in honesty indeed i do concluded the englishman looking full at piedro who took up his unsold basket of fish looking somewhat silly and gloomily walked off arthur the english servant was as good as his word he dealt constantly with francisco and proved an excellent customer buying from him during the whole season as much fruit as his master wanted his master who was an englishman of distinction was invited to take up his residence during his stay in italy at the count de fs villa which was in the environs of naplesan easy walk from resina francisco had the pleasure of seeing his fathers vineyard often full of generous visitors and arthur who had circulated the anecdote of the bruised melon was he said proud to think that some of this was his doing and that an englishman never forgot a good turn be it from a countryman or foreigner my dear boy said franciscos father to him whilst arthur was in the vineyard helping to tend the vines i am to thank you and your honesty it seems for our having our hands so full of business this season it is fair you should have a share of our profits so i have father enough and enough when i see you and mother going on so well what can i want more oh my brave boy we know you are a grateful good son but i have been your age myself you have companions you have little expenses of your own here this vine this fig tree and a melon a week next summer shall be yours with these make a fine figure amongst the little neapolitan merchants and all i wish is that you may prosper as well and by the same honest means in managing for yourself as you have done managing for me thank you father and if i prosper at all it shall be by those means and no other or i should not be worthy to be called your son piedro the cunning did not make quite so successful a summers work as did francisco the honest no extraordinary events happened no singular instance of bad or good luck occurred but he felt as persons usually do the natural consequences of his own actions he pursued his scheme of imposing as far as he could upon every person he dealt with and the consequence was that at last nobody would deal with him it is easy to outwit one person but impossible to outwit all the world said a man who knew the world at least as well as either piedro or his father piedros father amongst others had reason to complain he saw his own customers fall off from him and was told whenever he went into the market that his son was such a cheat there was no dealing with him one day when he was returning from the market in a very bad humour in consequence of these reproaches and of his not having found customers for his goods he espied his smart son piedro at a little merchants fruit board devouring a fine gourd with prodigious greediness where glutton do you find money to pay for these dainties exclaimed his father coming close up to him with angry gestures piedros mouth was much too full to make an immediate reply nor did his father wait for any but darting his hand into the youths pocket pulled forth a handful of silver the money father said piedro that i got for the fish yesterday and that i meant to give you to day before you went out then ill make you remember it against another time sirrah said his father ill teach you to fill your stomach with my money am i to lose my customers by your tricks and then find you here eating my all you are a rogue and everybody has found you out to be a rogue and the worst of rogues i find you who scruples not to cheat his own father saying these words with great vehemence he seized hold of piedro and in the very midst of the little fruit market gave him a severe beating this beating did the boy no good it was vengeance not punishment piedro saw that his father was in a passion and knew that he was beaten because he was found out to be a rogue rather than for being one he recollected perfectly that his father once said to him let everyone take care of his own grapes indeed it was scarcely reasonable to expect that a boy who had been educated to think that he might cheat every customer he could in the way of trade should be afterwards scrupulously honest in his conduct towards the father whose proverbs encouraged his childhood in cunning piedro writhed with bodily pain as he left the market after his drubbing but his mind was not in the least amended on the contrary he was hardened to the sense of shame by the loss of reputation all the little merchants were spectators of this scene and heard his fathers words you are a rogue and the worst of rogues who scruples not to cheat his own father these words were long remembered and long did piedro feel their effects he once flattered himself that when his trade of selling fish failed him he could readily engage in some other but he now found to his mortification that what franciscos father said proved true in all trades the best fortune to set up with is a good character not one of the little neapolitan merchants would either enter into partnership with him give him credit or even trade with him for ready money if you would cheat your own father to be sure you will cheat us was continually said to him by these prudent little people piedro was taunted and treated with contempt at home and abroad his father when he found that his sons smartness was no longer useful in making bargains shoved him out of his way whenever he met him all the food or clothes that he had at home seemed to be given to him grudgingly and with such expressions as these take that but it is too good for you you must eat this now instead of gourds and figsand be thankful you have even this piedro spent a whole winter very unhappily he expected that all his old tricks and especially what his father had said of him in the market place would be soon forgotten but month passed after month and still these things were fresh in the memory of all who had known them it is not easy to get rid of a bad character a very great rogue was once heard to say that he would with all his heart give ten thousand pounds for a good character because he knew that he could make twenty thousand by it something like this was the sentiment of our cunning hero when he experienced the evils of a bad reputation and when he saw the numerous advantages which franciscos good character procured such had been piedros wretched education that even the hard lessons of experience could not alter its pernicious effects he was sorry his knavery had been detected but he still thought it clever to cheat and was secretly persuaded that if he had cheated successfully he should have been happy but i know i am not happy now said he to himself one morning as he sat alone disconsolate by the sea shore dressed in tattered garments weak and hungry with an empty basket beside him his fishing rod which he held between his knees bent over the dry sands instead of into the water for he was not thinking of what he was about his arms were folded his head hung down and his ragged hat was slouched over his face he was a melancholy spectacle francisco as he was coming from his fathers vineyard with a large dish of purple and white grapes upon his head and a basket of melons and figs hanging upon his arm chanced to see piedro seated in this melancholy posture touched with compassion francisco approached him softly his footsteps were not heard upon the sands and piedro did not perceive that anyone was near him till he felt something cold touch his hand he then started and looking up saw a bunch of grapes which francisco was holding over his head eat them youll find them very good i hope said francisco with a benevolent smile they are excellentmost excellent and i am much obliged to you francisco said piedro i was very hungry and thats what i am now without anybodys caring anything about it i am not the favourite i was with my father but i know it is all my own fault well but cheer up said francisco my father always says one who knows he has been in fault and acknowledges it will scarcely be in fault again yes take as many figs as you will continued he and held his basket closer to piedro who as he saw cast a hungry eye upon one of the ripe figs but said piedro after he had taken several shall not i get you into a scrape by taking so many wont your father be apt to miss them do you think i would give them to you if they were not my own said francisco with a sudden glance of indignation well dont be angry that i asked the question it was only from fear of getting you into disgrace that i asked it it would not be easy for anybody to do that i hope said francisco rather proudly and to me less than anybody replied piedro in an insinuating tone i that am so much obliged to you a bunch of grapes and a few figs are no mighty obligation said francisco smiling i wish i could do more for you you seem indeed to have been very unhappy of late we never see you in the markets as we used to do no ever since my father beat me and called me rogue before all the children there i have never been able to show my face without being gibed at by one or tother if you would but take me along with you amongst them and only just seem my friend for a day or two or so it would quite set me up again for they all like you i would rather be than seem your friend if i could said francisco ay to be sure that would be still better said piedro observing that francisco as he uttered his last sentence was separating the grapes and other fruits into two equal divisions to be sure i would rather you would be than seem a friend to me but i thought that was too much to ask at first though i have a notion notwithstanding i have been so unlucky latelyi have a notion you would have no reason to repent of it you would find me no bad hand if you were to try and take me into partnership partnership interrupted francisco drawing back alarmed i had no thoughts of that but wont you cant you said piedro in a supplicating tone cant you have thoughts of it youd find me a very active partner franscisco still drew back and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground he was embarrassed for he pitied piedro and he scarcely knew how to point out to him that something more is necessary in a partner in trade besides activity and that is honesty cant you repeated piedro thinking that he hesitated from merely mercenary motives you shall have what share of the profits you please i was not thinking of the profits said francisco but without meaning to be ill natured to you piedro i must say that i cannot enter into any partnership with you at present but i will do what perhaps you will like as well said he taking half the fruit out of his basket you are heartily welcome to this try and sell it in the childrens fruit market ill go on before you and speak to those i am acquainted with and tell them you are going to set up a new character and that you hope to make it a good one hey shall i thank you for ever dear francisco cried piedro seizing his plentiful gift of fruit say what you please for me but dont make me say anything that is not true said francisco pausing no to be sure not said piedro i do mean to give no room for scandal if i could get them to trust me as they do you i should be happy indeed that is what you may do if you please said francisco adieu i wish you well with all my heart but i must leave you now or i shall be too late for the market chapter ii chi va piano va sano e anch lontano fair and softly goes far in a day piedro had now an opportunity of establishing a good character when he went into the market with his grapes and figs he found that he was not shunned or taunted as usual all seemed disposed to believe in his intended reformation and to give him a fair trial these favourable dispositions towards him were the consequence of franciscos benevolent representations he told them that he thought piedro had suffered enough to cure him of his tricks and that it would be cruelty in them because he might once have been in fault to banish him by their reproaches from amongst them and thus to prevent him from the means of gaining his livelihood honestly piedro made a good beginning and gave what several of the younger customers thought excellent bargains his grapes and figs were quickly sold and with the money that he got for them he the next day purchased from a fruit dealer a fresh supply and thus he went on for some time conducting himself with scrupulous honesty so that he acquired some credit among his companions they no longer watched him with suspicious eyes they trusted to his measures and weights and they counted less carefully the change which they received from him the satisfaction he felt from this alteration in their manners was at first delightful to piedro but in proportion to his credit his opportunities of defrauding increased and these became temptations which he had not the firmness to resist his old manner of thinking recurred i make but a few shillings a day and this is but slow work said he to himself what signifies my good character if i make so little by it light gains and frequent make a heavy purse was one of franciscos proverbs but piedro was in too great haste to get rich to take time into his account he set his invention to work and he did not want for ingenuity to devise means of cheating without running the risk of detection he observed that the younger part of the community were extremely fond of certain coloured sugar plums and of burnt almonds with the money he had earned by two months trading in fruit he laid in a large stock of what appeared to these little merchants a stock of almonds and sugar plums and he painted in capital gold coloured letters upon his board sweetest largest most admirable sugar plums of all colours ever sold in naples to be had here and in gratitude to his numerous customers piedro adds to these burnt almonds gratis this advertisement attracted the attention of all who could read and many who could not read heard it repeated with delight crowds of children surrounded piedros board of promise and they all went away the first day amply satisfied each had a full measure of coloured sugar plums at the usual price and along with these a burnt almond gratis the burnt almond had such an effect upon the public judgment that it was universally allowed that the sugar plums were as the advertisement set forth the largest sweetest most admirable ever sold in naples though all the time they were in no respect better than any other sugar plums it was generally reported that piedro gave full measurefuller than any other board in the city he measured the sugar plums in a little cubical tin box and this it was affirmed he heaped up to the top and pressed down before he poured out the contents into the open hands of his approving customers this belief and piedros popularity continued longer even than he had expected and as he thought his sugar plums had secured their reputation with the generous public he gradually neglected to add burnt almonds gratis one day a boy of about ten years old passed carelessly by whistling as he went along and swinging a carpenters rule in his hand ha what have we here cried he stopping to read what was written on piedros board this promises rarely old as i am and tall of my age which makes the matter worse i am still as fond of sugar plums as my little sister who is five years younger than i come signor fill me quick for im in haste to taste them two measures of the sweetest largest most admirable sugar plums in naplesone measure for myself and one for my little rosetta youll pay for yourself and your sister then said piedro for no credit is given here no credit do i ask replied the lively boy when i told you i loved sugar plums did i tell you i loved them or even my sister so well as to run in debt for them heres for myself and heres for my sisters share said he laying down his money and now for the burnt almonds gratis my good fellow they are all out i have been out of burnt almonds this great while said piedro then why are they in your advertisement here said carlo i have not had time to scratch them out of the board what not when you have by your own account been out of them a great while i did not know it required so much time to blot out a few wordslet us try and as he spoke carlo for that was the name of piedros new customer pulled a bit of white chalk out of his pocket and drew a broad score across the line on the board which promised burnt almonds gratis you are most impatient said piedro i shall have a fresh stock of almonds to morrow why must the board tell a lie to day it would ruin me to alter it said piedro a lie may ruin you but i could scarcely think the truth could you have no right to meddle with me or my board said piedro put off his guard and out of his usual soft voice of civility by this last observation my character and that of my board are too firmly established now for any chance customer like you to injure i never dreamed of injuring you or anyone else said carloi wish moreover you may not injure yourself do as you please with your board but give me my sugar plums for i have some right to meddle with those having paid for them hold out your hand then no put them in here if you please put my sisters at least in here she likes to have them in this box i bought some for her in it yesterday and shell think theyll taste the better out of the same box but how is this your measure does not fill my box nearly you give us very few sugar plums for our money i give you full measure as i give to everybody the measure should be an inch cube i know said carlo thats what all the little merchants have agreed to you know true said piedro so it is and so it is i must allow said carlo measuring the outside of it with the carpenters rule which he held in his hand an inch every way and yet by my eyeand i have no bad one being used to measuring carpenters work for my fatherby my eye i should think this would have held more sugar plums the eye often deceives us said piedro theres nothing like measuring you find theres nothing like measuring i find indeed replied carlo as he looked closely at the end of his rule which since he spoke last he had put into the cube to take its depth in the inside this is not as deep by a quarter of an inch signor piedro measured within as it is measured without piedro changed colour terribly and seizing hold of the tin box endeavoured to wrest it from the youth who measured so accurately carlo held his prize fast and lifting it above his head he ran into the midst of the square where the little market was held exclaiming a discovery a discovery that concerns all who love sugar plums a discovery a discovery that concerns all who have ever bought the sweetest and most admirable sugar plums ever sold in naples the crowd gathered from all parts of the square as he spoke we have bought and we have bought of those sugar plums cried several little voices at once if you mean piedros the same continued carlohe who out of gratitude to his numerous customers gives or promises to give burnt almonds gratis excellent they were cried several voices we all know piedro well but whats your discovery my discovery is said carlo that you none of you know piedro look you here look at this boxthis is his measure it has a false bottomit holds only three quarters as much as it ought to do and his numerous customers have all been cheated of one quarter of every measure of the admirable sugar plums they have bought from him think twice of a good bargain says the proverb so we have been finely duped indeed cried some of the bystanders looking at one another with a mortified air full of courtesy full of craft so this is the meaning of his burnt almonds gratis cried others all joined in an uproar of indignation except one who as he stood behind the rest expressed in his countenance silent surprise and sorrow is this piedro a relation of yours said carlo going up to this silent person i am sorry if he be that i have published his disgrace for i would not hurt you you dont sell sugar plums as he does im sure for my little sister rosetta has often bought from you can this piedro be a friend of yours i wished to have been his friend but i see i cant said francisco he is a neighbour of ours and i pitied him but since he is at his old tricks again theres an end of the matter i have reason to be obliged to you for i was nearly taken in he has behaved so well for some time past that i intended this very evening to have gone to him and to have told him that i was willing to do for him what he has long begged of me to doto enter into partnership with him francisco franciscoyour measure lend us your measure exclaimed a number of little merchants crowding round him you have a measure for sugar plums and we have all agreed to refer to that and to see how much we have been cheated before we go to break piedros bench and declare him bankrupt the punishment for all knaves they pressed on to franciscos board obtained his measure found that it held something more than a quarter above the quantity that could be contained in piedros the cries of the enraged populace were now most clamorous they hung the just and the unjust measures upon high poles and forming themselves into a formidable phalanx they proceeded towards piedros well known yellow lettered board exclaiming as they went along common cause common cause the little neapolitan merchants will have no knaves amongst them break his bench break his bench he is a bankrupt in honesty piedro saw the mob heard the indignant clamour and terrified at the approach of numbers he fled with the utmost precipitation having scarcely time to pack up half his sugar plums there was a prodigious number more than would have filled many honest measures scattered upon the ground and trampled under foot by the crowd piedros bench was broken and the public vengeance wreaked itself also upon his treacherous painted board it was after being much disfigured by various inscriptions expressive of the universal contempt for piedro hung up in a conspicuous part of the market place and the false measure was fastened like a cap upon one of its corners piedro could never more show his face in this market and all hopes of friendshipall hopes of partnership with franciscowere for ever at an end if rogues would calculate they would cease to be rogues for they would certainly discover that it is most for their interest to be honestsetting aside the pleasure of being esteemed and beloved of having a safe conscience with perfect freedom from all the various embarrassments and terror to which knaves are subject is it not clear that our crafty hero would have gained rather more by a partnership with francisco and by a fair character than he could possibly obtain by fraudulent dealing in comfits when the mob had dispersed after satisfying themselves with executing summary justice upon piedros bench and board francisco found a carpenters rule lying upon the ground near piedros broken bench which he recollected to have seen in the hands of carlo he examined it carefully and he found carlos name written upon it and the name of the street where he lived and though it was considerably out of his way he set out immediately to restore the rule which was a very handsome one to its rightful owner after a hot walk through several streets he overtook carlo who had just reached the door of his own house carlo was particularly obliged to him he said for restoring this rule to him as it was a present from the master of a vessel who employed his father to do carpenters work for him one should not praise ones self they say continued carlo but i long so much to gain your good opinion that i must tell you the whole history of the rule you have restored it was given to me for having measured the work and made up the bill of a whole pleasure boat myself you may guess i should have been sorry enough to have lost it thank you for its being once more in my careless hands and tell me i beg whenever i can do you any service by the by i can make up for you a fruit stall ill do it to morrow and it shall be the admiration of the market is there anything else you could think of for me why yes said francisco since you are so good natured perhaps youd be kind enough to tell me the meaning of some of those lines and figures that i see upon your rule i have a great curiosity to know their use that ill explain to you with pleasure as far as i know them myself but when im at fault my father who is cleverer than i am and understands trigonometry can help us out trigonometry repeated francisco not a little alarmed at the high sounding word thats what i certainly shall never understand oh never fear replied carlo laughing i looked just as you do nowi felt just as you do nowall in a fright and a puzzle when i first heard of angles and sines and cosines and arcs and centres and complements and tangents oh mercy mercy interrupted francisco whilst carlo laughed with a benevolent sense of superiority why said carlo youll find all these things are nothing when you are used to them but i cannot explain my rule to you here broiling in the sun besides it will not be the work of a day i promise you but come and see us at your leisure hours and well study it together i have a great notion we shall become friends and to begin step in with me now said carlo and eat a little macaroni with us i know it is ready by this time besides youll see my father and hell show you plenty of rules and compasses as you like such things and then ill go home with you in the cool of the evening and you shall show me your melons and vines and teach me in time something of gardening oh i see we must be good friends just made for each other so come inno ceremony carlo was not mistaken in his predictions he and francisco became very good friends spent all their leisure hours together either in carlos workshop or in franciscos vineyard and they mutually improved each other francisco before he saw his friends rule knew but just enough of arithmetic to calculate in his head the price of the fruit which he sold in the market but with carlos assistance and the ambition to understand the tables and figures upon the wonderful rule he set to work in earnest and in due time satisfied both himself and his master who knows but these things that i am learning now may be of some use to me before i die said francisco as he was sitting one morning with his tutor the carpenter to be sure it will said the carpenter putting down his compasses with which he was drawing a circlearithmetic is a most useful and i was going to say necessary thing to be known by men in all stations and a little trigonometry does no harm in short my maxim is that no knowledge comes amiss for a mans head is of as much use to him as his hands and even more so a word to the wise will always suffice besides to say nothing of making a fortune is not there a great pleasure in being something of a scholar and being able to pass ones time with ones book and ones compasses and pencil safe companions these for young and old no one gets into mischief that has pleasant things to think of and to do when alone and i know for my part that trigonometry is here the carpenter just as he was going to pronounce a fresh panegyric upon his favourite trigonometry was interrupted by the sudden entrance of his little daughter rosetta all in tears a very unusual spectacle for taking the year round she shed fewer tears than any child of her age in naples why my dear good humoured little rosetta what has happened why these large tears said her brother carlo and he went up to her and wiped them from her cheeks and these that are going over the bridge of the nose so fast i must stop these tears too said carlo rosetta at this speech burst out laughing and said that she did not know till then that she had any bridge on her nose and were these shells the cause of the tears said her brother looking at a heap of shells which she held before her in her frock yes partly said rosetta it was partly my own fault but not all you know i went out to the carpenters yard near the arsenal where all the children are picking up chips and sticks so busily and i was as busy as any of them because i wanted to fill my basket soon and then i thought i should sell my basketful directly in the little wood market as soon as i had filled my basket and made up my faggot which was not done brother till i was almost baked by the sun for i was forced to wait by the carpenters for the bits of wood to make up my faggoti say when it was all ready and my basket full i left it altogether in the yard that was not wise to leave it said carlo but i only left it for a few minutes brother and i could not think anybody would be so dishonest as to take it whilst i was away i only just ran to tell a boy who had picked up all these beautiful shells upon the sea shore and who wanted to sell them that i should be glad to buy them from him if he would only be so good as to keep them for me for an hour or so till i had carried my wood to market and till i had sold it and so had money to pay him for the shells your heart was set mightily on these shells rosetta yes for i thought you and francisco brother would like to have them for your nice grotto that you are making at resina that was the reason i was in such a hurry to get them the boy who had them to sell was very good natured he poured them into my lap and said i had such an honest face he would trust me and that as he was in a great hurry he could not wait an hour whilst i sold my wood but that he was sure i would pay him in the evening and he told me that he would call here this evening for the money but now what shall i do carlo i shall have no money to give him i must give back his shells and thats a great pity but how happened it that you did not sell your wood oh i forgot did not i tell you that when i went for my basket do you know it was empty quite empty not a chip left some dishonest person had carried it all off had not i reason to cry now carlo ill go this minute into the wood market and see if i can find your faggot wont that be better than crying said her brother should you know any one of your pieces of wood again if you were to see them yes one of them i am sure i should know again said rosetta it had a notch at one end of it where one of the carpenters cut it off from another piece of wood for me and is this piece of wood from which the carpenter cut it still to be seen said francisco yes it is in the yard but i cannot bring it to you for it is very heavy we can go to it said francisco and i hope we shall recover your basketful carlo and his friend went with rosetta immediately to the yard near the arsenal saw the notched piece of wood and then proceeded to the little wood market and searched every heap that lay before the little factors but no notched bit was to be found and rosetta declared that she did not see one stick that looked at all like any of hers on their part her companions eagerly untied their faggots to show them to her and exclaimed that they were incapable of taking what did not belong to them that of all persons they should never have thought of taking anything from the good natured little rosetta who was always ready to give to others and to help them in making up their loads despairing of discovering the thief francisco and carlo left the market as they were returning home they were met by the english servant arthur who asked francisco where he had been and where he was going as soon as he heard of rosettas lost faggot and of the bit of wood notched at one end of which rosetta drew the shape with a piece of chalk which her brother had lent her arthur exclaimed i have seen such a bit of wood as this within this quarter of an hour but i cannot recollect where stay this was at the bakers i think where i went for some rolls for my master it was lying beside his oven to the bakers they all went as fast as possible and they got there but just in time the baker had in his hand the bit of wood with which he was that instant going to feed his oven stop good mr baker cried rosetta who ran into the bakers shop first and as he heard stop stop re echoed by many voices the baker stopped and turning to francisco carlo and arthur begged with a countenance of some surprise to know why they had desired him to stop the case was easily explained and the baker told them that he did not buy any wood in the little market that morning that this faggot he had purchased between the hours of twelve and one from a lad about franciscos height whom he met near the yard of the arsenal this is my bit of wood i am sure i know it by this notch said rosetta well said the baker if you will stay here a few minutes you will probably see the lad who sold it to me he desired to be paid in bread and my bread was not quite baked when he was here i bid him call again in an hour and i fancy he will be pretty punctual for he looked desperately hungry the baker had scarcely finished speaking when francisco who was standing watching at the door exclaimed here comes piedro i hope he is not the boy who sold you the wood mr baker he is the boy though replied the baker and piedro who now entered the shop started at the sight of carlo and francisco whom he had never seen since the day of disgrace in the fruit market your servant signor piedro said carlo i have the honour to tell you that this piece of wood and all that you took out of the basket which you found in the yard of the arsenal belongs to my sister yes indeed cried rosetta piedro being very certain that nobody saw him when he emptied rosettas basket and imagining that he was suspected only upon the bare assertion of a child like rosetta who might be baffled and frightened out of her story boldly denied the charge and defied any one to prove him guilty he has a right to be heard in his own defence said arthur with the cool justice of an englishman and he stopped the angry carlos arm who was going up to the culprit with all the italian vehemence of oratory and gesture arthur went on to say something in bad italian about the excellence of an english trial by jury which carlo was too much enraged to hear but to which francisco paid attention and turning to piedro he asked him if he was willing to be judged by twelve of his equals with all my heart said piedro still maintaining an unmoved countenance and they returned immediately to the little wood market on their way they had passed through the fruit market and crowds of those who were well acquainted with piedros former transactions followed to hear the event of the present trial arthur could not especially as he spoke wretched italian make the eager little merchants understand the nature and advantages of an english trial by jury they preferred their own summary mode of proceeding francisco in whose integrity they all had perfect confidence was chosen with unanimous shouts for the judge but he declined the office and another was appointed he was raised upon a bench and the guilty but insolent looking piedro and the ingenuous modest rosetta stood before him she made her complaint in a very artless manner and piedro with ingenuity which in a better cause would have deserved admiration spoke volubly and craftily in his own defence but all that he could say could not alter facts the judge compared the notched bit of wood found at the bakers with a piece from which it was cut which he went to see in the yard of the arsenal it was found to fit exactly the judge then found it impossible to restrain the loud indignation of all the spectators the prisoner was sentenced never more to sell wood in the market and the moment sentence was pronounced piedro was hissed and hooted out of the market place thus a third time he deprived himself of the means of earning his bread we shall not dwell upon all his petty methods of cheating in the trades he next attempted he handed lemonade about in a part of naples where he was not known but he lost his customers by putting too much water and too little lemon into this beverage he then took to the waters from the sulphurous springs and served them about to foreigners but one day as he was trying to jostle a competitor from the coach door he slipped his foot and broke his glasses they had been borrowed from an old woman who hired out glasses to the boys who sold lemonade piedro knew that it was the custom to pay of course for all that was broken but this he was not inclined to do he had a few shillings in his pocket and thought that it would be very clever to defraud this poor woman of her right and to spend his shillings upon what he valued much more than he did his good namemacaroni the shillings were soon gone we shall now for the present leave piedro to his follies and his fate or to speak more properly to his follies and their inevitable consequences francisco was all this time acquiring knowledge from his new friends without neglecting his own or his fathers business he contrived during the course of autumn and winter to make himself a tolerable arithmetician carlos father could draw plans in architecture neatly and pleased with the eagerness francisco showed to receive instruction he willingly put a pencil and compasses into his hand and taught him all he knew himself francisco had great perseverance and by repeated trials he at length succeeded in copying exactly all the plans which his master lent him his copies in time surpassed the originals and carlo exclaimed with astonishment why francisco what an astonishing genius you have for drawingabsolutely you draw plans better than my father as to genius said francisco honestly i have none all that i have done has been done by hard labour i dont know how other people do things but i am sure that i never have been able to get anything done well but by patience dont you remember carlo how you and even rosetta laughed at me the first time your father put a pencil into my awkward clumsy hands because said carlo laughing again at the recollection you held your pencil so drolly and when you were to cut it you cut it just as if you were using a pruning knife to your vines but now it is your turn to laugh for you surpass us all and the times are changed since i set about to explain this rule of mine to you ay that rule said franciscohow much i owe to it some great people when they lose any of their fine things cause the crier to promise a reward of so much money to anyone who shall find and restore their trinket how richly have you and your father rewarded me for returning this rule franciscos modesty and gratitude as they were perfectly sincere attached his friends to him most powerfully but there was one person who regretted our heros frequent absences from his vineyard at resina not franciscos father for he was well satisfied his son never neglected his business and as to the hours spent in naples he had so much confidence in francisco that he felt no apprehensions of his getting into bad company when his son had once said to him i spend my time at such a place and in such and such a manner he was as well convinced of its being so as if he had watched and seen him every moment of the day but it was arthur who complained of franciscos absence i see because i am an englishman said he you dont value my friendship and yet that is the very reason you ought to value it no friends so good as the english be it spoken without offence to your italian friend for whom you now continually leave me to dodge up and down here in resina without a soul that i like to speak to for you are the only italian i ever liked you shall like another i promise you said francisco you must come with me to carlos and see how i spend my evenings then complain of me if you can it was the utmost stretch of arthurs complaisance to pay this visit but in spite of his national prejudices and habitual reserve of temper he was pleased with the reception he met with from the generous carlo and the playful rosetta they showed him franciscos drawings with enthusiastic eagerness and arthur though no great judge of drawing was in astonishment and frequently repeated i know a gentleman who visits my master who would like these things i wish i might have them to show him take them then said carlo i wish all naples could see them provided they might be liked half as well as i like them arthur carried off the drawings and one day when his master was better than usual and when he was at leisure eating a dessert of franciscos grapes he entered respectfully with his little portfolio under his arm and begged permission to show his master a few drawings done by the gardeners son whose grapes he was eating though not quite so partial a judge as the enthusiastic carlo this gentleman was both pleased and surprised at the sight of these drawings considering how short a time francisco had applied himself to this art and what slight instructions he had received arthur was desired to summon the young artist franciscos honest open manner joined to the proofs he had given of his abilities and the character arthur gave him for strict honesty and constant kindness to his parents interested mr lee the name of this english gentleman much in his favour mr lee was at this time in treaty with an italian painter whom he wished to engage to copy for him exactly some of the cornices mouldings tablets and antique ornaments which are to be seen amongst the ruins of the ancient city of herculaneum chapter iii tutte le gran faciende si fanno di poca cosa what great events from trivial causes spring signor camillo the artist employed by mr lee to copy some of the antique ornaments in herculaneum was a liberal minded man perfectly free from that mean jealousy which would repress the efforts of rising genius here is a lad scarcely fifteen a poor gardeners son who with merely the instructions he could obtain from a common carpenter has learned to draw these plans and elevations which you see are tolerably neat what an advantage your instruction would be to him said mr lee as he introduced francisco to signor camillo i am interested in this lad from what i have learned of his good conduct i hear he is strictly honest and one of the best of sons let us do something for him if you will give him some knowledge of your art i will as far as money can recompense you for your loss of time pay whatever you may think reasonable for his instruction signor camillo made no difficulties he was pleased with his pupils appearance and every day he liked him better and better in the room where they worked together there were some large books of drawings and plates which francisco saw now and then opened by his master and which he had a great desire to look over but when he was left in the room by himself he never touched them because he had not permission signor camillo the first day he came into this room with his pupil said to him here are many valuable books and drawings young man i trust from the character i have heard of you that they will be perfectly safe here some weeks after francisco had been with the painter they had occasion to look for the front of a temple in one of these large books what dont you know in which book to look for it francisco cried his master with some impatience is it possible that you have been here so long with these books and that you cannot find the print i mean had you half the taste i gave you credit for you would have singled it out from all the rest and have it fixed in your memory but signor i never saw it said francisco respectfully or perhaps i should have preferred it that you never saw it young man is the very thing of which i complain is a taste for the arts to be learned think you by looking at the cover of a book like this is it possible that you never thought of opening it often and often cried francisco have i longed to open it but i thought it was forbidden me and however great my curiosity in your absence i have never touched them i hoped indeed that the time would come when you would have the goodness to show them to me and so the time is come excellent young man cried camillo much as i love taste i love integrity more i am now sure of your having the one and let me see whether you have as i believe you have the other sit you down here beside me and we will look over these books together the attention with which his young pupil examined everything and the pleasure he unaffectedly expressed in seeing these excellent prints sufficiently convinced his judicious master that it was not from the want of curiosity or taste that he had never opened these tempting volumes his confidence in francisco was much increased by this circumstance slight as it may appear one day signor camillo came behind francisco as he was drawing with much intentness and tapping him upon the shoulder he said to him put up your pencils and follow me i can depend upon your integrity i have pledged myself for it bring your note book with you and follow me i will this day show you something that will entertain you at least as much as my large book of prints follow me francisco followed till they came to the pit near the entrance of herculaneum i have obtained leave for you to accompany me said his master and you know i suppose that this is not a permission granted to everyone paintings of great value besides ornaments of gold and silver antique bracelets rings etc are from time to time found amongst these ruins and therefore it is necessary that no person should be admitted whose honesty cannot be depended upon thus even franciscos talents could not have advanced him in the world unless they had been united to integrity he was much delighted and astonished by the new scene that was now opened to his view and as day after day he accompanied his master to this subterraneous city he had leisure for observation he was employed as soon as he had gratified his curiosity in drawing there are niches in the walls in several places from which pictures have been dug and these niches are often adorned with elegant masques figures and animals which have been left by the ignorant or careless workmen and which are going fast to destruction signor camillo who was copying these for his english employer had a mind to try his pupils skill and pointing to a niche bordered with grotesque figures he desired him to try if he could make any hand of it francisco made several trials and at last finished such an excellent copy that his enthusiastic and generous master with warm encomiums carried it immediately to his patron and he had the pleasure to receive from mr lee a purse containing five guineas as a reward and encouragement for his pupil francisco had no sooner received this money than he hurried to his father and mothers cottage his mother some months before this time had taken a small dairy farm and her son had once heard her express a wish that she was but rich enough to purchase a remarkably fine brindled cow which belonged to a farmer in the neighbourhood here my dear mother cried francisco pouring the guineas into her lap and here continued he emptying a bag which contained about as much more in small italian coins the profits of trade money he had fairly earned during the two years he sold fruit amongst the little neapolitan merchants this is all yours dearest mother and i hope it will be enough to pay for the brindled cow nay you must not refuse mei have set my heart upon the cow being milked by you this very evening and ill produce my best bunches of grapes and my father perhaps will give us a melon for ive had no time for melons this season and ill step to naples and invitemay i mothermy good friends dear carlo and your favourite little rosetta and my old drawing master and my friend arthur and well sup with you at your dairy the happy mother thanked her son and the father assured him that neither melon nor pine apple should be spared to make a supper worthy of his friends the brindled cow was bought and arthur and carlo and rosetta most joyfully accepted their invitation the carpenter had unluckily appointed to settle a long account that day with one of his employers and he could not accompany his children it was a delicious evening they left naples just as the sea breeze after the heats of the day was most refreshingly felt the walk to resina the vineyard the dairy and most of all the brindled cow were praised by carlo and rosetta with all the italian superlatives which signify most beautiful most delightful most charming whilst the english arthur with as warm a heart was more temperate in his praise declaring that this was the most like an english summers evening of any he had ever felt since he came to italy and that moreover the cream was almost as good as what he had been used to drink in cheshire the company who were all pleased with each other and with the gardeners good fruit which he produced in great abundance did not think of separating till late it was a bright moonlight night and carlo asked his friend if he would walk with them part of the way to naples yes all the way most willingly cried francisco that i may have the pleasure of giving to your father with my own hands this fine bunch of grapes that i have reserved for him out of my own share add this fine pine apple for my share then said his father and a pleasant walk to you my young friends they proceeded gaily along and when they reached naples as they passed through the square where the little merchants held their market francisco pointed to the spot where he found carlos rule he never missed an opportunity of showing his friends that he did not forget their former kindness to him that rule said he has been the cause of all my present happiness and i thank you for oh never mind thanking him now interrupted rosetta but look yonder and tell me what all those people are about she pointed to a group of men women and children who were assembled under a piazza listening in various attitudes of attention to a man who was standing upon a flight of steps speaking in a loud voice and with much action to the people who surrounded him francisco carlo and rosetta joined his audience the moon shone full upon his countenance which was very expressive and which varied frequently according to the characters of the persons whose history he was telling according to all the changes of their fortune this man was one of those who are called improvisatoripersons who in italian towns go about reciting verses or telling stories which they are supposed to invent as they go on speaking some of these people speak with great fluency and collect crowds round them in the public streets when an improvisatore sees the attention of his audience fixed and when he comes to some very interesting part of his narrative he dexterously drops his hat upon the ground and pauses till his auditors have paid tribute to his eloquence when he thinks the hat sufficiently full he takes it up again and proceeds with his story the hat was dropped just as francisco and his two friends came under the piazza the orator had finished one story and was going to commence another he fixed his eyes upon francisco then glanced at carlo and rosetta and after a moments consideration he began a story which bore some resemblance to one that our young english readers may perhaps know by the name of cornaro or the grateful turk francisco was deeply interested in this narrative and when the hat was dropped he eagerly threw in his contribution at the end of the story when the speakers voice stopped there was a momentary silence which was broken by the orator himself who exclaimed as he took up the hat which lay at his feet my friends here is some mistake this is not my hat it has been changed whilst i was taken up with my story pray gentlemen find my hat amongst you it was a remarkably good one a present from a nobleman for an epigram i made i would not lose my hat for twice its value it has my name written withinside of it dominicho improvisatore pray gentlemen examine your hats everybody present examined their hats and showed them to dominicho but his was not amongst them no one had left the company the piazza was cleared and searched in vain the hat has vanished by magic said dominicho yes and by the same magic a statue moves cried carlo pointing to a figure standing in a niche which had hitherto escaped observation the face was so much in the shade that carlo did not at first perceive that the statue was piedro piedro when he saw himself discovered burst into a loud laugh and throwing down dominichos hat which he held in his hand behind him cried a pretty set of novices most excellent players at hide and seek you would make whether piedro really meant to have carried off the poor mans hat or whether he was as he said merely in jest we leave it to those who know his general character to decide carlo shook his head still at your old tricks piedro said he remember the old proverb no fox so cunning but he comes to the furriers at last i defy the furrier and you too replied piedro taking up his own ragged hat i have no need to steal hats i can afford to buy better than youll have upon your head francisco a word with you if you have done crying at the pitiful story you have been listening to so attentively and what would you say to me said francisco following him a few steps do not detain me long because my friends will wait for me if they are friends they can wait said piedro you need not be ashamed of being seen in my company now i can tell you for i am as i always told you i should be the richest man of the two rich you rich cried francisco well then it was impossible you could mean to trick that poor man out of his good hat impossible said piedro francisco did not consider that those who have habits of pilfering continue to practise them often when the poverty which first tempted them to dishonesty ceases impossible you stare when i tell you i am rich but the thing is so moreover i am well with my father at home i have friends in naples and i call myself piedro the lucky look you here said he producing an old gold coin this does not smell of fish does it my father is no longer a fisherman nor i either neither do i sell sugar plums to children nor do i slave myself in a vineyard like some folks but fortune when i least expected it has stood my friend i have many pieces of gold like this digging in my fathers garden it was my luck to come to an old roman vessel full of gold i have this day agreed for a house in naples for my father we shall live whilst we can afford it like great folks you will see and i shall enjoy the envy that will be felt by some of my old friends the little neapolitan merchants who will change their note when they see my change of fortune what say you to all this francisco the honest that i wish you joy of your prosperity and hope you may enjoy it long and well well no doubt of that everyone who has it enjoys it well he always dances well to whom fortune pipes a yes no longer pipe no longer dance replied francisco and here they parted for piedro walked away abruptly much mortified to perceive that his prosperity did not excite much envy or command any additional respect from francisco i would rather said francisco when he returned to carlo and rosetta who waited for him under the portico where he left themi would rather have such good friends as you carlo and arthur and some more i could name and besides that have a clear conscience and work honestly for my bread than be as lucky as piedro do you know he has found a treasure he says in his fathers gardena vase full of gold he showed me one of the gold pieces much good may they do him i hope he came honestly by them said carlo but ever since the affair of the double measure i suspect double dealing always from him it is not our affair however let him make himself happy his way and we ours he that would live in peace and rest must hear and see and say the best b all piedros neighbours did not follow this peaceable maxim for when he and his father began to circulate the story of the treasure found in the garden the village of resina did not give them implicit faith people nodded and whispered and shrugged their shoulders then crossed themselves and declared that they would not for all the riches of naples change places with either piedro or his father regardless or pretending to be regardless of these suspicions piedro and his father persisted in their assertions the fishing nets were sold and everything in their cottage was disposed of they left resina went to live at naples and after a few weeks the matter began to be almost forgotten in the village the old gardener franciscos father was one of those who endeavoured to think the best and all that he said upon the subject was that he would not exchange francisco the honest for piedro the lucky that one cant judge of the day till one sees the evening as well as the morning not to leave our readers longer in suspense we must inform them that the peasants of resina were right in their suspicions piedro had never found any treasure in his fathers garden but he came by his gold in the following manner after he was banished from the little wood market for stealing rosettas basketful of wood after he had cheated the poor woman who let glasses out to hire out of the value of the glasses which he broke and in short after he had entirely lost his credit with all who knew him he roamed about the streets of naples reckless of what became of him he found the truth of the proverb that credit lost is like a venice glass brokenit cant be mended again the few shillings which he had in his pocket supplied him with food for a few days at last he was glad to be employed by one of the peasants who came to naples to load their asses with manure out of the streets they often follow very early in the morning or during the night time the trace of carriages that are gone or that are returning from the opera and piedro was one night at this work when the horses of a noblemans carriage took fright at the sudden blaze of some fireworks the carriage was overturned near him a lady was taken out of it and was hurried by her attendants into a shop where she stayed till her carriage was set to rights she was too much alarmed for the first ten minutes after her accident to think of anything but after some time she perceived that she had lost a valuable diamond cross which she had worn that night at the opera she was uncertain where she had dropped it the shop the carriage the street were searched for it in vain piedro saw it fall as the lady was lifted out of the carriage seized upon it and carried it off ignorant as he was of the full value of what he had stolen he knew not how to satisfy himself as to this point without trusting someone with the secret after some hesitation he determined to apply to a jew who as it was whispered was ready to buy everything that was offered to him for sale without making any troublesome inquiries it was late he waited till the streets were cleared and then knocked softly at the back door of the jews house the person who opened the door for piedro was his own father piedro started back but his father had fast hold of him what brings you here said the father in a low voice a voice which expressed fear and rage mixed only to ask my waymy shortest way stammered piedro no equivocations tell me what brings you here at this time of the night i will know piedro who felt himself in his fathers grasp and who knew that his father would certainly search him to find out what he had brought to sell thought it most prudent to produce the diamond cross his father could but just see its lustre by the light of a dim lamp which hung over their heads in the gloomy passage in which they stood you would have been duped if you had gone to sell this to the jew it is well it has fallen into my hands how came you by it piedro answered that he had found it in the street go your ways home then said his father it is safe with me concern yourself no more about it piedro was not inclined thus to relinquish his booty and he now thought proper to vary in his account of the manner in which he found the cross he now confessed that it had dropped from the dress of a lady whose carriage was overturned as she was coming home from the opera and he concluded by saying that if his father took his prize from him without giving him his share of the profits he would go directly to the shop where the lady stopped whilst her servants were raising the carriage and that he would give notice of his having found the cross piedros father saw that his smart son though scarcely sixteen years of age was a match for him in villainy he promised him that he should have half of whatever the jew would give for the diamonds and piedro insisted upon being present at the transaction we do not wish to lay open to our young readers scenes of iniquity it is sufficient to say that the jew who was a man old in all the arts of villainy contrived to cheat both his associates and obtained the diamond cross for less than half its value the matter was managed so that the transaction remained undiscovered the lady who lost the cross after making fruitless inquiries gave up the search and piedro and his father rejoiced in the success of their manuvres it is said that ill gotten wealth is quickly spent and so it proved in this instance both father and son lived a riotous life as long as their money lasted and it did not last many months what his bad education began bad company finished and piedros mind was completely ruined by the associates with whom he became connected during what he called his prosperity when his money was at an end these unprincipled friends began to look cold upon him and at last plainly told himif you mean to live with us you must live as we do they lived by robbery piedro though familiarized to the idea of fraud was shocked at the thought of becoming a robber by profession how difficult it is to stop in the career of vice whether piedro had power to stop or whether he was hurried on by his associates we shall for the present leave in doubt chapter iv we turn with pleasure from piedro the cunning to francisco the honest francisco continued the happy and useful course of his life by his unremitting perseverance he improved himself rapidly under the instructions of his master and friend signor camillo his friend we say for the fair and open character of francisco won or rather earned the friendship of this benevolent artist the english gentleman seemed to take a pride in our heros success and good conduct he was not one of those patrons who think that they have done enough when they have given five guineas his servant arthur always considered every generous action of his masters as his own and was particularly pleased whenever this generosity was directed towards francisco as for carlo and the little rosetta they were the companions of all the pleasant walks which francisco used to take in the cool of the evening after he had been shut up all day at his work and the old carpenter delighted with the gratitude of his pupil frequently repeatedthat he was proud to have given the first instructions to such a genius and that he had always prophesied francisco would be a great man and a good man papa said rosetta for though he has grown so great and though he goes into palaces now to say nothing of that place underground where he has leave to go yet notwithstanding all this he never forgets my brother carlo and you thats the way to have good friends said the carpenter and i like his way he does more than he says facts are masculine and words are feminine these goods friends seemed to make francisco happier than piedro could be made by his stolen diamonds one morning francisco was sent to finish a sketch of the front of an ancient temple amongst the ruins of herculaneum he had just reached the pit and the men were about to let him down with cords in the usual manner when his attention was caught by the shrill sound of a scolding womans voice he looked and saw at some paces distant this female fury who stood guarding the windlass of a well to which with threatening gestures and most voluble menaces she forbade all access the peasantsmen women and children who had come with their pitchers to draw water at this wellwere held at bay by the enraged female not one dared to be the first to advance whilst she grasped with one hand the handle of the windlass and with the other tanned muscular arm extended governed the populace bidding them remember that she was padrona or mistress of the well they retired in hopes of finding a more gentle padrona at some other well in the neighbourhood and the fury when they were out of sight divided the long black hair which hung over her face and turning to one of the spectators appealed to them in a sober voice and asked if she was not right in what she had done i that am padrona of the well said she addressing herself to francisco who with great attention was contemplating her with the eye of a painteri that am padrona of the well must in times of scarcity do strict justice and preserve for ourselves alone the water of our well there is scarcely enough even for ourselves i have been obliged to make my husband lengthen the ropes every day for this week past if things go on at this rate there will soon be not one drop of water left in my well nor in any of the wells of the neighbourhood added one of the workmen who was standing by and he mentioned several in which the water had lately suddenly decreased and a miller affirmed that his mill had stopped for want of water francisco was struck by these remarks they brought to his recollection similar facts which he had often heard his father mention in his childhood as having been observed previous to the last eruption of mount vesuvius a he had also heard from his father in his childhood that it is better to trust to prudence than to fortune and therefore though the peasants and workmen to whom he mentioned his fears laughed and said that as the burning mountain had been favourable to them for so many years they would trust to it and st januarius one day longer yet francisco immediately gave up all thoughts of spending this day amidst the ruins of herculaneum after having inquired sufficiently after having seen several wells in which the water had evidently decreased and after having seen the mill wheels that were standing still for want of their usual supply he hastened home to his father and mother reported what he had heard and seen and begged of them to remove and to take what things of value they could to some distance from the dangerous spot where they now resided some of the inhabitants of resina whom he questioned declared that they had heard strange rumbling noises underground and a peasant and his son who had been at work the preceding day in a vineyard a little above the village related that they had seen a sudden puff of smoke come out of the earth close to them and that they had at the same time heard a noise like the going off of a pistol b the villagers listened with large eyes and open ears to these relations yet such was their habitual attachment to the spot they lived upon or such the security in their own good fortune that few of them would believe that there could be any necessity for removingwell see what will happen to morrow we shall be safe here one day longer said they franciscos father and mother more prudent than the generality of their neighbours went to the house of a relation at some miles distance from vesuvius and carried with them all their effects in the meantime francisco went to the villa where his english friends resided the villa was in a most dangerous situation near terre del grecoa town that stands at the foot of mount vesuvius he related all the facts that he had heard to arthur who not having been like the inhabitants of resina familiarized to the idea of living in the vicinity of a burning mountain and habituated to trust in st januarius was sufficiently alarmed by franciscos representations he ran to his masters apartment and communicated all that he had just heard the count de flora and his lady who were at this time in the house ridiculed the fears of arthur and could not be prevailed upon to remove even as far as naples the lady was intent upon preparations for her birthday which was to be celebrated in a few days with great magnificence at their villa and she observed that it would be a pity to return to town before that day and they had everything arranged for the festival the prudent englishman had not the gallantry to appear to be convinced by these arguments and he left the place of danger he left it not too soon for the next morning exhibited a scenea scene which we shall not attempt to describe we refer our young readers to the account of this dreadful eruption of mount vesuvius published by sir w hamilton in the philosophical transactions it is sufficient here to say that in the space of about five hours the wretched inhabitants of torre del greco saw their town utterly destroyed by the streams of burning lava which poured from the mountain the villa of count de flora with some others which were at a little distance from the town escaped but they were absolutely surrounded by the lava the count and countess were obliged to fly from their house with the utmost precipitation in the night time and they had not time to remove any of their furniture their plate clothes or jewels a few days after the eruption the surface of the lava became so cool that people could walk upon it though several feet beneath the surface it was still exceedingly hot numbers of those who had been forced from their houses now returned to the ruins to try to save whatever they could but these unfortunate persons frequently found their houses had been pillaged by robbers who in these moments of general confusion enrich themselves with the spoils of their fellow creatures has the count abandoned his villa and is there no one to take care of his plate and furniture the house will certainly be ransacked before morning said the old carpenter to francisco who was at his house giving him an account of their flight francisco immediately went to the counts house in warn him of his danger the first person he saw was arthur who with a face of terror said to him do you know what has happened it is all over with resina all over with resina what has there been a fresh eruption has the lava reached resina no but it will inevitably be blown up there said arthur pointing to a thin figure of an italian who stood pale and trembling and looking up to heaven as he crossed himself repeatedly there said arthur is a man who has left a parcel of his cursed rockets and fireworks with i dont know how much gunpowder in the counts house from which we have just fled the wind blows that way one spark of fire and the whole is blown up francisco waited not to hear more but instantly without explaining his intentions to anyone set out for the counts villa and with a bucket of water in his hand crossed the beds of lava with which the house was encompassed when reaching the hall where the rockets and gunpowder were left he plunged them into the water and returned with them in safety over the lava yet warm under his feet what was the surprise and joy of the poor firework maker when he saw francisco return from this dangerous expedition he could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw the rockets and the gunpowder all safe the count who had given up the hopes of saving his palace was in admiration when he heard of this instance of intrepidity which properly saved not only his villa but the whole village of resina from destruction these fireworks had been prepared for the celebration of the countess birthday and were forgotten in the hurry of the night on which the inhabitants fled from torre del greco brave young man said the count to francisco i thank you and shall not limit my gratitude to thanks you tell me that there is danger of my villa being pillaged by robbers it is from this moment your interest as well as mine to prevent their depredations for trust to my liberality a portion of all that is saved of mine shall be yours bravo bravissimo exclaimed one who started from a recessed window in the hall where all this passed bravo bravissimofrancisco thought he knew the voice and the countenance of this man who exclaimed with so much enthusiasm he remembered to have seen him before but when or where he could not recollect as soon as the count left the hall the stranger came up to francisco is it possible said he that you dont know me it is scarcely a twelvemonth since i drew tears from your eyes tears from my eyes repeated francisco smiling i have shed but few tears i have had but few misfortunes in my life the stranger answered him by two extempore italian lines which conveyed nearly the same idea that has been so well expressed by an english poet to each their sufferingsall are men condemnd alike to groan the feeling for anothers woes th unfeeling for his own i know you now perfectly well cried francisco you are the improvisatore who one fine moonlight night last summer told us the story of cornaro the turk the same said the improvisatore the same though in a better dress which i should not have thought would have made so much difference in your eyes though it makes all the difference between man and man in the eyes of the stupid vulgar my genius has broken through the clouds of misfortune of late a few happy impromptu verses i made on the count de floras fall from his horse attracted attention the count patronizes me i am here now to learn the fate of an ode i have just composed for his ladys birthday my ode was to have been set to music and to have been performed at his villa near torre del greco if these troubles had not intervened now that the mountain is quiet again people will return to their senses i expect to be munificently rewarded but perhaps i detain you go i shall not forget to celebrate the heroic action you have performed this day i still amuse myself amongst the populace in my tattered garb late in the evenings and i shall sound your praises through naples in a poem i mean to recite on the late eruption of mount vesuvius adieu the improvisatore was as good as his word that evening with more than his usual enthusiasm he recited his verses to a great crowd of people in one of the public squares amongst the crowd were several to whom the name of francisco was well known and by whom he was well beloved these were his young companions who remembered him as a fruit seller amongst the little merchants they rejoiced to hear his praises and repeated the lines with shouts of applause let us pass what is all this disturbance in the streets said a man pushing his way through the crowd a lad who held by his arm stopped suddenly on hearing the name of francisco which the people were repeating with so much enthusiasm ha i have found at last a story that interests you more than that of cornaro the turk cried the improvisatore looking in the face of the youth who had stopped so suddenly you are the young man who last summer had liked to have tricked me out of my new hat promise me you wont touch it now said he throwing down the hat at his feet or you hear not one word i have to say not one word of the heroic action performed at the villa of the count de flora near torre del greco this morning by signor francisco signor francisco repeated the lad with disdain well let us hear what you have to tell of him added he your hat is very safe i promise you i shall not touch it what of signor francisco signor francisco i may without impropriety call him said the improvisatore for he is likely to become rich enough to command the title from those who might not otherwise respect his merit likely to become rich how said the lad whom our readers have probably before this time discovered to be piedro how pray is he likely to become rich enough to be a signor the count de flora has promised him a liberal portion of all the fine furniture plate and jewels that can be saved from his villa at torre del greco francisco is gone down hither now with some of the counts domestics to protect the valuable goods against those villainous plunderers who robbed their fellow creatures of what even the flames of vesuvius would spare come we have had enough of this stuff cried the man whose arm piedro held come away and he hurried forwards this man was one of the villains against whom the honest orator expressed such indignation he was one of those with whom piedro got acquainted during the time that he was living extravagantly upon the money he gained by the sale of the stolen diamond cross that robbery was not discovered and his success as he called it hardened him in guilt he was both unwilling and unable to withdraw himself from the bad company with whom his ill gotten wealth connected him he did not consider that bad company leads to the gallows the universal confusion which followed the eruption of mount vesuvius was to these villains a time of rejoicing no sooner did piedros companion hear of the rich furniture plate etc which the imprudent orator had described as belonging to the count de floras villa than he longed to make himself master of the whole it is a pity said piedro that the count has sent francisco with his servants down to guard it and who is this francisco of whom you seem to stand in so much awe a boy a young lad only of about my own age but i know him to be sturdily honest the servants we might corrupt but even the old proverb of angle with a silver hook wont hold good with him and if he cannot be won by fair means he must be conquered by foul said the desperate villain but if we offer him rather more than the count has already promised for his share of the booty of course he will consult at once his safety and his interest no said piedro that is not his nature i know him from a child and we had better think of some other house for to nights business none other none but this cried his companion with an oath my mind is determined upon this and you must obey your leader recollect the fate of him who failed me yesterday the person to whom he alluded was one of the gang of robbers who had been assassinated by his companions for hesitating to commit some crime suggested by their leader no tyranny is so dreadful as that which is exercised by villains over their young accomplices who become their slaves piedro who was of a cowardly nature trembled at the threatening countenance of his captain and promised submission in the course of the morning inquiries were made secretly amongst the counts servants and the two men who were engaged to sit up at the villa that night along with francisco were bribed to second the views of this gang of thieves it was agreed that about midnight the robbers should be let into the house that francisco should be tied hand and foot whilst they carried off their booty he is a stubborn chap though so young i understand said the captain of the robbers to his men but we carry poniards and know how to use them piedro you look pale you dont require to be reminded of what i said to you when we were alone just now piedros voice failed and some of his comrades observed that he was young and new to the business the captain who from being his pretended friend during his wealthy days had of late become his tyrant cast a stern look at piedro and bid him be sure to be at the old jews which was the place of meeting in the dusk of the evening after saying this he departed piedro when he was alone tried to collect his thoughtsall his thoughts were full of horror where am i said he to himself what am i about did i understand rightly what he said about poniards francisco oh francisco excellent kind generous francisco yes i recollect your look when you held the bunch of grapes to my lips as i sat by the sea shore deserted by all the world and now what friends have i robbers and the word murderers he could not utter he again recollected what had been said about poniards and the longer his mind fixed upon the words and the look that accompanied them the more he was shocked he could not doubt but that it was the serious intention of his accomplices to murder francisco if he should make any resistance piedro had at this moment no friend in the world to whom he could apply for advice or assistance his wretched father died some weeks before this time in a fit of intoxication piedro walked up and down the street scarcely capable of thinking much less of coming to any rational resolution the hours passed away the shadows of the houses lengthened under his footsteps the evening came on and when it grew dusk after hesitating in great agony of mind for some time his fear of the robbers vengeance prevailed over every other feeling and he went at the appointed hour to the place of meeting the place of meeting was at the house of that jew to whom he several months before sold the diamond cross that cross which he thought himself so lucky to have stolen and to have disposed of undetected was in fact the cause of his being in his present dreadful situation it was at the jews that he connected himself with this gang of robbers to whom he was now become an absolute slave oh that i dared to disobey said he to himself with a deep sigh as he knocked softly at the back door of the jews house the back door opened into a narrow unfrequented street and some small rooms at this side of the house were set apart for the reception of guests who desired to have their business kept secret these rooms were separated by a dark passage from the rest of the house and numbers of people came to the shop in the front of the house which looked into a creditable street without knowing anything more from the ostensible appearance of the shop than that it was a kind of pawnbrokers where old clothes old iron and all sorts of refuse goods might be disposed of conveniently at the moment piedro knocked at the back door the front shop was full of customers and the jews boy whose office it was to attend to these signals let piedro in told him that none of his comrades were yet come and left him in a room by himself he was pale and trembling and felt a cold dew spread over him he had a leaden image of saint januarius tied round his neck which in the midst of his wickedness he superstitiously preserved as a sort of charm and on this he kept his eyes stupidly fixed as he sat alone in this gloomy place he listened from time to time but he heard no noise at the side of the house where he was his accomplices did not arrive and in a sort of impatient terror the attendant upon an evil conscience he flung open the door of his cell and groped his way through the passage which he knew led to the public shop he longed to hear some noise and to mix with the living the jew when piedro entered the shop was bargaining with a poor thin looking man about some gunpowder i dont deny that it has been wet said the man but since it was in the bucket of water it has been carefully dried i tell you the simple truth that so soon after the grand eruption of mount vesuvius the people of naples will not relish fireworks my poor little rockets and even my catherine wheels will have no effect i am glad to part with all i have in this line of business a few days ago i had fine things in readiness for the countess de floras birthday which was to have been celebrated at the counts villa why do you fix your eyes on me friend what is your discourse to me said piedro who imagined that the man fixed his eyes upon him as he mentioned the name of the counts villa i did not know that i fixed my eyes upon you i was thinking of my fireworks said the poor man simply but now that i do look at you and hear your voice i recollect having had the pleasure of seeing you before when where said piedro a great while ago no wonder you have forgotten me said the man but i can recall the night to your recollection you were in the street with me the night i let off that unlucky rocket which frightened the horses and was the cause of overturning a ladys coach dont you remember the circumstance i have a confused recollection of some such thing said piedro in great embarrassment and he looked suspiciously at this man in doubt whether he was cunning and wanted to sound him or whether he was so simple as he appeared you did not perhaps hear then continued the man that there was a great search made after the overturn for a fine diamond cross belonging to the lady in the carriage that lady though i did not know it till lately was the countess de flora i know nothing of the matter interrupted piedro in great agitation his confusion was so marked that the firework maker could not avoid taking notice of it and a silence of some moments ensued the jew more practised in dissimulation than piedro endeavoured to turn the mans attention back to his rockets and his gunpowderagreed to take the gunpowderpaid for it in haste and was though apparently unconcerned eager to get rid of him but this was not so easily done the mans curiosity was excited and his suspicions of piedro were increased every moment by all the dark changes of his countenance piedro overpowered with the sense of guilt surprised at the unexpected mention of the diamond cross and of the count de floras villa stood like one convicted and seemed fixed to the spot without power of motion i want to look at the old cambric that you said you hadthat would do for makingthat you could let me have cheap for artificial flowers said the firework maker to the jew and as he spoke his eye from time to time looked towards piedro piedro felt for the leaden image of the saint which he wore round his neck the string which held it cracked and broke with the pull he gave it this slight circumstance affected his terrified and superstitious mind more than all the rest he imagined that at this moment his fate was decided that saint januarius deserted him and that he was undone he precipitately followed the firework man the instant he left the shop and seizing hold of his arm whispered i must speak to you speak then said the man astonished not here this way said he drawing him towards the dark passage what i have to say must not be overheard you are going to the count de floras are not you i am said the man he was going there to speak to the countess about some artificial flowers but piedro thought he was going to speak to her about the diamond cross you are going to give information against me nay hear me i confess that i purloined that diamond cross but i can do the count a great service upon condition that he pardons me his villa is to be attacked this night by four well armed men they will set out five hours hence i am compelled under the threat of assassination to accompany them but i shall do no more i throw myself upon the counts mercy hasten to himwe have no time to lose the poor man who heard this confession escaped from piedro the moment he loosed his arm with all possible expedition he ran to the counts palace in naples and related to him all that had been said by piedro some of the counts servants on whom he could most depend were at a distant part of the city attending their mistress but the english gentleman offered the services of his man arthur arthur no sooner heard the business and understood that francisco was in danger than he armed himself without saying one word saddled his english horse and was ready to depart before anyone else had finished their exclamations and conjectures but we are not to set out yet said the servant it is but four miles to torre del greco the sbirri officers of justice are summonedthey are to go with uswe must wait for them they waited much against arthurs inclination a considerable time for these sbirri at length they set out and just as they reached the villa the flash of the pistol was seen from one of the apartments in the house the robbers were there this pistol was snapped by their captain at poor francisco who had bravely asserted that he would as long as he had life defend the property committed to his care the pistol missed fire for it was charged with some of the damaged powder which the jew had bought that evening from the firework maker and which he had sold as excellent immediately afterwards to his favourite customersthe robbers who met at his house arthur as soon as he perceived the flash of the piece pressed forward through all the apartments followed by the counts servants and the officers of justice at the sudden appearance of so many armed men the robbers stood dismayed arthur eagerly shook franciscos hand congratulating him upon his safety and did not perceive till he had given him several rough friendly shakes that his arm was wounded and that he was pale with the loss of blood it is not muchonly a slight wound said francisco one that i should have escaped if i had been upon my guard but the sight of a face that i little expected to see in such company took from me all presence of mind and one of the ruffians stabbed me here in the arm whilst i stood in stupid astonishment oh take me to prison take me to prisoni am weary of lifei am a wretch not fit to live cried piedro holding his hands to be tied by the sbirri the next morning piedro was conveyed to prison and as he passed through the streets of naples he was met by several of those who had known him when he was a child ay said they as he went by his father encouraged him in cheating when he was but a child and see what he is come to now he is a man he was ordered to remain twelve months in solitary confinement his captain and his accomplices were sent to the galleys and the jew was banished from naples and now having got these villains out of the way let us return to honest francisco his wound was soon healed arthur was no bad surgeon for he let his patient get well as fast as he pleased and carlo and rosetta nursed him with so much kindness that he was almost sorry to find himself perfectly recovered now that you are able to go out said franciscos father to him you must come and look at my new house my dear son your new house father yes son and a charming one it is and a handsome piece of land near itall at a safe distance too from mount vesuvius and can you guess how i came by itit was given to me for having a good son yes cried carlo the inhabitants of resina and several who had property near terre del greco and whose houses and lives were saved by your intrepidity in carrying the materials for the fireworks and the gunpowder out of this dangerous place went in a body to the duke and requested that he would mention your name and these facts to the king who amongst the grants he has made to the sufferers by the late eruption of mount vesuvius has been pleased to say that he gives this house and garden to your father because you have saved the property and lives of many of his subjects the value of a handsome portion of furniture plate etc in the count de floras villa was according to the counts promise given to him and this money he divided between his own family and that of the good carpenter who first put a pencil into his hands arthur would not accept of any present from him to mr lee the english gentleman he offered one of his own drawingsa fruit piece i like this very well said arthur as he examined the drawing but i should like this melon better if it was a little bruised it is now three years ago since i was going to buy that bruised melon from you you showed me your honest nature then though you were but a boy and i have found you the same ever since a good beginning makes a good endingan honest boy will make an honest man and honesty is the best policy as you have proved to all who wanted the proof i hope yes added franciscos father i think it is pretty plain that piedro the cunning has not managed quite so well as francisco the honest tarlton delightful task to rear the tender thought to teach the young idea how to shoot to pour the fresh instruction oer the mind to breathe th enlivening spiritand to fix the generous purpose in the glowing breast thomson young hardy was educated by mr freeman a very excellent master at one of our rural sunday schools he was honest obedient active and good natured hence he was esteemed by his master and being beloved by all his companions who were good he did not desire to be loved by the bad nor was he at all vexed or ashamed when idle mischievous or dishonest boys attempted to plague or ridicule him his friend loveit on the contrary wished to be universally liked and his highest ambition was to be thought the best natured boy in the schooland so he was he usually went by the name of poor loveit and everybody pitied him when he got into disgrace which he frequently did for though he had a good disposition he was led to do things which he knew to be wrong merely because he could never have the courage to say no because he was afraid to offend the ill natured and could not bear to be laughed at by fools one fine autumn evening all the boys were permitted to go out to play in a pleasant green meadow near the school loveit and another boy called tarlton began to play a game of battledore and shuttlecock and a large party stood by to look on for they were the best players at battledore and shuttlecock in the school and this was a trial of skill between them when they had got it up to three hundred and twenty the game became very interesting the arms of the combatants tired that they could scarcely wield the battledores the shuttlecock began to waver in the air now it almost touched the ground and now to the astonishment of the spectators mounted again high over their heads yet the strokes became feebler and feebler and now loveit now tarlton resounded on all sides for another minute the victory was doubtful but at length the setting sun shining full in loveits face so dazzled his eyes that he could no longer see the shuttlecock and it fell at his feet after the first shout for tarltons triumph was over everybody exclaimed poor loveit hes the best natured fellow in the world what a pity that he did not stand with his back to the sun now i dare you all to play another game with me cried tarlton vauntingly and as he spoke he tossed the shuttlecock up with all his forcewith so much force that it went over the hedge and dropped into a lane which went close beside the field hey day said tarlton what shall we do now the boys were strictly forbidden to go into the lane and it was upon their promise not to break this command that they were allowed to play in the adjoining field no other shuttlecock was to be had and their play was stopped they stood on the top of the bank peeping over the hedge i see it yonder said tarlton i wish somebody would get it one could get over the gate at the bottom of the field and be back again in half a minute added he looking at loveit but you know we must not go into the lane said loveit hesitatingly pugh said tarlton why now what harm could it do i dont know said loveit drumming upon his battledore but you dont know man why then what are you afraid of i ask you loveit coloured went on drumming and again in a lower voice said he didnt know but upon tarltons repeating in a more insolent tone i ask you man what youre afraid of he suddenly left off drumming and looking round said he was not afraid of anything that he knew of yes but you are said hardy coming forward am i said loveit of what pray am i afraid of doing wrong afraid of doing wrong repeated tarlton mimicking him so that he made everybody laugh now hadnt you better say afraid of being flogged no said hardy coolly after the laugh had somewhat subsided i am as little afraid of being flogged as you are tarlton but i meant no matter what you meant why should you interfere with your wisdom and your meanings nobody thought of asking you to stir a step for us but we asked loveit because hes the best fellow in the world and for that very reason you should not ask him because you know he cant refuse you anything indeed though cried loveit piqued there youre mistaken for i could refuse if i chose it hardy smiled and loveit half afraid of his contempt and half afraid of tarltons ridicule stood doubtful and again had recourse to his battledore which he balanced most curiously upon his forefinger look at himnow do look at him cried tarlton did you ever in your life see anybody look so sillyhardy has him quite under his thumb hes so mortally afraid of parson prig that he dare not for the soul of him turn either of his eyes from the tip of his nose look how he squints i dont squint said loveit looking up and nobody has me under his thumb and what hardy said was only for fear i should get in disgrace hes the best friend i have loveit spoke this with more than usual spirit for both his heart and his pride were touched come along then said hardy taking him by the arm in an affectionate manner and he was just going when tarlton called after him ay go along with its best friend and take care it does not get into a scrapegood bye little panado whom do they call little panado said loveit turning his head hastily back never mind said hardy what does it signify no said loveit to be sure it does not signify but one does not like to be called little panado besides added he after going a few steps farther theyll all think it so ill natured i had better go back and just tell them that im very sorry i cant get their shuttlecock do come back with me no said hardy i cant go back and youd better not but i assure you i wont stay a minute wait for me added loveit and he slunk back again to prove that he was not little panado once returned the rest followed of course for to support his character of good nature he was obliged to yield to the entreaties of his companions and to show his spirit leapt over the gate amidst the acclamations of the little mobhe was quickly out of sight here cried he returning in about five minutes quite out of breath ive got the shuttlecock and ill tell you what ive seen cried he panting for breath what cried everybody eagerly why just at the turn of the corner at the end of the lanepanting well said tarlton impatiently do go on let me just take breath first pughnever mind your breath well then just at the turn of the corner at the end of the lane as i was looking about for the shuttlecock i heard a great rustling somewhere near me and so i looked where it could come from and i saw in a nice little garden on the opposite side of the way a boy about as big as tarlton sitting in a great tree shaking the branches so i called to the boy to beg one but he said he could not give me one for that they were his grandfathers and just at that minute from behind a gooseberry bush up popped the uncle the grandfather poked his head out of the window so i ran off as fast as my legs would carry me though i heard him bawling after me all the way and let him bawl cried tarlton he shant bawl for nothing im determined well have some of his fine large rosy apples before i sleep to night at this speech a general silence ensued everybody kept their eyes fixed upon tarlton except loveit who looked down apprehensive that he should be drawn on much farther than he intended oh indeed said he to himself as hardy told me i had better not have come back regardless of this confusion tarlton continued but before i say any more i hope we have no spies amongst us if there is any one of you afraid to be flogged let him march off this instant loveit coloured bit his lips wished to go but had not the courage to move first he waited to see what everybody else would do nobody stirred so loveit stood still well then cried tarlton giving his hand to the boy next him then to the next your word and honour that you wont betray me but stand by me and ill stand by you each boy gave his hand and his promise repeating stand by me and ill stand by you loveit hung back till the last and had almost twisted off the button of the boys coat who screened him when tarlton came up holding out his hand come loveit lad youre in for it stand by me and ill stand by you indeed tarlton expostulated he without looking him in the face i do wish youd give up this scheme i daresay all the apples are gone by this time i wish you would do pray give up this scheme what scheme man you havent heard it yet you may as well know your text before you begin preaching the corners of loveits mouth could not refuse to smile though in his heart he felt not the slightest inclination to laugh why i dont know you i declare i dont know you to day said tarlton you used to be the best natured most agreeable lad in the world and would do anything one asked you but youre quite altered of late as we were saying just now when you skulked away with hardy comedo man pluck up a little spirit and be one of us or youll make us all hate you hate me repeated loveit with terror no surely you wont all hate me and he mechanically stretched out his hand which tarlton shook violently saying ay now thats right ay now thats wrong whispered loveits conscience but his conscience was of no use to him for it was always overpowered by the voice of numbers and though he had the wish he never had the power to do right poor loveit i knew he would not refuse us cried his companions and even tarlton the moment he shook hands with him despised him it is certain that weakness of mind is despised both by the good and the bad the league being thus formed tarlton assumed all the airs of commander explained his schemes and laid the plan of attack upon the poor old mans apple tree it was the only one he had the world we shall not dwell upon their consultation for the amusement of contriving such expeditions is often the chief thing which induces idle boys to engage in them there was a small window at the end of the back staircase through which between nine and ten oclock at night tarlton accompanied by loveit and another boy crept out it was a moonlight night and after crossing the field and climbing the gate directed by loveit who now resolved to go through the affair with spirit they proceeded down the lane with rash yet fearful steps at a distance loveit saw the white washed cottage and the apple tree beside it they quickened their pace and with some difficulty scrambled through the hedge which fenced the garden though not without being scratched and torn by the briers everything was silent yet now and then at every rustling of the leaves they started and their hearts beat violently once as loveit was climbing the apple tree he thought he heard a door in the cottage open and earnestly begged his companions to desist and return home this however he could by no means persuade them to do until they had filled their pockets with apples then to his great joy they returned crept in at the window and each retired as softly as possible to his own apartment loveit slept in the room with hardy whom he had left fast asleep and whom he now was extremely afraid of awakening all the apples were emptied out of loveits pockets and lodged with tarlton till the morning for fear the smell should betray the secret to hardy the room door was apt to creak but it was opened with such precaution that no noise could be heard and loveit found his friend as fast asleep as when he left him ah said he to himself how quietly he sleeps i wish i had been sleeping too the reproaches of loveits conscience however served no other purpose but to torment him he had not sufficient strength of mind to be good the very next night in spite of all his fears and all his penitence and all his resolutions by a little fresh ridicule and persuasion he was induced to accompany the same party on a similar expedition we must observe that the necessity for continuing their depredations became stronger the third day for though at first only a small party had been in the secret by degrees it was divulged to the whole school and it was necessary to secure secrecy by sharing the booty everyone was astonished that hardy with all his quickness and penetration had not yet discovered their proceedings but loveit could not help suspecting that he was not quite so ignorant as he appeared to be loveit had strictly kept his promise of secrecy but he was by no means an artful boy and in talking to his friend conscious that he had something to conceal he was perpetually on the point of betraying himself then recollecting his engagement he blushed stammered bungled and upon hardys asking what he meant would answer with a silly guilty countenance that he did not know or abruptly break off saying oh nothing nothing at all it was in vain that he urged tarlton to permit him to consult his friend a gloom overspread tarltons brow when he began to speak on the subject and he always returned a peremptory refusal accompanied with some such taunting expression as thisi wish we had nothing to do with such a sneaking fellow hell betray us all i see before we have done with him well said loveit to himself so i am abused after all and called a sneaking fellow for my pains thats rather hard to be sure when ive got so little by the job in truth he had not got much for in the division of the booty only one apple and half of another which was only half ripe happened to fall to his share though to be sure when they had all eaten their apples he had the satisfaction to hear everybody declare they were very sorry they had forgotten to offer some of theirs to poor loveit in the meantime the visits to the apple tree had been now too frequently repeated to remain concealed from the old man who lived in the cottage he used to examine his only tree very frequently and missing numbers of rosy apples which he had watched ripening he though not prone to suspicion began to think that there was something going wrong especially as a gap was made in his hedge and there were several small footsteps in his flower beds the good old man was not at all inclined to give pain to any living creature much less to children of whom he was particularly fond nor was he in the least avaricious for though he was not rich he had enough to live upon because he had been very industrious in his youth and he was always very ready to part with the little he had nor was he a cross old man if anything would have made him angry it would have been the seeing his favourite tree robbed as he had promised himself the pleasure of giving his red apples to his grandchildren on his birthday however he looked up at the tree in sorrow rather than in anger and leaning upon his staff he began to consider what he had best do if i complain to their master said he to himself they will certainly be flogged and that i should be sorry for yet they must not be let to go on stealing that would be worse still for it would surely bring them to the gallows in the end let me seeoh ay that will do i will borrow farmer kents dog barker hell keep them off ill answer for it farmer kent lent his dog barker cautioning his neighbour at the same time to be sure to chain him well for he was the fiercest mastiff in england the old man with farmer kents assistance chained him fast to the trunk of the apple tree night came and tarlton loveit and his companions returned at the usual hour grown bolder now by frequent success they came on talking and laughing but the moment they had set their foot in the garden the dog started up and shaking the chain as he sprang forward barked with unremitting fury they stood still as if fixed to the spot there was just moonlight enough to see the dog let us try the other side of the tree said tarlton but to whichever side they turned the dog flew round in an instant barking with increased fury hell break his chain and tear us to pieces cried tarlton and struck with terror he immediately threw down the basket he had brought with him and betook himself to flight with the greatest precipitation help me oh pray help me i cant get through the hedge cried loveit in a lamentable tone whilst the dog growled hideously and sprang forward to the extremity of his chain i cant get out oh for gods sake stay for me one minute dear tarlton he called in vain he was left to struggle through his difficulties by himself and of all his dear friends not one turned back to help him at last torn and terrified he got through the hedge and ran home despising his companions for their selfishness nor could he help observing that tarlton with all his vaunted prowess was the first to run away from the appearance of danger the next morning loveit could not help reproaching the party with their conduct why could not you any of you stay one minute to help me said he we did not hear you call answered one i was so frightened said another i would not have turned back for the whole world and you tarlton i said tarlton had not i enough to do to take care of myself you blockhead everyone for himself in this world so i see said loveit gravely well man is there anything strange in that strange why yes i thought you all loved me lord love you lad so we do but we love ourselves better hardy would not have served me so however said loveit turning away in disgust tarlton was alarmed pugh said he what nonsense have you taken into your brain think no more about it we are all very sorry and beg your pardon come shake hands forgive and forget loveit gave his hand but gave it rather coldly i forgive it with all my heart said he but i cannot forget it so soon why then you are not such a good humoured fellow as we thought you were surely you cannot bear malice loveit loveit smiled and allowed that he certainly could not bear malice well then come you know at the bottom we all love you and would do anything in the world for you poor loveit flattered in his foible began to believe that they did love him at the bottom as they said and even with his eyes open consented again to be duped how strange it is thought he that i should set such value upon the love of those i despise when im once out of this scrape ill have no more to do with them im determined compared with his friend hardy his new associates did indeed appear contemptible for all this time hardy had treated him with uniform kindness avoided to pry into his secrets yet seemed ready to receive his confidence if it had been offered after school in the evening as he was standing silently beside hardy who was ruling a sheet of paper for him tarlton in his brutal manner came up and seizing him by the arm cried come along with me loveit ive something to say to you i cant come now said loveit drawing away his arm ah do come now said tarlton in a voice of persuasion well ill come presently nay but do pray theres a good fellow come now because i have something to say to you what is it youve got to say to me i wish youd let me alone said loveit yet at the same time he suffered himself to be led away tarlton took particular pains to humour him and bring him into temper again and even though he was not very apt to part with his playthings went so far as to say loveit the other day you wanted a top ill give you mine if you desire it loveit thanked him and was overjoyed at the thought of possessing this top but what did you want to say to me just now ay well talk of that presently not yetwhen we get out of hearing nobody is near us said loveit come a little farther however said tarlton looking round suspiciously well now well you know the dog that frightened us last night yes it will never frighten us again wont it how so look here said tarlton drawing something from his pocket wrapped in a blue handkerchief whats that tarlton opened it raw meat exclaimed loveit how came you by it tom the servant boy tom got it for me and im to give him sixpence and is it for the dog yes i vowed id be revenged on him and after this hell never bark again never bark again what do you mean is it poison exclaimed loveit starting back with horror only poison for a dog said tarlton confused you could not look more shocking if it was poison for a christian loveit stood for nearly a minute in profound silence tarlton said he at last in a changed tone and altered manner i did not know you i will have no more to do with you nay but stay said tarlton catching hold of his arm stay i was only joking let go my armyou were in earnest but then that was before i knew there was any harm if you think theres any harm if said loveit why you know i might not know for tom told me its a thing thats often done ask tom ill ask nobody surely we know better whats right and wrong than tom does but only just ask him to hear what hell say i dont want to hear what hell say cried loveit vehemently the dog will die in agoniesin agonies there was a dog poisoned at my fathersi saw him in the yard poor creature he lay and howled and writhed himself poor creature well theres no harm done now cried tarlton in a hypocritical tone but though he thought fit to dissemble with loveit he was thoroughly determined in his purpose poor loveit in haste to get away returned to his friend hardy but his mind was in such agitation that he neither talked nor moved like himself and two or three times his heart was so full that he was ready to burst into tears how good natured you are to me said he to hardy as he was trying vainly to entertain him but if you knew here he stopped short for the bell for evening prayer rang and they all took their places and knelt down after prayers as they were going to bed loveit stopped tarltonwell asked he in an inquiring manner fixing his eyes upon him well replied tarlton in an audacious tone as if he meant to set his inquiring eye at defiance what do you mean to do to night to go to sleep as you do i suppose replied tarlton turning away abruptly and whistling as he walked off oh he has certainly changed his mind said loveit to himself else he could not whistle about ten minutes after this as he and hardy were undressing hardy suddenly recollected that he had left his new kite out upon the grass oh said he it will be quite spoiled before morning call tom said loveit and bid him bring it in for you in a minute they both went to the top of the stairs to call tom no one answered they called again louder is tom below im here answered he at last coming out of tarltons room with a look of mixed embarrassment and effrontery and as he was receiving hardys commission loveit saw the corner of the blue handkerchief hanging out of his pocket this excited fresh suspicions in loveits mind but without saying one word he immediately stationed himself at the window in his room which looked out towards the lane and as the moon was risen he could see if anyone passed that way what are you doing there said hardy after he had been watching some time why dont you come to bed loveit returned no answer but continued standing at the window nor did he watch long in vain presently he saw tom gliding slowly along a by path and get over the gate into the lane hes gone to do it exclaimed loveit aloud with an emotion which he could not command whos gone to do what cried hardy starting up how cruel how wicked continued loveit whats cruelwhats wicked speak out at once returned hardy in that commanding tone which in moments of danger strong minds feel themselves entitled to assume towards weak ones loveit instantly though in an incoherent manner explained the affair to him scarcely had the words passed his lips when hardy sprang up and began dressing himself without saying one syllable for gods sake what are you going to do said loveit in great anxiety theyll never forgive me dont betray me theyll never forgive pray speak to me only say you wont betray us i will not betray you trust to me said hardy and he left the room and loveit stood in amazement while in the meantime hardy in hopes of overtaking tom before the fate of the poor dog was decided ran with all possible speed across the meadow then down the lane he came up with tom just as he was climbing the bank into the old mans garden hardy too much out of breath to speak seized hold of him dragged him down detaining him with a firm grasp whilst he panted for utterance what master hardy is it you whats the matter what do you want i want the poisoned meat that you have in your pocket who told you that i had any such thing said tom clapping his hand upon his guilty pocket give it me quietly and ill let you off sir upon my word i havent i didnt i dont know what you mean said tom trembling though he was by far the stronger of the two indeed i dont know what you mean you do said hardy with great indignation and a violent struggle immediately commenced the dog now alarmed by the voices began to bark outrageously tom was terrified lest the old man should come out to see what was the matter his strength forsook him and flinging the handkerchief and meat over the hedge he ran away with all his speed the handkerchief fell within reach of the dog who instantly snapped at it luckily it did not come untied hardy saw a pitchfork on a dunghill close beside him and seizing upon it stuck it into the handkerchief the dog pulled tore growled grappled yelled it was impossible to get the handkerchief from between his teeth but the knot was loosed the meat unperceived by the dog dropped out and while he dragged off the handkerchief in triumph hardy with inexpressible joy plunged the pitchfork into the poisoned meat and bore it away never did hero retire with more satisfaction from a field of battle full of the pleasure of successful benevolence hardy tripped joyfully home and vaulted over the window sill when the first object he beheld was mr power the usher standing at the head of the stairs with his candle in his hand come up whoever you are said mr william power in a stern voice i thought i should find you out at last come up whoever you are hardy obeyed without replyhardy exclaimed mr power starting back with astonishment is it you mr hardy repeated he holding the light to his face why sir said he in a sneering tone im sure if mr trueman was here he wouldnt believe his own eyes but for my part i saw through you long since i never liked saints for my share will you please to do me the favour sir if it is not too much trouble to empty your pockets hardy obeyed in silence heyday meat raw meat what next thats all said hardy emptying his pockets inside out this is all said mr power taking up the meat pray sir said hardy eagerly let that meat be burned it is poisoned poisoned cried mr william power letting it drop out of his fingers you wretch looking at him with a menacing air what is all this speak hardy was silent why dont you speak cried he shaking him by the shoulder impatiently still hardy was silent down upon your knees this minute and confess all tell me where youve been what youve been doing and who are your accomplices for i know there is a gang of you so added he pressing heavily upon hardys shoulder down upon your knees this minute and confess the whole thats your only way now to get off yourself if you hope for my pardon i can tell you its not to be had without asking for sir said hardy in a firm but respectful voice i have no pardon to ask i have nothing to confess i am innocent but if i were not i would never try to get off myself by betraying my companions very well sir very well very fine stick to it stick to it i advise you and we shall see and how will you look to morrow mr innocent when my uncle the doctor comes home as i do now sir said hardy unmoved his composure threw mr power into a rage too great for utterance sir continued hardy ever since i have been at school i never told a lie and therefore sir i hope you will believe me now upon my word and honour sir i have done nothing wrong nothing wrong better and better what when i caught you going out at night that to be sure was wrong said hardy recollecting himself but except that except that sir i will except nothing come along with me young gentleman your time for pardon is past saying these words he pulled hardy along a narrow passage to a small closet set apart for desperate offenders and usually known by the name of the black hole there sir take up your lodging there for to night said he pushing him in to morrow ill know more or ill know why added he double locking the door with a tremendous noise upon his prisoner and locking also the door at the end of the passage so that no one could have access to him so now i think i have you safe said mr william power to himself stalking off with steps which made the whole gallery resound and which made many a guilty heart tremble the conversation which had passed between hardy and mr power at the head of the stairs had been anxiously listened to but only a word or two here and there had been distinctly overheard the locking of the black hole door was a terrible soundsome knew not what it portended and others knew too well all assembled in the morning with faces of anxiety tarlton and loveits were the most agitated tarlton for himself loveit for his friend for himself for everybody every one of the party and tarlton at their head surrounded him with reproaches and considered him as the author of the evils which hung over them how could you do so and why did you say anything to hardy about it when you had promised too oh what shall we all do what a scrape you have brought us into loveit its all your fault all my fault repeated poor loveit with a sigh well that is hard goodness theres the bell exclaimed a number of voices at once now for it they all stood in a half circle for morning prayers they listenedhere he is coming noyeshere he is and mr william power with a gloomy brow appeared and walked up to his place at the head of the room they knelt down to prayers and the moment they rose mr william power laying his hand upon the table cried stand still gentlemen if you please everybody stood stock still he walked out of the circle they guessed that he was gone for hardy and the whole room was in commotion each with eagerness asked each what none could answer has he told what has he told who has he told of i hope he has not told of me cried they ill answer for it he has told of all of us said tarlton and ill answer for it he has told of none of us answered loveit with a sigh you dont think hes such a fool when he can get himself off said tarlton at this instant the prisoner was led in and as he passed through the circle every eye was fixed upon him his eye fell upon no one not even upon loveit who pulled him by the coat as he passedeveryone felt almost afraid to breathe well sir said mr power sitting down in mr truemans elbow chair and placing the prisoner opposite to him well sir what have you to say to me this morning nothing sir answered hardy in a decided yet modest manner nothing but what i said last night nothing more nothing more sir but i have something more to say to you sir then and a great deal more i promise you before i have done with you and then seizing him in a fury he was just going to give him a severe flogging when the schoolroom door opened and mr trueman appeared followed by an old man whom loveit immediately knew he leaned upon his stick as he walked and in his other hand carried a basket of apples when they came within the circle mr trueman stopped short hardy exclaimed he with a voice of unfeigned surprise whilst mr william power stood with his hand suspendeday hardy sir repeated he i told him youd not believe your own eyes mr trueman advanced with a slow step now sir give me leave said the usher eagerly drawing him aside and whispering so sir said mr t when the whisper was done addressing himself to hardy with a voice and manner which had he been guilty must have pierced him to the heart i find i have been deceived in you it is but three hours ago that i told your uncle i never had a boy in my school in whom i placed so much confidence but after all this show of honour and integrity the moment my back is turned you are the first to set an example of disobedience of my orders why do i talk of disobeying my commandsyou are a thief i sir exclaimed hardy no longer able to repress his feelings you siryou and some others said mr trueman looking round the room with a penetrating glanceyou and some others ay sir interrupted mr william power get that out of him if you canask him i will ask him nothing i shall neither put his truth nor his honour to the trial truth and honour are not to be expected amongst thieves i am not a thief i have never had anything to do with thieves cried hardy indignantly have you not robbed this old man dont you know the taste of these apples said mr trueman taking one out of the basket no sir i do not i never touched one of that old mans apples never touched one of them i suppose this is some vile equivocation you have done worse you have had the barbarity the baseness to attempt to poison his dog the poisoned meat was found in your pocket last night the poisoned meat was found in my pocket sir but i never intended to poison the dogi saved his life lord bless him said the old man nonsensecunning said mr power i hope you wont let him impose upon you sir no he cannot impose upon me i have a proof he is little prepared for said mr trueman producing the blue handkerchief in which the meat had been wrapped tarlton turned pale hardys countenance never changed dont you know this handkerchief sir i do sir is it not yours no sir dont you know whose it is cried mr power hardy was silent now gentlemen said mr trueman i am not fond of punishing you but when i do it you know it is always in earnest i will begin with the eldest of you i will begin with hardy and flog you with my own hands till this handkerchief is owned im sure its not mine and im sure its none of mine burst from every mouth whilst they looked at each other in dismay for none but hardy loveit and tarlton knew the secret my cane said mr trueman and mr power handed him the cane loveit groaned from the bottom of his heart tarlton leaned back against the wall with a black countenance hardy looked with a steady eye at the cane but first said mr trueman laying down the cane let us see perhaps we may find out the owner of this handkerchief another way examining the corners it was torn almost to pieces but luckily the corner that was marked remained j t cried mr trueman every eye turned upon the guilty tarlton who now as pale as ashes and trembling in every limb sank down upon his knees and in a whining voice begged for mercy upon my word and honour sir ill tell you all id never have thought of stealing the apples if loveit had not first told me of them and it was tom who first put the poisoning the dog into my head it was he that carried the meat wasnt it said he appealing to hardy whose word he knew must be believed oh dear sir continued he as mr trueman began to move towards him do let me off pray do let me off this time im not the only one indeed sir i hope you wont make me an example for the rest its very hard im to be flogged more than they im not going to flog you thank you sir said tarlton getting up and wiping his eyes you need not thank me said mr trueman take your handkerchiefgo out of this roomout of this house let me never see you more if i had any hopes of him said mr trueman as he shut the door after himif i had any hopes of him i would have punished himbut i have none punishment is meant only to make people better and those who have any hopes of themselves will know how to submit to it at these words loveit first and immediately all the rest of the guilty party stepped out of the ranks confessed their fault and declared themselves ready to bear any punishment their master thought proper oh they have been punished enough said the old man forgive them sir hardy looked as if he wished to speak not because you ask it said mr trueman to the guilty penitents though i should be glad to oblige youit wouldnt be just but there pointing to hardy there is one who has merited a reward the highest i can give him is that of pardoning his companions hardy bowed and his face glowed with pleasure whilst everybody present sympathized in his feelings i am sure thought loveit this is a lesson i shall never forget gentlemen said the old man with a faltering voice it wasnt for the sake of my apples that i spoke and you sir said he to hardy i thank you for saving my dog if you please ill plant on that mount opposite the window a young apple tree from my old one i will water it and take care of it with my own hands for your sake as long as i am able and may god bless you laying his trembling hand on hardys head may god bless youim sure god will bless all such boys as you are the basket woman toute leur tude tait de se complaire et de sentraider a paul et virginie at the foot of a steep slippery white hill near dunstable in bedfordshire called chalk hill there is a hut or rather a hovel which travellers could scarcely suppose could be inhabited if they did not see the smoke rising from its peaked roof an old woman lives in this hovel b and with her a little boy and girl the children of a beggar who died and left these orphans perishing with hunger they thought themselves very happy when the good old woman first took them into her hut and bid them warm themselves at her small fire and gave them a crust of mouldy bread to eat she had not much to give but what she had she gave with good will she was very kind to these poor children and worked hard at her spinning wheel and at her knitting to support herself and them she earned money also in another way she used to follow all the carriages as they went up chalk hill and when the horses stopped to take breath or to rest themselves she put stones behind the carriage wheels to prevent them from rolling backwards down the steep slippery hill the little boy and girl loved to stand beside the good natured old womans spinning wheel when she was spinning and to talk to her at these times she taught them something which she said she hoped they would remember all their lives she explained to them what is meant by telling the truth and what it is to be honest she taught them to dislike idleness and to wish that they could be useful one evening as they were standing beside her the little boy said to her grandmother for that was the name by which she liked that these children should call hergrandmother how often you are forced to get up from your spinning wheel and to follow the chaises and coaches up that steep hill to put stones underneath the wheels to hinder them from rolling back the people who are in the carriages give you a halfpenny or a penny for doing this dont they yes child but it is very hard work for you to go up and down that hill you often say that you are tired and then you know that you cannot spin all that time now if we might go up the hill and put the stones behind the wheels you could sit still at your work and would not the people give us the halfpence and could not we bring them all to you do pray dear grandmother try us for one dayto morrow will you yes said the old woman i will try what you can do but i must go up the hill along with you for the first two or three times for fear you should get yourselves hurt so the next day the little boy and girl went with their grandmother as they used to call her up the steep hill and she showed the boy how to prevent the wheels from rolling back by putting stones behind them and she said this is called scotching the wheels and she took off the boys hat and gave it to the little girl to hold up to the carriage windows ready for the halfpence when she thought that the children knew how to manage by themselves she left them and returned to her spinning wheel a great many carriages happened to go by this day and the little girl received a great many halfpence she carried them all in her brothers hat to her grandmother in the evening and the old woman smiled and thanked the children she said that they had been useful to her and that her spinning had gone on finely because she had been able to sit still at her wheel all day but paul my boy said she what is the matter with your hand only a pinchonly one pinch that i got as i was putting a stone behind a wheel of a chaise it does not hurt me much grandmother and ive thought of a good thing for to morrow i shall never be hurt again if you will only be so good as to give me the old handle of the broken crutch grandmother and the block of wood that lies in the chimney corner and that is of no use ill make it of some use if i may have it take it then dear said the old woman and youll find the handle of the broken crutch under my bed paul went to work immediately and fastened one end of the pole into the block of wood so as to make something like a dry rubbing brush look grandmamma look at my scotcher i call this thing my scotcher said paul because i shall always scotch the wheels with it i shall never pinch my fingers again my hands you see will be safe at the end of this long stick and sister anne you need not be at the trouble of carrying any more stones after me up the hill we shall never want stones any more my scotcher will do without anything else i hope i wish it was morning and that a carriage would come that i might run up the hill and try my scotcher and i wish that as many chaises may go by to morrow as there did to day and that we may bring you as many halfpence grandmother said the little girl so do i my dear anne said the old woman for i mean that you and your brother shall have all the money that you get to morrow you may buy some gingerbread for yourselves or some of those ripe plums that you saw at the fruit stall the other day which is just going into dunstable i told you then that i could not afford to buy such things for you but now that you can earn halfpence for yourselves children it is fair should taste a ripe plum and bit of gingerbread for once and a way in your lives well bring some of the gingerbread home to her shant we brother whispered little anne the morning came but no carriages were heard though paul and his sister had risen at five oclock that they might be sure to be ready for early travellers paul kept his scotcher poised upon his shoulder and watched eagerly at his station at the bottom of the hill he did not wait long before a carriage came he followed it up the hill and the instant the postillion called to him and bid him stop the wheels he put his scotcher behind them and found that it answered the purpose perfectly well many carriages went by this day and paul and anne received a great many halfpence from the travellers when it grew dusk in the evening anne said to her brotheri dont think any more carriages will come by to day let us count the halfpence and carry them home now to grandmother no not yet answered paul let them alonelet them lie still in the hole where i have put them i daresay more carriages will come by before it is quite dark and then we shall have more halfpence paul had taken the halfpence out of his hat and he had put them into a hole in the high bank by the roadside and anne said she would not meddle with them and that she would wait till her brother liked to count them and paul saidif you will stay and watch here i will go and gather some blackberries for you in the hedge in yonder field stand you hereabouts half way up the hill and the moment you see any carriage coming along the road run as fast as you can and call me anne waited a long time or what she thought a long time and she saw no carriage and she trailed her brothers scotcher up and down till she was tired then she stood still and looked again and she saw no carriage so she went sorrowfully into the field and to the hedge where her brother was gathering blackberries and she said paul im sadly tired sadly tired said she and my eyes are quite strained with looking for chaises no more chaises will come to night and your scotcher is lying there of no use upon the ground have not i waited long enough for to day paul oh no said paul here are some blackberries for you you had better wait a little bit longer perhaps a carriage might go by whilst you are standing here talking to me anne who was of a very obliging temper and who liked to do what she was asked to do went back to the place where the scotcher lay and scarcely had she reached the spot when she heard the noise of a carriage she ran to call her brother and to their great joy they now saw four chaises coming towards them paul as soon as they went up the hill followed with his scotcher first he scotched the wheels of one carriage then of another and anne was so much delighted with observing how well the scotcher stopped the wheels and how much better it was than stones that she forgot to go and hold her brothers hat to the travellers for halfpence till she was roused by the voice of a little rosy girl who was looking out of the window of one of the chaises come close to the chaise door said the little girl here are some halfpence for you anne held the hat and she afterwards went on to the other carriages money was thrown to her from each of them and when they had all gotten safely to the top of the hill she and her brother sat down upon a large stone by the roadside to count their treasure first they began by counting what was in the hatone two three four halfpence but oh brother look at this exclaimed anne this is not the same as the other halfpence no indeed it is not cried paul it is no halfpenny it is a guinea a bright golden guinea is it said anne who had never seen a guinea in her life before and who did not know its value and will it do as well as a halfpenny to buy gingerbread ill run to the fruit stall and ask the woman shall i no no said paul you need not ask any woman or anybody but me i can tell you all about it as well as anybody in the whole world the whole world oh paul you forgot not so well as my grandmother why not so well as my grandmother perhaps but anne i can tell you that you must not talk yourself anne but you must listen to me quietly or else you wont understand what i am going to tell you for i can assure you that i dont think i quite understood it myself anne the first time my grandmother told it to me though i stood stock still listening my best prepared by this speech to hear something very difficult to be understood anne looked very grave and her brother explained to her that with a guinea she might buy two hundred and fifty two times as many plums as she could get for a penny why paul you know the fruit woman said she would give us a dozen plums for a penny now for this little guinea would she give us two hundred and fifty two dozen if she has so many and if we like to have so many to be sure she will said paul but i think we should not like to have two hundred and fifty two dozen of plums we could not eat such a number but we could give some of them to my grandmother said anne but still there would be too many for her and for us too said paul and when we had eaten the plums there would be an end to all the pleasure but now ill tell you what i am thinking of anne that we might buy something for my grandmother that would be very useful to her indeed with the guineasomething that would last a great while what brother what sort of thing something that she said she wanted very much last winter when she was so ill with the rheumatismsomething that she said yesterday when you were making her bed she wished she might be able to buy before next winter i know i know what you mean said annea blanket oh yes paul that will be much better than plums do let us buy a blanket for her how glad she will be to see it i will make her bed with the new blanket and then bring her to see it but paul how shall we buy a blanket where are blankets to be got leave that to me ill manage that i know where blankets can be got i saw one hanging out of a shop the day i went last to dunstable you have seen a great many things at dunstable brother yes a great many but i never saw anything there or anywhere else that i wished for half so much as i did for the blanket for my grandmother do you remember how she used to shiver with the cold last winter ill buy the blanket to morrow im going to dunstable with her spinning and youll bring the blanket to me and i shall make the bed very neatly that will be all rightall happy said anne clapping her hands but stay hush dont clap your hands so anne it will not be all happy im afraid said paul and his countenance changed and he looked very grave it will not be all right im afraid for there is one thing we have neither of us thought of but that we ought to think about we cannot buy the blanket im afraid why paul why because i dont think this guinea is honestly ours nay brother but im sure it is honestly ours it was given to us and grandmother said all that was given to us to day was to be our own but who gave it to you anne some of the people in those chaises paul i dont know which of them but i daresay it was the little rosy girl no said paul for when she called you to the chaise door she said heres some halfpence for you now if she gave you the guinea she must have given it to you by mistake well but perhaps some of the people in the other chaises gave it to me and did not give it to me by mistake paul there was a gentleman reading in one of the chaises and a lady who looked very good naturedly at me and then the gentleman put down his book and put his head out of the window and looked at your scotcher brother and he asked me if that was your own making and when i said yes and that i was your sister he smiled at me and put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and threw a handful of halfpence into the hat and i daresay he gave us the guinea along with them because he liked your scotcher so much why said paul that might be to be sure but i wish i was quite certain of it then as we are not quite certain had not we best go and ask my grandmother what she thinks about it paul thought this was excellent advice and he was not a silly boy who did not like to follow good advice he went with his sister directly to his grandmother showed her the guinea and told her how they came by it my dear honest children said she i am very glad you told me all this i am very glad that you did not buy either the plums or the blanket with this guinea im sure it is not honestly ours those who threw it you gave it you by mistake i warrant and what i would have you do is to go to dunstable and try if you can at either of the inns find out the person who gave it to you it is now so late in the evening that perhaps the travellers will sleep at dunstable instead of going on the next stage and it is likely that whosoever gave you a guinea instead of a halfpenny has found out their mistake by this time all you can do is to go and inquire for the gentleman who was reading in the chaise oh interrupted paul i know a good way of finding him out i remember it was a dark green chaise with red wheels and i remember i read the innkeepers name upon the chaise john nelson i am much obliged to you for teaching me to read grandmother you told me yesterday grandmother that the names written upon chaises are the innkeepers to whom they belong i read the name of the innkeeper upon that chaise it was john nelson so anne and i will go to both the inns in dunstable and try to find out this chaisejohn nelsons come anne let us set out before it gets quite dark anne and her brother passed with great courage the tempting stall that was covered with gingerbread and ripe plums and pursued their way steadily through the streets of dunstable but paul when he came to the shop where he had seen the blanket stopped for a moment and said it is a great pity anne that the guinea is not ours however we are doing what is honest and that is a comfort here we must go through this gateway into the inn yard we are come to the dun cow cow said anne i see no cow look up and youll see the cow over your head said paulthe signthe picture come never mind looking at it now i want to find out the green chaise that has john nelsons name upon it paul pushed forward through a crowded passage till he got into the inn yard there was a great noise and bustle the hostlers were carrying in luggage the postillions were rubbing down the horses or rolling the chaises into the coach house what now what business have you here pray said a waiter who almost ran over paul as he was crossing the yard in a great hurry to get some empty bottles from the bottle rack youve no business here crowding up the yard walk off young gentleman if you please pray give me leave sir said paul to stay a few minutes to look amongst these chaises for one dark green chaise with red wheels that has mr john nelsons name written upon it whats that he says about a dark green chaise said one of the postillions what should such a one as he is know about chaises interrupted the hasty waiter and he vas going to turn paul out of the yard but the hostler caught hold of his arm and said maybe the child has some business here lets know what he has to say for himself the waiter was at this instant luckily obliged to leave them to attend the bell and paul told his business to the hostler who as soon as he saw the guinea and heard the story shook paul by the hand and said stand steady my honest lad ill find the chaise for you if it is to be found here but john nelsons chaises almost always drive to the black bull after some difficulty the green chaise with john nelsons name upon it and the postillion who drove that chaise were found and the postillion told paul that he was just going into the parlour to the gentleman he had driven to be paid and that he would carry the guinea with him no said paul we should like to give it back ourselves yes said the hostler that they have a right to do the postillion made no reply but looked vexed and went towards the house desiring the children would wait in the passage till his return in the passage there was standing a decent clean good natured looking woman with two huge straw baskets on each side of her one of the baskets stood a little in the way of the entrance a man who was pushing his way in and carried in his hand a string of dead larks hung to a pole impatient at being stopped kicked down the straw basket and all its contents were thrown out bright straw hats and boxes and slippers were all thrown in disorder upon the dirty ground oh they will be trampled upon they will be all spoiled exclaimed the woman to whom they belonged well help you to pick them up if you will let us cried paul and anne and they immediately ran to her assistance when the things were all safe in the basket again the children expressed a desire to know how such beautiful things could be made of straw but the woman had not time to answer before the postillion came out of the parlour and with him a gentlemans servant who came to paul and clapping him upon the back said so my little chap i gave you a guinea for a halfpenny i hear and i understand youve brought it back again thats right give me hold of it no brother said anne this is not the gentleman that was reading pooh child i came in mr nelsons green chaise heres the postillion can tell you so i and my master came in that chaise i and my master that was reading as you say and it was he that threw the money out to you he is going to bed he is tired and cant see you himself he desires that youll give me the guinea he pushed them towards the door but the basket woman whispered to them as they went out wait in the street till i come to you pray mrs landlady cried this gentlemans servant addressing himself to the landlady who just then came out of a room where some company were at supper pray mrs landlady please to let me have roasted larks for my supper you are famous for larks at dunstable and i make it a rule to taste the best of everything wherever i go and waiter let me have a bottle of claret do you hear larks and claret for his supper said the basket woman to herself as she looked at him from head to foot the postillion was still waiting as if to speak to him and she observed them afterwards whispering and laughing together no bad hit was a sentence which the servant pronounced several times now it occurred to the basket woman that this man had cheated the children out of the guinea to pay for the larks and claret and she thought that perhaps she could discover the truth she waited quietly in the passage waiter joe joe cried the landlady why dont you carry in the sweetmeat puffs and the tarts here to the company in the best parlour coming maam answered the waiter and with a large dish of tarts and puffs the waiter came from the bar the landlady threw open the door of the best parlour to let him in and the basket woman had now a full view of a large cheerful company and amongst them several children sitting round a supper table ay whispered the landlady as the door closed after the waiter and the tarts there are customers enough i warrant for you in that room if you had but the luck to be called in pray what would you have the conscience i wonder now to charge me for these here half dozen little mats to put under my dishes a trifle maam said the basket woman she let the landlady have the mats cheap and the landlady then declared she would step in and see if the company in the best parlour had done supper when they come to their wine added she ill speak a good word for you and get you called in afore the children are sent to bed the landlady after the usual speech of i hope the supper and everything is to your liking ladies and gentlemen began with if any of the young gentlemen or ladies would have a curosity to see any of our famous dunstable straw work theres a decent body without would i daresay be proud to show them her pincushion boxes and her baskets and slippers and her other curosities the eyes of the children all turned towards their mother their mother smiled and immediately their father called in the basket woman and desired her to produce her curiosities the children gathered round her large pannier as it opened but they did not touch any of her things ah papa cried a little rosy girl here are a pair of straw slippers that would just fit you i think but would not straw shoes wear out very soon and would not they let in the wet yes my dear said her father but these slippers are meant for powdering slippers miss interrupted the basket woman to wear when people are powdering their hair continued the gentleman that they may not spoil their other shoes and will you buy them papa no i cannot indulge myself said her father in buying them now i must make amends said he laughing for my carelessness and as i threw away a guinea to day i must endeavour to save sixpence at least ah the guinea that you threw by mistake into the little girls hat as we were coming up chalk hill mamma i wonder that the little girl did not take notice of its being a guinea and that she did not run after the chaise to give it back again i should think if she had been an honest girl she would have returned it missmaamsir said the basket woman if it would not be impertinent may i speak a word a little boy and girl have just been here inquiring for a gentleman who gave them a guinea instead of a halfpenny by mistake and not five minutes ago i saw the boy give the guinea to a gentlemans servant who is there without and who said his master desired it should be returned to him there must be some mistake or some trick in this said the gentleman are the children gone i must see themsend after them ill go for them myself said the good natured basket woman i bid them wait in the street yonder for my mind misgave me that the man who spoke so short to them was a cheat with his larks and his claret paul and anne were speedily summoned and brought back by their friend the basket woman and anne the moment she saw the gentleman knew that he was the very person who smiled upon her who admired her brothers scotcher and who threw a handful of halfpence into the hat but she could not be certain she said that she received the guinea from him she only thought it most likely that she did but i can be certain whether the guinea you returned be mine or no said the gentleman i marked the guinea it was a light one the only guinea i had which i put into my waistcoat pocket this morning he rang the bell and desired the waiter to let the gentleman who was in the room opposite to him know that he wished to see him the gentleman in the white parlour sir do you mean i mean the master of the servant who received a guinea from this child he is a mr pembroke sir said the waiter mr pembroke came and as soon as he heard what had happened he desired the waiter to show him to the room where his servant was at supper the dishonest servant who was supping upon larks and claret knew nothing of what was going on but his knife and fork dropped from his hand and he overturned a bumper of claret as he started up from the table in great surprise and terror when his master came in with a face of indignation and demanded the guineathe guinea sir that you got from this child that guinea which you said i ordered you to ask for from this child the servant confounded and half intoxicated could only stammer out that he had more guineas than one about him and that he really did not know which it was he pulled his money out and spread it upon the table with trembling hands the marked guinea appeared his master instantly turned him out of his service with strong expressions of contempt and now my little honest girl said the gentleman who had admired her brothers scotcher turning to anne and now tell me who you are and what you and your brother want or wish for most in the world in the same moment anne and paul exclaimed the thing we wish for the most in the world is a blanket for our grandmother she is not our grandmother in reality i believe sir said paul but she is just as good to us and taught me to read and taught anne to knit and taught us both that we should be honestso she has and i wish she had a new blanket before next winter to keep her from the cold and the rheumatism she had the rheumatism sadly last winter sir and there is a blanket in this street that would be just the thing for her she shall have it then and continued the gentleman i will do something more for you do you like to be employed or to be idle best we like to have something to do always if we could sir said paul but we are forced to be idle sometimes because grandmother has not always things for us to do that we can do well should you like to learn how to make such baskets as these said the gentleman pointing to one of the dunstable straw baskets oh very much said paul very much said anne then i should like to teach you how to make them said the basket woman for im sure of one thing that youd behave honestly to me the gentleman put a guinea into the good natured basket womans hand and told her that he knew she could not afford to teach them her trade for nothing i shall come through dunstable again in a few months added he and i hope to see that you and your scholars are going on well if i find that they are i will do something more for you but said anne we must tell all this to grandmother and ask her about it and im afraidthough im very happythat it is getting very late and that we should not stay here any longer it is a fine moonlight night said the basket woman and is not far ill walk with you and see you safe home myself the gentleman detained them a few minutes longer till a messenger whom he had dispatched to purchase the much wished for blanket returned your grandmother will sleep well upon this good blanket i hope said the gentleman as he gave it into pauls opened arms it has been obtained for her by the honesty of her adopted children footnotes a hard hearted man the proper species of rush says white in his natural history of selborne seems to be the

to serve the purpose well quite on to autumn the largest and longest are the best decayed labourers women and children make it their business to procure and prepare them as soon as they are cut they must be flung into water and kept there for otherwise they will dry and shrink and the peel will not run when these junci are thus far prepared they must lie out on the grass to be bleached and take the dew for some nights and afterwards be dried in the sun some address is required in dipping these rushes in the scalding fat or grease but this knack is also to be attained by practice a pound of common grease may be procured for fourpence and about six pounds of grease will dip a pound of rushes and one pound of rushes may be bought for one shilling so that a pound of rushes medicated and

bills of exchange upon benches in the streets and when a merchant or banker lost his credit and was unable to pay his debts his bench was broken we must give those of our young english readers who may not be acquainted with the ancient city of herculaneum some idea of it none can be ignorant that near naples is the celebrated volcanic mountain of vesuviusthat from time to time there happen violent eruptions from this mountain that is to say flames and immense clouds of smoke issue from different openings mouths or craters as they are called but more especially from the summit of the mountain which is distinguished by the name of the crater a rumbling and afterwards a roaring noise is heard within and prodigious quantities of stones and minerals burnt into masses scori are thrown out of the crater sometimes to a great distance the hot ashes from mount vesuvius have often been seen upon the roofs of the houses of naples from which it is six miles distant streams of lava run down the sides of the mountains during the time of an eruption destroying everything in their way and overwhelm the houses and vineyards which are in the neighbourhood about years ago during the reign of the roman emperor titus there happened a terrible eruption of mount vesuvius and a large city called herculaneum which was situated at about four miles distance from the volcano was overwhelmed by the streams of lava which poured into it filled up the streets and quickly covered over the tops of the houses so that the whole was no more visible it remained for many years buried the lava which covered it became in time fit for vegetation plants grew there a new soil was formed and a new town called portici was built over this place where herculaneum formerly stood the little village of resina is also situated near the spot about fifty years ago in a poor mans garden at resina a hole in a well about thirty feet below the surface of the earth was observed some persons had the curiosity to enter into this hole and after creeping underground for some time they came to the foundations of houses the peasants inhabitants of the village who had probably never heard of herculaneum were somewhat surprised at their discovery about the same time in a pit in the town of portici a similar passage underground was discovered and by orders of the king of naples workmen were employed to dig away the earth and clear the passage they found at length the entrance into the town which during the reign of titus was buried under lava it was about eighty eight neapolitan palms a palm contains near nine inches below the top of the pit the workmen as they cleared the passages marked their way with chalk when they came to any turning lest they should lose themselves the streets branched out in many directions and lying across them the workmen often found large pieces of timber beams and rafters some broken in the fall others entire these beams and rafters are burned quite black like charcoal except those that were found in moist places which have more the colour of rotten wood and which are like a soft paste into which you might run your hand the walls of the houses slant some one way some another and some are upright several magnificent buildings of brick faced with marble of different colours are partly seen where the workmen have cleared away the earth and lava with which they were encrusted columns of red and white marble and flights of steps are seen in different places and out of the ruins of the palaces some very fine statues and pictures have been dug foreigners who visit naples are very curious to see this subterraneous city and are desirous to carry with them into their own country some proofs of their having examined this wonderful place

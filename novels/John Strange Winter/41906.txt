with the voice jewels to wear princess sarah take this lesson to thy heart that is best which lieth nearest gasper bacerra chapter i orphaned in a poor little street in a crowded city there stood a small house not alone but in the middle of a row of other houses exactly like it there was a tiny bow window on the left of the door and two very small sash windows in the storey above the frames were warped and the paint like that of the door was blistered and cracked in many places and the doorstep looked as if it had been cleaned a week or so before with whiting instead of pipe clay and evidently the person who had done it had doubtless with the very best intentions in the world given the lower part of the door a few daubs with the same cloth which had not at all improved its shabby surface between the house and the pavement there was a small garden a very humble attempt at a garden with a rockery in one corner and a raised bed in the middle it was a noisy street though it was not a thoroughfare for on that hot sultry day the doors and windows were all open and the children were all playing about pavements and road caring little for the heat and dust screaming laughing shouting crying as children will except when they found themselves within reach of the house which i have described then their voices were hushed their tones sobered then they stood to gaze up at the closed blinds which beat now and then against the open windows as if a door had been opened and allowed a draught of air to sweep through the house then one little maid of ten years old or so lifted a warning finger to check a lesser child upon whom the fear and knowledge of death had not yet fallen hush sh don't make a noise annie she said mr gray is dead the younger child annie ceased her laughter turning from the closed house to stare at two ladies who came slowly down the street looking from side to side as if they sought one of the houses in particular this must be it said one as her eyes fell upon the closed blinds yes returned the other that must be it so they passed in at the little gate and knocked softly at the shabby door poor fellow said one with a glance at the bit of garden before the bow window his doing evidently there's not another garden in the street like it no and what pains he must have taken with it poor fellow echoed the other there was a moment's scuffle within the house the sound of loudly whispering voices then a heavy footstep and the door was opened by a stout elderly person in a shabby black gown and white apron a person who was unmistakably a nurse she curtsied as she saw the ladies and the one who had spoken last addressed her we heard early this morning i see the sad news is too true she began yes'm shaking her head he went off quite quiet about ten o'clock last night ah i've seen a many but i never saw a more peaceful end never the two ladies each made a murmur of sympathy and the little girl said one of them well mum she do fret a good bit replied the nurse pityingly poor little thing we have brought some fruit and some other little things said the lady handing a basket to the nurse it's real kind of you mum the old woman cried she'll be rare and pleased she will poor little missy you see mum it's been a queer strange life for a child for she's been everything to him and she never could go out and play in the street with the other children that couldn't be and it was hard for the little thing to see 'em and be shut off from 'em all day as she was and the master on that account used to make hisself more to her which will make it all the harder for her now poor fatherless motherless lamb that she is of course of course poor little maid and what will become of her do you think i can't say for certain mum but the mistress she had relations and the master wrote to one of them on thursday he was sore troubled about little missy was the master aye sore troubled the letter was sent and an answer came this morning to say that one of missy's aunts was coming to day the vicar opened it oh well i'm glad somebody is coming to the poor child said the lady who had brought the basket of fruit i hope it will be all right and you will give her the things nurse with a look at the basket oh yes mum with a curtsey there was not only some fruit in the basket but a pot of jam and a jar of potted meat a glass of jelly some sponge cakes and a packet of sweeties such as little folk love the old nurse carried them into the sitting room and set them down on the table before a little girl who was sitting beside it see missy what a nice basket of good things mrs tracy has brought for you the old woman cried wasn't it kind of her very kind said the little girl brightening up somewhat at the unexpected kindness from one almost a stranger to her grapes miss sarah and peaches and orleans plums and see potted meat now how could she know you're so fond of potted meat i don't know nurse he liked potted meat too you know yes dear yes but he's gone where he has all he's most fond of you know except me murmured sarah under her breath ah that's true my lamb but you mustn't repine him as took the master away so calm and peaceful last night knew just what was best to do and he'll do it never fear it's hard to bear my honey and sure with a sigh no one knows better what bearing such is than old nurse and hark to think of any one coming with a knock like that enough to waken the but then she broke off short and went to open the door chapter ii her new found aunt a short stout well dressed woman stood upon the door step and the cabman was just hauling a box off the roof of his cab mr gray's 'ouse demanded the stout lady ah pore thing i see it's all over pore thing well i'm sorry of course though i don't suppose 'e'll be much loss to any one pore dreaming shiftless thing miss sarah is here mum said the old nurse pointing severely towards the door of the sitting room miss sarah oh the child eh well my dear going into the room and taking sarah's limp and shaking hand i'm sorry to come on such an errand the first time ever i see you but that was your pore pa's fault not mine i never was one to turn my back on my own flesh and blood never though perhaps i say it that shouldn't but your pore pa he was that awkward when he got a crotchet into his 'ead that there was no doing aught with him i think you favour your ma my dear she continued with a complete change of tone your pore pa eh what oh the cab yes i'll come and then she bustled out fumbling at the fastening of a small leather bag which hung over her wrist and leaving poor sarah struck dumb with astonishment the child crept to the door and watched her new found aunt settle with the cabman and it is certain that never had sarah seen a cabman settled with in that fashion before they had not indulged in many cabs during the course of her short life but on the few occasions that they had enjoyed such luxuries her father had paid for them with the air of a prince and with a liberality such as made dispute out of the question alas poor child if the loving father now lying white and silent in the room above had had less of that princely air and still less of that princely instinct of hospitality and generosity life would at that moment probably have been very different for her but all this was beyond sarah who was very young and therefore not likely to see the advantages of the lengthened haggling process going on just then at the gate a moment later mrs stubbs entered the house again in triumph lot of thieving vagabonds them cabmen are to be sure she remarked with an air of indignation mingled with satisfaction but he don't get the better of me not if i know it and so i told him but dear dear 'ow like your pore ma you are child stubbs 'll be glad of it he never could abide him as is gone pore thing well well we needn't say aught again him now for he won't trouble us no more only as i say stubbs 'll be glad of it please who is mr stubbs sarah asked plaintively feeling instinctively that she had better not try to argue with this strange relative mrs stubbs however was so taken aback at so unexpected a question that she was obliged to sit down the better to show the extent of her astonishment well i don't 'old with it she exclaimed to the nurse who had come in to spread the cloth for a cup of tea which the visitor had expressed herself able and willing to take it's bringing up the child like a 'eathen in ignorance of what her own flesh and blood's very names is 'pon my word it is it's 'eathenish miss sarah doesn't understand put in the old nurse pointedly for a moment mrs stubbs gasped much as she might have done if the older woman had dashed a pail of water in her face but she took the hint with a very good grace and turned to sarah again your pore ma my dear was stubbs' own sister she said then mr stubbs is my uncle my own uncle sarah asked your own uncle and i'm your aunt not your own aunt of course sarah but that's no matter i've a good and a feeling 'eart whatever other faults i may have to carry and what's stubbs' flesh and blood is my flesh and blood and so you'll find besides i've seven children of my own and my 'eart feels for them that has no father nor mother to stand by 'em and i believe in sticking to your own everybody's not like that sarah though maybe i say it that shouldn't there is folks that believes in wearing yourself to the bone for other people's advantage and letting your own flesh and blood starve in the gutter so to speak ah well i ain't one of that sort and i'm thankful for it sarah poor little desolate sarah with her suddenly empty life and great aching void in her heart crept a shade closer to her new found aunt and rested her tired head against her substantial arm and i have seven cousins of my own she said the shadows in her eyes clearing away for a moment seven cousins of your own cried mrs stubbs in an ecstasy of enjoyment seven sarah my dear why i have seven children and have i some more aunts and uncles sarah asked feeling not a little bewildered why dear yes three aunts and two uncles on your pore ma's side to say naught of all there may be on your pa's side with which i'm not familiar said mrs stubbs with a certain air such as conveyed to sarah that her ignorance was a decided loss to her father's family in general there's your uncle joe he 'as five boys and lives at 'ampstead and there's your uncle george he 'as only three girls and lives in great style at brighton he's in the corn trade is your uncle george instinctively sarah realized why once when they had been going to the seaside for a fortnight her father had said no no not brighton when that town was suggested and as instinctively she kept the recollection to herself and then there's polly your aunt mary sarah she's the fine lady of the family very 'aughty she is though her and me 'as always been very good friends always still she's uncommon 'aughty and maybe she 'as a right for she married a gentleman in the city and keeps her carriage and pair and a footman too ah well she 'asn't a family 'asn't mrs lennard perhaps if she 'ad 'ad seven children like me she'd have 'ad to be content with a broom as i am we have a broom too said sarah watching the visitor stir her tea round and round indeed we have two and a very old one that jane uses to sweep out the yard with for a minute mrs stubbs was too thoroughly astounded to speak then she subsided into weak fits of laughter such as told sarah she had made a terrible mistake somehow a very old one to sweep out the yard with mrs stubbs cried in gasps oh dear dear why child you're just like a little 'eathen a broom is a carriage a close carriage something like a four wheel cab only better oh dear dear and we keep three do we oh what a joke to tell stubbs miss sarah knows struck in the old nurse with some indignation the doctor's carriage is what mrs stubbs calls a broom dearie sarah turned her crimson face from one to the other but father always called that kind of carriage a bro am she emphasized and i didn't know you meant the same aunt well never mind my dear i shouldn't 'ave laughed at you returned mrs stubbs stirring her tea again with fat complaisance little folks can't be expected to know everything though there are some as does expect it and most unreasonable it is of 'em only sarah it's more stylish to say broom so try to think of it there's a good girl i'll try said sarah hoping that she had somewhat retrieved her character by knowing what kind of carriage her aunt meant by a broom then mrs stubbs had another cup of tea which she seemed to enjoy particularly and you would like to go upstairs mum said the nurse as she set the cup down why yes nurse it's my duty to go and i'm not one as is ever backward in doing 'er duty mrs stubbs replied upheaving herself from the somewhat uncertain depths of the big chair the only easy chair in the house so the two women went up above together to visit that something which sarah had not seen since the moment of death she sat just where they left her a way she had for sarah was a very quiet child wondering how life would be with this new found aunt of hers she was very kind sarah decided and would be very good to her she knew and yet yet there was something about her from which she shrank instinctively something she knew would have offended her father beyond everything poor sarah at that moment mrs stubbs was standing beside all that was left of him that had loved her so dearly during all the years of her short life pore thing she was saying pore thing we weren't good friends nurse but we must not think of that now and i'll be a mother to his little girl just as if there'd never been a cloud between us pore thing only thirty six ah well pore thing but he makes a pretty corpse illustration pore thing she was saying pore thing chapter iii sarah's future is arranged two days later sarah's father was buried laid quietly away in a pretty little churchyard two miles outside the town beside the young wife who had died nine years before the funeral was a very unostentatious affair only one cab followed the coffin and contained sarah and mrs stubbs the old nurse and jane the untidy little maid who after the manner of her sort wept and sobbed and choked until mrs stubbs would right willingly have given her a good shaking sarah was very subdued and quiet and mrs stubbs cried a little and would have cried more had she not been so taken up with keeping an eye on that stupid ninny jane and then they went back to the little hot stuffy house and had a cup of tea after which the vicar of the parish called and had a long talk with mrs stubbs about sarah's future i can't say we was good friends with him pore thing mrs stubbs explained but when death comes between little differences should be forgotten and stubbs and me will forget all our differences now it's stubbs' wish as well as mine i believe in sticking to your own flesh and blood for if your own won't whose can you expect to do it so sarah and me is the best of friends and she is going back with me to share and share alike with my own children oh you are going to take sarah said the vicar who had felt a great interest in the dreamy artist whom they had just left to his last long rest in the quiet country churchyard that is very good of you very good of you i have been wondering what would become of the poor little woman why what should become of her mrs stubbs said indignantly her mother was stubbs' own sister yes said the vicar smiling but it is not every lady who would at all encourage the idea of bringing up a child because her mother happened to be her husband's sister you're right there mr moore you are right mrs stubbs cried but some women 'ave 'earts of stone instead of flesh and blood i'm not one of that sort and about the furniture and so on the vicar broke in having heard mrs stubbs's remarks about her own good qualities several times already mrs stubbs looked round the room in good natured contempt there's nothing to speak of she answered and she was right enough but what there is 'll have to go to paying for the doctor and the undertaker if there's a few pounds left over stubbs says put it into the savings bank and let the child 'ave it when she grows up she'll want to buy a ring or something to remember her father by and you are going to take the sole charge and expense of her the vicar exclaimed oh yes we've seven of our own and when you've so many one more or less makes very little difference but i wanted to ask you something else mr moore and i'll ask it before it slips my memory you know mr gray 'e's gone now pore thing and i don't wish to say aught against him brought sarah up in a very strange way indeed as i said at the time to the nurse it's quite 'eathenish and it you'll believe me sir she didn't even know how many aunts and uncles she 'ad nor what our very names were but he 'as taught her some things and playing the fiddle is one yes sarah plays the violin remarkably well for her age said the vicar promptly yes so the old nurse says returned mrs stubbs with an air of melancholy but i don't altogether 'old with it myself it seems to me such an outlandish thing for a little girl to play on i wish it had been the piano or the 'arp there's so much more style about them the violin is the most fashionable instrument a lady can learn just now mrs stubbs put in the clergyman hastily wishing to secure sarah the free use of her beloved violin if it were possible dear me you don't say so what are young ladies about 'ere learning it mrs stubbs asked with interest yes i was dining at lord allington's last week and in the evening one of his daughters played a violin solo but she doesn't play nearly as well as sarah he replied then sarah shall keep her violin and play to her 'eart's content mrs stubbs cried enthusiastically that was what i wanted to ask you if you thought i should encourage or discourage the child in keeping it up but as you say so plainly encourage i will and sarah shall 'ave good lessons as soon as she's fairly settled down at 'ome illustration then sarah shall keep her violin and play to her 'eart's content that will be the greatest delight to sarah for the child loves her violin said the vicar heartily and that is not all mrs stubbs but if she goes on as she has begun there will always be a useful or at least a remunerative accomplishment at her fingers' ends oh as to that returned mrs stubbs with a lordly indifference to money such as told her visitor that she was well blessed with worldly goods stubbs 'll provide for the child along with his own and maybe her other uncles and aunts 'll do something for her too i will say that for his family as a family they're not mean i will say that for 'em so sarah's future was arranged she was to go home with mrs stubbs who lived at south kensington and be one with her children she was to have the best violin lessons to be had for love or money and mrs stubbs in the warmth of her kindly but vulgar heart even went so far as to suggest that if sarah was a very good industrious girl and got on well with her practising her uncle might very likely be induced to buy her a new violin for her next birthday instead of the dingy old thing she was playing on now poor well meaning mrs stubbs she little knew that the whole of sarah's grateful soul rose in loathing at the suggestion she dropped her bow upon the nearest chair and hugged her precious violin as closely to her breast as if it had been a thing of life and that life was threatened oh auntie she burst out a new violin yes child i think it's very likely returned mrs stubbs delighted to see the effect of her suggestion upon her pale little niece and quite mistaking the meaning of her emotion your uncle is very fond of making nice presents he gave may a new piano last christmas but gasped sarah my violin is a real amati it belonged to my grandfather and if it did what then ejaculated mrs stubbs in no way impressed by the information all the more reason why you should 'ave a new one the wonder to me is you play half as well as you do on an old thing like that it's it's worth five hundred pounds sarah cried her face in a flame illustration it's it's worth five hundred pounds mrs stubbs fairly gasped in her surprise sarah she said what are you saying little girls ought not to tell stories it's wicked do you know where you'll go to sarah i'm shocked and surprised at you auntie dear said sarah it's true all true it is indeed ask the doctor ask the vicar ask any one who knows about violins and they'll tell you it's a real amati it's worth five hundred pounds perhaps more i'm not telling stories auntie but father was offered that much for it only he wouldn't take it because he said it was all he had to give me and that it would be worth more to me some day never had mrs stubbs heard sarah say so much at one time before but her earnest face and manner carried conviction with them and she saw that the child knew what she was talking about and was speaking only what she believed to be the truth you really mean it sarah she asked putting out a hand to touch the wonderful instrument oh yes auntie it's absolutely true returned sarah using the longest adjective she could think of the better to impress her aunt then exclaimed the good lady with radiant triumph you'd better 'old your tongue about it sarah and not say a word about it or you'll be 'aving the probate people down on you robbing the fatherless and the orphan chapter iv her new home at last mr gray's affairs were all cleared up and sarah was about to leave dingy old bridgehampton behind for ever to take up her new life in london the great city of the world there were some very sad farewells to be made still and mrs stubbs was a woman of very good feeling and encouraged the child to go and say good bye to everybody who had been kind to her in the past there is mrs tracy said sarah on the last day she brought me all that fruit and jam and the other things auntie oh you must go and say good bye to 'er of course returned mrs stubbs and we must go and see your pore pa's grave for 'eaven knows when you'll see it again i should like to do that please said sarah in a very low voice well i can't drag out all that way remarked mrs stubbs who being stout was not good at walking exercise we'll have an open carriage if nurse can get one and nurse shall go too so sarah went and said good bye to her father's grave and the wise old nurse after a minute spent beside it drew mrs stubbs away to the other side of the pretty churchyard to show her a curious tombstone about which she had been telling her as they drove along so sarah for a few minutes was left alone free to kneel down and bid her farewell in peace it was a relief to the child to be alone for mrs stubbs though meaning to be kindness itself was not a woman in whose presence it was possible to grieve in comfort her remarks about your pore pa invariably had the effect of stifling any feeling of emotion which was aroused in her childish heart she was very good sarah knew that she meant to be so i'll try not to mind the difference dear father she whispered to the brown sods above his dear head it's all so different to you so different to when there was just you and i together nobody will ever understand me like you dear daddy but auntie means to be very kind and i'll try my hardest to grow up so that you'll love me better when we meet again as she rose up mrs stubbs and the nurse were coming across the grass between the graves to fetch her mrs stubbs noticed the tears on her cheeks and still flooding her eyes nay now you mustn't fret sarah she said kindly 'e's better off pore thing than when he was 'ere so you mustn't fret for 'im there's a good girl sarah wiped her eyes and turned to go away she said nothing for she knew it was no use trying to make her aunt understand that her tears had not been so much for him as for herself and mrs stubbs stood for a moment looking down upon the mould with its covering of brown disjointed sods and its faded wreaths pore thing she murmured it's a sad end to 'ave and he must 'ave felt leaving the little one badly 'fore he brought himself to write that letter pore thing well i'm not one to bear ill will for what's past and gone and so beyond 'elp now and i'll be as much a mother to sarah as if 'im and me had always been the best of friends 'e once said i was vulgar and perhaps i am it's vulgar to 'ave 'earts and such like and he knows better now pore thing for i have a 'eart yes and the queen upon 'er throne she has a 'eart too bless her there were tears on the good soul's cheeks as she turned to follow sarah whom she found at the gate waiting for her by the time she had reached the child she had wiped them but sarah saw that they had been there dear auntie she said he wasn't friends with you but he knows how good you are now and then she flung her arms round her and her victory over her uncle's wife was complete sarah she said when they were nearly at the end of their journey you have never 'ad any playfellows have you dear never auntie not real playfellows sarah answered and flushing up with joy at the anticipation of those who were in store for her well i'd better warn you sarah it may not be all sugar and honey till you get used to them said mrs stubbs solemnly there's a good deal of give and take about children's ways that is if you want to get on peaceable if you get a knock you must just bear it without telling or else you get called a 'tell pie' and treated according it's what i've never encouraged and i must do my children the justice to say if they gets a knock they gives it back again and there's no more about it thus sarah was somewhat prepared for the darker side of her new life though she gathered no true idea of the nest of young ruffians to whom she was made known an hour later they came out with a rush to the door when the carriage stopped and welcomed their mother home again with a fluent and boisterous torrent of joy truly appalling to the little quiet and retiring sarah who was not accustomed to the domestic manners of children of the stubbs class ma what have you brought me is that sarah ma my ain't she a littl'un ma mary was late this morning yes and our kao kao was burnt i told her i should tell you pa slapped johnnie last night because he wouldn't be washed to come down to dessert and flossie has torn her best frock and may hush be quiet children exclaimed mrs stubbs holding her hands to her ears 'pon my word you're like a lot of young savages miss clark can't have taken much care of you whilst i've bin away really you're enough to frighten sarah out of her senses this is your cousin sarah she's going to live 'ere in future so come and say ''ow d'ye do' to her nicely thus bidden the young stubbses all turned their attention on their new cousin and said their greeting and shook hands with various kinds of manner there was may aged fourteen a very consequential young person with an inclination to be short and stout like her mother and had her nice fair hair plaited into a tail behind and tied with a bunch of mauve ribbon worn with a white frock in memory of the uncle by marriage whom she had never seen how d'you do cousin sarah she said with a fine lady air which petrified poor sarah who thought that and her cousin's earrings and watch chain the finest things she had ever beheld about any human being before then there came the redoubtable flossie who had torn her best frock and was twelve and a half flossie who was nearly as big as may came forward with a giggle and said how and went off into fits of laughter at some private joke of her own i'm ashamed of you flossie cried mrs stubbs sharply shake 'ands with your cousin sarah at once ah this is lily lily's five and a 'alf sarah she's the baby then there was tom the eldest boy who gripped hold of sarah's hand and wrung it until she could have shrieked with the pain but taking it as an expression of kindness and welcome she bore it bravely and looked at him with a smiling face she knew better afterwards after tom came the twins minnie and the johnnie who had been slapped the day before and last of all janey the prettiest and sarah fancied the sweetest of them all janey was seven or as she said herself nearly eight i suppose said mrs stubbs addressing herself to flossie that your pa 'asn't got 'ome yet no ma not yet returned flossie but presently when mrs stubbs had changed her dress for a garment such as sarah had never beheld before and which may told her was a tea gown and was enjoying a cup of sweet smelling tea in the large and shady drawing room to sarah a perfect dream of beauty he came came with a bustle and noise like a tempest and caught his stout wife round the waist with a hulloa old woman it's a sight for sore eyes to see you 'ome again sarah had determined to be surprised at nothing but her uncle stubbs was altogether too much for her resolution in apologising to herself afterwards she said she was obliged to stare and where's the little lass mr stubbs asked when he had kissed his wife oh there well aren't you going to speak to your uncle eh yes uncle said sarah shyly he drew her nearer to him and turned her face to the light like her dear ma put in mrs stubbs yes said mr stubbs shortly not like her pa at all mrs stubbs persisted no more shortly still then after a pause i 'ope you'll be a good gal sarah and remember though your father and me wasn't friends yet as long as i've a 'ome to call my own you're welcome to a shelter in it your mother was my favourite sister and though she turned 'er back on me i'll never do that on you never father knows better now uncle said the child with an effort he knows how good you and auntie are to me you'd be friends now wouldn't you earnestly i don't know i don't know at all replied mr stubbs shortly then struck by the pleading look on the child's wistful face added gruffly i suppose we should any way i hope so at this point mrs stubbs broke in any way it's no fault of sarah's that we wasn't all the very best of friends stubbs and sarah and me's real fond of one another already aren't we sarah so say no more about it what's past and gone is beyond 'elp flossie you can take sarah upstairs now it's just six time for your tea be sure she gets a good tea chapter v a taste of the future thus bidden flossie took sarah's hand and led her upstairs you won't like miss clark she remarked as they went we don't like her not any of us she's so mean always telling tales about somebody she got johnnie slapped and sent off to bed last night it was all spite nasty old thing who is miss clark sarah asked feeling rather bewildered miss clark what didn't ma tell you about her ejaculated miss flossie in surprise no auntie never told me about her at all lor there that shows ma herself don't think much of her i'll tell miss clark any way don't don't sarah cried in an agony yes i shall the amiable flossie returned suddenly opening a door and dragging her cousin into the midst of a noisy crew all squabbling round a tea table miss clark what d'you think ma actually never told sarah a single word about you well my dear never mind perhaps mrs stubbs didn't say very much about any of us she didn't put in sarah hastily i suppose this is sarah miss clark went on yes answered flossie adding under her breath to johnnie stupid little thing how do you do sarah asked the governess with the air of primness which had made her unruly young pupils dislike her i hope we shall be very good friends and that you will do your best to be a very tidy and industrious little girl this rather took sarah's breath away but she replied politely that she would try her best come and sit by me sarah said may with a very condescending air of protection yes sit by may added miss clark may is my right hand without may i could not endure all the worry and trial of the others copy may and you will be quite right so sarah watched may mincing with her knife and fork and conscientiously tried to do likewise to the infinite amusement of the younger ones of whom may took no notice whatever and to whose jibing remarks she showed a superb indifference sarah shouted tom stuffing his mouth so full of pressed tongue and bread and butter that sarah's heart stood still for fear of his choking how many pieces of bread and butter can you put into your mouth at once disgusting boy remarked may disdainfully without giving sarah time to reply you grow more atrociously vulgar every day you live hi hi shouted tom seizing a tablespoon and ramming it down his throat until even boy's nature revolted and expressed disapproval put that spoon down cried miss clark authoritatively if i see you do that again tom you shall not go down to dessert now this was almost the only threat by which poor miss clark whose life was one long continued struggle and fight was able to hold her own over tom when he was at home for his holidays not going down to dessert meant not only the punishment of losing a share of the good things below but also it meant inquiry as to the cause of absence and other effects according to evidence tom's exuberance of spirits settled down promptly into discreet behaviour and miss clark had time to look round the table johnnie you are forbidden to eat jam for a week she burst out minnie take his plate away it's a shame poor johnnie isn't to have any jam minnie began whining all for nothing too it's a real downright shame it is and forthwith she took the opportunity of daubing a thick slice of bread and butter with jam off her own plate and smuggling it into the luckless johnnie's hand in such a way that he might eat it upside down to the intense delight of tom opposite who had seen the little manoeuvre and was bursting to disclose it for once nodding and winking had no effect for nobody happened to be looking at him so tom in despair lest such an amusing incident should be altogether lost began vigorously nudging flossie who sat next to him with his elbow flossie unfortunately was in the act of raising a large cup of very hot tea to her lips and tom's nudge causing the hot cup to touch her knuckle made her jerk violently and over the tea went in a deluge on to her lap it is almost impossible to give an adequate description of the scene which followed flossie shrieked and screamed as if she was being murdered by a slow process tom vowed and protested that it was not his fault janey had pushed him over against flossie janey appealed to miss clark to remember that at the very moment she was handing her cup in the opposite direction and miss clark began to wring her hands and exclaim that she would ask to have tom sent back to school again for stand his cruel and unbrotherly behaviour she neither could nor would and in the midst of it all young johnnie seized the opportunity of helping minnie freely to jam and eating off her plate as if he were eating for a wager sarah sat looking as she was scared and may calmly surveyed the scene of uproar with disdainful face disgusting boy she said to the still protesting tom you get more vulgar every day don't take any notice sarah you will get used to it by and by eventually miss clark began to cry weakly it's too much for me how am i to bear four weeks more of this dreadful boy she sobbed do like me take no notice suggested may but i must take notice miss clark cried desperately my only comfort is that you do sit still may dear as for sarah she is a good girl a pattern to you with a withering glance at tom i feel sure sarah has never seen such a disgraceful scene before have you sarah no whispered sarah wishing fervently that miss clark had been pleased to leave her out of the discussion i thought so i knew sarah's manners were far too good for her to have been brought up among this sort of thing sarah is like a young princess by this time the tumult had subsided a little flossie had recovered from her fright and was consoling herself with buttered scones and honey looking darkly at tom the while just by way of reminding him that she had not by any means forgotten but tom was unconscious of her wrath a fresh idea had presented itself to his volatile mind and for the moment he had utterly forgotten not only flossie's wrath but also that other probable wrath to come princess sarah he shouted pointing at his cousin her royal highness princess sarah of nowhere princess sarah princess sarah cried johnnie taking up the taunt and waving his bread and butter like a flag three cheers for princess sarah chapter vi the amiable flossie miss clark did not tell that time it was not flossie but may who poured oil on the troubled waters it's no use making a fuss flossie she said wisely tom didn't mean to spill your tea he only wanted you to look at johnnie cribbing jam when he'd been told not to have any and it's the first night ma's at home and tom's her favourite and if you get him into trouble with pa she'll give what she's brought for you to somebody else so you just hold your tongue flossie and be a bit nice to miss clark and get her to say nothing about it it isn't as if you were hurt and besides you can't pretend you're hurt and then go down to dessert it's your turn to go down to night thus advised flossie went to miss clark and begged her to say nothing more about tom's unfortunate accident tom says he didn't mean to miss clark and ma's tired i dare say so you won't say anything about it will you i think i ought to say something about it flossie said miss clark severely though in her heart she was as glad to get off telling as even tom himself could be no miss clark i don't think you ought ma always gets a headache after a long journey and if pa's put out with tom and perhaps whips him ma 'll go to bed and cry all night and it wasn't as if tom meant to spill the tea over me it was quite an accident he was only jogging me to look at johnnie with much apparent reluctance miss clark at last consented to say no more about it and so occupied was she in making flossie feel how great a concession it was for her to do so that she forgot to ask what johnnie had happened to be doing to attract tom's attention so johnnie escaped scot free also and flossie and tom went off to prepare for going down to dessert which the young stubbses did in strict turn two at a time as soon as the table was cleared miss clark got out a little work box and began a delicate piece of embroidery sarah kept close to may whom at present she liked best of any of the young people and may sat down with a piece of fancy work also of which she did very little miss clark she began after she had done a few stitches isn't it jolly without tom very said miss clark with a great sigh of relief i don't think tom meant to be disagreeable said may turning miss clark's silks over with careless fingers but he's a boy and boys are very tiresome animals miss clark yes miss clark replied how many times have you been engaged and may leant her elbows upon the table and regarded the governess with interested eyes illustration how many times have you been engaged twice answered miss clark in a low voice and he was nice may inquired with vivid interest i thought them both nice at the time miss clark returned with a sigh and a smile but oh here is flossie ready to go down flossie my dear how quick you have been but i'm quite tidy miss clark flossie replied i wish tom would be quick i say sarah don't you wish you were going down too sarah's quite happy with miss clark and me put in may ain't you sarah yes quite sarah replied oh are you then i shall tell ma you said you didn't want to go down to see her then flossie retorted poor sarah's eyes filled with tears and she turned to may in the hope of getting protection from her take no notice said may superbly you'll get used to flossie after a bit she's a regular tell tale but she won't tell ma for ma won't listen she never does ma never will listen to tales not even from tom flossie began to laugh uproariously as if it was the greatest joke in the world to tease sarah who had yet to learn the peculiar workings of a stubbs character then miss clark interrupted with a remark that flossie's sash was not very well tied come here and let me tie it properly she said sharply and as flossie knew that any shortcoming would be sharply noticed and commented upon when she got downstairs she turned obediently round and allowed miss clark to arrange her garments to her satisfaction by that time tom was ready and the two went down together thank goodness remarked may piously now miss clark we shall have a little peace may was destined to have even a greater peace for her little chat with the governess than she had anticipated for a few minutes after flossie and tom had gone downstairs one of the maids came up and said that the mistress wished miss sarah to come down at once miss sarah she added was not to stay to dress more than she was then mayn't i just wash my hands sarah asked imploringly of may of course may answered good naturedly i'll go with you and make you straight may was very good natured though it is true that she was somewhat condescending and she went with sarah and showed her the room she was to share with janey and lily showed her where to wash her face and hands and herself combed her hair and made her look quite presentable there you look all right let miss clark see you she said and after sarah had been for inspection and approval she followed the maid and went down for the first time in her life to dessert 'ere she is mrs stubbs exclaimed as the little figure in black appeared in the doorway flossie ought to have known you would come down to dessert the first evening and after that you must take it in turn with the others yes auntie said sarah shyly taking the chair next to mrs stubbs for which she was thankful will you 'ave some grapes my dear mrs stubbs asked kindly sarah 'd like a nectarine said mr stubbs who made a god of his stomach and loved good things i doubt if she will his wife said they're bitter to a child's taste but 'ave which you like best sarah grapes please auntie said sarah promptly as a matter of fact sarah did not exactly know what nectarines were and not liking to confess her ignorance lest by doing so she should bring on herself sarcastic glances to be followed later by sarcastic remarks from flossie and tom she chose what she was sure of besides she did not want to run the risk of getting something upon her plate which she did not like and perhaps could not eat poor sarah still had a lively recollection of once helping herself to a piece of crystallised ginger when out to tea with her father she could not bear hot things and it seemed to her that that piece of ginger was the hottest morsel she had ever put in her mouth she sucked and sucked in the hope of reducing it and so getting rid of it and the harder she sucked the hotter it grew she tried crushing it between her sharp young teeth but that process only seemed to bring out the heat more and more and at last in sheer desperation sarah bethought herself of her pocket handkerchief and putting it up as if to wipe her lips ejected the pungent morsel and at the same time seized the opportunity of putting her poor little burning tongue out to cool have another piece of ginger dear the lady of the house had said seeing that her plate was empty chapter vii cousinly amenities the following morning mrs stubbs began preparing vigorously for the move to brighton which the family invariably made at this time of the year usually indeed they went a week or so earlier but mrs stubbs being at bridgehampton miss clark had done no more towards going than to see that the children's summer and seaside frocks and other clothes were all ready i think may and flossie must 'ave new white best frocks mrs stubbs remarked and sarah's things must be attended to i knew it was no use getting the child anything but a black frock in that old fashioned bridge'ampton i'd better go and see about them this morning and if they're not done by thursday they can come after us so sarah was dressed and with may went out in the neat broom with mrs stubbs and when she had arranged about the white frocks for her own children mrs stubbs began to lay in a stock of clothes for sarah poor sarah was bewildered and felt more ready to cry than anything else am i to wear all these she asked with what was almost horror as she surveyed the pile of stockings petticoats gloves sash ribbons pocket handkerchiefs and such things which quickly accumulated upon the counter mrs stubbs laughed good naturedly you won't say 'all' when you've been a month at brighton grubbing about on the shingle and going donkey rides and such like you must be tidy you know sarah and i told you in an undertone that you would be the same as my own i never do things by 'alves i'm not one of that sort thank 'eaven so to sarah's dismay she bought lavishly of many things frocks boots smart pinafores a pretty light summer jacket and two hats one a white sailor hat the other a black trimmed one for best do you take cold easy sarah mrs stubbs inquired pausing as they went out of the showroom before a huge pile of furs i think i do rather auntie and i had bronchitis last year that settles it her aunt exclaimed i don't believe in bronchitis and doctors' bills waste of money i call it you shall 'ave a fur cape now for two years past the dream of sarah's life had been to possess a fur cape a beautiful warm soft and lovely fur cape as she expressed it but until now poor child she had never dared to think it might ever be more than a dream that it might come to be a possibility or a reality the sudden realization was almost too much for her she gave a little gasp of delight and squeezed her aunt's arm hard oh auntie she whispered with a sob of delight what shall i ever do for you nay nay don't sarah mrs stubbs expostulated fearing the child was going to break down be a good girl and love your aunt that's all dear oh auntie i do i do sarah whispered back but if only father knew if only he knew why maybe he does said mrs stubbs kindly but come sarah my dear let us try your cape on we are wasting this gentleman's time the gentleman in question protested that it was of no consequence and begged mrs stubbs not to hurry herself but time was passing and mrs stubbs wanted to get home again so she urged sarah to be quick ten minutes later sarah was the proud possessor of a beautiful brown fur cape just a little large for her that she might have room to grow but so warm and cosy and so entirely to her liking that in spite of the sultry day the child would willingly have kept it on and gone home in it she did not however dare to propose it to her aunt and if she had done so mrs stubbs had far too much good sense to have allowed it so they went home gaily enough to lunch which was the young folk's dinner but not without a petition from may that they should stop at some nice shop and have ices it will spoil your dinner exclaimed mrs stubbs oh no mother said may who sometimes called her mother so and sarah ought to have an ice the very first time she has ever had a drive with you thus pressed mrs stubbs gave in and stopped the carriage at a confectioner's in regent street i'll have vanilla said may which are you going to have sarah whichever you like said sarah who had never tasted an ice in her life and was thus gaining another new experience try strawberry then said may and then we can help one another to a spoonful sarah did try strawberry and very good she found it and then when they had each eaten about half of their ices may proposed that they should change about sarah did not find the vanilla ice nearly so much to her liking as the strawberry one had been but not liking to say so as her cousin seemed to appreciate the change she finished her portion and said she had enjoyed herself very much you'll buy us some sweets ma said may sarah stared aghast it seemed to her a terrible extravagance to have had the ices particularly after having spent so much money as her aunt must have done for the clothes that morning and then to ask for sweets it seemed to her that may had no conscience and perhaps she was not very far wrong but may if she had no conscience had a wonderful knack of smoothing the path of daily life for herself mrs stubbs demurred decidedly to buying sweets but may gave a good reason for her demand oh ma dear do flossie 'll be as cross as two sticks at sarah being out with you instead of her and she's sure to ask if we had ices and you know we can't either of us tell a story about it at least i can't and i don't think sarah's at all the story telling sort are you sarah oh no indeed auntie i'll never tell you a story sarah protested and flossie will go on anyhow and taunt her i know she will she and tom were at it last night calling her princess sarah her royal highness princess sarah may went on didn't they sarah never mind said sarah trying to make light of it but what did they call her that for mrs stubbs asked listening in a way that was rare with her to a bit of tittle tattle from the schoolroom well ma dear you know what tom is he doesn't mean to be rough or rude but he's just a boy home for the holidays and after she's had the little ones all day and perhaps not me to talk to at all tom does get a bit too much for miss clark's nerves and last night tom was just a bit more boisterous than usual and poor miss clark didn't feel very well and it tried her you know and sarah was sitting by me and very quiet and miss clark happened to say she behaved like a princess and so she did and tom took it up princess sarah of nowhere her royal highness princess sarah of nowhere and such like i don't think tom meant to be unkind but it wasn't very nice for sarah being strange to us all and then flossie took it up and johnnie but miss clark told johnnie he should go to bed if he said it again so he soon shut up well it's no use taking any notice of it said mrs stubbs stroking sarah's hand kindly but you'd better put a stop to it whenever you hear 'em at it may i only 'ope tom won't let his pa 'ear him he'd be very angry for sarah's pore ma that's dead and gone was 'is favourite sister and pa'd never forgive a slight that was put on her little girl it isn't said mrs stubbs warming to her subject any fault of sarah's that she's left at nine years old without a father or a mother or a 'ome and it's no credit of any of yours that you've got a kind pa and ma and a lux'r'ous 'ome and a broom to ride about in so sarah my dear don't take no notice if they begin teasing you about anything remember your ma was your uncle's favourite sister and that you was as welcome as flowers in may to him when i brought you 'ome sarah looked up i don't mind anything auntie dear she said bravely though her lips were trembling and her eyes were moist i'll remember what you told me when we were coming give and take that's a brave little woman mrs stubbs exclaimed yes you'd better go and choose some sweets may perhaps it was a little 'ard on flossie she should have to stop at 'ome but i can't do with more than three in the broom it gets so 'ot and so stuffy perhaps some day your pa 'll buy us an open carriage and then i don't mind 'ow many there are may went out into the shop for they had been sitting alone in an inner room to choose the sweets and mrs stubbs continued her talk to sarah i don't 'old with telling as a rule i want my children to be better than tell pies she said but i am glad may told me of this if anything goes wrong with you you tell may about it sarah she's my right 'and i don't know what i should do without her chapter viii flossie's grievances it was just as well that may had had sufficient forethought to provide herself with a bundle of sweets in the shape of a peace offering for flossie for when they got in they found flossie in anything but an amiable mood and when flossie was not in an amiable mood she was anything but an agreeable young person she was sitting in the schoolroom staring sullenly out of the window and kicking impatiently against the window board in a way which upset miss clark's nerves until they could only be fairly described as shattered illustration she was sitting in the schoolroom staring sullenly out of the window for everything from first to last had gone wrong with poor flossie that morning in the first place she had been intensely disappointed at being left at home that sarah might go in the carriage with mrs stubbs flossie was particularly fond of going out with her mother in the carriage and was also very fond of shopping it was therefore quite in vain that miss clark tried to make her understand that sarah had not been taken for favouritism but simply in order that her aunt might buy her the clothes necessary for their trip to brighton flossie thought and said it was a horrid shame and vowed vengeance on the unfortunate and inoffensive though offending sarah in consequence nasty little mean white faced thing she exclaimed i suppose i shall always be shoved into the background now just that she may be coddled up and made to think herself better than anybody else princess sarah yes that's to be the new idea we're all to be put on one side for princess sarah flossie said miss clark very severely you ought to be thoroughly ashamed of yourself to be jealous of a poor little girl who has no father or mother who has come among strangers at nine years old and is fretting her poor little heart out for the sake of the father who loved her better than any one in all the world to be jealous of her being taken out once when you know it is only on business they have gone oh for shame flossie for shame oh well she needn't fret after her pa so much flossie retorted not taking miss clark's remarks to heart at all he didn't do so much for her he wasn't a gentleman like pa if he had been he'd have left her some money of her own miss clark's whole soul rose up in absolute loathing within her you vulgar vulgar child she thought aloud she said flossie my dear a lady would not say such a thing as that your mother would be very very angry if she heard it come it is useless to stay grumbling and sulking here you will have to accept the situation mrs stubbs is your mother and the mistress of this house and family she does not ask your leave whether she shall take you out with her or not she would be a very bad mother to you if she did instead of being as she is now a very good one let me hear not another word but put your things on to go out with me is tom going flossie inquired not daring to refuse though she would dearly have liked to do so no tom and johnnie are going out with charles and i have to just go out with you and three stupid girls with your three sisters certainly it's a beastly shame flossie burst out not another word said the governess sharply go and get ready at once and poor flossie had to go of course it happened that as she began wrong at the beginning nothing went very well with her during the rest of the morning miss clark went the one way she hated above all others but miss clark had to do a small but important commission for mrs stubbs and was obliged to take it then her sisters whom she heartily despised tom being her favourite annoyed her excessively janey would persist in lagging behind and minnie got a stone in her shoe and had to stop and take it off and shake out the pebble and then of course she had to stop also to have her shoe tied again and one or two people stopped to see what was amiss as people do stop when they see any impediment to the general traffic in the london streets making a perfect show of them all flossie said angrily and when they got home flossie not feeling quite so bad as when they set off mrs stubbs and may and that sarah actually had not come back it really was too bad and flossie sat down in the schoolroom window to watch for them with a face like a thunder cloud and a heart in which every outraged and injured feeling capable of being felt by weak human nature seemed to be seething and struggling at once if only tom had come back it would not have been so bad but charles the indoor servant had taken him and johnnie down to seven dials to buy some guinea pigs and seven dials being a long way from south kensington they could not possibly have got back by that time if they had tried ever so poor flossie so she sat and brooded brooded over what she was pleased to call her wrongs she would not so much have minded not going out with the broom if only she might have gone with charles and tom and johnnie to enjoy the somewhat doubtful delights of seven dials that however mrs stubbs had resolutely and peremptorily refused to allow so it happened that flossie sat in the window waiting for their return at last they came she saw them get out of the carriage and disappear within the house she saw the carriage drive round to the stables and then there was a long pause but they none of them seemed to think of coming upstairs even then poor flossie kicked at the window board more noisily than ever and in vain miss clark driven almost to desperation cried flossie will you be quiet and then the door opened quietly and may came in looking radiant flossie felt more ill used even than before oh you are here flossie i've been looking for you everywhere she remarked well you can't have looked very hard or you'd have found me flossie snapped then with a fierce glance at the parcel in her sister's hand she blurted out you've been having ices yes we have answered may but you needn't look like that flossie i've brought you back a great deal more than both our ices cost what have you brought half mollified caramels in chocolate i hate caramels flossie declared fearing with the old clinging to ungraciousness that sulky people have that her last reply had sounded too much like coming round a concession which flossie never made too soon or made too cheap nougat said may putting the caramels on one side you know i can't eat nougat it always makes my teeth ache flossie cried fondants may knew that her sister was passionately fond of that form of sweetmeats but flossie would have none of it i detest fondants she said with an impressiveness which would have been worthy of the occasion had she said that she detested well prussic acid or some pleasant and deadly preparation of that kind well it's a pity i worried ma for them at all may remarked with her usual placid air of disgust perhaps though you'll think differently after lunch come down and pray don't look like that pa's at home chapter ix an astute tell pie but not even the presence of mr stubbs who was held in great awe by his sons and daughters and was most emphatically what is known as master in his own house was sufficient to restore the redoubtable flossie to her usual careless happy go lucky giggling sauciness she went down and took her seat at table speaking only when spoken to but nevertheless contriving to eat an uncommonly good meal and tom entertained her with an account of his excursion to the dials and although flossie had spent the last three hours in a passion of jealousy envy and unhappiness too great for alleviation even when it came in the shape of caramels nougat and fondants yet she could not resist the temptation of hearing all that tom had to say and of arranging to go round to the stables with him to see his new pets when lunch should be over and presently she was graciously pleased to accept the caramels and nougat and the fondants but for some hours she did not forgive sarah princess sarah she unceasingly called her although solemnly warned by may that ma had already heard of the name and that if pa heard it the consequences would indeed be dreadful ah i suppose miss tell pie has been making up to ma this morning suggested flossie with a frightful sneer nothing of the kind returned may quickly but in her most condescending tone it was quite another person sarah has never said a word not even when she was asked but any way ma did hear it and she's very angry about it and ma says if pa gets to know about it he'll be fearfully angry for sarah's ma was his favourite sister and so you'd better just mind what you're doing miss flossie i do hate that miss clark flossie remarked miss clark exclaimed may why whatever for nasty mean spiteful tell pie flossie explained it wasn't miss clark i tell you ma got to hear about it who was it then ah that i can't tell you but any way ma got to hear of it and she told me to put a stop to it and so you'd better be careful that's all and never for a moment did flossie suspect that some blades are so sharp that they can cut two ways and that her informant was quite as clever at carrying tales to one side as to the other ah but blundering boisterous flossie was not nearly so astute as mrs stubbs's right hand may when they had come from bridgehampton mrs stubbs had only brought her own box and one which contained sarah's modest wardrobe with them her father's pictures and the precious amati with one or two bits of old carved oak a chair a table a little chest and a stool with one or two bits of armour and a few pieces of very good china were all packed and sent off by goods train they arrived that afternoon and mrs stubbs had them all unpacked and declared her intention of putting them into the little bedroom which after they came back from brighton should be sarah's own they're lovely things and belong to the child herself and it's right she should have them kept for 'er you know stubbs quite right quite right returned mr stubbs promptly and turning to see the effect of his wife's consideration on sarah whose character he was studying earnestly and diligently for the purpose of finding out whether any taint of what he called her fine gentleman father was about her but sarah was quite oblivious she had got hold of her beloved violin from which she had never been parted before in all her life and was dusting it jealously with her little pocket handkerchief mrs stubbs saw the look and understood it the child didn't 'ear she explained and having attracted sarah's attention told her what her plans were for her future comfort you'll like that won't you she ended sarah's reply was as astounding as it was prompt oh no dear auntie not at all she said earnestly and why not mrs stubbs inquired while her husband stared as if he thought the world might be coming to an end why auntie didn't you say your own self how beautiful they were and how well they would set off a hall i'd much rather you'd put them downstairs than in a bedroom for you would see them every time you went in and out and that would please me there's unselfishness for you mrs stubbs cried no auntie i don't think it is said sarah in her sweet humble voice it's nothing so grand as unselfishness it's just because i love you kiss me my woman cried mrs stubbs with rapture and come and kiss me said mr stubbs you're a good girl sarah your mother's own daughter she was right my lass to stick to the husband she loved and married though i never thought so till this moment oh uncle sarah gasped for to hear him speak so of the mother she had never seen but whom she had been taught to love from her babyhood was joy almost greater than her child's heart could bear there there if aught goes wrong come to me mr stubbs murmured and if you always speak to your aunt as you've done to day i shall think your pore father must have been a fine fellow or you'd never be what you are oh sarah was so happy after all what could what did it matter if flossie and tom did call her princess sarah of nowhere why just nothing at all nothing at all uncle she said after a moment or two may i play you something on my violin yes he answered that remarked mrs stubbs as sarah opened the piano and began to tune up in a way which made her uncle open his eyes with astonishment is the fiddle sarah says is worth five hundred pounds like enough some of 'em are he answered and then sarah played a german lied and a hungarian dance then home sweet home well said mrs stubbs looking at him when she ceased what do you think of it i think she's a genius answered mr stubbs chapter x a pleasant railway journey on the thursday following the whole stubbs family went to brighton sarah enjoyed the journey intensely journeys being still almost a novelty with her she would have enjoyed it more if may had not grumbled at going second class and if flossie and tom had not vied with one another in trying how far they could lean out of either window of the carriage poor miss clark was almost beside herself with fright tom put your head in immediately she cried in desperation and expecting every moment to see the door fly open and tom shoot out headlong to be picked up a mangled corpse or in actual fragments tom do you hear me tom i insist upon it but if miss clark had shouted till she had killed herself with shouting tom leaning half his body out of the window with the wind whistling in his ears and the roar and rattle of the engine and wheels all helping to deaden any such small sounds as that of a human voice and that the voice of a weak and rather helpless woman could not have heard her and miss clark had no choice but with may's help to tug tom in by the nether part of his garments this done she pulled up the window with a jerk illustration tom leaning half his body out of the window with the wind whistling in his ears i forbid you to open that window again she said with such severity that even tom was cowed and sat meekly down with a somewhat sulky air miss clark had thus time to turn her attention to the other children when to her horror she found that flossie was not only emulating but far surpassing her brother not contenting herself with leaning well out of the window but was actually standing on the seat that she might push herself out the farther to pull her in and put her down on her seat with a bump was the work of but a moment if i have to speak to you again flossie she said in accents of solemn warning i shall get out at the next station and take you to your father's carriage i fancy you will sit quiet there flossie thought so too and sat quietly enough till the next station was passed but after that may complained so bitterly of the closed windows and the horrid stuffiness of the carriage that miss clark's sternness relented a little and she allowed the window beside which may was sitting to be let down and the very fact of the window being open seemed to set all tom's nerves and muscles and longings tingling he moved about uneasily in his seat kept dodging round to look sideways through the glass at the side and finally jumped up in a hurry and pushed his head and shoulders through the window in vain did miss clark tug and pull at him and his garments alike tom had his elbows out of the window this time and as he chose not to give way not all the combined strength of miss clark and may with such help as sarah and minnie could give had the smallest effect upon him at last miss clark who as i have said was not very strong sat down and began to sniff in a way which sounded very hysterical for she really was horribly afraid some dreadful accident would happen long before they got to their destination however as the suspicious little sob was heard and understood by may that young lady took the law into her own hands and administered a sharp corrective immediately tom she shouted come in tom did not hear more than that he was being shouted at and as a natural consequence did not move whereupon may quietly reached up to the rack and fished out tom's own his very own riding whip and with that she began to belabour him soundly it had effect after half a dozen cuts tom began to struggle in but may was a stout and heavily set young lady and as resolute in will as ever was her father when she was once fairly roused so she calmly held him by his neck and went on administering her corrective until she was utterly tired then she let him go and when he blind with rage and fury and vowing vengeance upon her made for her and would have fought her she sprang up at the knob by which you can signal to the driver and stop a train and threatened to pull it if he touched her and oh tom was angry angry he was furious but he was mastered for it happened that on the very day that he and johnnie had gone with charles to seven dials he had asked charles all about the alarm bell by means of which trains may be stopped if necessary and charles had explained the matter in a clear and lucid way peculiar to himself a talent which made him especially valuable in a home where there were boys why master tom he exclaimed you see that's a indicator if you wants to storp the trayin you just pulls that knob and it rings a bell on the engine somewhere and the driver storps the trayin at once let's stop it suggested tom in high glee at the prospect of a walk through a dark and dangerous tunnel it must be admitted that charles's heart fairly stood still at the thought of what his explanation had suggested master tom said he with a face of horror which was so expressive that tom was greatly impressed by it don't you go for to do nothing of the kind it's almost a 'anging matter is storping of trayins useless like if you was took ill or 'ad a fit or somebody was a murdering of you why it would be all right but to storp a trayin when there's naught wrong is well i believe as a matter of fact it's seven years seven years seven years what tom asked thinking the whole thing a grand joke prison returned charles laconically that is if it was me if it was you master tom it would mean reformatory school with plenty of stick and no meat nor no 'olidays no i wouldn't go for to storp no trayins if i was you master tom but we needn't say it was us that rang pleaded tom whose fingers were just itching to ring that bell charles laughed lor master tom they're up to that game he answered bless you they 'ave a lot of numbers and they'd know in a minute which carriage it was that rang no master tom don't you go for to ring no bells and storp no trayins i lived servant with a young fellow once as had had five years of a reformatory school and the tales he used to tell of what went on there was enough to make your blood curdle and your very 'air stand on end mine did many a time which your blood or your hair charles tom inquired with keen interest both returned charles in a tone which carried conviction with it thus tom had no further resource when may vowed to ring the bell and stop the train if he touched her but to sit down and bear his aches and his defeat in silence but oh he was angry to be beaten and beaten again by a girl it was too humiliating too lowering to bear yet poor tom had to bear it that was the worst of it so they eventually got to brighton in safety chapter xi aunt george it would be hard for me to tell of all the joys and pleasures which brighton gave to the stubbs family and to sarah in particular to the younger of the stubbs children all was joy and delight though they had been there several times before to miss clark it was rest and peace because she was not much troubled with tom and flossie too was allowed to go about with him and johnnie a great deal more freely than she ever was at home may always miss clark's favourite spent much of her time beside her though she went shopping sometimes with her mother and also driving but on the whole mrs stubbs did not give up very much of her time just then to her children for mr stubbs was taking his holiday and mr stubbs was troubled with a threatened fit of the gout and do with the sound of the children's racket and bustle he simply could not he was often threatened with the gout though the threatenings seldom came to anything more than temper so whilst they were at brighton mrs stubbs who was as good a wife as she was a mother devoted herself to him and left the children to take care of themselves a good deal their life was naturally quite a different one to what it was in town they had a furnished house in which they slept and took their meals but which at other times they did not much affect they had early dinner there and a high tea at seven o'clock at which they all ate like ravenous wolves sarah amongst the number this was a very happy free and easy meal for though mr and mrs stubbs joined in the early dinner and called it lunch they did not go in for the high tea but invariably went to the grand hotel and had dinner there oh what happy happy days they were there was the early run out on the parade or the sea wall before breakfast then the delicious seaside breakfast with fresh whitings every morning there was the daily dip in the sea and the daily donkey ride or goat chaise drive there was the ever new and delightful shingle on which they played and skipped and dug and delved to their hearts' content there were the niggers and the blind man who sang to his own accompaniment on a sort of hand organ and wore a smart blue necktie and a flower in his button hole there was a sweet little child too wearing a big sun bonnet whom they used to watch for every morning who came with toddling three year old gravity with a penny for the niggers to the infinite amusement of the bystanders here black man thank you my little snowdrop was the invariable reply of the nigger minstrel and then the little wee snowdrop would make a stately bow the nigger would take off his hat with a bow to match it and the little scene was over till the morrow then there was the aquarium and the delightful shop which they called the creameries a little way past mutton's and once or twice they all except mr stubbs went for a trip in the steamer when mrs stubbs took chief charge and miss clark was so horribly ill that she thought she would have died and once mr and mrs stubbs went to newhaven and thence to dieppe taking tom with them not at all because tom wanted to go but because may represented to her mother that neither she nor miss clark were feeling very well and that without pa's restraining influence she was sure tom would not only worry them all to death but would also incite flossie into all manner of dreadful pranks the consequences of which might be dire and terrible so tom went with them over the water on to french soil and may remarked triumphantly to the governess i've got rid of him miss clark so now we shall have a little peace and enjoy ourselves and so they did to be without tom was like the enjoyment of the calm which comes after a storm and they one and all with the exception of flossie enjoyed it to the full flossie was very much aggrieved at being thus deprived of her playfellow it is too bad that tom should have to go with pa and ma she complained he won't have a soul to speak to or a boy to play with or anything except some stupid little french boy perhaps who can't speak a word of anything but gibberish i call it a beastly shame i suppose it's old clark's doing and that she was just afraid tom would get an extra good time while they were away nasty old cat miss clark had no more to do with it than you had may replied ma chose to take him and that's enough as tom was actually gone there was not the smallest use in grumbling so flossie thus left idle turned her attention upon sarah it is needless to say that very very soon flossie also began to tease her and in consequence sarah's life became more or less of a burden to her in this way sarah who was a singularly uncomplaining child crept nearer and nearer to miss clark and may as there she was safe from flossie's taunts and jeers and it was in this way that some notice was taken of her by one of the great lights of the stubbs family mrs george stubbs the corn factor's wife who lived in great style at brighton it happened that one morning sarah and may were waiting for miss clark to come out with the younger children when mrs george came slowly along in a bath chair as she passed by them she called to the man to stop dear me is that you may she remarked how you've grown your papa and mamma came to see us the other day but i was not at home i was out they have gone over to dieppe said may and tom with them this is our cousin sarah aunt george oh is it yes your mamma told me when she wrote last that she was coming to live with you how do you do sarah all this was uttered in a languid tone as if on the whole life was too much trouble to be lived at all sarah had met with nothing of this kind in all her life before and looked only impressed in truth she looked a good deal more impressed than she was or rather she looked differently impressed to what she was and mrs george stubbs was pleased to be a little flattered thereby you must come and have tea with me she observed graciously to may i have not been able to get out except the day your mamma called my unfortunate neuralgia has been so very trying you may bring sarah would you like to come to night very much indeed thank you aunt george responded may very much indeed echoed sarah your cousins are of course all at school in paris and your uncle is in london so we will have high tea at seven o'clock bring your music with you sarah plays the violin said may who hated playing in company herself she plays it beautifully she's going to have lessons then bring your violin and let me hear you said mrs george to sarah it is a most stylish instrument i will said sarah oh is flossie to come aunt george asked may as they shook hands flossie no i can not do with flossie replied mrs george in a tone which was enough to remind may that the very last time they had visited their aunt flossie had been clever enough to break a beautiful venetian glass which was as mrs george had remarked pathetically over the fragments simply of priceless value chapter xii sarah makes an impression what a shame said flossie when she heard of the invitation just like the nasty old thing to remember an accident that i couldn't help not that i care i shall enjoy myself far better at home and flossie caught hold of minnie's arm and stalked along the parade as if she cared so little that she did not want to hear any more about that great lady her aunt george what did you think of her may asked of sarah is she very ill sarah asked thinking of the bath chair and her aunt's languid wrists and tones ill no ma says she's a hy po chon driac returned may pronouncing the long word in syllables that's fancying yourself ill when you ain't see but all the same aunt george is very stylish she's not half so nice as auntie sarah flashed out no she isn't but she's a great deal stylisher than ma is may returned didn't you hear the way she told the man to go on 'go on chawles' and may leant back on the seat slightly waved a languid hand flickered her drooping eyelids and gave a half languid half supercilious smile it was a fine imitation of mrs george's stylish airs and sarah was lost in admiration of it i wonder she remarked presently after thinking the question over i wonder if she eats her dinner like that because if she does it must generally get cold before she has half finished it oh aunt's much too stylish to eat much may explained she nibbles at this and picks at that you'll see to night and sarah did see saw that in spite of her airs and her nibbling and her picking mrs george contrived to put a good meal out of sight quite as much as ever her sister in law could manage to do that evening was also a new experience to sarah it was so much more stately than anything she had seen before mr and mrs george stubbs lived in a very large house in a large square in the best part of brighton a resplendent footman received them when they got out of the cab yes they had a cab though it was only a short way from their own house and a solemn butler ushered them into mrs george's presence she wore a tea gown of soft yellow silk with a very voluminous trailing skirt and showers of white lace and broad yellow ribbons about it it was a garment that suited the languid air the quivering eye lids the weak wrists and the soft drawling voice to perfection the resplendent footman had relieved sarah of her violin case and carried it upstairs for her mrs george motioned to it as he announced her visitors with great care chawles and chawles put it down on a chair beside the inlaid grand piano as if it were a baby and might squeal illustration with great care chawles how are you dears mrs george said giving each a limp and languid hand how oppressive the evening is then to chawles let tea be served very soon tea was announced and they went downstairs it was all new to sarah the large spacious dining room with its rich costly art furniture the pretty round table with flowers and pretty coloured glasses with quaint little figures holding trays of sweets or preserves or wheeling barrows of tiny ferns or miniature palms and the board was well spread too there was salmon salad and a boiled chicken covered with white frothy sauce there was an aspic jelly with eggs and green peas and certain dark things which may told her afterwards were truffles and there were several kinds of sweet dishes and more than one kind of wine to sarah it was a resplendent feast as resplendent as the gorgeous footman who stood midway between her chair and may's only a little in the rear the solemn butler keeping guard over his mistress whom he served first as if she had been a royal queen now you shall play to me mrs george said to sarah when they had got back to the drawing room again sarah rose obediently what shall i play she asked what can you play mrs george asked in reply oh a great many things sarah said modestly let sarah play what she fancies put in may who had established herself in a low lounging chair and was fanning herself with a fan she had found on a table at hand with the closest imitation of mrs george she could manage she always plays the best then very well mrs george said graciously so sarah began she felt that in all her life before she had never played as she played then the influence of the luxurious meal of which they had just partaken was upon her the exquisite coloured glass the sweet scented flowers the smell of the fragrant coffee the stately servants moving softly about with quiet footsteps and smooth gestures each and all had made her feel calm and peaceful and now the soft toned drawing room with its plush and lace hangings its delicate china its indian embroideries and those two quiet figures lying back in the half light making no movement except the slow waving to and fro of their fans completed the influence it was all food to sarah's artistic soul and she made the amati speak for her all that was passing through her mind mrs george was spell bound she actually forgot to fan herself in the desire not to miss a single note nay she did more she forgot to be languid and sat bolt upright in her chair her head moving to and fro in time with sarah's music why child you are a genius she exclaimed as sarah came to a close and turned her speaking eyes upon her for comment that's just what papa said put in may adjusting her language to her company if you go on if you work mrs george continued your violin will be your fortune you will be a great woman some day sarah's great eyes blazed at the thought of it her heart began to beat hard and fast do you really think so aunt george she asked i really do i am sure of it but child your violin seems to me a very good one where did you get it father gave it to me it was his grandfather's said sarah holding it out for inspection it is an amati it is worth five hundred pounds said may who was eminently practical and measured most things by a pounds shillings and pence standard of course if it is an amati murmured mrs george becoming languid again but go on my child i should like a little more so sarah played and played until the room grew darker and darker and gradually the shadows deepened until it was only by the lamps from the square that she could distinguish the outlines of the figure in the yellow sweeping robes it was like a shock when the door was gently opened and the footman came in bearing a huge lamp with a crimson shade then the coffee followed and before very long one of the servants came back and said that the cab for the young ladies had come you have given me great pleasure said mrs george to sarah and when mrs stubbs comes back i must make an afternoon party and sarah shall play at it i have not been so pleased for a long time and then she kissed them both and with good night they left her won't ma be pleased remarked may with great satisfaction as they drove along the parade i shan't mind a bit her being vexed that flossie wasn't asked really sarah i never saw aunt george so excited before she's generally so die away and all that but sarah was hardly listening and not heeding at all with her precious amati on her knee she was looking away over the moonlit sea thinking of what her aunt had said to her if you go on if you work your violin will be your fortune you will be a great woman i will go on i will work she said to herself if i can be a great woman i will chapter xiii the turning point of her life mrs george's opinion of sarah's violin playing proved to be the turning point of her life as a violin player a few days later when mr and mrs stubbs had returned from dieppe she gave a large afternoon reception to which sarah took her violin and played her best and the visitors elegant ladies and gentlemen crowded round the child and would have turned her head with praises had it not been such a sensible little head that they had no sort of effect upon it they talked such a lot she said to her aunt afterwards that i felt frightened at first but i found that they didn't really know much about it for one of my strings got flat and they praised that more than anything but her aunt mrs stubbs was proud enough and elated enough for a dozen violin players and she stood beside sarah explaining who she was and how she was going to have lessons from the best master they could get until mrs george felt sick to think that her grand friends should know that dreadful woman was a relation of hers sarah my dear lady golladay wishes you to play again something pathetic so sarah tuned up again and mrs stubbs was silent she can't talk when the child is playing murmured mrs george to her husband do take her down to have some tea or something and keep her as long as you can anything to keep her out of sight all right he answered and immediately that sarah's melody came to an end followed by a burst of applause he offered his arm to his sister in law and begged her to go with him and have some refreshments this reception completely opened mrs stubbs's eyes and she went back to london strangely impressed with a belief that sarah was not only a genius but a new fashion she gave a party too not an afternoon party for she wanted her husband to be there and he was never at home before six o'clock no it was not an afternoon but an evening party at which the elder children were all present and at which sarah played and then sarah began with her violin lessons and worked hard very hard mrs george wrote from brighton that she would provide all the new music she required and that her uncle george enclosed a sovereign for herself so time went on sarah had two lessons a week and improved daily in her playing tom went back to school and johnnie with him and flossie's turbulent spirit became a good deal subdued though she never forgot to keep sarah reminded that she was princess sarah of nowhere the weeks rolled into months and months into years miss clark went away and got married to may's mingled sorrow and delight and to flossie's unfeigned and unutterable disgust for mrs stubbs chose a lady to fill her place who was what she called a strict disciplinarian and flossie had considerably less freedom and fun than she had aforetime for miss best had not only a strong mind and a strong will but also a remarkably strong body and seemed able to be on the alert at all times and seasons she had too not the smallest objection to telling tales in school or out of it the slightest infringement of her rules was visited with heavy punishment in the form of extra lessons and the least attempt to shirk them was reported to headquarters immediately in fact miss best was a power a power to be felt and feared and flossie did both accordingly of all her pupils sarah was miss best's favourite in her she recognised the only worker may was good tempered and possessed the blessing of a placid and dignified disposition but may's capacity for learning was not great and miss best soon found that it was no use trying to drive her a shade faster along the royal road to knowledge she went at a willing jog trot she could not gallop because she had not the power with flossie it was different flossie had brilliant capacities which she would not use miss best was determined that she should use them and exert them flossie was equally determined that she would not and so for the first few months life in the stubbs's schoolroom was a hand to hand fight between flossie and miss best and miss best came off winner yet though she got the better of flossie and made her work she never gave her the same place in her heart that she gave to sarah who worked with all her heart and soul because she was impressed with the idea that if she only worked hard enough she might be a great woman one day and as she was a favourite with miss best so was she a favourite with signor capri the master who taught her the violin he was quick to recognise the true artist soul that dwelt within her and gave her all the help that lay in his power in fact sarah was his favourite pupil his pet and he put many chances of advancement toward her great ambition in her way illustration sarah was his favourite pupil for instance many times he took her out with him to play at concerts and private houses so that she might grow accustomed to playing before an audience of strangers and also that she might become known and known very soon sarah was and welcomed to many a noble house for the sake of the exquisite sounds she was able to draw from the strings of the amati besides that sarah was a very pretty child and as she grew older was an equally pretty girl she never had that gawky legginess which distinguishes so many girls in their teens there was nothing awkward about her nothing rough or boisterous all her movements were soft and gentle her voice was sweet and her laugh very musical but not loud and with her tall slim figure and the great grey earnest eyes looking out from under the shining masses of sunny hair she was indeed an uncommon looking girl and a great contrast to the young stubbses who were all short and inclined to be stout and had twine coloured hair and pale pasty complexions though in spite of that they all had like their mother a certain bonniness which made them pleasant looking enough sarah had been nearly four years living at jesamond road where mrs stubbs's home was when may came out may was then nearly eighteen and just what she had been when sarah first saw her placid good tempered and obliging not very quick in mind nor yet in body willing to take advantage of every pleasure that came in her road but not willing to give herself the smallest trouble that other people might have pleasure too she was very different to flossie who was a regular little spitfire and had neither consideration for nor fear of anything on earth except miss best whom she detested but whom she dared not openly defy if she had dared flossie would have done it as for tom he was beyond the control of anybody in that house excepting his father he was wilder rougher more unmerciful and more impudent than ever and whenever tom's holidays drew near sarah used to quake for fear lest her precious amati should not survive the visit and invariably she carried it to the cupboard in miss best's room for safety happily into that room master tom did not presume to put even so much as the tip of his nose chapter xiv a brilliant marriage when may left the schoolroom behind her sarah found a great difference in her life in her placid good natured way may had always been fond of her and had in a great measure stood between her and flossie but flossie when she became the senior of the schoolroom took every opportunity she had of making the younger ones particularly sarah aware of that fact sarah was then nearly fourteen and rather taller than flossie who was turned sixteen so had she chosen to do so she could easily have got the best of her but sarah never forgot never indeed was allowed to forget that she was not a daughter of the house and was not therefore free to fight and wrangle as much and as disagreeably as the others allowed themselves to do very very often in those days did she have the old taunt of princess sarah thrown at her oh princess sarah is quite too high and mighty to quarrel over it princess sarah is going to do the mute martyr style of thing so flossie would though she did not know it encourage her cousin to work harder than ever just by way of showing that she had something more in her than to spend her life in bickering and snarling stay i do sarah an injustice there she was moved by another and a better motive both in trying to keep peace and in trying to get on with her work for she had always the grateful feeling it will please auntie so and always a feeling that it was a slight return to her uncle's wife if she bore flossie's attentions without complaining they did not see much of may all day she was in the drawing room with her mother if she was not out on some errand of pleasure and at night when the schoolroom tea was over she used to come down for a minute and show herself a vision of comeliness for may was considered a great beauty in the stubbs' set in white or roseate airy garments with hair crimpled and fluffy feathers and flowers fans and bangles pearls and diamonds and all the other necessaries for a young lady of fashion in her first season some time previously mr stubbs had made his wife a present of an elegant landau and a pair of high stepping horses but flossie to her disgust found that her drives were no more frequent than they had been in the days of the one horse broom then her mother had not unreasonably declared herself unable to bear the stuffiness of a carriage full of people now may objected to any one going with them on the score of her dress being crushed and the unpleasantness of looking like a family ark they had become very gay scarcely a night passed but they went out to some gay entertainment or other and many parties were given at home when the elder of the younger members of the family had the pleasure of participating in them flossie was terribly indignant at being kept at home that may might have more room in the luxurious and roomy carriage just you wait till i come out miss may she said one day and then see if your airs and graces will keep me in the background the fact is you're afraid to show off against me you know as well as i do that with all your fine dress and your finer airs you are not half so much noticed as i am and as for that sarah leave sarah out of it laughed may she doesn't want to go i'd soon stop it if she did growled flossie it was really very hard and flossie thought and said so but may was inflexible and long before flossie was ready to come out may became engaged to be married it was a very brilliant marriage indeed and the entire family were wonderfully elated about it true the bridegroom was a good deal older than may and was pompous to a degree but then he was enormously rich and had a great cheap clothes manufactory down the east end somewhere and could give may bigger diamonds than anybody they knew he had too a house in palace gardens and a retinue of silk stockinged servants in comparison with whom mrs george's footman at brighton was a mere country clod so in time may was married married with such pomp and ceremony that feelings seemed left out altogether and if tender hearted mrs stubbs shed a few tears at parting with the first of all her brood they were smothered among the billows of lace which bedecked her and nobody but herself was any the wiser after this it became an established custom that flossie should take may's place in the carriage and it was not long before she managed to persuade her mother that it was time for her to throw off miss best's yoke altogether and go out as a young lady of fashion before very long mrs stubbs began dearly to repent herself of her weakness for flossie with her emancipation seemed to have left her old self in the schoolroom and to have taken up a new character altogether she became very refined very fashionable very elegant in all her ideas and desires my mother really is a great trial to me she said one day to sarah she's very good and all that you know but she's so well there's no sort of style about poor mother and it is trying to have to take men up and introduce them to her and they look at her don't you know as if she were something new something strange as if they hadn't seen anything like her before it's annoying to say the least of it well if i were you retorted sarah hotly i should say to such people and pretty sharply 'if my mother is not good enough for you why neither am i' but then you see i am remarked flossie with ineffable conceit you don't understand what i mean said sarah with a patient sigh that's because you're so bad at expressing yourself my dear said flossie with a fine air of condescension it all comes out of shutting yourself up so much with that squeaking old violin of yours i can't think why you didn't go in for the guitar it's such a pretty instrument to play and it backs up a voice so well but i haven't got a voice cried sarah laughing oh that doesn't matter lady lomys hasn't a voice either but she sings everywhere everywhere where did you hear her sarah asked oh well i haven't heard her myself flossie admitted but then that's what everybody says about lady lomys oh i see murmured sarah not at all impressed by the mention of her ladyship's accomplishments it happened not very long after this that the stubbses gave a ball not just a dance but a regular ball with every available room in the house cleared and specially decorated with the balconies covered in with awnings and with every window and chimney shelf every fireplace and corner filled with banks of flowers or stacks of exquisite palms or ferns the entire house looked like fairyland and mrs stubbs went to and fro like a substantial fairy godmother who was not quite sure how her charms were going to work may came with her elderly husband from her great mansion in palace gardens wearing a white velvet gown and such a blaze of diamonds that the mind refused to estimate their real value and ran instinctively to paste and mrs george who was in town for the season came with her daughters and languidly patronised everything but those diamonds which she cheapened at once as being a little off colour and a trifle overdone mrs george herself had put on every single stone she was possessed of even to making use of her husband's breast pin to fasten a stray end of lace on the bosom of her gown but that of course had nothing really to do with her remarks on her niece's taste oh no flossie had a new dress for the occasion of course and she had coaxed a beautiful diamond arrow out of her father on some pretext or other sarah thought she had never seen her look so charming before and she told her so it was with a smile and a conscious toss of her head that flossie received the information and looked at herself once more in the glass of her wardrobe as she stood there with sarah in a simple white muslin gown watching her a maid entered with a large white cardboard box for miss flossie she said the box contained a beautiful bouquet of rare and fragrant hothouse flowers and attached to the stem was a small parcel the parcel proved to contain a superb diamond bangle and flossie went proudly downstairs wearing it upon her arm and that night it crept out among the young ones in the stubbs' schoolroom that flossie was going to be married chapter xv a family catastrophe i am bound to say that flossie's brothers and sisters and sarah received the news of her approaching departure from her father's roof with unmixed feelings not a drop of sorrow was there to mar the cup of joy which the occasion presented to every one not a regret at the blank her going would cause leavened the general satisfaction at her happiness and flossie herself was the least sorrowful the least regretful and the most satisfied of all like may she was marrying well that is to say she was marrying money but unlike may's husband who was old her future lord and master was young only five years older than herself it is true he was not much to look at but then as mrs stubbs remarked to her husband that was flossie's business it was equally true that he was reputed to be a young scamp with an atrocious temper but then as tom said that was flossie's look out and decidedly flossie was not without little failings of that kind though why if one bad tempered person decides upon marrying another bad tempered person it is generally considered by the world to be all right because the one is as bad to get on with as the other it would be hard to say perhaps it is on the principle of two negatives making an affirmative or in the belief that two wrongs will make eventually a right i cannot say but odd as it is that is the very general opinion the engagement was an unusually short one indeed the bride had barely time to get her things ready by the day and a great part of her trousseau was not able to be ready before her return from her honeymoon but still they never seemed to think of putting off the wedding for a single day although it was fixed to take place just six weeks from the day of the ball when the engagement had begun it seemed to sarah well used as she had become to seeing liberal expenditure that at this time the entire family seemed to be spending money like water may's wedding had been a very grand one but flossie's outshone it in every way in the number of the bridesmaids in the number of the guests in the number of the carriages and the servants and the flowers in the splendour of the presents and the dresses of the trousseau nay in the very length of the bride's train the presents were gorgeous mr stubbs gave his daughter a gold mounted dressing case and a cheque for a thousand pounds mrs stubbs gave a diamond star and may a necklace of such magnificence that even flossie was astounded when she saw it so flossie became mrs jones and passed away from her old home and when it was all over and the tokens of the great feast and merry making had been cleared away the household for a few days settled down into comparative quietude only for a few days however with the exception of sarah who was too deeply engrossed in her work to care much for passing pleasures the entire family seemed to have caught a fever of restlessness and love of excitement after ten days the bride and bridegroom returned and there were great parties to welcome them every day there seemed some reason why they should launch out a little further and yet a little further and instead of the family being less expensive now that two daughters were married the general expenditure was far more lavish than it had ever been before they had a second man servant and another maid and then they found that it was impossible to get on any longer without a second broom horse for night work they did indeed begin to talk about leaving jesamond road and going into a larger house the boys tom was just seventeen and johnnie only fifteen wanted a billiard room and minnie wanted a boudoir and mr stubbs wanted a larger study and mrs stubbs wanted a double hall that change however was never made although mrs stubbs and minnie had seen and set their hearts upon a mansion in earl's court at a modest rental of five hundred a year which they thought quite a reasonable rent for one awful night the senior clerk came tearing up to the door in a cab with the horse all in a lather and his own face like chalk and asked for the master illustration and asked for the master the master and mistress were just going out to a great dinner party at the house of mrs giath their eldest daughter in palace gardens but mr stubbs came down and saw him in the study they were shut up there together for some time until mrs stubbs grew impatient and knocked several times at the door with a reminder that they would be very late and that may would not like to be kept waiting and at last mr stubbs opened the door and came out get my coat james he said to the servant then as he buttoned it added mr senior will have a glass of wine and a biscuit before he goes good night senior see you in the morning lor pa exclaimed mrs stubbs as they rolled away from the door i thought something was the matter no my dear only some important business senior thought i ought to know about he answered and mr stubbs that evening was the very light and life of his daughter's party but in the morning the crash came not that he was there to see it though for just as they reached home again and he passed into his own house mr stubbs reeled and fell to the ground in all the hideousness of a severe paralytic seizure nor did he ever even partially recover his senses before the day was done he had gone out of the sea of trouble which overwhelmed him to answer for his doings before a high and just tribunal which let us hope would give him a more merciful judgment than he would have found in this world mrs stubbs was broken hearted and inconsolable if he had only been spared for a bit she sobbed to her married daughters who came to her in her trouble but to be taken sudden like that oh it is 'ard it is 'ard poor pa murmured may he was so active he couldn't have borne to be ill and helpless as he would have been if he'd lived i wouldn't fret so if i were you ma dear i really wouldn't there's nothing dishonourable mrs stubbs sobbed all's gone but your poor pa's good name's 'ere still i do thank 'eaven for that yes i do h'm if pa'd been half sharp flossie remarked he'd have taken care there was something left he's left his good name and his good deeds behind him that's better than mere money said sarah softly holding her aunt's hand very tightly in both of hers oh well as to that sarah said flossie of course it isn't likely you'll blame pa for being so lavish as he was dressed just the same as us and expensive violin lessons twice a week and all that mrs stubbs and may both cried out upon flossie for her words cruel cruel mrs stubbs exclaimed when you've had every lux'ry you could wish to blame your poor pa for his charity before he's laid in his grave i'm ashamed of you flossie i am and then she hid her face on sarah's slim young shoulder and broke into bitter sobs and tears chapter xvi a change of circumstances when her husband's affairs were all investigated and arranged it was found to mrs stubbs's great joy that matters were scarcely quite so bad as had at first been anticipated true everything or what she called everything was gone but no stain was there to sully a name which had always been held among city men as a blameless and honourable one the actual cause of the crash had been the failure of a large bank which had ruined two important houses with which the firm of stubbs co had very large dealings these houses were unable to pay their debts to stubbs co and stubbs co having been living in great extravagance up to the last penny which could be squeezed out of the business were not able to stand the strain of the unexpected losses but when everything was arranged it was found that with careful nursing and management the business could be carried on for the benefit of the children until such time as the boys should be of an age to take the management of it themselves meanwhile the trustees took tom away from the expensive public school at which he was at the time of his father's death and instead of sending him to oxford as his father intended to have done a few months later put him into the clerks' department of a large mercantile house where they made him work as tom himself said indignantly as if he were a mere under clerk at a few shillings a week it happened that the trustees were both bachelors who understood the management of a large and expensive household just about as well as they sympathised with the desire for social prominence therefore they believed themselves to be doing a really generous and almost unheard of action when they agreed to allow mrs stubbs three hundred a year out of the proceeds of the business and the lad will have his pound a week they said to one another as a further proof of their consideration for their old friend's widow but to mrs stubbs it seemed as if the future was all so black that she could not even see where she was to get food for herself and her children poor soul she had forgotten what the old friends of her dead husband remembered only too well the days when she had run up and down stairs after her mother's lodgers of whom poor john stubbs was one on the whole it is pretty certain that we rise much more easily than we fall we find climbing up much easier than we find slipping down and mrs stubbs had got so used to spending twice three thousand a year that to her a descent to three hundred seemed but very little better than the workhouse a nice little 'ouse at fulham she exclaimed when flossie tried to paint such a home in glowing colours you know i never could a bear little 'ouses besides 'ow am i to get them all into a nice little 'ouse there's sarah and me oh sarah first of course snapped flossie for shame flossie you seem as if you don't know how to be mean enough to sarah i said 'er name first because she's my right 'and just now and i lean on her for everything there's sarah and me and tom and johnnie and there's minnie and janey and lily that's seven 'ow am i to put seven of us away in what you call a nice little 'ouse why you'll have five bedrooms flossie cried and where are the servants to go mrs stubbs demanded oh i suppose i'm to do without a servant at all well i shouldn't think you'll want more than one returned flossie who had six mrs stubbs rocked herself to and fro in the depth of her misery and despair and what's to become of me when lily comes of age she cried for by mr stubbs's will the business was to be carried on for the benefit of his children until the youngest should come of age when the two boys were to have it as partners he had believed his wife and children were safely provided for out of his property which had nothing to do with the business of which mrs stubbs was to take half absolutely and the other half was to go equally among the children every penny of this had however been swallowed up by the losses which had in reality killed him so that though there was a provision for the children mrs stubbs was except through the favour of the trustees absolutely unprovided for oh well it's a good long time till then flossie returned coldly and really ma i do think it's ungrateful of you to make such a fuss when things might be so different just supposing now may and i weren't married you might grumble then i 'aven't as much mrs stubbs cried to bring up five children on as you and may each 'ave to dress on perhaps not but then we have to go into a great deal of society and look what that costs flossie retorted any way mr jones is too much disgusted at all this happening just now to let me help you and as for my allowance i have to pay my maid out of it so i really don't see that you can expect me to do anything for you i don't think auntie wants you to do anything for her i'm sure she doesn't expect it put in sarah who was so utterly disgusted that she could keep silence no longer though she had determined not to speak at all well sarah i really can't see what occasion there is for you to put your word in said mrs jones with an air of dignity we have heard a great deal about what you were going to do perhaps now you will do it and let us see whether the princess is going to turn out a real princess after all or not for a moment sarah looked at her with such utter disdain in her grey eyes that the redoubtable flossie fairly quailed beneath her gaze i am going always to treat my dear aunt with the respect and love she deserves flossie she said gravely and even if i prove an utter failure in every other way you might still take a lesson from me with great improvement to yourself oh you think so do you sneered flossie yes i do said sarah promptly then let me tell you miss sarah gray that i think your tone and manner exceedingly impertinent and familiar in future call me mrs jones if you please and try if you can remember to keep your place mrs jones i will and do you remember to keep yours sarah replied and do you remember too that you need not insult my aunt any further i shall speak as i like to my own mother flossie cried furiously sarah opened her eyes wide if i do put you out of the house mrs jones she said speaking with ominous calmness i may be a little rough with you and then the door opened and may came languidly in what is the matter she cried flossie is that you at it again do go away please i am not well i came to have a little talk to ma and i can't bear quarrelling do go away flossie i beg that sarah has insulted me flossie gasped but may was remarkably unsympathetic oh i've no doubt a very good thing too for you've insulted her ever since you first saw her do go away i'm sure i shall faint i never could bear wrangling and fighting and poor pa's going off like that has upset me so i just feel as if i could burst out crying if any one speaks to me on this flossie finding that may was unmistakably preparing herself for a nice comfortable faint went stormily away and rolled off in her grand carriage looking like a thunder cloud may recovered immediately i really don't envy flossie's husband the rest of his life she remarked what a comfort she has gone away well ma dear i came in to have a quiet talk with you and that tiresome girl has upset you i would not take any notice if i were you dear i don't suppose flossie means it but she is so impetuous and she's so jealous of sarah i'm sure i don't know what you ever did to upset her sarah but you and i were always the best of friends the best of friends may said sarah then bent down and kissed her cousin's soft ungloved hand i didn't mean to speak not to say a word but she was so unkind to poor auntie and may it is hard on auntie after all this looking round the room and her beautiful carriages and horses and her kind husband who was so fond of her to have just three hundred a year to keep five children on it is hard poor mrs stubbs broke down and began to sob instantly sarah puts it all so beautifully she said that's just as it was your poor pa and but then she stopped unable to go on choked by her tears now ma dear don't may entreated we don't know why everything is it might have been worse you know dear just think if you'd had flossie at home ah it is a comfort to me to think flossie is married said mrs stubbs drying her eyes she's never been like a child to me and there might have been nothing you know after all there is something and you'll be able to keep them all together i shall help you all i can ma dear you know i shall do that and if i can't do much else i can take you for drives and see if i can't help minnie to get married you'll think it queer ma dear that i'm not just able to say 'i'll give you a cheque for a hundred now and then' but i can't life isn't all roses for me either of course i have a grand house in palace gardens and diamonds and carriages and all that but mr giath doesn't give me much money he isn't like poor dear pa of course he made a very big settlement pa insisted on that but only at his death i don't get it now and he pays my dress bills himself and with a sob i don't find it all roses to be an old man's darling but i don't want to trouble you with all that ma dear you've got enough troubles and worries of your own but you'll understand just how it is won't you dear and of course there'll be many little ways that i shall be able to help you well i have got my troubles said mrs stubbs drying her eyes and looking at her daughter's pretty flushed face but others has them as well you were always my right 'and may from the time you was a little girl in short petticoats and you're more comfort to me now than all my other children put together all of them flossie's been 'ere turning up her nose at her mother and insulting sarah shameful and tom's grumbling all day long at what he calls his 'beggarly screw' and saying it won't pay for 'is cigars and cabs and such like and minnie's been crying all this morning because it's her birthday and nobody's remembered it and really altogether i feel as if it wouldn't take much more to send me off my head altogether but i did remember it cried may i've brought her a birthday present poor child i'm sure it is good of you may poor mrs stubbs cried minnie 'll be a bit comforted now you know it is 'ard on her for we used to make so much of birthdays but neither she nor the little ones ever seem to think of what they've 'ad and no more i do myself for that matter only of what they 'aven't got 'pon my word there is but one in the 'ouse to day who hasn' 'ad their grumble over something or other and that's sarah sarah laughed as she patted her aunt's fat hand i've got something else to do just now auntie she said bravely i've got to put my shoulder to the wheel now i've been riding on the top of the wagon all along chapter xvii sarah's opportunity a few days later they made the move to the little house at fulham which in poor lavish mrs stubbs's eyes was but a degree better than a removal to the workhouse but sarah who somehow seemed to have naturally the management of everything worked like a slave to get everything into good order before her aunt should set foot in the place at all she turned the house in jesamond road out that she might take the prettiest and most suitable things for the little queen anne box to which they were going and with the help of johnnie and the new servant succeeded in having everything in perfect order by the time of mrs stubbs's arrival but it was very very small mrs stubbs looked hopelessly at the narrow passage and the narrower doorways when she entered sobbed as she recognised one article of furniture after another or missed such as sarah had not thought it wise or in good taste to bring oh dear dear i ought to think it all very pretty and nice she wailed i left it all to you sarah and i know you've done your best i know it but i did think i should have been able to keep my own inlaid market writing table that stubbs gave me on my last wedding day i did dear auntie you shall have it sarah explained soothingly i couldn't get you to choose just what you would have and i had to be guided by size a good deal but we can fetch the table easily enough it will stand here in the window beautifully and just finish off the room nicely flossie says she'll not be able to come and see us very often mrs stubbs wandered off again she says it knocks the carriage about so coming down these new neighbourhoods ah i never used to think of my carriages before my relations never flossie will have more sense by and by said sarah who had but small patience with mrs jones's airs and graces poor sarah was so tired of flossie and her airs to her mind she was hardly worth a moment's consideration or regret to her she was just an ungenerous self sufficient very vulgar and heartless young person who would have been more in her place had she been scrubbing floors or washing dishes than she was or ever would be riding in her own carriage behind a pair of high stepping horses that had cost four hundred guineas don't think about flossie at all dear she said to her aunt some day she'll be sorry for all that has happened lately perhaps some day she may have trouble herself and then she will understand how unkind she has been to you but may is always sweet and good though she is tied up by that horrid old man and can't help you as she would like and the little ones are different they would never hurt your feelings willingly poor mrs stubbs shook her head sadly she had said nothing to sarah for a wonder for as a rule she carried all her troubles to her but only that morning tom had flung off to his beastly office in a rage because she had not been able to give him a sovereign and had suggested that the pound a week he was receiving ought to be more than enough for his personal expenses and minnie had pouted and cried because she could not have a pair of new gloves and the little ones had looked at her in utter dismay because there was not a fresh pot of jam for their breakfast perhaps mrs stubbs felt that sarah was young and must not be disheartened when she was doing her best i know not any way she kept these things to herself and after shaking her head as a sort of tribute to her troubles promised that she would try to make herself happy in her new home and then sarah felt herself at liberty to go and pay a visit to signor capri her violin master one she had been wishing to pay ever since her uncle's death she went at a time when she knew he would be alone and indeed she found him so ah my little sara he cried i was hoping to see you again soon and tell me you have lost the good uncle eh yes signor she answered and briefly told him all the story of her uncle's misfortune and death and now she ended i want to make money they have done everything for me now i want to do something for them can you help me illustration they have done everything for me now i want to do something for them can you help me you are a brave child the violin master cried and god has given you the rarest of all good gifts a grateful heart i think i can help you i think so only this morning i had a letter from a friend who is arranging a concert tour he has first rate artistes and he wants a lady violinist me cried sarah excitedly but said the maestro raising his hand he does not give much money but it would be a beginning she broke in he gives six pounds a week i'll go sarah cried then we will go and see him at once i have an hour to spare said the italian kindly well before that hour was ended sarah had engaged herself to go on a twelve weeks' tour at a salary of six pounds a week and her travelling expenses and before ten days more had gone over her head she had set off on her travels in search of fame and fortune flossie's remarks were very pious i'm sure sarah she said setting her rich folds of crape and silk straight i am heartily glad to find that you have so much good feeling as to wish to relieve poor ma of the expense of keeping you how much happier you will be to feel you are no longer a burden on anybody there's nothing like independence i'm sure every time i think of poor ma i say to myself 'thank heaven i'm no burden upon her that must be a great comfort to you i'm sure flossie said sarah gravely yes i often tell mr jones so and what salary are you going to have sarah enough to help my aunt a little replied sarah coldly well really i can't see why you need be so close about it flossie observed nor why you should want to help ma i'm sure she'll have enough to live very comfortably only of course she must be content to live a little less extravagantly than she did before i do believe she added with a superb air in people being content and happy with what they have it's so much more sensible than always pining after what they haven't got by the bye sarah we are going to have a dinner party to morrow night i couldn't ask ma because of her mourning but if you like to come in in the evening and bring your violin we shall be very pleased i'm sure if you like to ask me as a professional and pay my fee began sarah mischievously pay your fee well i never to your own cousin and when you owe us so much flossie exclaimed i don't think i owe you anything flossie not even civility or kindness said sarah coldly but mrs jones had flounced away in a huff such impudence as she said to her husband afterwards well sarah went off on her tour and won a fair amount of success enough to make her manager anxious to secure her for the following winter on the same terms but sarah had promised signor capri to do nothing without his knowledge and he wrote back wait before next winter you may be famous but the months passed over and still fame had not come except in a moderate degree the manager was very glad to take sarah on tour again at a salary advanced to seven pounds a week instead of six and sarah was equally glad to go in the meantime she had made a good deal of money by playing at private houses and at concerts she had taken a well earned holiday to the channel islands and had given her aunt and the little ones a very good time there all out of her own pocket and had added a very liberal sum to the housekeeping purse of the little queen anne house at fulham twice she had dined with the giaths in palace gardens and had taken her violin because may had not asked her to do so and more than once she had been asked to go in the evening to grace the rooms of mrs jones an honour which she persistently declined so time went on and sarah worked late and early hoping longing praying to be one day a great woman thus several years went by and at last there came a glad and joyous day when she received a command to play at a state concert a day when she woke to find herself looked upon as one of the first violinists of the age it was wonderful then how engagements crowded in upon her how she was sought out flattered and made much of how even the redoubtable flossie was proud to go about saying that she was miss gray's cousin not that she ever owned it to sarah but sarah heard from time to time that mrs jones had spread the fact of the relationship abroad the object of flossie's life now seemed to be to get sarah to play at her house for as she explained to her mother and may now a rich young widow of course it looks odd to other people that they never see sarah at my house and i don't wish to do sarah harm by saying that i don't care to have her there but sometimes when she's staying with you may you might bring her i don't think she would come laughed may you see you sat upon sarah so frightfully when she wasn't anybody in particular that now when she is somebody of more consequence than all the lot of us put together she naturally doesn't feel inclined to have anything to do with you i know i shouldn't and lady bright asked particularly if she was going to play on the th said flossie with a rueful face and not attempting to deny the past in any way and what did you say i said i hoped so oh well that will be all the same lady bright will understand after a time that 'hope deferred maketh the heart sick' may laughed and perhaps it will be as well to remember in future that ugly ducklings may turn out swans some day and that if they do they are sometimes painfully aware of the fact that some people would have kept them ducklings for ever you see you and tom who is more horrid now even than he was as a boy yes i see you agree with me gave her the name of princess sarah she has grown up to the name that is all the end miss mignon it was a week before christmas there were no visitors at ferrers court although a couple of days later the great hall would be filled to overflowing with a happy light hearted set of people all bent as they always were at ferrers court on enjoying themselves to the uttermost the weather was cold and cheerless though not cold enough to stop the hunting and captain ferrers had been absent all day and might now come home at any moment mrs ferrers was in fact rather putting on the time hoping he might return before browne brought in the tea the children meantime were clamouring loudly for a story a story said mrs ferrers doubtfully she never thought herself very good at story telling and often wondered that the children seemed to like hearing her so much yes a story cried three or four fresh young voices in a breath i'm afraid i've told you all my stories mrs ferrers said apologetically and i have told them all so many times tell us about mignon cried maud for mignon their half sister was still their favourite heroine mrs ferrers pondered for a moment i don't believe she remarked that i have ever told you about mignon being lost mignon lost cried maud oh never lost echoed pearl and where was she lost mother tell us cried bertie yes do tell us echoed cecil tell us cried madge and baby in the same breath so mrs ferrers gathered her thoughts together and began it was when pearl was about four months old at which pearl drew herself up and looked important as if she too had had a share in the adventure we went to london for the season that was in april we had not the house we have now for that was let for a term so your father took a house near the top of queen's gate that's where the memorial is said pearl i know yes we know echoed maud well humphie who had attended mignon ever since she was a year old had of course the entire care of pearl and i engaged a very nice french maid half maid half nurse for mignon she was under humphie of course but she had to take mignon out not very often for she was accustomed to going out a great deal with your father and to dress her and so on well one day your father and i were going to a large afternoon party where we couldn't very well take mignon we stayed rather late rushed back and dressed and went to a dinner party not really having time to see the children at all we had a party or two later on but to them we never went for just as we ladies were going through the hall on our way up into the drawing room i caught sight of browne at the door of the inner hall i turned aside at once 'is anything the matter browne' i asked indeed i saw by his white face that something dreadful had happened illustration 'is anything the matter brown' page 'oh yes ma'am something dreadful' he answered 'i scarcely know how to tell you miss mignon is lost' 'miss mignon lost browne what do you mean' i said 'how can she be lost' 'i only know she is' he said in a shaking voice 'that silly idiot hortense went out with her about three o'clock with orders to go into the park she this is her story i cannot vouch for the truth of it ma'am she admits that she took her first to look at the shop windows in the high street and that then she thought she would like to go into the gardens and that while there she fell asleep the afternoon being so warm she sat on a bench asleep till half past five and when she woke up with a start feeling very shivery and cold and serve her right too miss mignon was gone there was not a trace of her to be seen' 'if the silly creature had come straight home' browne went on 'something might have been done but instead of doing that she must go into hysterics with nobody to see her even and then go crying about from one gate to the other wandering about as if miss mignon would be likely to be sitting on the edge of the pavement waiting for her at last i suppose when she began to get hungry' browne went on savagely 'she bethought herself of coming home and there she landed herself at nine o'clock and has been steadily going out of one faint into another ever since i have sent james round to the police station' he said 'but i thought i had better come straight away and fetch you ma'am' well mrs ferrers went on i said good night to our hostess and sent for your father and we went back at once we were five miles from home and it was half past eleven when we got there and there was no trace of mignon james had taken a cab and gone round to all the police stations within reach of the house and humphie was waiting for us shaking like a leaf and as white as death and at the sight of us hortense went off into wild hysterics again and shrieked till till i could have shaken her mrs ferrers ended severely well your father and i just stood and looked at one another 'where can she be' i said 'can't you get any information out of hortense surely the woman must know where she was last with her' but as your father said the gardens were all deserted and closed hours ago she was not at all likely to be there almost without doubt she had strayed out into the busy street had then found herself in a strange neighbourhood and and i simply shuddered to think what might have happened to her after that for the time we were helpless we did not know we could not think what to do next a policeman came up from the nearest station as we stood considering what we should do but he had no news he shook his head at my eager inquiry 'no madam' he said 'i'm sorry we have no news of the little lady but we telegraphed to all the stations near but no lost child has been brought in she must have fallen in with some private person' as you may imagine mrs ferrers went on i felt dreadfully blank indeed your father and i simply stood and looked at one another what should we what could we do next to go out and search about the streets at nearly midnight would be like looking for a needle in a truss of hay we could not send a crier out with a bell we were at our wits' end indeed it seemed as if we could do nothing but wait till morning when we might advertise then just as the policeman was turning away another policeman came and knocked at the door a little girl had been taken into the police station at hammersmith a pretty fair haired child about six years old who did not know where she lived and could not make the men there understand who she was 'that's not miss mignon' cried humphie indignantly 'miss mignon knows perfectly well who she is and who she belongs to that's never miss mignon' 'ah well humphie' said your father 'miss mignon has never been lost at dead of night before it's enough to frighten any child and though she's as quick as a needle she's only a baby after all' the carriage was still at the door and we went down as quickly as the horses could go to hammersmith feeling sure that we should find mignon there frightened and tired but safe and when we got there the child wasn't mignon at all but a little commonly dressed thing who didn't seem even to know what her name was however its mother came whilst we were there and scolded her properly for what she called 'running away' i couldn't help it mrs ferrers went on i was in such trouble wondering what had got mignon and i just spoke to her straight 'oh' i said 'you ought only to be thankful your little girl is safe and sound and not be scolding the poor little frightened thing like that how can your speak to her so' 'well' she said 'if you had seven of them always up to some mischief or other and you'd been running about for hours till you were fit to drop and you hadn't a carriage to take her home in i daresay you'd feel a bit cross too' and i felt mrs ferrers went on reflectively that there was a great deal in what she said they didn't live more than a mile off and it was our way back so we drove them home and the little girl went to sleep on her mother's knee and i told her what trouble we were in about mignon she was quite grateful for the lift and i promised to let her know if we found mignon all right well we reached home again and there wasn't a sign of mignon anywhere with every moment i got more and more uneasy for mignon was turned six years old and was well used to going about and seeing strange people i knew she wasn't a child to get nervous unduly or be frightened of any one who offered to take care of her only i was so afraid that the wrong sort of people might have got hold of her and might have decoyed her away for the sake of her clothes or a reward oh dear what a dreadful night it was your father went out and got a cab and went round to all the police stations inquiring everywhere for traces of her and then he went and knocked up all the park keepers but none of them had noticed her either and humphie and i sat up by the nursery fire and about two in the morning hortense crept down and went on her knees to me praying and imploring me to forgive her and saying that if anything had happened to little missie she would make away with herself illustration hortense crept down and went on her knees to me praying and imploring me to forgive her what's that asked madge suddenly hanging herself answered pearl judas hanged himself judas went out and hanged himself corrected maud who had a passion for accuracy of small details yes of course but that doesn't matter said pearl the hanging was the principal thing he could have hanged himself without going out but going out without hanging himself would not have been anything go on mother cried a chorus of voices what happened next well nothing happened for a long time mrs ferrers replied we all stayed up i think nobody thought of going to bed that night at all i know humphie and i never did and at last the morning broke and your father and browne began to make arrangements for putting notices in all the papers and when they had written them all they went off in the grey dim light to try to get them put into that day's papers oh it was a most dreadful night and a terrible morning i didn't like to put it into words but all night long i had thought of the round pond and wondered if my mignon was in there i found out afterwards that your father had thought of it too and had made all arrangements for having it dragged though he wouldn't speak of it to me because he fancied i had not thought of it and over and over again humphie kept saying 'i'm sure my precious lamb knows perfectly well who she is and all about herself i'm sure of it why we taught her years ago ma'am in case it ever happened she got lost i'm miss mignon and i belong to booties and captain ferrers the scarlet lancers she knew it all years since' 'yes but humphie has any one taught her queen's gate sw' i asked 'no' said humphie 'i can't say that we have' 'then she might fall in with hundreds and thousands of people in london who wouldn't know captain ferrers from captain jones and she might be too frightened to remember anything about the scarlet lancers it isn't as if we were with the regiment still' the morning wore on nothing happened your father went to scotland yard and detectives came down and examined hortense who went off into fresh hysterics and threatened to go right away and drown herself there and then but there was no news of mignon and then algy came in and told me they had dragged the pond and thank god she wasn't there though the suspense was almost unbearable as it was but we seemed no nearer to hearing anything of her and hardly knew what to be doing next though the day was wearing away and it was horrible to think of going through such another night as the one we had just passed and then just at four o'clock a handsome carriage drew up at the door and i heard mignon's voice 'yes i'm sure that's the house' she said oh i don't know how i got to the door i think i tore it open and ran down the steps to meet her i don't remember what i said i think i cried i'm sure your father nearly choked himself in trying to keep his sobs back we nearly smothered mignon with kisses and it was ever so long before we had time to take any notice of the strange lady who had brought her home 'i'm afraid you've had a terrible night' she said with tears in her eyes 'i found your dear little maid wandering about in south kensington oh right down in onslow gardens i saw that she was not a child accustomed to being out alone and i asked her how it was she was perfectly cool and unconcerned 'i've lost my maid she said she sat down on a seat and i was picking daisies and i don't know how but i couldn't find her again 'and what is your name i asked her 'oh i'm miss mignon she answered 'and where do you live i inquired 'well that's just what i can't remember when i'm at home i live at ferrers court and when we were with the regiment our address was the scarlet lancers just that but now we are in town i can't remember the name of the street i thought when i lost hortense that i should know my way back but i missed it somehow and mother will be so uneasy she ended 'well' said the lady 'i told her she had much better come home with me and that i would try to find out captain ferrers and so i did but without success then it occurred to me that as soon as the offices were open i would telegraph to the scarlet lancers asking for captain ferrers' address and so i did and when the answer came back it was your country address captain ferrers ferrers court farlington blankshire 'so i had no choice but to telegraph to ferrers court for your town address and oh dear lady my heart was aching for you all the time for i knew you must be suffering agonies she ended holding out her hands to me and so of course i had been mrs ferrers went on but 'all's well that ends well' and we at once taught mignon the name of the house she lived in and indeed for a long time we sewed a little ticket on to the hem of her frock so that if she did forget it she would easily make some one understand where she wished to be taken and hortense what did you do with her pearl asked oh we gave her a month's wages and sent her away mrs ferrers answered and now here is browne with the tea pearl can you manage it oh yes mother pearl answered she was nearly fourteen and loved to make the tea now and then oh here's miss maitland coming miss maitland i am to pour out the tea mother says so willingly so long as you don't scald yourself said miss maitland smiling and here is father cried maud bootles mother has been telling us the dreadful story of how mignon was lost has she sweetheart well we don't want to go through that particular experience any more do we darling no once was once too often said mrs ferrers slipping her hand into his two lumps of sugar said pearl bringing her father his cup and muffins added maud boy's love part i it was towards the close of the afternoon of a warm june day that a short sturdy fair haired boy wearing a dark blue uniform with a touch of scarlet here and there about it sat down at a long desk to write a letter it was headed duke of york's school chelsea sw and began my dear mother when he had got thus far the boy paused leaned his elbow upon the desk and rested his head upon his hand and then after a minute the hand slipped downward and rubbed something out of his eyes something hard to get rid of apparently for presently one bright drop after another forced its way through his fingers and fell on to the desk beneath and yet truth to tell even those bright drops did not help to get rid of the something the something which had a firm foothold in the heart below making it swell till it was well nigh to bursting this was his letter my dear mother this is my last day at school to morrow i am going to warnecliffe to join the th dragoons they call them the black horse i am very glad to leave school and be a soldier like my father but and here the blurred writing was an evidence of the trouble in the boy's heart but i don't like losing my chum you know he is tom boynton and we have been chums for more than three years he is orderly to the dispenser and has leave to go out almost any time i am very fond of him and haven't any other chum though he has another chum besides me i think he likes me best i do love him mother and i lay awake all last night crying tom cried too a little he is going to the scarlet lancers and i don't know when i shall see him any more i wish we were going into the same regiment i got your letter on my fourteenth birthday the day before yesterday tom is seven months older than me he would have left school before if he had not been orderly to the dispenser we both got the vg jack green is going into my regiment i shall come home when i get my furlough and if tom gets his at the same time can i bring him too tom hasn't any father or mother at all this is a very long letter i hope you are very well i am your affectionate son edward petres he read the letter over brushing his cuff across his eyes when he came to that part of the paper which showed traces of tears and then he folded it and directed the envelope after which he had finished then he got up took his cap and with the letter in his hand went forlornly out of the large room when he had got rid of it he went in search of his chum tom boynton whom he met just coming away from his last service as dispenser's orderly with a heaving chest and eyes almost as red and swollen as poor ted's own ted turned back with him and took hold of his arm taken your last physic out tom said he with a gallant attempt at manly indifference to the dreaded parting of the morrow aye returned tom in a choking voice and with eyes carefully averted the dispenser had just bade him good bye and had told him in wishing him god speed that he was very sorry to lose him and would most likely have to wait a long time before he again had help as efficient and then he had given him a tip of half a crown and had shaken hands with him so tom's heart was quite as full as ted's and of the two being the older and bigger and stronger he was far the most anxious to hide the emotion he felt have you seen jack he asked giving his head a bit of a shake and crushing his trouble down right bravely jack green asked ted shortly he was not a little jealous of jack green who was his chum's other chum aye where is he i haven't seen him not all the afternoon returned ted curtly i'll go and find him said tom disengaging his arm from ted's close grasp the two lads parted then for tom swung away in the direction of the playground leaving ted staring blankly after him and there he stood for full five minutes until his eyes blinded with pain he could see no longer and then he turned away and hid his face upon his arm against a friendly sheltering wall illustration hid his face upon his arm against a friendly sheltering wall but by and by his jealousy of jack green began to wear away perhaps after all he argued tom only wanted to hide his trouble tom was a big lad and was even more ashamed than ted of being betrayed into weeping and such like exhibitions of weakness so by the time they turned in for the night the last night ted had forgotten the pain of the afternoon tom said he going over to his chum's bed which was next to his tom i've come to talk to you yes whispered tom in reply the lights were all out then and most of the boys were fast asleep so big tom drew his chum's head down to his and put his arm round his neck it's the last night tom said ted in a strangled voice yes said tom in a whisper we've been chums for three years and more ted went on and we've never been out of friends yet p'raps i shall get an exchange to your reg'ment yet or me to yours answered tom eagerly i shan't have no chum now ted went on taking no notice of tom's words you'll have jack green said tom yes there'll be jack green but he ain't you ted answered mournfully he'll never be my chum like you was tom but if ever i've a chance of doing him a good turn i will 'cause you liked him will you ted eagerly yes i will answered ted steadily and tom it's our last time together to night we mayn't ever get together again i know sighed tom i wish ted said hesitatingly oh tom with a sorrowful catch in his voice and a great gulp in his throat i i do wish you'd kiss me just once and so tom boynton put his other arm around his chum's neck and the two lads who had been friends for three years held one another for a minute in a close embrace an instant later ted petres tore himself away and sprang into his bed dragging the clothes over his head and burying his face in the pillow in a vain attempt to stifle his sobs and before another day had gone over their heads they had parted to meet again when and where part ii seven years had gone by a fierce and scorching sun shone down with glaring radiance upon long stretches of arid and sandy country covered sparsely with coarse rank grass and brushwood the country which is called the soudan the country where so many brilliant lives ended sacrificed in the cause of a crusade as hopeless as the crusade of the children who sought to win heaven with glory where the flower of the nations had failed sacrificed to the death in the too late attempt to succour a gallant soldier the noble victim of an ignoble policy and between the brilliant glaring sky and the sun scorched arid earth there hung a heavy cloud of gunpowder smoke while the flower of two races fought desperately for conquest in the midst a square of british troops with set white faces and sternly compressed lips with watchful eyes well on the alert and in each brave heart the knowledge that the fight was for life or death and on all hands swarms of stalwart soudanese reckless of life and counting death their chiefest gain shouting on allah and the prophet to aid them and dying happy in the certain faith of entering paradise if but one christian dog should fall to their hand oh what a scene it was only a handful of men at bay while mass after mass of the enemy came down upon them like the waves of the incoming tide upon the sea shore and as at times a rock bound coast gives way and falls before the encroaching advances of the ocean so that ill fated square gave way before the overwhelming numbers of the soldiers of the prophet and in a moment all chance for our men seemed over ay but the british lion can up and fight again after he has had a roll over which would crush the life out of most of his foes and so that day by sheer hard desperate fighting the square closed up and was formed again and of all the enemy who had dashed into the midst of it not one lived to tell the tale but oh what though the enemy fell half a score to one how many a brave life was laid down that day and how many a bullet had found its billet was proved by the shrieks of agony which rose and rang above all the tumult of the fight it happened that our old friend ted petres no longer a short and sturdy boy but a fine grown young fellow of one and twenty now found himself not very far from the place where the square had been broken found himself fighting hard to win the day and check the mad on rush of the sons of the prophet as the ranks closed up once more he as did most others who were in the rear turned his attention to the seething mass of blacks thus trapped and to his horror saw his comrade jack green down on his knees striking wildly here and there against the attacks of three soudanese quick as thought the thought that this was the first time he had ever had a chance of fulfilling his last promise to his boy's love tom ted flew to his aid sent one shouting gentleman to paradise and neatly disabled the right arm of a second just as the third put his spear through poor jack's lungs to cleave him to the teeth was but the work of a moment and ted petres accomplished it before the follower of the prophet had time to withdraw his spear but alas poor jack's life was welling out of him faster than the sands run out of a broken hour glass it was no use to lift him up and look round for help jack green had seen his last service and ted knew it but he did his best for him in those last moments and help came in the person of one of their officers one d'arcy de bolingbroke who though badly wounded in the arm himself was yet able to lend a hand petres you're a splendid fellow he exclaimed i shall recommend you if we live to get out of this you ought to get the cross for this thank you sir returned ted gratefully and then between them they managed to get the poor fellow to the doctors who were hard at work behind a poor shelter of wagons and store cases but it was too late for when they laid him down jack green was dead and at ease for ever one of the hospital orderlies turned from a case at hand and ted uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of him why tom he cried starting up to take his hand i didn't even know you were with us there was no answering gleam of pleasure on tom boynton's face he stared at ted stared at the face of the dead man lying at their feet then dropped upon his knees beside him oh jack jack speak to me he cried imploringly illustration oh jack jack speak to me he cried imploringly it's too late tom said ted bending down i did my best but it was too late old man i did my best tom boynton looked up in his old chum's face you let him die he asked we were three to one returned the other humbly you did your best and you let him die repeated tom blankly and he was my chum he added miserably tom cried ted passionately i was your chum too you with infinite scorn then bending down he kissed the dead face tenderly ted petres turned away blind with pain he might have won the cross but he had lost his friend the friend who had loved him less than that other chum of whom he had not the heart now to feel jealous and that was how they met again that was the end of tom petres' boy's love yum yum a pug chapter i for a pug yum yum was perfect and let me tell you it takes a great many special sorts of beauty to give you a pug which in any way approaches perfection first your true pug must be of a certain colour a warm fawn colour it must have a proper width of chest and a bull doggish bandiness about the legs it must have a dark streak from the top of its head along its back towards the tail it must have a double twist to that same tail and three rolls of fat or loose skin set like a collar about its throat it must have a square mouth an ink black no no a soot black mask that is face adorned with an infinitesimal nose a pair of large and lustrous goggle eyes and five moles i believe too that there is something very important about the shape and colouring of its toes but i really don't know much about pugs and this list of perfections is only what i have been able to gather from various friends who do understand the subject so let me get on with my story and say at once that yum yum possessed all these perfections she may have had others for she was without doubt a great beauty of her kind and she certainly was blessed with an admirable temper an angelic temper mild as new milk and as patient as job's and yum yum belonged to a little lady called nannie mackenzie illustration yum yum a pug the mackenzies i must tell you were not rich people or in any way persons of importance they had no relations and apparently belonged to no particular family but they were very nice people and very good people and lived in one of a large row of houses on the surrey side of the river thames at that part which is called putney mr mackenzie was something in the city and had not apparently hit upon a good thing for there was not much money to spare in the house at putney i rather fancy that he was managing clerk to a tea warehouse but am not sure upon that point mrs mackenzie had been a governess but of course she had not started life as a teacher of small children no she had come into the world in an upper room of a pretty country vicarage where the olive branches grew like stonecrop and most visitors were in the habit of reminding the vicar of certain lines in the hundred and twenty seventh psalm in course of time this particular olive plant like her sisters picked up a smattering of certain branches of knowledge and armed thus went out into the wide world to make her own way her knowledge was not extensive it comprised a fluent power of speaking her mother tongue with a pleasant tone and correct accent but without any very well grounded idea of why and wherefore it was so she also knew a little french of doubtful quality and a little less german that was distinctly off colour she could copy a drawing in a woodenly accurate kind of way with stodgy skies made chiefly of chinese white and exceedingly woolly trees largely helped out with the same useful composition at that time there was no sham about nora browne's pretensions to art there they were good bad or indifferent and you might take them for what they were worth which was not much it was not until she had been mrs mackenzie for some years that she took to doing the picture galleries armed with catalogue and pencil and talked learnedly about chiar oscuro about distance and atmosphere about this school and that this method or the other treatment there were frequenters of the art galleries of london to whom mrs mackenzie nee nora browne was a delightful study but then on the other hand there was a much larger number of persons than these whom she impressed deeply and who even went so far as to speak of her with bated breath as a power on the press while as a matter of fact mrs mackenzie's little paragraphs were very innocent and not very remunerative and generally won for the more or less weekly society papers in which they appeared a reputation for employing an art critic who knew a good deal more about the frames than about the pictures within them however all this is a little by the way i really only give these details of mrs mackenzie's doings to show that the family was by virtue of their mother being a dabbler in journalism in touch with the set which i saw the other day elegantly described as upper bohemia now in the circles of upper bohemia nobody is anybody unless they can do something unless they can paint pictures or umbrella vases and milking stools unless they can sing attractively or play some instrument beyond the ordinary average of skill unless they can write novels or make paragraphs for the newspapers unless they can act or give conjuring entertainments or unless they can compose pretty little songs with a distinct motif or pieces for the piano which nobody can make head or tail of it is very funny that there should be so wide a difference necessary between the composition of music for the voice and music for the piano for the first there must be a little something to catch the ear a little swing in the refrain a something to make the head wag to and fro the words may be ever so silly if they are only bordering on the pathetic and if the catch in the refrain is taking enough the rest of the song may be as silly as the words and still it will be a success but with a piece it is different for that the air must be resolutely turned inside out as it were and apparently if the composer chances to light on one or two pretty bits he goes back again and touches them up so as to make them match all the rest it seems odd this but the world does not stop to listen but talks its hardest and as at the end it says how lovely i suppose it is all right but all these people stand in the very middle of upper bohemia and as a pebble dropped into the water makes circles and ever widening circles on the smooth surface so do the circles which constitute upper bohemia widen and widen until eventually they merge into the world beyond there are the amateurs and the reciters and the artists who put decorative in front of the word which denotes their calling and then put a hyphen between the two and there are the thought readers and the palmists and the people who have invented a new religion all these are in the ever widening circles of upper bohemia and outside these again come the fashionable lady dressmakers and the art milliners the trained nurses and the professors of cooking after these you may go on almost ad libitum until the circle melts into professional life on the one hand and fashionable life on the other you have perhaps been wondering my gentle reader what all this can possibly have to do with the pug yum yum which belonged to a little girl named nannie mackenzie well it really has something to do with it as i will show you first because it tells you that this was the set of people to whom the mackenzies belonged and took a pride in belonging it is true that they had a stronger claim to belong to a city set but you see mrs mackenzie had been brought up in the bosom of the church and thought more of the refined society in upper bohemia than she did of all the money bags to be found east of temple bar in this i think she was right in modern london it does not do for the lion to lie down with the lamb or for earthenware pipkins to try sailing down the stream with the iron pots in upper bohemia owing to the haziness of her right of entry mrs mackenzie was quite an important person in the city owing to various circumstances shortness of money most of all mrs mackenzie was nowhere mrs mackenzie had not followed the example of her father and mother with regard to the size of her family she had only three children two girls and a boy rosalind wilfrid and nannie at this time nannie was only ten years old a pretty sweet engaging child with frank blue eyes and her mother's pretty trick of manner a child who was never so happy as when she had a smart sash on with a clean white frock in readiness for any form of party that had happened to come in her way wilf was different he was a grave quiet boy of thirteen already working for a scholarship at st paul's school and meaning to be a great man some day and meanwhile spending all his spare hours collecting insects and gathering specimens of fern leaves together above wilf was rosalind and rosalind was sixteen a tall willowy slip of a girl with a pair of fine eyes and a passion for art i do not mean a passion for making the woodenly accurate drawings with stodgy clouds and woolly trees which had satisfied her mother's soul and made her so eminently competent to criticise the work of other folk no not that but a real passion for real art now the two mackenzie girls had had a governess for several years a mildly amiable young lady of the same class and possessed of about the same amount of knowledge as mrs mackenzie herself had been she too made wooden drawings with stodgy clouds and woolly trees and she painted flowers such flowers as made rosalind's artistic soul rise within her and loathe miss temple and all her works nay sometimes loathe even those good qualities which were her chiefest charm rosalind wanted to go further a field in the art world than either her mother's paragraphs or miss temple's copies she wanted to join some well known art class and giving up everything else go in for real hard grinding work but it could not be done for as i have said money was not plentiful in the house at putney and there was always the boy to be thought of and also there was nannie's education to finish to let rosalind join an expensive art class would mean being without miss temple and mrs mackenzie felt that to do that would be to put a great wrong upon little nannie for which she would justly be able to reproach her all her life long it would not do my dear she said to rosalind when her elder daughter was one day holding forth on the glories which might one day be hers if only she could get her foot upon this the lowest rung of the ladder by which she would fain climb to fame and fortune and really i don't see the sense or reason of your being so anxious to follow art as a profession i am sure you paint very well that little sketch of wild roses you did last week was exquisite indeed i showed it to miss dumerique when i was looking over her new art studio in bond street she said it would be charming painted on a thrush's egg ground for a milking stool or a tall table or used for a whole suite of bedroom or boudoir furniture i'm sure my dear you might make quite an income did miss dumerique offer to do one to let me do any work of that kind for her rosalind broke in impatiently no she did not mrs mackenzie admitted but but depend upon it she is at work on the idea long before this cried rosalind she knew miss dumerique and had but small faith in any income from that quarter several of her most cherished designs having suggested ideas to that gifted lady if i only had twenty pounds twenty pounds rosalind went on it would give me such a help such a lift i should learn so much if i could spend twenty pounds and it's such a little only the price of the dress mrs arlington had on the other day and she said it was so cheap 'just a cheap little gown my dear to wear in the morning' oh if only i had the price of that gown rosalind my dear cried mrs mackenzie don't say that it sounds so like envy and envy is a hateful quality yes i know it is but i do want twenty pounds so badly answered rosalind in a hopeless tone mrs mackenzie began to sob weakly if i could give it to you rosalind you know i would she wailed but i haven't got it i work and work and work and strain every nerve to give you the advantages ay and more than the advantages that i had when i was your age but i can't give you what i haven't got it's unreasonable to ask it or to expect it i didn't either ask or expect it said rosalind but she said it under her breath and felt that after all her mother was right she could not give what she had not got it was hard on them both on the girl that she could not have on the mother that she could not give rosalind from this time forth kept silence about her art because she knew that it was useless to hope for the impossible kept silence that is from all but one person and yet she could not keep her thoughts from flying ever and again to the art classes and the twenty pounds which would do so much for her so up in the room at the top of the house where she dabbled among her scanty paints and sketched out pictures in any colours that she happened to have and even went so far in the way of economy as to utilize the leavings of her mother's decorative paints hedge sparrow's egg blue arabian brown eau de nil gobelin and others equally unsuitable for her purpose rosalind mackenzie dreamed dreams and saw visions visions of a great day when she would have paints in profusion and art teaching galore there was not the smallest prospect of her dreams and visions coming true any more than without teaching and without paints there was of her daubs growing into pictures and finding places on the line at the academy and the new it is always so with youth it hopes and hopes against hope and when hope is dead there is no longer any youth it is dead too there are youthful dreamers building castles fair with stately stairways asking blindly of the future what it cannot give them chapter ii but there was one person to whom rosalind mackenzie poured out all that was in her mind that was her ten year old sister nannie in nannie she found a ready and a sympathetic listener moreover in nannie's mind there was no doubt no hesitation in believing that if rosalind only had that twenty pounds there would be nothing to keep her back nothing to prevent her sailing on right ahead into the roseate realms of fame and glory if only she had that twenty pounds now nannie undoubtedly had a very gay and jovial disposition she was always ready for fun and excitement and had no tendency or any desire to carve out a line for herself as her brother and sister had both had before they had reached her age yet she had what was better in many people's eyes a very tender heart and a very affectionate nature and her tender heart was wrung and wrung again at the thought of her sister's unsatisfied longings and the great future that was being blighted all for the want of twenty pounds yet what could a little girl of ten years old do towards getting such a sum as that together just nothing why if the sum was shillings instead of pounds she would still find it utterly beyond her power and out of her grasp she thought and she thought but thinking did not help matters she lay awake at night puzzling her little brain but that did no good and nannie's face grew a good deal paler and set her mother wondering if the house was unhealthy or thinking that perhaps the air from the river was damp and injurious it was about this time that yum yum the pug which had been given to nannie by one of her mother's friends two years before suddenly became the person of the most importance in the household at putney for behold one fine morning when nannie came down to breakfast yum yum presented her with three babies three dear wee pugs which sent nannie into ecstasies and made her forget for a few days all about rosalind's unsatisfied longings and her craving after higher things than at present were attainable to her you think they're real beauties don't you father said nannie anxiously yes they are great beauties said mr mackenzie holding one little snub nosed pug up and examining it closely and what should you think that they are worth father nannie asked worth oh that would depend a good deal on how they turn out their pedigree is a very fair one and at the end of six weeks or two months they might be worth three or four guineas apiece more for that matter nannie fairly gasped and she clutched hold of her father's arm oh daddy dear she exclaimed do you really really think i might be able to get any thing like that for them oh yes i think so he answered smiling at her earnestness but nannie why do you want this money so much have you set your mind on a watch and chain oh no dear daddy she answered eagerly it's not for myself at all it's poor rosalind i'm thinking of and forthwith she poured into her father's surprised but sympathetic ear all the story of rosalind's artistic longings her craving for better art lessons for all the good things that may be had for the sum of twenty pounds long before the story came to an end mr mackenzie had drawn his little daughter very closely to him and i fancy he was thinking when she came to the end of it more of the goodness of his nannie's heart than of the greatness of rosalind's future my nannie he said tenderly my generous kind hearted little woman rosalind ought to love you dearly for rosalind does love me dearly daddy nannie explained only she can't help wanting to be a painter it's in her you know and it's choking her and rosalind doesn't know a word about it she wouldn't want me to sell yummy's pups for her only you know daddy we can't keep three dogs besides yummy and we may just as well sell them as give them away and then rosalind would be able to have some of the lessons that she wants so badly mr mackenzie smiled at nannie's voluble information well well you shall sell the pups and make rosalind happy he said then after a moment added you know nannie that i am not rich in fact i am very poor but i will make the sum up to ten pounds and rosalind can go on thus far at all events well a few weeks passed over and the secret was rigidly kept between mr mackenzie and nannie more than once mrs mackenzie grumbled at the expense and the trouble yummy's three babies were in the kitchen and one afternoon when she came in from town she said oh nannie lady gray would like to have one of yummy's puppies i told her i thought you would let her have first choice then her ladyship must pay five guineas for it my dear said mr mackenzie promptly nannie and i are going to sell the puppies this time mrs mackenzie rather lifted her eyebrows oh if that is so she said of course lady gray must stand on one side but what are you going to do with the money nannie buy yourself a watch no mother but and nannie looked anxiously at her father who quickly came to the rescue and evaded the question which at that moment was an awkward one for rosalind was present it is probable that mr mackenzie gave his wife just a hint of what was a foot for she asked no more questions about the puppies and made no further complaints of the extra food and milk which yummy required at this time and in due course after a good deal of correspondence through the columns of the queen and the exchange and mart one by one the three little pugs went away from the house at putney to homes of their own and nannie in return became the proud possessor of no fewer than eight golden sovereigns to these mr mackenzie added the two which he had promised to make up the sum of ten pounds and then nannie had the supreme joy of going to rosalind who was hard at work in her studio painting a sunset in tints so startling that her artist soul was sick within her and flinging her offering in a shower into her lap why what is this nannie rosalind cried half frightened it's your lessons rosie nannie cried or at least as much of them as you can get for ten pounds and i'm so glad dear dear rosie to be able to help you you don't know and happy nannie flung her arms round her sister almost crying for joy but where did you get it oh the pugs i forgot them rosalind cried oh but nannie my dear darling unselfish sister i can't take your money in this way you must nannie answered promptly but your watch you've longed so for a watch you know said the elder girl well i have but i can long a bit more returned nannie philosophically i shall like it all the better when i do get it i can't take it darling rosalind urged oh yes you can if you try continued nannie and as for my watch why when you are a great swell painter you can buy me one a real beauty and i shall like it ever so much better than any other one in all the world rosalind clasped nannie close to her heart my nannie my nannie she cried i shall never be as brave and helpful as you are while i have been grumbling and growling and railing at fate you have been putting your shoulder to the wheel and oh nannie nannie it is good of you it is good i shall never forget it the first penny i earn dear shall be yours and i will never forget what my dear little sister has done for me never never as long as i live a few days after this rosalind was hard at work in the studio of the artist for whose teaching she had longed for so many weary months and how she did work i have one pupil who works her maestro got into the habit of saying some of you have a natural gift you have a correct eye and you have firm touch every one of you might make progress if you tried but there is only one of you all who works that is miss mackenzie but all too soon rosalind's ten pounds melted away until they had all gone and as there was no more where they had come from rosalind's lessons must also come to an end oh mother can't you do anything to help rosie nannie cried in piteously beseeching accents the night before rosalind was to go to the studio for the last time nannie answered mrs mackenzie reproachfully don't you think i would if i could daddy can you do nothing nannie implored my little one i am so poor just now he answered so poor nannie went to bed in bitter disappointment for her sister's trial she felt that it was very very hard upon rosalind who had worked almost day and night that she might profit by every moment of the time she was at the studio yes it was very very hard however rosalind was brave and put a good face upon the matter don't worry about it my nannie she said just before she got into bed after all i've learnt a great deal while i have been able to go to mr raymond and perhaps after a time daddy may be able to help me to go again and i may do some work that will sell and then i shall be able to go again so don't worry yourself my darling for you can't help me this time you see yummy hasn't got any more pups to sell but nannie had got an idea and all through the hours of that long night it stayed with her with the pertinacity of a nightmare still whatever it was she did not say a word about it to rosalind and when rosalind looked round for her when she was ready to start for the studio in the morning she was nowhere to be seen where is nannie she asked oh she's out in the garden mrs mackenzie answered well i haven't time to go down but don't let her worry about me will you mother said rosalind anxiously no no i will look after her mrs mackenzie answered vaguely so rosalind went off fairly satisfied i have come for my last lesson mr raymond she said with rather an uncertain smile as she bade the maestro good morning oh well well we must have a talk about that he answered good naturedly rosalind shook her head a little sadly and took her place without delay to her every moment was precious but though this was her last lesson she was not destined to do much work that day for as soon as she opened her little paint box which she had taken home the previous day that she might do some work in the early morning she saw lying on the top of the paints a little note addressed in nannie's round child's hand to rosalind the next moment maestro and pupils were alike startled by the sight of rosalind mackenzie with her face hidden in her hands sobbing as if her heart would break my dear child cried the maestro running to her side how now what is the matter pray tell me my dear tell me illustration 'my dear child what is the matter' then little by little rosalind sobbed out the whole story how she had longed and pined for these lessons how her little sister nannie had sacrificed herself to help her and then at last she put into the maestro's hand the little note which she had brought from home in the paint box darling rosalind the maestro read aloud i thought of a way to help you last night but i did not tell you about it because i know you would stop it you know that mrs clarke who bought yummy's little son said she would give ten guineas for her any day so i'm going to get father to take her there this afternoon and you shall have the money i don't think i shall mind parting with her much nannie mr raymond took off his glasses and wiped them upon my word he muttered in an uncertain voice upon my word the darling cried one pupil is she fond of the dog asked another fond of her rosalind echoed why yummy is the very idol of her heart she has had her from a puppy it would break the child's heart to part with her why i would die she said passionately before i would let her do it i would go out as a charwoman and scrub floors for my living all the days of my life rather than do such a mean thing mr raymond she went on i must go back at once or i may be too late i must lose my lesson i can't help that but i must go back for look at the poor little letter all tears and and there rosalind broke down into tears and sobs again but all the same she gathered her brushes together and began to pack up all her belongings the maestro stood for a moment in deep thought but as rosalind put her hat on and resolutely dried her eyes he spoke to the others who were standing around i should very much like to see this out he said and if you will set me free this morning i will give you each an extra lesson to make up for the interrupted one to day what do you say yes yes they all cried so the old painter and rosalind went back to the house at putney together and at the door rosalind put an eager question to the maid who opened it for them my mother she asked mrs mackenzie is dressing to go out miss rosalind the maid answered and miss nannie i believe miss nannie is in the garden was the reply so rosalind led the maestro out into the garden where they soon espied nannie curled up in a big chair with yummy in her arms she did not notice their approach indeed she was almost asleep worn out by the violence of her grief at the coming parting with yummy and was lying with her eyes closed her cheek resting against the dog's satin smooth head rosalind flung herself down upon her knees before the chair and took child and dog into her arms my own precious little sister my unselfish darling she cried as if i would let you part with the dear doggy for my sake i couldn't nannie my dear i couldn't i couldn't part with yummy myself but i shall never forget it nannie my dear unselfish nannie illustration my own precious little sister my unselfish darling she cried nannie looked past her sister towards the tall old painter standing behind her your lessons she faltered with quivering lips my little heroine said the old painter tenderly your sister is my favourite among all my pupils i would rather he went on laying his hand on rosalind's shoulder i would rather teach one real worker such as she is for love than fifty of the usual kind who come to me she is just the real worker one might expect with such a sister you will go on teaching rosalind nannie cried in a bewildered way for nothing i will gladly the maestro answered and in return you shall come one day and bring the pug and let me paint a picture of you both and then the old man went away leaving the sisters in the fulness of their joy together for him this had been somewhat of a new experience a pleasant one they were young and he was old but he went back to his pictures with a heart fresh and young as it had not been for years asking of himself a question out of the pages of a favourite poet shall i thank god for the green summer and the mild air and the flowers and the stars and all that makes the world so beautiful and not for the good and beautiful beings i have known in it our ada elizabeth the sublime mystery of providence goes on in silence and gives no explanation of itself no answer to our impatient questionings hyperion chapter i the dicki'sons lived in blankhampton not in the fashionable suburb of greater gate for the dicki'sons were not fashionable people far from it indeed nor yet in that exclusive part which immediately surrounds the cathedral which blankhampton folk familiarly call the parish no they lived in neither of these but away on the poorer side of the town and in the narrowest of narrow lanes so narrow indeed that if a cart came along the passer by was glad to get into a doorway and stand there trembling until the danger was past and the road free again i must tell you that although they were always called the dicki'sons their name was spelt in the usual way with an n in the middle and without an apostrophe but as their neighbours made an invariable rule of pronouncing the word as they did themselves in the way in which i have written it i will take the liberty of continuing the custom in this story for their position they were rather well to do mr dicki'son the father of the family was a plumber and glazier not in business for himself but the foreman of a business of some importance in the town and mr dicki'son was a plain man of somewhat reserved disposition there were ill natured and rude persons in that neighbourhood who did not hesitate to describe mr dicki'son as a sulky beast but then the opinion of such was scarcely worth having and even they had not a word to say against him beyond a general complaint of his unsociable temper they were lively people who lived round about gardener's lane the fathers worked hard all the week and mostly got frightfully drunk on saturday nights when they went home and knocked their dirty slipshod wives about just by way of letting them know their duty to their lords and masters and after this sort of thing had subsided the wives generally gave the children a good cuffing all round just by way of letting them know that they need not hope to take any liberties with their mothers because of their fathers' little ways and then they all got quieted down for the night and got up late on sunday morning with headaches if the day was fine the men sat dull and sodden in the sunshine on the pavement in the wide street out of which gardener's lane ran propping their backs against the wall and stretching their legs out greatly to the danger and annoyance of passers by and while the men thus smoked the pipe of peace the women stood in groups at their doorways scratching their elbows and comparing their bruises and the children who had gone to sleep the previous night in tears and tribulation found keen enjoyment in watching for the parson and the few people who went to the church round the corner and called names and uncomplimentary terms after them as they turned in at the gates which led thereto now as mr dicki'son was a person of a reserved and taciturn disposition who was distinctly respectable in all his doings who never got drunk and openly despised any one else who did it will readily be believed that he was not popular in the neighbourhood of gardener's lane he was not anxious to be popular and had it not been that the house in which he lived was his own and that it suited his family as a home gardener's lane would not have counted him among its inhabitants mrs dicki'son was a good deal younger than her husband a pretty weak sentimental woman rather gushing in disposition and very injudicious she was always overwhelmed with troubles and babies although as a matter of fact she had but six children altogether and one of them died while still an infant gerty was twelve years old and ada elizabeth just a year younger then came a gap of two years ere a boy william thomas was born william thomas if he had lived would i fancy have inherited his father's reserved disposition for i must say a more taciturn babe it has never at any time been my lot to encounter he was a dreadful trouble to his dissatisfied mother who felt and said that there was something uncanny about a child who objected to nothing who seemed to know no difference between his own thumb and the bottle which fed him and would go on sucking as patiently at the one as at the other who would lie with as much apparent comfort on his face as on his back and seemed to find no distinction between his mother's arms and a corner of the wide old sofa which earlier and later babies resented as a personal insult and made remarks accordingly however after six months of this monotonous existence william thomas was removed from this lower sphere passing away with the same dignity as he had lived after which he served a good purpose still which was to act as a model to all the other babies who resented the corner of the sofa and declined to accept the substitution of their thumbs or any other makeshift for the bottle of their desires two years later was a girl called polly and two years later again was georgie and then for a time mrs dicki'son being free from the cares of a baby fretted and worried that 'ome isn't like 'ome without a baby in it but when georgie was just turned three little miriam arrived and mrs dicki'son was able to change her complaint and tell all her acquaintance that she did think georgie was going to be the last and she was sure she was just wore out most of the children took after their mother true as i have already said william thomas had given signs of not doing so but william thomas had not really lived long enough for any one to speak definitely on the subject all the rest thrived and grew apace and they all took after their mother both in looks and character with the exception of the second girl our ada elizabeth the very moral of her father mrs dicki'son was accustomed to sigh as she tried in vain to trim ada elizabeth's hat so that the plain little face underneath it should look as bright and fresh as the rosy faces of her sisters but it was a hopeless task and mrs dicki'son had to give it up in despair and with many a long speech full of pity for herself that she of all people in the world should have such a hard trial put upon her as a child who was undeniably plain for the child was plain she had been a plain featureless baby of uncertain colour inclining to drab very much indeed what william thomas was after her a baby who even when newly washed never looked quite clean a little girl whose pinafore never hung right and with tow coloured hair which no amount of hair oil or curl papers could make anything but lank and unornamental a child with a heavy dull face and a mouth that seldom relaxed into a smile though there were people not mrs dicki'son among them though who did not fail to notice that the rare smile was a very sweet one infinitely sweeter than ever was seen on the four pretty rosy faces of the other children illustration a child with a heavy dull face mrs dicki'son was eloquent about ada elizabeth's looks and temper i'm sure she cried one day to gerty who was pretty and quick of wit and knew to a hair's breadth how far she could go with her mother it's 'ard upon me i should have such a plain looking child as our ada elizabeth it's no use me trying to trim her hat so as to make her look a credit to us i'm sure it's aggravating it is i've trimmed your two hats just alike and she looks no better in hers than she does in her old school hat and i got two nice curly tips just alike 'pon my word it's quite thrown away on her and i want another feather in mine to make it perfect mother murmured gerty with insinuating suggestiveness mrs dicki'son caught at the bait thus held out to her i've a good mind to take the tip out she said hesitatingly yes do mother our ada elizabeth won't care will you ada elizabeth appealingly to the child who had had the misfortune to be born plain no i don't care returned ada elizabeth whose heart was bursting not with jealousy but with a crushing sense of her own shortcomings just like her father remarked mrs dicki'son loosening the feather from its place with one snip of her scissors he never cares 'ow he looks ''andsome is as 'andsome does' is his motto and though he's been a good 'usband to me and i'd be the last to go again' him yet i must say i do like a bit of smartness myself but ada elizabeth's the very moral of her father as much in her ways as she is in her looks so gradually it got to be an established custom that ada elizabeth's attire should be shorn of those little decorations with which mrs dicki'son delighted to add effect to her eldest child's prettiness it was felt to be quite useless to spend money over curly tips and artificial roses to put above such a plain little face or waste it as her mother put it in the not very delicate way in which she tried to excuse herself to the child when some more obvious difference than usual between her clothes and gerty's was contemplated ada elizabeth made no complaint if asked her mind by the officious gerty she said she did not care and the answer was accepted as literal truth by her mother and sister but ada elizabeth did care she was not jealous mind alas no poor child she was only miserable crushed with an ever present consciousness of her own deficiencies and shortcomings with a sense that in having been born plain and in having taken after her father she had done her mother an irreparable injury had offered her the deepest insult possible she honestly felt that it was a hard trial to her mother that she should have such a plain and dull child more than once she made a desperate effort to chatter after gerty's fashion but somehow the dicki'son family did not appreciate the attempt gerty stared at her and sniggered and her mother told her with fretful promptness that she did not know what she was talking about and poor ada elizabeth withdrew into herself as it were and became more reserved more like her father than ever cherishing no resentment against those who had so mercilessly snubbed her but only feeling more intensely than ever that she was unlike the rest of the world and that her fate was to be seen as little as possible and not heard at all chapter ii the time had come round for the great annual examination of the national schools where the young dicki'sons received their education and on the great day itself the children came in at tea time full to overflowing with the results of their efforts and ada elizabeth was full of it too but not to overflowing on the contrary she crept into the kitchen where her father and mother and little two year old miriam commonly called mirry were already seated at the table and put her school bag away in its place with a shamefaced air as if she being an ignominious failure could have no news to bring well exclaimed mrs dicki'son to gerty who threw her hat and bag down and wriggled into her seat with her mouth already open to tell her tale did you get a prize no i didn't mother returned gerty glibly a nasty old crosspatch miss simmonds is she always did hate me and i think she hates me worse than ever now anyway she didn't give me a prize just to show her spite nasty thing mrs dicki'son always declared that her husband was a slow man and he looked up slowly then and fixed his dull eyes upon gerty's flushed face h'm he remarked in a dry tone and then closed his lips tight and helped himself to another slice of bread and butter gerty's flushed face grew a fine scarlet she knew only too well what the h'm and the dry tone and the tightly closed lips meant and made haste to change the subject or at least to turn the interest of the conversation from herself to her sister but our ada elizabeth's got the first prize of all she informed them and in her eagerness to divert her father's slow attention from herself she spoke with such an air of pride in the unlooked for result of the examination that ada elizabeth cast a glance of passionate gratitude towards her and then visibly shrank into herself as if in having won so prominent a place she had done something to make her mother's trials harder to bear than ever and there's going to be a grander treat than we've ever had this year gerty went on in her glibest tones and the dean's lady lady margaret is going to give the prizes away and all the company is going to be at the treat and and oh what a pity exclaimed mrs dicki'son turning a hopeless gaze upon poor ada elizabeth our ada elizabeth 'll never show up properly as you would gerty our ada elizabeth's lesson books 'll show up better than gerty's may be put in mr dicki'son in his quietest tone and with his driest manner oh ada elizabeth's not clever like gerty returned mrs dicki'son utterly ignorant as she was indifferent to the fact that she was rapidly taking all the savour out of the child's hour of triumph and you were so sure of it too gerty so was the hare of winning the race but the tortoise won after all remarked mr dicki'son sententiously what are you talking about father his wife demanded i'm sure if tidy 'air has anything to do with it gerty ought to be at the top of the tree for try as i will i can't make ada elizabeth's 'air ever look aught like wash it and brush it and curl it as ever i will and as for 'air oil mr dicki'son interrupted his wife by a short laugh i didn't mean that at all he knew by long experience that it was useless to try to make her understand what he did mean but now you speak of it perhaps ada elizabeth's 'air don't make so much show as some of the others it's like mine and mine never was up to much not but what there's scarcely enough left to tell what sort it is it was quite a long speech for the unsociable and quiet mr dicki'son to come out with and his wife passed it by without comment only making a fretful reiteration of ada elizabeth's plainness and a complaint of the sorry figure she would cut among the great doings on the day of the school treat and distribution of prizes is our ada elizabeth a plain one said mr dicki'son with an air of astonishment which conveyed a genuine desire for information then turned and scanned the child's burning face after which he looked closely at the faces of the other children so little like hers and so nearly like that of his pretty mindless complaining wife well yes little 'un i suppose you're not exactly pretty he admitted unwillingly you're like me and i never was a beauty to look at but there 'handsome is as handsome does' and you've brought home first prize to day which you wouldn't have done may be if you'd always been on the grin like gerty there seems to me he went on reflectively that that there first prize 'll stand by you when folks has got tired of gerty's grin that's what seems to me i don't know he went on that i set so much store by looks i never was aught but a plain man but i've made you a good husband em'ly and you can't deny it you'll mind that good looking chap joe webster that you kept company with before you took up with me he chucked you up for eliza moriarty well i met her this morning poor soul with two black eyes and her lips strapped up with plaster h'm with a sniff of self approval seems to me i'd not care to change my plain looks for his handsome ones 'handsome is as handsome does' is my motto and if i want aught doing for me it's our ada elizabeth i asks to do it that's all i know the great day of the school treat came and went the dean's wife lady margaret adair gave away the prizes as she had promised and was so struck with our ada elizabeth's timid and shrinking air that she kept her for a few minutes while she told her that she had heard a very good account of her and that she hoped she would go on and work harder than ever for i see said lady margaret looking at a paper in her hand that you are the first in your class for these subjects and that you have carried off the regular attendance and good conduct prize as well i am sure you must be a very good little woman and be a great favourite with your schoolmistress mrs dicki'son who as the mother of the show pupil of the day and as a person of much respectability in the neighbourhood which was not famous for that old fashioned virtue had been given a seat as near as possible to the dais on which lady margaret and the table of prizes were accommodated heard the pleasant words of praise which would have made most mothers' hearts throb with exultant pride with but little of such a feeling on the contrary her whole mind was filled with regret that it was not gerty standing on the edge of the dais instead of the unfortunate ada elizabeth who did not show off well if only it had been gerty gerty would have answered my lady with a pretty blush and smile and would have dropped her courtesy at the right moment and would have been a credit to her mother generally but alas gerty's glib tongue and ready smiles had not won her the prizes which had fallen to poor little plain ada elizabeth's share and gerty was out in the cold so to speak among the other scholars while ada elizabeth in an agony of shyness and confusion stood on the edge of the dais first on one foot and then on the other conscious that her mother's eyes were upon her and that their expression was not an approving one feeling though she would hardly have been able to put it into words that in cutting so sorry a figure she was making her poor mother's trials more hard to bear than ever poor little plain child she kept courtesying up and down like a mechanical doll and saying yes 'm and no 'm at the wrong moments and she altogether forgot that the fresh coloured buxom lady in the neat black gown and with only a bit of blue feather to relieve her black bonnet was not a ma'am at all but a my lady who ought to have been addressed as such at last however the ceremony and the games and sports and the big tea were all over and ada elizabeth went home with her prizes to be a heroine no longer for she soon very soon in the presence of gerty's prettiness and gerty's glib tongue and ready smiles sank into the insignificance which had been her portion aforetime she had not much encouragement to go on trying to be a credit to the family which she had so hardly tried by taking after her father for nobody seemed to remember that she had been at the top of the tree at the great examination or if they did recall it it was generally as an example of the schoolmistress's awkwardness of disposition in having passed over the hare for the tortoise yet sometimes when gerty was extra hard upon ada elizabeth's dulness or mrs dicki'son found the trial of her life more heavy to bear than usual her father would look up from his dinner or his tea as it might happen to be and fix his slow gaze upon his eldest daughter's vivacious countenance h'm our ada elizabeth's too stupid to live is she well you're like to know gerty it was you won three first prizes last half wasn't it a great credit to you to say nought about the 'good conduct and regular attendance' yes you're like to know all about it you are dear me gerty mrs dicki'son would as often as not chime in fretfully having just wit enough to keep on the blind side of father eat your tea and let our ada elizabeth alone do it isn't pretty of you to be always calling her for something our ada elizabeth's plain looking there's no saying aught again' it but stupid she isn't and never was and as father says ''andsome is as 'andsome does' so don't let me hear any more of it and all the time the poor little subject of discussion would sit writhing upon her chair feeling that after all gerty was quite right and that she was not only unfortunately plain to look at but that in spite of the handsome prizes laid out in state on the top of the chest of drawers there was little doubt that she was just too stupid to live chapter iii it was a very mild and damp autumn that year and the autumn was succeeded by an equally mild winter therefore it is not surprising that the truth of the old saying a green christmas makes a fat kirkyard became sadly realized in the neighbourhood of gardener's lane for about the middle of december a dangerous low fever with some leaning towards typhoid broke out in the parish and the men being mostly hard drinkers and the majority of the women idle drabs who did not use half a pound of soap in a month it flew from house to house until half the population was down with it ay and as nearly always happens not only the hard drinkers and the idle drabs were those to suffer but the steady respectable workmen and the good housewives came in for more than their just share of the tribulation also and among others the dicki'son family paid dearly for the sins and shortcomings of their fellow creatures for the first to fall sick was the pretty complaining mother of whom not even her detractors could say other than that she was cleanliness itself in all her ways and it was a very bad case the good parson came down with offers of help and sent in a couple of nurses whom he paid out of his own pocket though if he had but known it he would have done much more wisely to have spent the same amount of money on one with more knowledge of her business and less power of speech and the doctor and his partner came and went with grave and anxious faces which did not say too much for the sick woman's chance of recovery mr dicki'son stayed at home from his work for a whole week and spent his time about equally between anxiously watching his wife's fever flushed face and sitting with his children trying to keep them quiet no easy task let me tell you in a house where every movement could be heard in every corner and as the schools were promptly closed for fear of spreading the epidemic the children were on hand during the whole day and poor little things were as sorely tried by the silence they were compelled to keep as they tried the quiet dull man whose heart was full almost to bursting but he was very patient and good with them and ada elizabeth was his right hand in everything for the first time in her life she forgot her plain looks and her mother's trials and felt that she had been born to some purpose and that purpose a good one and then there came an awful day when the mother's illness was at the worst when the two nurses stood one on each side of the bed and freely discussed her state in utter indifference to the husband standing miserably by with gerty's little sharp face peeping from behind him eh pore thing i'm sure with a sniff and a sob it is 'ard at 'er age to go i' this way pore thing it is 'ard which ring did you say gerty was to 'ave love bending down over the sick woman who was just conscious enough to know that some one was speaking to her the keeper yes love i'll see to it and which is for ada elizabeth her breathing's getting much harder put in the woman on the other side it won't be long now t' doctor said there was a chance with care but i know better i've seen so many and if it's the lord's will to take her he'll take her we may do all we can but it's no use for i've seen so many mr dicki'son gave a smothered groan and turning sharply round went out of the room and down the narrow creaking stairs with a great lump in his throat and a thick mist in front of his eyes a fretful wail from little mirry had fallen upon his ear and he found her sobbing piteously while ada elizabeth tried in vain to pacify her she was more quiet when she found herself in his arms and then he noticed with a sudden and awful fear knocking at his heart that there was something wrong with his right hand ada elizabeth that she looked fagged and white and that there was a brilliancy in her dull grey eyes such as he had never seen there before ada elizabeth what ails you he asked anxiously illustration ada elizabeth what ails you he asked anxiously nought father i'm a bit tired that's all she answered pushing her heavy hair away from her forehead mirry was awake all night nearly and i couldn't keep her quiet hardly mr dicki'son looked closely at mirry but though the child was evidently heavy and inclined to be fretful there was not the same glitter in her eyes as there was in her sister's here gerty he said nurse mirry a bit i want to go upstairs for a minute can't ada elizabeth have her asked gerty who always wanted to be in the sick room so that she might know the latest news of her mother and be to the front whoever came for in those dark days between the rector and the doctors and the neighbours who came in and out there were a good many visitors to the little house our ada elizabeth always keeps mirry quiet better than i can father do as i bid you returned mr dicki'son sharply and thus rebuked gerty sat crossly down and bumped little mirry on to her knee with a burst of temper which set the child wailing again mr dicki'son had already reached the sick room where the nurses were still standing over his half unconscious wife's bed i want you a minute missus he said to the one who had been so anxious concerning the disposal of mrs dicki'son's few bits of jewellery just come downstairs a minute the woman followed him wondering what he could want just look at this little lass he said taking ada elizabeth by the hand and leading her to the window do you think there is aught amiss with her there is little or no reserve among the poor they speak their minds and they tell ill news with a terrible bluntness which is simply appalling to those of a higher station and this woman did not hesitate to say what she thought notwithstanding the fact that she knew that the man was utterly overwrought and that the child's fever bright eyes were fixed earnestly upon her mr dicki'son she cried i'll not deceive you no some folks would tell you as nought ailed but not me wi' her pore mother dying upstairs i couldn't find it in my 'eart to do it i couldn't indeed pore ada elizabeth's took and you'd better run round to widow martin's and see if t' doctor's been there this morning he telled me i might send there for him up to one o'clock and it's only ten minutes past ada elizabeth lie down on t' sofa honey and keep yourself quiet gerty can't you keep mirry at t' window ada elizabeth's took with the fever and can't bear being tewed about wi' her mr dicki'son was off after the doctor like a shot and less than a quarter of an hour brought him back to see if the nurse's fiat was a true one alas it proved to be too true and the kind hearted doctor drew the grief stricken man on one side look here dicki'son he said your wife is very ill indeed it's no use my deceiving you her life hangs on a thread and it will be only by the greatest care if she is pulled through this the child has undoubtedly got the fever upon her and she cannot have the attention she ought to have here there is not room enough nor quiet enough and there's nobody to attend to her get her off to the hospital at once the hospital repeated mr dicki'son blankly he had all the horror of a hospital that so many of his class have it's the child's best chance answered the doctor of course it may turn out only a mild attack all the better that she should be in the hospital in any case in fact i wish your wife was there this minute doctor said mr dicki'son hoarsely i don't like my little lass going to the hospital i don't like it but there is no help for it and she'll be far better off there than she would be at home the doctor answered but all the same they'd better not talk about it before your wife even when she is delirious or half unconscious she knows a good deal of what's going on about her i'll step up and have a look at her and will speak to the women myself before a couple of hours were over ada elizabeth was comfortably in bed in the quiet and shady ward of the well managed hospital and in the little house in gardener's lane the struggle between life and death went on while gerty had to devote herself as best she could to the children gerty felt that it was desperately hard upon her for mirry and six year old georgie fretted without ceasing for our ada elizabeth and would not be comforted not all the same that gerty's ideas of comfort were very soothing ones a bump and a shake and divers threatenings of bogle bo and a black man who came down chimneys to carry naughty children away being about her form and little mirry and georgie found it but a poor substitute for the tender if dull patience of our ada elizabeth however in spite of all the very real drawbacks which she had to fight against mrs dicki'son did not die slowly and painfully she struggled back to her own senses again with a dim realization of how very near the gate of death she had wandered but alas by the time the doctor had with a kindly pat upon his shoulder told mr dicki'son that his wife would live if no very serious relapse took place the fever had fastened on another victim and little mirry was tossing to and fro with fever flushed face and the same unnatural brilliancy in her bonny blue eyes as had lighted up ada elizabeth's dull grey ones they had not taken her to the hospital it was so full that only urgent cases were admitted now and since the mother was on the road to recovery there was time to attend to the child and so she lay in the next room to her mother whose weakened senses gradually awoke to the knowledge of what was going on about her is that mirry crying she asked on the morning when the child was at its worst now don't you fret yourself love returned the nurse evasively t' bairn's being took care of right enough they will cry a bit sometimes you know and then she shut the door and the mother dozed off to sleep again but in the evening the pitiful wail reached her ears again i want our ada 'liz'bet' the child's fretful voice cried mirry do want our ada 'liz'bet' so bad a ly me want our ada 'liz'bet' mrs dicki'son started nervously and tried to lift herself in her bed i'm sure mirry's ill she gasped mrs barker don't deceive me tell me is she ill well my dear i won't deceive yer the nurse answered poor little mirry's been took with the fever yes but don't you go and fret yourself mrs bell's waiting of her and she wants for nought and t' doctor says it's only a mild attack only children runs up and down so quick and she's a bit more fretful than usual to night that's all mirry do want our ada 'liz'bet' wailed the sick child in the next room mrs dicki'son turned her head weakly from side to side and trembled in every limb why can't ada elizabeth go to her she burst out at last the nurse coughed awkwardly well my dear she began poor ada elizabeth isn't 'ere isn't 'ere repeated mrs dicki'son wildly and just then her husband walked into the room and up to the bedside she clutched hold of him with frantic eagerness father she cried hysterically is it true our mirry's took with the fever yes em'ly but it's a very mild case he answered feeling that it was best in her excited and nervous condition to tell her the exact truth at once she's fretty to night but she's not so ill that you need worry about her she's being took every care of but she's crying for our ada elizabeth mrs dicki'son persisted hark there she is again why can't ada elizabeth be quick and go to her where is she what does mrs barker mean by saying she isn't 'ere mr dicki'son cast a wrathful glance at the nurse but he did not attempt to hide from his wife any longer the fact that ada elizabeth was not in the house you know you was very ill em'ly a bit back he said with an air and tone of humble apology and our ada elizabeth was taken with the fever just the day you was at the worst and there was no one to wait on her and the doctor would have her go to the hospital and what was i to do em'ly it went against my very heart to let the little lass go but she was willing and you was taking all our time i was very near beside myself em'ly i was or i'd never have consented mrs dicki'son lay for some minutes in silence exhausted by the violence of her agitation then the fretful wail in the adjoining room broke the stillness again i do want our ada 'liz'bet' the child cried piteously mrs dicki'son burst out into passionate sobbing i lie 'ere and i can't lift my finger for 'er she gasped out and and it was just like ada elizabeth to go and get the fever when she was most wanted she always was the contrariest child that i had always mr dicki'son drew his breath sharply as if some one had struck him in the face but with an effort he pulled himself together and answered her gently nay wife emily don't say that the little lass held up until she couldn't hold up no longer i'll go and quiet mirry she's always quiet enough with me keep yourself still and i'll stop with the bairn until she's asleep and then he bent and kissed her forehead and passed softly out of the room only whispering not one word to the nurse as he passed her but dear heaven how that man's heart ached as he sat soothing his little fever flushed child into quietness i said but now that he drew his breath sharply as if some one had struck him in the face alas it was worse than that for the wife of his bosom the mother of his children had struck him stabbed him to the lowest depths of his heart by her querulous complaint against the child who had gone from him only a few hours before on whose little white plain face he had just looked for the last time and on which his scalding tears had fallen for he knew that plain and dull and unobtrusive as she had always been the butt of her sister's sharp tongue the trial of his wife's whole existence he knew that with the closing of the heavy eyes the brightest light of his life had gone out and little mirry wrapped in a blanket lay upon his breast soothed into slumber did something fall from his eyes upon her face that she started and looked up at him she must have mistaken the one plain face for the other for she put up her little hot hand and stroked his cheek you tum back ada 'liz'bet' she murmured as she sank off to sleep again mirry did want you so bad a ly the sick child's tender words took away half the bitterness of the sting which his wife had thrust into his heart and his whole soul seemed to overflow with a great gush of love as he swayed her gently to and fro she had loved the unattractive face and missed it bitterly she had wearied for the rare patient smile and the slow gentle voice and to mr dicki'son's dull mind the child's craving had bound ada elizabeth's heavy brows with a crown of pure gold with the truest proof that affection never was wasted illustration you tum back ada 'liz'bet' she murmured halt halt who goes there cried a man's voice through the thick gloom of the dark night there was no answer save silence and after listening for a moment private flinders turned and began to tramp once more along the ten paces which extended from his sentry box i could have sworn i heard a footstep he said to himself it's curious how one's ears deceive one on a night like this ten paces one way ten paces the other turn and back again and begin your ten paces over again yes it is monotonous there is no doubt of that but it is the bounden duty of a sentry unless he happens to prefer standing still in his box getting stiff and chill and perhaps running the risk of being caught asleep at his post no light offence in a barrack i can tell you ten paces one way ten paces the other a rustling a mere movement such as would scarcely have attracted the attention of most people but which caught private flinders' sharp ears and brought him up to a standstill again in an attitude of strict watchfulness halt who goes there he cried again and listened once more again silence met him and again he stood alert and suspicious waiting for the reply friend by gum this is queer he thought as he stood listening i'll search to the bottom of it though i daresay it's only some of the chaps getting at me but i'll be even with 'em if it is he groped about in rather an aimless sort of way for the night was black as pitch and his eyes though they had grown used to the inky want of light could distinguish nothing of his surroundings now where are you you beggar he remarked beginning to lose his habitual serenity and laying about him with his carbine after a stroke or two the weapon touched something though not heavily and a howl followed a howl which was unmistakably that of a small child it conveyed both fear and bodily pain private flinders followed up the howl by feeling cautiously in the part whence the sounds had come his hand closed upon something soft and shrinking and the howls were redoubled hollo what the deuce are you he exclaimed drawing the shrieking captive nearer to him why i'm blessed if it ain't a kid and a girl too well i'm blowed and where did you happen to come from the howl by this time had developed into a faint sniffing for private flinders' voice was neither harsh nor forbidding but the creature did not venture on speech where did you come from and what are you doing here he asked do you belong to the barricks and has your mammy been wollopping of you or did you stray in from outside lost my mammy the small creature burst out finding that she was expected to say something what's your mammy's name flinders asked mammy of course was the reply and what's your name susy susy aye but susy what susy repeated the little person beginning to whimper again where do you live at home said susy in an insulted tone as if all these questions were quite superfluous well blest if i know what to do with you said flinders pushing his busby on one side and scratching his head vigorously i don't believe you belong to the barricks your speech haven't got the twang of it and if you've strayed in from outside gord knows what 'll become of you certain it is that you won't be let to stop here susy so cold whimpered the mite pitifully i should think you was cold returned private flinders sympathetically i'm none too warm myself and the fog seems to fair eat into one's bones well little 'un i can't carry you back to where you came from that's very certain i can't even take you round to the guard room now what the deuce am i to do with you and i shan't be relieved for over a hour private flinders being one of the most good natured men in creation it ended by his gathering the child in his arms and carrying her up and down on his beat until the relief came why what's the meaning of this demanded the corporal of the guard when he perceived the unusual encumbrance to the private's movements ah corporal that's more than i can tell you responded the other promptly this here kid toddled along over a hour ago and as she don't seem to know what her name is or where she come from i just walked about with her that she mightn't be froze to death i suppose we'd best carry her to the guard room fire and keep her warm till morning and then asked the corporal with a twinkle in his eye which the dark night effectually hid gord knows was the private's quick reply eventually the mite who rejoiced in the name of susy and did not know whence she had come or whither she was going was carried off to the guard room and made as comfortable as circumstances would permit that being the only course indeed at that hour of the night or to be quite correct of the morning which could with reason be followed she slept as healthy children do like a top or dog and when she awoke in the morning she expressed no fear or very much surprise and having enquired in a casual kind of way for her mammy she partook of a very good breakfast of bread and milk followed by a drink of coffee and a taste or two of such other provisions as were going round later on private flinders was sent for to the orderly room and told to give the commanding officer such information as he was in possession of concerning the stray mite who was still in the warm guard room now it happened that the commanding officer of the th hussars was a gentleman to whom routine was a religion and discipline a salvation and he expressed himself sharply enough as to the only course which could possibly be pursued under the present circumstances we had better send down to the workhouse people to come and remove the child at once otherwise we may have endless trouble with the mother and moreover if it once got about that these barracks were open to that kind of thing the regiment would soon be turned into a regular foundling hospital let the workhouse people be sent for at once what did you say mr jervis that the child might be quartered for a few hours among the married people yes i daresay but if the mother is on the look out which is very doubtful she is more likely to go to the police station than she is to come here as to any stigma the mother should have borne that in mind when she lost the child on second thoughts i think it is to the police station that we should send yes that will be quite the best thing to do a few hours later the child susy was transferred from the guard room to the police station and there she made herself equally at home only asking occasionally in a perfunctory kind of way for mammy and being quite easily satisfied when she was told that she would be coming along by and by during the few hours that she was at the police station she became quite a favourite and made friends with all the stalwart constables just as she had done with one and all of the strapping hussars at the cavalry barracks she was not shy for she answered the magistrate in quite a friendly way though she gave no information as to her belongings simply because she had no information to give and the end was that she was condemned to the workhouse and was carried off to that undesirable haven as soon as the interview with the magistrate was over a blooming shame i call it poor little kid said private flinders that evening to a group of his friends in the comfortable safety of the troop room she was a jolly little lass and if i'd been a married man i'd have kept her myself dashed if i wouldn't perhaps your missis might 'ave 'ad a word or two to say to that flinders cried a natty fellow just up to the standard in height and no more oh i'd have made it all right with her returned flinders with that easy assurance of everything good that want of experience gives but to send it to the workhouse it's a blooming shame they treat kids anyhow in them places now then thomson what are you a grinning at perhaps you know as much about workhouses as i can tell you perhaps i do and perhaps i don't replied thomson with provoking good temper i wasn't a laughing at the workhouse cussing them is more like what one feels but to think of you old chap tramping up and down with the blessed kid asleep well it beats everything i ever heard tell of blame me if it don't private flinders however was not to be laughed out of his interest in the little child susy and regularly every week he walked down to the workhouse and asked to see her taking always a few sweeties bought out of his scanty pay the cost of which meant his going without some small luxury for himself and susy who was miserably unhappy in that abode of sorrow which we provide in this country for the destitute grew to look eagerly for his visits and sobbed out all her little troubles and trials to his sympathetic ears susy don't like her she confided to him one day when the matron had left them alone together she slaps me susy don't love her but susy will learn to be a good girl and not get slapped the soldier said with something suspiciously like a lump in his throat see i've brought you some lollipops you'll like them won't you he happened to run up against the matron as he walked away toward the door she's a tender little thing missis he remarked with a vague kind of notion that even workhouse matrons have hearts sometimes and so some of them have though not many this particular one was among the many illustration she's a tender little thing missis he remarked a very self willed child she remarked sharply considering that she's so young we have a great deal of trouble with her she does not seem to know the meaning of the word obedience she is but a baby ventured the soldier apologetically baby or no baby she'll have to learn it here snapped the matron viciously and then flinders went on his way feeling sadder than ever and yet more and more regretful that he was not married or had at least a mother in a position to adopt a little child the next time he went they had cut the child's lovely long curling locks indeed she had been shorn like a sheep in spring time flinders' soft heart gave a great throb and he cuddled the mite to his broad breast as if by so doing he could undo the indignity that had been put upon her susy he said when he had handed over his sweets and she was busily munching them up i want you to try and remember something susy looked at him doubtfully but nodded her cropped head with an air of wise acquiescence flinders went on talking quietly you remember before you came here you had a home and a mammy don't you yes said susy promptly what sort of a house was it where my mammy was she asked yes big replied susy briefly selecting another sweetie with care and what was it called the house said the child in a matter of fact tone flinders gave a sigh yes i dare say it was don't you remember though what your mammy was called why mammy of course said susy as if the question was too utterly foolish for serious consideration yes but other people didn't call her mammy it was only you did that said flinders desperately what did other people call her can't you remember that it happened that susy not only remembered but immediately gave utterance to her recollections in such a way as fairly made the soldier jump they called my mammy 'my lady' she said simply private flinders gave the child a great hug and put her down off his knee gord bless you little 'un he ejaculated and see if i don't ferret that mammy of yours out before i'm many days older see if i don't he met the matron as he went towards the entrance missis he said stopping i've got a clue to that little 'un's belongings i'm off to the police station now about it i'd advise you to treat her as tender as you can it'll come home to you mark my words dear me snapped the matron is she going to turn out a princess in disguise then it'll perhaps turn out a pity you was in such a hurry to crop her hair said private flinders with dignity in the face of that sudden recollection of the child's he felt that he could afford to be to a certain extent stand offish to the cold eyed unloving woman before him oh rules are rules said the matron with an air of fine disdain and in an institution like ours all must be served alike it would be a pretty thing if we had to spend half of every day curling the children's hair good day to you he felt that he had got the worst of it and that it was more than possible that little susy would pay the penalty of his indiscretion fool that he had been not to hold his tongue until he had something more tangible to say well it was done now and could not be undone and it behoved him to lose no time but to find out the truth as soon as possible the inspector whom he found in charge of the police station listened to his tale with a strictly professional demeanour yes i remember the little girl coming in and being taken to the workhouse i remember the case right enough you'd better leave it to us and we will find out whether such a child is missing anywhere in the country i need hardly say that in private flinders' mind there lurked that deep rooted distrust of a policeman that lives somewhere or other in the heart of every soldier it came uppermost in his mind at that moment you'll do your best he said a little wistfully you'll not let time go by and and we shall be in communication with every police station in the kingdom in a few hours returned the inspector who knew pretty well what was passing in the soldier's mind but all the same you mustn't be over much disappointed if there proves to be nothing in it you see if such a child was being inquired for we should have heard of it before this however we'll do our best you may be very sure of that with that private flinders was obliged to rest content he made inquiries from day to day and eventually this advertisement appeared in the leading daily papers to parents and guardians a little girl apparently about three years old is in charge of the police at bridbrook she says her name is susy and appears to be the child of well to do parents very fair hair blue eyes features small and pretty clothes very good but much soiled address police station bridbrook a few hours after the appearance of the advertisement a telegram arrived at the police station keep child will come as soon as possible jackson less than three hours afterwards an excited woman rushed into the station having precipitated herself out of a cab and almost flung herself upon the astonished inspector i've come for the child the little girl she gasped as if she had run at racing speed direct from the place indicated by the telegram oh she belongs to you does she remarked the inspector coolly well you've no call to be in such a 'urry you've been very comfortable about her for the last six weeks comfortable echoed the excited one why i've been very near out of my mind i thought she was drowned and i was so frightened i daren't say a word to any one about it and my lady away then you're not the mother said the inspector sharply the mother my goodness no i'm the head nurse my young lady's mother is the countess of morecambe then what does she say to all this pray he asked my lady went abroad two months ago to one of those foreign cure places and she doesn't know but what lady susy is safe with me at this minute the woman replied the inspector gave a prolonged whistle well you're a pretty sort of nurse to leave in charge of a child he remarked i shouldn't wonder if you get the sack for this do you know the child's at the workhouse and that they've cropped her head as bare as mine at this the woman simply sat down and sobbed aloud aye you may well cry said the inspector grimly i should if i was in your shoes she finally told how the child had been missed how she had refrained from giving notice to the police through fear of publicity and believing she could find her by diligent search in the locality how my lady was a widow with only this one little child how she had been advised to go for this cure how she had consented to the nurse taking lady susy to the seaside meantime well knowing that she would be safe and happy with her yes you may laugh at that she wound up but my dear lamb has often called me 'mammy' as anything else and my lady has often said she was quite jealous of me all the same i shouldn't wonder if you get the sack repeated the inspector who was not troubled with much sentiment i scarcely know how to tell the rest how jackson went off to the workhouse and enlightened the matron and others as to the child's station in life how she seized her little ladyship and almost smothered her with kisses how she bewailed her shorn locks and wondered and conjectured as to how she could possibly have got to a place so far from her home as bridbrook but a few weeks later a lovely woman in mourning came to the cavalry barracks and inquired for private flinders she wept during the interview this lovely lady and when she had gone away private flinders opened the packet she had put into his hands to find a cheque for a hundred pounds and a handsome gold watch and chain and at the end of the chain was a plain gold locket on one side of which was engraved private flinders' initials whilst on the other was written the single word halt the little lady with the voice a fairy tale marjory drummond was sitting on the bank of the river and if the whole truth must be owned she was crying she was not crying loudly or passionately but as she rested her cheek on her hand the sad salt tears slowly gathered in her eyes and brimmed over one by one falling each with a separate splash upon the blue cotton gown which she wore illustration the sad salt tears slowly gathered in her eyes the sun was shining high in the blue heavens the river danced and sang merrily as it went rippling by and all the hedgerows were alive with flowers and the air was full of the scent of the new cut hay yet marjory was very miserable and for her the skies looked dark and dull the river only gave her even sadder thoughts than she already had and the new cut hay seemed quite scentless and dead and all because a man had failed her a man had proved to be clay instead of gold and so she sat there in the gay summer sunshine and wished that she had never been born or that she were dead or some such folly and the butterflies fluttered about and the bees hummed and all nature excepting herself seemed to be radiant and joyous an old water vole came out of his hiding place by the river and watched her with a wise air and a dragon fly whizzed past and hovered over the surface of the sunlit water but marjory's eyes were blind to each and all of these things and still the tears welled up and overflowed their bounds and she wept on what is the matter said a voice just at her ear marjory gave a jump and dashed her tears away it was one thing to indulge herself in her grief but it was quite another to let any one else and that a stranger see her what is wrong with you marjory said the voice once more nothing answered marjory shortly i may perhaps be able to help you the gentle little voice persisted nobody can help me said marjory with a great sigh nobody can help me nobody don't be so sure of that said the voice why do you keep this curl of hair why do you turn so persistently away from me why don't you look at me marjory turned her head but she could see no one near who are you why do you hide she asked in turn you look too high said the voice look lower yes ah how d'you do marjory almost jumped into the river in her fright for there standing under the shade of a big dandelion was the smallest being she had ever seen in her life yet as she sat staring at her this tiny woman seemed to increase in size and to assume a shape which was somehow familiar to her you know me now asked the little woman smiling at her again n o replied marjory stammering a little oh yes you do you remember the old woman whose part you took a few weeks ago down by the old church when some boys were teasing her well that was me me and now i'm going to do something for you i am going to make you happy are you a witch asked marjory in a very awed voice hu sh sh we never use such an uncomplimentary word in our world but you poor mortals are often very rude even without knowing it i am not what is called a witch young lady i am a familiar marjory's eyes opened wider than ever she bent forward and asked an earnest question are you my familiar she said perhaps perhaps answered the little woman nodding her head wisely that all depends on yourself if you are good yes if you are bad no most emphatically no i am much too important a person to be familiar to worthless people i'm sure you are very kind said marjory meekly but what will you do to make me happy you cannot give me back my jack because he has married some one else the wretch she added under her breath but the ejaculation was for the woman whom jack had married not for jack himself you will learn to live without your jack as you call him said the little woman with the soft voice sagely and to feel thankful that he chose elsewhere you once did me a service and that is a thing that a familiar never never forgets i have been watching you ever since that time and now i will reward you marjory drummond from this time henceforth everything shall prosper with you everything you touch shall turn to gold everything you wish shall come to pass what you strive after you shall have your greatest desires shall be realised and you shall have power to draw tears from all eyes whenever you choose this last i give you in compensation for the tears that you have shed this day farewell stay cried marjory won't you even tell me your name may i not thank you no the thanks are mine said the little lady when we meet again i will tell you my name not before in a moment she was gone and so quickly and mysteriously did she go that marjory did not see her disappear she rubbed her eyes and looked round i must have been asleep she exclaimed i must have dreamt it several years had gone by with marjory drummond everything had prospered and she was on the high road to success and fame and fortune whenever her name was spoken people nodded their heads wisely and said a wonderful girl nothing she cannot do and they mostly said it as if each one of them had had a hand in making her the clever girl that she was as an artist she was extremely gifted being well hung in the academy of the year as an actress though only playing with that form of art she was hard to beat and she had written stories and tales which were so infinitely above the average that editors were one and all delighted at any time to have the chance of a story signed with the initials md initials which the world thought and declared were those of one of the most fashionable doctors of the day and at last the world of letters woke up and rubbed its eyes very much as marjory had rubbed her eyes that day on the river's bank and the world said we have a great and gifted man among us 'md' is the writer of the time and slowly little by little the secret crept out and marjory was feted and flattered and made the star of the season her name was in every one's mouth and her work was sought after eagerly and read by all and among those who worshipped at her shrine was the jack who had flouted her in the old days yet not quite the same but a jack very much altered and world worn so that marjory could no longer regret or wish that the lines of her life had fallen otherwise than they had done and often and often as the years rolled by and she was still the darling star of the people who love to live in the realms of fiction did marjory ponder over that vivid dream by the riverside and try to satisfy herself that it really was no more than a dream and that the old lady with the sweet clear voice had had no being except in her excited brain i wish she said aloud one day when she was sitting by the fire after finishing the most important work that had ever yet come from her pen i wish that she would come back and satisfy me about it it seemed so real so vivid so distinct and yet it is so impossible not impossible at all said a familiar voice at her elbow marjory looked round with a start oh is it you she cried then it was all true i have never been able to make up my mind whether it was true or only a dream now i know that it was quite real and everything that you promised me has come about i am the happiest woman in all the world to day and dear friend if ever i did a service to you you have amply repaid me we never stint thanks in our world said the little old lady smiling then there is nothing more that you want yes kind friend just one thing said marjory you promised me that when we met again you would tell me your name the little woman melted away instantly but somewhere out of the shadows came a small sweet sighing voice which said softly my name is genius jewels to wear torches are made to burn jewels to wear shakespeare chapter i i can't think nancy why you cannot get something useful to occupy yourself with it seems to me that i have slaved and sacrificed myself all my life in every possible direction simply that you may waste your whole time spoiling good paper scribbling scribbling scribbling from morning till night with your fingers inky and your thoughts in the clouds and your attention on nothing that i want you to attend to i don't call it a good reward to make to me you will never do any good with that ridiculous scribbling never when i think of what you might save me of how you might spare me in my anxious and busy life it makes me positively ill to think i am your mother here have i been thinking of you nancy and working for you and struggling and fighting and slaving for you for twenty years and now that the time has come when you might do something for me you have only one idea in your head and that is writing rubbishy stories that nobody will ever want to buy illustration you have only one idea in your head and that is writing rubbishy stories that nobody will ever want to buy the girl thus addressed turned and looked at her mother mother dear she said depreciatingly i am sorry that i am not more useful i can't help it i do think of you i try to do everything i can to relieve you and help you but these stories will come into my head they won't be put out of it what am i to do what are you to do echoed the mother why look at that basket of stockings to darn i am quite willing to darn them said nancy meekly yes you are quite willing i daresay you are quite willing when i tell you but you don't seem to see what a burden it is to me to have to tell you everything as if you were a baby there are the stockings and there are you at your age you don't surely need me to tell you that the stockings need mending i will do them at once said nancy i will do them this minute yes with your thoughts in the clouds and your mind fixed on scribbling what may i ask you nancy do you think you will ever do with it i don't know said nancy desperately perhaps i may make some money some day never never waste it you mean waste it over pens ink paper and tablecloths there is the tablecloth in your bedroom spotted with ink from end to end it is heart breaking well mother what do you wish me to do the girl asked in desperation your plain and simple duty i would like you to give up all idea of wasting your time in that way from now on said the mother deliberately won't you even let me write a little to amuse myself in my spare time asked the girl piteously your spare time echoed the mother impatiently what spare time have poor people such as we are what spare time have i here are we with this great boarding house on our hands twenty three boarders to be made comfortable kept in good temper fed housed boarded everything to be done for them and i have to do it why in the time that you waste over those stories you might make yourself a brilliant pianist and play in the evening to them then you would be of some use i don't think said nancy that anything will ever make me a brilliant pianist mother there's no music in me not of that kind and i don't think that the boarders would like me half as well if i went and strummed on the drawing room piano every evening for an hour or two i really don't mother no you know better than i do of course that is the way with the young people of the present day you are all alike ah it was different when i was a girl i would no more have dreamed of defying my mother as you defy me mother i don't defy you nancy broke in indignantly i never defied you in my life i never thought of such a thing don't you write stories in defiance of my wishes mrs macdonald asked dropping the tragedy air and putting the question in a plain every day businesslike tone at this nancy macdonald flushed a deep full red a blush of shame it was or what felt like shame and as it slowly faded away until her face was a dull greyish white all hope for that gift which was as the very mainspring of her life seemed to shrink and die within her mother she said at last in a firm tone i will do what you wish i will give up writing i promise you from this time forward and i will not write at all while i have any duty left in the day you will not mind my doing a little when i have seen the after dinner coffee served will you that means i suppose said mrs macdonald rather tartly that you will sit up half the night ruining your health spoiling your eyesight wasting my gas and making it perfectly impossible that you should get up in good time in the morning mother said the girl in a most piteous tone when i am once late in the morning i will promise you to give it up altogether and for ever more than that i cannot say as you said just now it is a hard life here and we have not very much leisure time but i implore you do not take my one delight and pleasure from me altogether if you put it in that way said mrs macdonald rather grudgingly of course we can but try the experiment but what good i ask you nancy do you think will ever come of it i don't know said nancy i can't say other people have made fortunes other people have done well by writing why should not i as if you would ever make a fortune said mrs macdonald with the contemptuousness of a woman to whom the struggle of life had been hard and to whom pounds shillings and pence in the very hand were the only proofs of reason for what she called wasting time over story writing well if not a fortune at least a comfortable income said nancy eagerly and if i did mother i should give it all to you thank you for nothing my dear was the ungracious reply to this nancy made no answer she carried the big basket of stockings to the window and sat down in the cold winter light to do such repairs as were necessary poor child it was a hard fate for her she was the eldest of a family of five all dependent on the exertions of her widowed mother in keeping afloat the big boarding house by which they lived for a boarding house be it ever so liberally managed be the receipts ever so generous is but a sordid abode especially to those who have the trouble and care of managing it and to an eldest daughter and one who stands between the anxious mother and the younger children who mostly resemble young rooks with mouths chronically open such a life appears perhaps more sordid than it does to any one else to nancy macdonald with her mind full of visionary beauty and living daily in a world of her own not a world of boarding houses the life they lived seemed even more sordid more trivial more petty than it was in reality her wants were not many she was never inclined to rail at fate because she had not been born with a silver spoon in her mouth not at all but if only she could have a quiet home with an assured income just sufficient to cover their modest wants to provide good wholesome food to buy boots and shoes for the little ones to pay the wages of a good servant to take those lines of anxious care from her mother's forehead so that she could employ her leisure in cultivating her art she always called it her art poor child she would have been perfectly happy or she thought she would have been perfectly happy which in the main amounted to the same thing as she sat in the cold light of that winter's afternoon darning as if for dear life the great pile of stockings which were her portion she soon drifted away from the tall bloomsbury dwelling into a bright brilliant land of romance where there were no troubles no cares where nothing was sordid and everything was bright and rosy and even troubles and worries might have been adequately described as double water gilt young writers do indulge in these blessed dreams of fancy and nancy remember was only twenty her heroines were always lovely always extravagantly rich or picturesquely poor her heroes were all lithe and long and most of them had tawny moustaches and violet eyes like a girl's they were all guardsmen or noblemen they knew not the want of money if they were called poor they went everywhere in hansoms and had valets and gambling debts it was an ideal world and nancy macdonald was very happy in it from that time forward a new life began for the girl the household certainly went more smoothly because of that promise to her mother and mrs macdonald's sharp tongue whetted itself on other grievances more frequently than on that old one about nancy's scribbling propensities it was irritating to nancy of course to hear her mother continually nagging about something or other but then as she reminded herself very often during the day her mother had great anxieties and grievous worries she was a sort of double distilled martha careful and troubled not about many things but about everything everything that did happen or might happen even what could happen under given circumstances which might and probably never would occur still it was not so trying to bear when the shafts of sarcasm and complaining were aimed at others instead of herself and to do nancy strict justice she did try honestly to do the work which lay to her hand in the midst of the multitudinous cares of the large household it must be owned that the girl's writing suffered it is all very well for a girl in fiction to do scullery work all day long and write the brilliant novel of a season in odd moments in a cold and cheerless bedroom but in real life it is very different nancy macdonald gave her attention to stockings and table linen and shopping and ordering and dusting to keeping boarders in good temper and making herself generally useful to superintending the education and manners of the little ones to smoothing down the rough edges of her mother's chronic asperity in short to being a real help but her much loved work practically went to the wall she dreamed a good deal while she was doing other things but mere dreaming is not of much help towards making name or fortune work is the only road which leads to either still you cannot do your duty without improving your character and nancy macdonald's character was strengthening and softening every day she worked a little at night but often she was far too tired and weary to attempt it very often when she did so she found that the words would not run the incidents would not connect themselves and frequently that her eyes would not keep open and then i am obliged to say that it was not an uncommon thing for nancy macdonald to get into bed and cry herself to sleep still her character was strengthening with every day that went by she learnt more of the power of endurance she became more patient more fixed in her ideas the goal of her desires was set more immediately in front of her it was less visionary but it was infinitely more substantial in a desultory kind of a way she still worked still wrote of lords and ladies whom she did not know in the flesh still drew pictures of guardsmen with longer legs and tawnier moustaches even than before she spent the whole of her pocket money which by the bye consisted of certain perquisites in the house the medicine bottles and the dripping forming her chief sources of income on manuscript paper and was sometimes hard pushed to pay the postage on the mysterious packages which she smuggled into the post office and to provide the stamps for paying the return fare of these children of her fancy poor things they always required it no enterprising editors wanted the long legged guardsmen their blue eyes and tawny moustaches notwithstanding nobody had a welcome for the lovely ladies who were all dressed by worth though they never seemed to have heard of such a person as felix the disappointments of their continued return were very bitter to her yet at heart nancy macdonald was a true artist and had all the true artist's pluck and perseverance so that she never thought of giving up her work it was only that she had not yet found her metier chapter ii for about six months after nancy's promise to her mother that she would not even try to write during the working hours life went fairly prosperously with the widowed boarding house keeper then a spell of bad luck set in several boarders left and were not replaced their best paying permanent boarder a rich old gentleman the head of a large business in the city died suddenly died without a will although he had several times spoken of his intention of leaving mrs macdonald a handsome legacy and his next of kin did not seem to think it necessary to do more than pay the actual expenses which their relative had incurred twice they had visitors who left without paying their bills and as a last crowning act of ill luck the youngest child fell sick and the doctor pronounced the illness to be scarlet fever when troubles come they come not single spies but in battalions and that is as true to day as when shakespeare penned the lines more than three hundred years ago mrs macdonald was almost beside herself she ceased to gird at any member of the family or household she girded at fate instead morning noon and night she discussed the situation in a frenzied manner with tears in her eyes and a large amount of gesticulation which would have formed an excellent object lesson to a student for the stage but at the same time it must be owned that raving appeals to the almighty passionate assertions that she was the most unlucky woman that the light of day had ever shone upon bitter forebodings of what her daily life would be like when she was safely landed in the nearest workhouse did not avail anything no the macdonald family was in for a spell of bad luck and all the asseverations in the world would not alter it or gainsay it at this time nancy was like a rock in the midst of a stormy sea she after much self communing threw over her promise to her mother concerning the time of her writing she felt as every true artist feels that it was in her to do great things and that even a little money earned in such a crisis would be of double value so every moment that she could steal from the now greatly decreased house duties she spent in her own room working with feverish haste and anxiety at a new story a story which was not about lords and ladies or majestic guardsmen or lovely heroines in costly parisian dresses no she felt all in a moment the utter futility of trying to draw a phase of life with which she herself was not familiar it seemed to come to her like a flash of light that her children of pen and ink were not real that she was fighting the air that she was like an artist drawing without a model like a living human voice a warning came into her mind write what you know write what you see before all things be an impressionist so her new child was slowly coming to life a child born in poverty and reared in a boarding house the form of the child was crude and was the work of an unpractised hand but it was strong it was full of life it was a thing alive and as line after line came from under her hand as the story assumed shape and colour from under her nervous fingers nancy macdonald felt that she was on the right tack at last that this time she would not fail as soon as her story was done she sent it with breathless hope to a well known weekly magazine which is almost a household word and then she sat down to wait oh but it is weary waiting under such circumstances after three days of sickening suspense nancy decided in her own mind that if she had to wait as many weeks she would be raving mad at the end of them so she locked herself in her room and began another story the story of a love affair which came about in just such a house as their own meantime it can scarcely be said that the macdonald fortunes improved it is true that the fever stricken child recovered and was sent away to a superior convalescent home at the seaside it is true that one or two fresh boarders came and that there were hopes that the family would be able to weather the storm supposing that is that they were able to tide over the next few months still in london it is not easy to tide over a few months when your resources have been drained and your income has been sorely diminished there were bills for this and that claims for that and the other and these came in with great rapidity and with pressing demands for payment mrs macdonald pitied herself more than ever her tones as she recalled the virtues of her past life were more tragic her debit and credit account with the almighty she showed to be clearly falsified never was so good a woman so abominably used of providence and humanity alike she wept copiously over her deservings and railed furiously against her fate poor mrs macdonald for many a weary year she had toiled to the best of her ability and she had done her duty by her children according to her lights which were pitiably dim the lord must indeed love me she remarked with bitterest irony one day when a mysterious visitor had put a gruesome paper into her unwilling hands it is but the beginning of the end nancy she said resignedly the beginning of the end i haven't a sovereign in the house and how i am to pay nine pounds seventeen and fourpence is beyond me altogether it won't last long we shall have the roof of the workhouse over our heads soon we can't go on like this where's the money to come from and that of course nancy knew no more than her mother could not we sell something she said looking round their shabby little sitting room where all that was worst in the house was gathered together because it was only used by themselves couldn't we sell something i might sell my cameo brooch said mrs macdonald with a huge sigh it was the last present your poor father ever gave me and i don't suppose it would fetch anything like nine pounds seventeen and fourpence said nancy doubtfully your father paid a great deal for it returned mrs macdonald but when one has to sell it's different to buying one gives one's things away as a matter of fact the late mr macdonald had given fifty shillings for the cameo brooch in question having bought it in a pawnshop in the strand but neither mrs macdonald nor nancy were aware of that fact dear mother said nancy i would not worry you have still a fortnight before you need settle it one way or the other a great many things may turn up in a fortnight not a ten pound note said mrs macdonald with an air of conviction you don't know mother look how many things have turned up when we least expected them and money has come that seemed to have dropped from the clouds at all events i would not break down over it until the very last day comes i would not indeed mother ah perhaps you would not said the mother i should not have done so when i was your age when you are mine you will understand me better yes dear perhaps i shall but you know even if the worst happens oh but we shall manage somehow depend upon it we shall manage somehow but nancy's youthful philosophy did not tend to check the flow of mrs macdonald's troubled spirit a whole week went by which she passed chiefly in tears and in drawing gloomy pictures of the details of the life which would soon soon be hers i shall have to wear a poke bonnet and a shawl she remarked in a doleful tone one day and i never could bear a shawl even when they were in fashion horrid cold things at meals of course poor lady she had to keep a cheerful countenance so that her guests should not suspect how badly things were going with them but nancy noticed that she ate very little and like most young people her chief idea for a panacea for all woes took the form of food in mrs macdonald's case it took the form of fresh tea and hot buttered toast and really i would be sorry to say how much tea was used in that household during those few days by way of bolstering its mistress's strength and spirits against what might happen in the immediate future the fortnight of grace soon passed away and with every day mrs macdonald's spirits sank lower and lower she looked old and aged and worn and nancy's heart ached when she realised that there was no prospect of anything turning up and apparently no chance of the danger which threatened them being averted what money had come in had mostly been imperatively required to meet daily expenses it seemed preposterous that people with a large house as they had should be in such straits for so small a sum and yet if they began selling their belongings which with the exception of the cameo brooch and mrs macdonald's keeper ring almost entirely consisted of furniture she knew that it would be impossible to replace them or even to dispose of them without the knowledge of their guests she hardly liked to suggest it to her mother and yet she felt that when the last day came she would have no other course open to her it was the evening before the last day of grace and still the needful sum had not been set aside twice during the day mrs macdonald had subsided in tears and wretchedness into the old armchair by their little sitting room fire while nancy had brought her fresh fragrant tea and a little covered plate of hot buttered toast and had delicately urged her to decide between selling the precious brooch and appealing to one or other of the boarders for an advance payment i will just wait till the morning she said to herself as she came down from the drawing room after dispensing the after dinner coffees nancy nancy cried her younger sister edith at that moment where are you i am here dear nancy replied what is the matter the child for edith was only some thirteen or fourteen years old came running up the stairs two steps at a time here's a letter for you nancy she said eagerly a letter cried nancy her mind flying at once to her story yes it's got a queen's head on it or something here it is the two girls reached the large and dimly lighted entrance hall together one from upstairs and one from down give it to me said nancy breathlessly she felt that it was a letter about her story the very fact that it had come without an accompanying roll of manuscript gave her hope she tore open the envelope with trembling fingers and by the light of the single flickering gas lamp read its contents the editor of the family beacon presents his compliments to miss macdonald and will be pleased to accept her story 'out of gloom into the sun' for the sum of fifteen guineas for which a cheque will be sent immediately on receipt of her reply for a few moments the poor painted hall with its gaunt umbrella stand and cold black and white marble floor seemed to be rocking up and down and spinning round and round the revulsion of feeling was so intense that the girl staggered up against the wall fighting hard with her palpitating heart oh nancy what is it cried edith staring in a fright at her sister's chalk white face is it bad news oh no good news the best news where's mother i she could not speak she simply could not finish the sentence her trembling lips refused to perform their office in her shaking hands she still clutched the precious letter and gathering her wits together she turned and literally tore down the stairs to the basement mother mother where are you she cried what is it cried mrs macdonald who poor soul was ready for all and every evil that could fall upon her for a moment nancy tried to control herself sufficiently to speak but the revulsion of feeling was too great twice she opened her mouth but no words would come then she dropped all of a heap at her mother's feet and hiding her head upon her knee she burst into a passion of tears illustration then she dropped all of a heap at her mother's feet and hiding her head upon her knee she burst into a passion of tears in spite of her acidity and her disputes with providence and things in general mrs macdonald still retained some of her mother's instinct she drew the girl's head to her breast and held her there tightly with a tragic at least we will all die together air that was utterly pathetic she had no words of consolation for what she believed was some new and terrible trouble come upon them then as nancy still sobbed on she drew the letter from her unresisting fingers mastered its contents and sat like a woman turned to stone i am afraid she said after a long silence that i have been very cruel to you nancy i have called your scribbling rubbish i have scolded you i have been very hard on you and instead of my being punished for my blindness it is your work which has come to save me from the end which i so dreaded but i shall never forgive myself but nancy the storm over brushed the tears away from her eyes and sat back resting her elbow upon her mother's knee oh it is very silly of me to go on like this half laughing and half inclined to weep yet more i have been so worried you know mother it's really stupid of me but you mustn't blame yourself now that good luck has come to us must you you did what you thought was right and you had a right to speak and after all i did leave everything to you everything and i might have wasted all my time you were quite right mother what was that line willie was writing in his copybook last week said mrs macdonald holding the girl's hand fast and looking oh so unlike her usual self torches were made to burn jewels to wear

illustration she saw that he had drawn the shape of a coffin and was then writing on the lid the name of agnes dedication to dr alderson of norwich dear sir in dedicating this publication to you i follow in some measure the example of those nations who devoted to their gods the first fruits of the genial seasons which they derived from their bounty to you i owe whatever of cultivation my mind has received and the first fruits of that mind to you i dedicate besides having endeavoured in the father and daughter to exhibit a picture of the most perfect parental affection to whom could i dedicate it with so much propriety as to you since in describing a good father i had only to delineate my own allow me to add full of gratitude for years of tenderness and indulgence on your part but feebly repaid even by every possible sentiment of filial regard on mine that the satisfaction i shall experience if my publication be favourably received by the world will not proceed from the mere gratification of my selflove but from the conviction i shall feel that my success as an author is productive of pleasure to you amelia opie berners street the father and daughter by mrs opie to the reader it is not without considerable apprehension that i offer myself as an avowed author at the bar of public opinionand that apprehension is heightened by its being the general custom to give indiscriminately the name of novel to every thing in prose that comes in the shape of a story however simple it be in its construction and humble in its pretensions by this means the following publication is in danger of being tried by a standard according to which it was never intended to be made and to be criticized for wanting those merits which it was never meant to possess i therefore beg leave to say in justice to myself that i know the father and daughter is wholly devoid of those attempts at strong character comic situation bustle and variety of incident which constitute a novel and that its highest pretensions are to be a simple moral tale the father and daughter a tale the night was darkthe wind blew keenly over the frozen and rugged heath when agnes pressing her moaning child to her bosom was travelling on foot to her fathers habitation would to god i had never left it she exclaimed as home and all its enjoyments rose in fancy to her viewand i think my readers will be ready to join in the exclamation when they hear the poor wanderers history agnes fitzhenry was the only child of a respectable merchant in a country town who having lost his wife when his daughter was very young resolved for her sake to form no second connection to the steady manly affection of a father fitzhenry joined the fond anxieties and endearing attentions of a mother and his parental care was amply repaid by the love and amiable qualities of agnes he was not rich yet the profits of his trade were such as to enable him to bestow every possible expense on his daughters education and to lay up a considerable sum yearly for her future support whatever else he could spare from his own absolute wants he expended in procuring comforts and pleasures for herwhat an excellent father that man is was the frequent exclamation among his acquaintanceand what an excellent child he has well may he be proud of her was as commonly the answer to it nor was this to be wondered atagnes united to extreme beauty of face and person every accomplishment that belongs to her own sex and a great degree of that strength of mind and capacity for acquiring knowledge supposed to belong exclusively to the other for this combination of rare qualities agnes was admiredfor her sweetness of temper her willingness to oblige her seeming unconsciousness of her own merits and her readiness to commend the merits of othersfor these still rarer qualities agnes was beloved and she seldom formed an acquaintance without at the same time securing a friend her father thought he loved her and perhaps he was right as never father loved a child before and agnes thought she loved him as child never before loved fatheri will not marry but live single for my fathers sake she often saidbut she altered her determination when her heart hitherto unmoved by the addresses of the other sex was assailed by an officer in the guards who came to recruit in the town in which she resided clifford as i shall call him had not only a fine figure and graceful address but talents rare and various and powers of conversation so fascinating that the woman he had betrayed forgot her wrongs in his presence and the creditor who came to dun him for the payment of debts already incurred went away eager to oblige him by letting him incur still more fatal perversion of uncommon abilities this man who might have taught a nation to look up to him as its best pride in prosperity and its best hope in adversity made no other use of his talents than to betray the unwary of both sexes the one to shame the other to pecuniary difficulties and he whose mind was capacious enough to have imagined schemes to aggrandize his native country the slave of sordid selfishness never looked beyond his own temporary and petty benefit and sat down contented with the achievements of the day if he had overreached a credulous tradesman or beguiled an unsuspecting woman but to accomplish even these paltry triumphs great knowledge of the human heart was necessarya power of discovering the prevailing foible in those on whom he had designs and of converting their imagined security into their real danger he soon discovered that agnes who was rather inclined to doubt her possessing in an uncommon degree the good qualities which she really had valued herself with not unusual blindness on those which she had not she thought herself endowed with great power to read the characters of those with whom she associated when she had even not discrimination enough to understand her own and while she imagined that it was not in the power of others to deceive her she was constantly in the habit of deceiving herself clifford was not slow to avail himself of this weakness in his intended victim and while he taught her to believe that none of his faults had escaped her observation with hers he had made himself thoroughly acquaintedbut not content with making her faults subservient to his views he pressed her virtues also into his service and her affection for her father that strong hold secure in which agnes would have defied the most violent assaults of temptation he contrived should be the means of her defeat i have been thus minute in detailing the various and seducing powers which clifford possessed not because he will be a principal figure in my narrativefor on the contrary the chief characters in it are the father and daughterbut in order to excuse as much as possible the strong attachment which he excited in agnes love says mrs inchbald whose knowledge of human nature can be equalled only by the humour with which she describes its follies and the unrivalled pathos with which she exhibits its distresseslove however rated by many as the chief passion of the heart is but a poor dependent a retainer on the other passionsadmiration gratitude respect esteem pride in the object divest the boasted sensation of these and it is no more than the impression of a twelvemonth by courtesy or vulgar error called loveand of all these ingredients was the passion of agnes composed for the graceful person and manner of clifford she felt admiration and her gratitude was excited by her observing that while he was an object of attention to every one wherever he appeared his attentions were exclusively directed to herself and that he who from his rank and accomplishments might have laid claim to the hearts even of the brightest daughters of fashion in the gayest scenes of the metropolis seemed to have no higher ambition than to appear amiable in the eyes of agnes the humble toast of an obscure country town while his superiority of understanding and brilliancy of talents called forth her respect and his apparent virtues her esteem and when to this high idea of the qualities of the man was added a knowledge of his high birth and great expectations it is no wonder that she also felt the lastmentioned and often perhaps the greatest excitement to love pride in the object footnote nature and art vol i p when clifford began to pay those marked attentions to agnes which ought always on due encouragement from the woman to whom they are addressed to be followed by an offer of marriage he contrived to make himself as much disliked by the father as admired by the daughter yet his management was so artful that fitzhenry could not give a sufficient reason for his dislike he could only declare its existence and for the first time in her life agnes learned to think her father unjust and capricious thus while clifford ensured an acceptance of his addresses from agnes he at the same time secured a rejection of them from fitzhenry and this was the object of his wishes as he had a decided aversion to marriage and knew besides that marrying agnes would disappoint all his ambitious prospects in life and bring on him the eternal displeasure of his father at length after playing for some time with her hopes and fears clifford requested fitzhenry to sanction with his approbation his addresses to his daughter and fitzhenry as he expected coldly and firmly declined the honour of his alliance but when clifford mentioned as if unguardedly that he hoped to prevail on his father to approve the marriage after it had taken place if not before fitzhenry proudly told him that he thought his daughter much too good to be smuggled into the family of any one while clifford piqued in his turn at the warmth of fitzhenrys expressions and the dignity of his manner left him exulting secretly in the consciousness that he had his revengefor he knew that the heart of agnes was irrecoverably his agnes heard from her lover that his suit was rejected with agonies as violent as he appeared to feelwhat exclaimed she can that affectionate father who has till now anticipated my wishes disappoint me in the wish nearest to my heart in the midst of her first agitation her father entered the room and with a countenance more in sorrow than in anger began to expostulate with her on the impropriety of the connection which she was desirous of forming he represented to her the very slender income which clifford possessed the inconvenience to which an officers wife is exposed and the little chance which there is for a mans making a constant and domestic husband who has been brought up in an idle profession and accustomed to habits of intemperance expense and irregularity but above all said he how is it possible that you could ever condescend to accept the addresses of a man whose father he himself owns will never sanction them with his approbation alas agnes could plead no excuse but that she was in love and she had too much sense to urge such a plea to her father believe me he continued i speak thus from the most disinterested consideration of your interest for painful as the idea of parting with you must be to me i am certain i should not shrink from the bitter trial whenever my misery would be your happiness here his voice faltered but in this case i am certain that by refusing my consent to your wishes i ensure your future comfort and in a cooler moment you will be of the same opinion agnes shook her head and turned away in tears nay hear me my child resumed fitzhenry you know that i am no tyrant and if after time and absence have been tried in order to conquer your unhappy passion it remain unchanged then in defiance of my judgement i will consent to your marriage with mr clifford provided his father consent likewisefor unless he do i never willand if you have not pride and resolution enough to be the guardian of your own dignity i must guard it for you but i am sure there will be no need of my interference and agnes fitzhenry would scorn to be clandestinely the wife of any man agnes thought so tooand fitzhenry spoke this in so mild and affectionate a manner and in a tone so expressive of suppressed wretchedness which the bare idea of parting with her had occasioned him that for the moment she forgot every thing but her father and the vast debt of love and gratitude which she owed him and throwing herself into his arms she protested her entire nay cheerful acquiescence in his determination promise me then replied fitzhenry that you will never see mr clifford more if you can avoid it he has the tongue of belial and if here agnes indignantly interrupted him with reproaches for supposing her so weak as to be in danger of being seduced into a violation of her duty and so strong were the terms in which she expressed herself that her father entreated her pardon for having thought such a promise necessary the next day clifford did not venture to call at the house but he watched the door till he saw agnes come out alone having then joined her he obtained from her a full account of the conversation which she had had with fitzhenry when to her great surprise he drew conclusions from it which she had never imagined possible he saw or pretended to see in fitzhenrys rejection of his offers not merely a dislike of her marrying him but a design to prevent her marrying at all and as a design like this was selfish in the last degree and ought to be frustrated he thought it would be kinder in her to disobey her father then and marry the man of her heart than by indulging his unreasonable wishes on this subject once to make him expect that she would do so again and continue to lead a single lifebecause in that case the day of her marrying when it came at last would burst on him with tenfold horrors the result of this specious reasoning enforced by tears caresses and protestations was that she had better go off to scotland immediately with him and trust to time necessity and their parents affection to secure their forgiveness agnes the first time heard these arguments and this proposal with the disdain which they merited but alas she did not resolve to avoid all opportunity of hearing them a second time but vain of the resolution she had shown on this first trial she was not averse to stand another delighted to find that she had not overrated her strength when she reproached fitzhenry for his want of confidence in it the consequence is obviousagain and again she heard clifford argue in favour of an elopement and though she still retained virtue sufficient to withhold her consent she every day saw fresh reason to believe he argued on good grounds and to think that that parent whose whole study till now had been her gratification was in this instance at least the slave of unwarrantable selfishness at last finding that neither time reflection nor even a temporary absence had the slightest effect on her attachment but that it gained new force every day she owned that nothing but the dread of making her father unhappy withheld her from listening to cliffords proposaltwas true she said pride forbade it but the woman who could listen to the dictates of pride knew nothing of love but the name this was the moment for clifford to urge more strongly than ever that the elopement was the most effectual means of securing her fathers happiness as well as her own till at last her judgement became the dupe of her wishes and fancying that she was following the dictates of filial affection when she was in reality the helpless victim of passion she yielded to the persuasions of a villain and set off with him for scotland when fitzhenry first heard of her flight he sat for hours absorbed in a sort of dumb anguish far more eloquent than words at length he burst into exclamations against her ingratitude for all the love and care that he had bestowed on her and the next moment he exclaimed with tears of tenderness poor girl she is not used to commit faults how miserable she will be when she comes to reflect and how she will long for my forgiveness and o yes i am sure i shall long as ardently to forgive herthen his arms were folded in fancy round his child whom he pictured to himself confessing her marriage to him and upon her knees imploring his pardon but day after day came and no letter from the fugitives acknowledging their error and begging his blessing on their unionfor no union had taken place when clifford and agnes had been conveyed as fast as four horses could carry them one hundred miles towards gretnagreen and had ordered fresh horses clifford started as he looked at his pocketbook and with welldissembled consternation exclaimed what can we do i have brought the wrong pocketbook and have not money enough to carry us above a hundred and odd miles further on the north roadagnes was overwhelmed with grief and apprehension at this information but did not for an instant suspect that the fact was otherwise than as clifford stated it to be as i before observed agnes piqued herself on her knowledge of characters and she judged of them frequently by the rules of physiognomy she had studied voices too as well as countenanceswas it possible then that agnes who had from cliffords voice and countenance pronounced him all that was ingenuous honourable and manly could suspect him capable of artifice could she retracting her pretensions to penetration believe she had put herself in the power of a designing libertine novanity and selflove forbade this salutary suspicion to enter her imagination and without one scruple or one reproach she acceded to the plan which clifford proposed as the only one likely to obviate their difficulties and procure them most speedily an opportunity of solemnizing their marriage deluded agnes you might have known that the honourable lover is as fearful to commit the honour of his mistress even in appearance as she herself can be that his care and anxiety to screen her even from the breath of suspicion are ever on the watch and that therefore had cliffords designs been such as virtue would approve he would have put it out of the power of accident to prevent your immediate marriage and expose your fair fame to the whisper of calumny to london they set forward and were driven to an hotel in the adelphi whence clifford went out in search of lodgings and having met with convenient apartments at the west end of the town he conducted to them the pensive and already repentant agnesunder what name and title said agnes am i to be introduced to the woman of the houseas my intended wife cried her lover pressing her to his bosomand in a few daysthough to me they will appear agesyou will give me a right to call you by that tender namein a few days exclaimed agnes withdrawing from his embrace cannot the marriage take place tomorrow impossible replied clifford you are not of agei cant procure a licensebut i have taken these lodgings for a monthwe will have the banns published and be married at the parishchurch to this arrangement against which her delicacy and every feeling revolted agnes would fain have objected in the strongest manner but unable to urge any reasons for her objection except such as seemed to imply distrust of her own virtue she submitted in mournful silence to the plan with a heart then for the first time tortured with a sense of degradation she took possession of her apartment and clifford returned to his hotel meditating with savage delight on the success of his plans and on the triumph which he fancied awaited him agnes passed the night in sleepless agitation now forming and now rejecting schemes to obviate the danger which must accrue to her character if not to her honour by remaining for a whole month exposed to the seductions of a man whom she had but too fatally convinced of his power over her heart and the result of her reflections was that she should insist on his leaving town and not returning till he came to lead her to the altar happy would it have been for agnes had she adhered to this resolution but vanity and selfconfidence again interferedwhat have i to fear said agnes to herselfam i so fallen in my own esteem that i dare not expose myself even to a shadow of temptationnoi will not think so meanly of my virtuethe woman that is afraid of being dishonoured is half overcome already and i will meet with boldness the trials which i cannot avoid o vanity thou hast much to answer fori am convinced that were we to trace up to their source all the most painful and degrading events of our lives we should find most of them to have their origin in the gratified suggestions of vanity it is not my intention to follow agnes through the succession of mortifications embarrassments and contending feelings which preceded her undoing for secure as she thought herself in her own strength and the honour of her lover she became at last a prey to her seducer it is sufficient that i explain the circumstances which led to her being in a cold winters night houseless and unprotected a melancholy wanderer towards the house of her father before the expiration of the month clifford had triumphed over the virtue of agnes and soon after he received orders to join his regiment as it was going to be sent on immediate servicebut you will return to me before you embark in order to make me your wife said the halfdistracted agnes you will not leave me to shame as well as misery clifford promised every thing she wished and agnes tried to lose the pangs of parting in anticipation of the joy of his return but on the very day when she expected him she received a letter from him saying that he was under sailing orders and to see her again before the embarkation was impossible to do clifford justice he in this instance told truth and as he really loved agnes as well as a libertine can love he felt the agitation and distress which his letter expressed though had he returned to her he had an excuse ready prepared for delaying the marriage words can but ill describe the situation of agnes on the receipt of this letterthe return of clifford was not to be expected for months at least and perhaps he might never returnthe thought of his danger was madnessbut when she reflected that she should in all probability be a mother before she became a wife in a transport of frantic anguish she implored heaven in mercy to put an end to her existenceo my dear injured father she exclaimed i who was once your pride am now your disgraceand that child whose first delight it was to look up in your face and see your eyes beaming with fondness on her can now never dare to meet their glance again but though agnes dared not presume to write to her father till she could sign herself the wife of clifford she could not exist without making some secret inquiries concerning his health and spirits and before he left her clifford recommended a trusty messenger to her for the purposethe first account which she received was that fitzhenry was well the next that he was dejected the three following that his spirits were growing betterand the last account was that he was married married cried agnes rushing into her chamber and shutting the door after her in a manner sufficiently indicative to the messenger of the anguish she hastened from him to concealmarriedclifford abroadperhaps at this moment a corpseand my father marriedwhat then am i a wretch forlorn an outcast from societyno one to love no one to protect and cherish me great god wilt thou not pardon me if i seek a refuge from my suffering in the grave here nature suddenly and powerfully impressed on her recollection that she was about to become a parent and falling on her knees she sobbed out what am i did i aski am a mother and earth still holds me by a tie too sacred to be broken then by degrees she became calmer and rejoiced fervently rejoiced in her fathers second marriage though she felt it as too convincing a proof how completely he had thrown her from his affections she knew that the fear of a second familys diminishing the strong affection which he bore to her was his reason for not marrying again and now it was plain that he married in hopes of losing his affection for her still this information removed a load from her mind by showing her that fitzhenry felt himself capable of receiving happiness from other hands than hers and she resolved if she heard that he was happy in his change of situation never to recall to his memory the daughter whom it was so much his interest to forget the time of agness confinement now drew neara time which fills with apprehension even the wife who is soothed and supported by the tender attentions of an anxious husband and the assiduities of affectionate relations and friends and who knows that the child with which she is about to present them will at once gratify their affections and their pride what then must have been the sensations of agnes at a moment so awful and dangerous as thisagnes who had no husband to soothe her by his anxious inquiries no relations or friends to cheer her drooping soul by the expressions of sympathy and whose child instead of being welcomed by an exulting family must be perhaps a stranger even to its nearest relations but in proportion to her trials seemed to be agness power of rising superior to them and after enduring her sufferings with a degree of fortitude and calmness that astonished the mistress of the house whom compassion had induced to attend on her she gave birth to a lovely boyfrom that moment though she rarely smiled and never saw any one but her kind landlady her mind was no longer oppressed by the deep gloom under which she had before laboured and when she had heard from clifford or of her fathers being happy and clasped her babe to her bosom agnes might almost be pronounced cheerful after she had been six months a mother clifford returned and in the transport of seeing him safe agnes forgot for a moment that she had been anxious and unhappy now again was the subject of the marriage resumed but just as the wedding day was fixed clifford was summoned away to attend his expiring father and agnes was once more doomed to the tortures of suspense after a months absence clifford came back but appeared to labour under a dejection of spirits which he seemed studious to conceal from her alarmed and terrified at an appearance so unusual she demanded an explanation which the consummate deceiver gave at length after many entreaties on her part and feigned reluctance on his he told her that his fathers illness was occasioned by his having been informed that he was privately married to her that he had sent for him to inquire into the truth of the report and being convinced by his solemn assurance that no marriage had taken place he had commanded him unless he wished to kill him to take a solemn oath never to marry agnes fitzhenry without his consent and did you take the oath cried agnes her whole frame trembling with agitationwhat could i do replied he my fathers life in evident danger if i refused besides the dreadful certainty that he would put his threats in execution of cursing me with his dying breathand cruel as he is agnes i could not help feeling that he was my fatherbarbarian exclaimed she i sacrificed my father to youan oath o god have you then taken an oath never to be mine and saying this she fell into a long and deep swoon when she recovered but before she was able to speak she found clifford kneeling by her and while she was too weak to interrupt him he convinced her that he did not at all despair of his fathers consent to his making her his wife else he should have been less willing to give so ready a consent to take the oath imposed on him even although his fathers life depended on it oh no replied agnes with a bitter smile you wrong yourself you are too good a son to have been capable of hesitating a momentthere are few children so bad so very bad as i amand bursting into an agony of grief it was long before the affectionate language and tender caresses of clifford could restore her to tranquillity another six months elapsed during which time clifford kept her hopes alive by telling her that he every day saw fresh signs of his fathers relenting in her favourat these times she would say lead me to him let him hear the tale of my wretchedness let me say to him for your sons sake i have left the best of fathers the happiest of homes and have become an outcast from societythen would i bid him look at this pale cheek this emaciated form proofs of the anguish that is undermining my constitution and tell him to beware how by forcing you to withhold from me my right he made you guilty of murdering the poor deluded wretch who till she knew you never lay down without a fathers blessing nor rose but to be welcomed by his smile clifford had feeling but it was of that transient sort which never outlived the disappearance of the object that occasioned it to these pathetic entreaties he always returned affectionate answers and was often forced to leave the room in order to avoid being too much softened by them but by the time he had reached the end of the street always alive to the impressions of the present moment the sight of some new beauty or some old companion dried up the starting tear and restored to him the power of coolly considering how he should continue to deceive his miserable victim but the time at length arrived when the mask that hid his villany from her eyes fell off never to be replaced as agnes fully expected to be the wife of clifford she was particularly careful to lead a retired life and not to seem unmindful of her shame by exhibiting herself at places of public amusement in vain did clifford paint the charms of the play the opera and other places of fashionable resort retirement with books music work and your society she used to reply are better suited to my taste and situation and never but as your wife will i presume to meet the public eye clifford though he wished to exhibit his lovely conquest to the world was obliged to submit to her will in this instance sometimes indeed agnes was prevailed on to admit to her table those young men of cliffords acquaintance who were the most distinguished for their talents and decorum of manners but this was the only departure that he had ever yet prevailed on her to make from the plan of retirement which she had adopted one evening however clifford was so unusually urgent with her to accompany him to drurylane to see a favourite tragedy alleging as an additional motive for her obliging him that he was going to leave her on the following monday in order to attend his father into the country where he should be forced to remain some time that agnes unwilling to refuse what he called his parting request at length complied clifford having prevailed on mrs askew her kind landlady to accompany them and having assured agnes that as they should sit in the upper boxes she might if she chose it wear her veil downagnes in spite of herself was delighted with the representationbut as hearts refind the saddend tint retain the sigh is pleasure and the jest is pain she was desirous of leaving the house before the farce began yet as clifford saw a gentleman in the lower boxes with whom he had business she consented to stay till he had spoken to him soon after she saw clifford enter the lower box opposite to her and those who know what it is to love will not be surprised to hear that agnes had more pleasure in looking at her lover and drawing favourable comparisons between him and the gentlemen who surrounded him than in attending to the farce she had been some moments absorbed in this pleasing employment when two gentlemen entered the box where she was and seated themselves behind her who is that elegant fashionablelooking man my lord in the lower box just opposite to us said one of the gentlemen to the otheri mean he who is speaking to captain mowbrayit is george clifford of the guards replied his lordship and one of the cleverest fellows in england colonel agnes who had not missed one word of this conversation now became still more attentive oh i have heard a great deal of him returned the colonel and as much against him as for himmost likely said his lordship i dare say that fellow has ruined more young men and seduced more young women than any man of his age which is only fourandthirty in the kingdom agnes sighed deeply and felt herself attacked by a sort of faint sickness but it is to be hoped that he will reform now observed the colonel i hear he is going to be married to miss sandford the great city heiressso he isand monday is the day fixed for the wedding agnes startedclifford himself had told her he must leave her on monday for some weeksand in breathless expectation she listened to what followed but what then continued his lordship he marries for money merely the truth is his father is lately come to a long disputed barony and with scarcely an acre of land to support the dignity of it so his son has consented to marry an heiress in order to make the family rich as well as noble you must know i have my information from the fountainheadcliffords mother is my relation and the good woman thought proper to acquaint me in form with the advantageous alliance which her hopeful son was about to make this confirmation of the truth of a story which she till now hoped might be mere report was more than agnes could well bear but made courageous by desperation she resolved to listen while they continued to talk on this subject mrs askew in the mean while was leaning over the box too much engrossed by the farce to attend to what was passing behind her just as his lordship concluded the last sentence agnes saw clifford go out with his friend and she who had but the minute before gazed on him with looks of admiring fondness now wished in the bitterness of her soul that she might never behold him again i never wish said the colonel a match of interest to be a happy onenor will this be so depend on it answered his lordship for besides that miss sandford is ugly and disagreeable she has a formidable rivalindeed cried the othera favourite mistress i suppose here the breath of agnes grew shorter and shorter she suspected that they were going to talk of her and under other circumstances her nice sense of honour would have prevented her attending to a conversation which she was certain was not meant for her ear but so great was the importance of the present discourse to her future peace and wellbeing that it annihilated all sense of impropriety in listening to it yes he has a favourite mistress answered his lordshipa girl who was worthy of a better fateyou know her then asked the colonelno replied heby name only but when i was in the neighbourhood of the town where she lived i heard continually of her beauty and accomplishments her name is agnes fitzfitzfitzhenry i suppose said the otheryes that is the name said his lordship how came you to guess itbecause agnes fitzhenry is a name which i have often heard toasted she sings well does she notshe does every thing well rejoined the other and was once the pride of her father and of the town in which she lived agnes could scarcely forbear groaning aloud at this faithful picture of what she once was poor thing resumed his lordshipthat ever she should be the victim of a villain it seems he seduced her from her fathers house under pretence of carrying her to gretnagreen but on some infernal plea or other he took her to london here the agitation of agnes became so visible as to attract mrs askews notice but as she assured her that she should be well presently mrs askew again gave herself up to the illusion of the scene little did his lordship think how severely he was wounding the peace of one for whom he felt such compassion you seem much interested about this unhappy girl said the coloneli am so replied the other and full of the subject too for cliffords factotum wilson has been with me this morning and i learned from him some of his masters tricks which made me still more anxious about his victimit seems she is very fond of her father though she was prevailed on to desert him and has never known a happy moment since her elopement nor could she be easy without making frequent but secret inquiries concerning his healthstrange inconsistency muttered the colonelthis anxiety gave clifford room to fear that she might at some future moment if discontented with him return to her afflicted parent before he was tired of herso what do you think he did at this moment agnes far more eager to hear what followed than the colonel turned round and fixing her eyes on her unknown friend with wild anxiety could scarcely help saying what did clifford do my lord he got his factotum the man i mentioned to personate a messenger and to pretend that he had been to her native town and then he gave her such accounts as were best calculated to calm her anxiety but the masterstroke which secured her remaining with him was his telling the pretended messenger to inform her that her father was married againthough it is more likely poor unhappy man that he is dead than that he is married at the mention of this horrible probability agnes lost all selfcommand and screaming aloud fell back on the knees of the astonished narrator reiterating her cries with all the alarming helplessness of phrensy turn her out turn her out echoed through the theatrefor the audience supposed that the noise proceeded from some intoxicated and abandoned woman and a man in the next box struck agnes a blow on the shoulder and calling her by a name too gross to repeat desired her to leave the house and act her drunken freaks elsewhere agnes whom the gentlemen behind were supporting with great kindness and compassion heard nothing of this speech save the injurious epithet applied to herself and alive only to what she thought the justice of it did you hear that she exclaimed starting up with the look and tone of phrensydid you hear thato god my brain is on firethen springing over the seat she rushed out of the box followed by the trembling and astonished mrs askew who in vain tried to keep pace with the desperate speed of agnes before agnes with all her haste could reach the bottom of the stairs the farce ended and the lobbies began to fill agnes pressed forward when amongst the crowd she saw a tradesman who lived near her fathers houseno longer sensible of shame for anguish had annihilated it she rushed towards him and seizing his arm exclaimed for the love of god tell me how my father is the tradesman terrified and astonished at the pallid wildness of her look so unlike the countenance of successful and contented vice that he would have expected to see her wear repliedhe is well poor soul butbut unhappy i suppose interrupted agnesthank god he is wellbut is he marriedmarried dear me no he isdo you think he would forgive me eagerly rejoined agnesforgive you answered the manhow you talk belike he might forgive you ifi know what you would say interrupted agnes again if i would returnenoughenoughgod bless you you have saved me from distraction so saying she ran out of the house mrs askew having overtaken her followed by the nobleman and the colonel who with the greatest consternation had found from an exclamation of mrs askews that the object of their compassion was miss fitzhenry herself but before agnes had proceeded many steps down the street clifford met her on his return from a neighbouring coffeehouse with his companion and spite of her struggles and reproaches which astonished and alarmed him he with mrs askews assistance forced her into a hackneycoach and ordered the man to drive homeno explanation took place during the ride to all the caresses and questions of clifford she returned nothing but passionate exclamations against his perfidy and cruelty mrs askew thought her insane clifford wished to think her so but his conscience told him that if by accident his conduct had been discovered to her there was reason enough for the frantic sorrow which he witnessed at length they reached their lodgings which were in suffolkstreet charingcross and agnes having at length obtained some composure in as few words as possible related the conversation which she had overheard clifford as might be expected denied the truth of what his lordship had advanced but it was no longer in his power to deceive the awakened penetration of agnesunder his assumed unconcern she clearly saw the confusion of detected guilt and giving utterance in very strong language to the contempt and indignation which she felt while contemplating such complete depravity she provoked clifford who was more than half intoxicated boldly to avow what he was at first eager to deny and agnes who before shuddered at his hypocrisy was now shocked at his unprincipled daring but what right have you to complain added he the cheat that i put upon you relative to your father was certainly meant in kindness and though miss sandford will have my hand you alone will ever possess my heart therefore it was my design to keep you in ignorance of my marriage and retain you as the greatest of all my worldly treasuresplague on this prating lord he has destroyed the prettiest arrangement ever made however i hope we shall part good friends great god cried agnes raising her tearless eyes to heavenand have i then forsaken the best of parents for a wretch like thisbut think not sir she added turning with a commanding air towards clifford whose temper naturally warm the term wretch had not soothed think not fallen as i am that i will ever condescend to receive protection and support either for myself or child from a man whom i know to be a consummate villain you have made me criminal but you have not obliterated my horror for crime and my veneration for virtueand in the fulness of my contempt i inform you sir that we shall meet no more not till tomorrow said cliffordthis is our first quarrel agnes and the quarrels of lovers are only the renewal of love you know therefore leaving the bitter piercing air to guard my treasure for me till tomorrow i take my leave and hope in the morning to find you in a better humour so saying he departed secure from the inclemency of the weather and darkness of the night that agnes would not venture to go away before the morning and resolved to return very early in order to prevent her departure if her threatened resolution were any thing more than the frantic expressions of a disappointed woman besides he knew that at that time she was scantily supplied with money and that mrs askew dared not furnish her with any for the purpose of leaving him but he left not agnes as he supposed to vent her sense of injury in idle grief and inactive lamentation but to think to decide and to actwhat was the rigour of the night to a woman whose heart was torn by all the pangs which convictions such as those which she had lately received could give she hastily therefore wrapped up her sleeping boy in a plisse of which in a calmer moment she would have felt the want herself and took him in her arms then throwing a shawl over her shoulders she softly unbarred the hall door and before the noise could have summoned any of the family she was already out of sight so severe was the weather that even those accustomed to brave in ragged garments the pelting of the pitiless storm shuddered as the freezing wind whistled around them and crept with trembling knees to the wretched hovel that awaited them but the winters wind blew unfelt by agnes she was alive to nothing but the joy of having escaped from a villain and the faint hope that she was hastening to obtain perhaps a fathers forgiveness thank heaven she exclaimed as she found herself at the rails along the green parkthe air which i breathe here is uncontaminated by his breath when as the watchman called halfpast eleven oclock the recollection that she had no place of shelter for the night occurred to her and at the same instant she remembered that a coach set off at twelve from piccadilly which went within twelve miles of her native place she therefore immediately resolved to hasten thither and either in the inside or on the outside to proceed on her journey as far as her finances would admit of intending to walk the rest of the way she arrived at the inn just as the coach was setting off and found to her great satisfaction one inside place vacant nothing worth mentioning occurred on the journey agnes with her veil drawn over her face and holding her slumbering boy in her arms while the incessant shaking of her knee and the piteous manner in which she sighed gave evident marks of the agitation of her mind might excite in some degree the curiosity of her fellowtravellers but gave no promise of that curiosity being satisfied and she was suffered to remain unquestioned and undisturbed at noon the next day the coach stopped for the travellers to dine and stay a few hours to recruit themselves after their labours past and to fortify themselves against those yet to come here agnes who as she approached nearer home became afraid of meeting some acquaintance resolved to change her dress and to equip herself in such a manner as should while it screened her from the inclemency of the weather at the same time prevent her being recognised by any one accordingly she exchanged her plisse shawl and a few other things for a mans great coat a red cloth cloak with a hood to it a pair of thick shoes and some yards of flannel in which she wrapped up her little edward and having tied her straw bonnet under her chin with her veil she would have looked like a countrywoman drest for market could she have divested herself of a certain delicacy of appearance and gracefulness of manner the yet uninjured beauties of former days when they set off again she became an outside passenger as she could not afford to continue an inside one and covering her child up in the red cloak which she wore over her coat she took her station on the top of the coach with seeming firmness but a breaking heart agnes expected to arrive within twelve miles of her native place long before it was dark and reach the place of her destination before bedtime unknown and unseen but she was mistaken in her expectations for the roads had been rendered so rugged by the frost that it was late in the evening when the coach reached the spot whence she was to commence her walk and by the time she had eaten her slight repast and furnished herself with some necessaries to enable her to resist the severity of the weather she found that it was impossible for her to reach her longforsaken home before daybreak still she was resolved to go onto pass another day in suspense concerning her father and her future hopes of his pardon was more formidable to her than the terrors of undertaking a lonely and painful walk perhaps too agnes was not sorry to have a tale of hardship to narrate on her arrival at the house of her nurse whom she meant to employ as mediator between her and her offended parent his child his penitent child whom he had brought up with the utmost tenderness and screened with unremitting care from the ills of life returning to implore his pity and forgiveness on foot and unprotected through all the dangers of lonely paths and through the horrors of a winters night must she flattered herself be a picture too affecting for fitzhenry to think upon without some commiseration and she hoped he would in time bestow on her his forgivenessto be admitted to his presence was a favour which she dared not presume either to ask or expect but in spite of the soothing expectation which she tried to encourage a dread of she knew not what took possession of her mindevery moment she looked fearfully around her and as she beheld the wintry waste spreading on every side she felt awestruck at the desolateness of her situation the sound of a human voice would she thought have been rapture to her ear but the next minute she believed that it would have made her sink in terror to the groundalas she mournfully exclaimed i was not always timid and irritable as i now feelbut then i was not always guiltyo my child would i were once more innocent like thee so saying in a paroxysm of grief she bounded forward on her way as if hoping to escape by speed from the misery of recollection agnes was now arrived at the beginning of a forest about two miles in length and within three of her native place even in her happiest days she never entered its solemn shade without feeling a sensation of fearful awe but now that she entered it leafless as it was a wandering wretched outcast a mother without the sacred name of wife and bearing in her arms the pledge of her infamy her knees smote each other and shuddering as if danger were before her she audibly implored the protection of heaven at this instant she heard a noise and casting a startled glance into the obscurity before her she thought she saw something like a human form running across the road for a few moments she was motionless with terror but judging from the swiftness with which the object disappeared that she had inspired as much terror as she felt she ventured to pursue her course she had not gone far when she again beheld the cause of her fear but hearing as it moved a noise like the clanking of a chain she concluded that it was some poor animal which had been turned out to graze still as she gained on the object before her she was convinced it was a man that she beheld and as she heard the noise no longer she concluded that it had been the result of fancy only but that with every other idea was wholly absorbed in terror when she saw the figure standing still as if waiting for her approachyet why should i fear she inwardly observed it may be a poor wanderer like myself who is desirous of a companionif so i shall rejoice in such a rencontre as this reflection passed her mind she hastened towards the stranger when she saw him look hastily around him start as if he beheld at a distance some object that alarmed him and then without taking any notice of her run on as fast as before but what can express the horror of agnes when she again heard the clanking of a chain and discovered that it hung to the ankle of the strangersurely he must be a felon murmured agneso my poor boy perhaps we shall both be murderedthis suspense is not to be borne i will follow him and meet my fate at oncethen summoning all her remaining strength she followed the alarming fugitive after she had walked nearly a mile further and as she did not overtake him had flattered herself that he had gone in a contrary direction she saw him seated on the ground and as before turning his head back with a sort of convulsive quickness but as it was turned from her she was convinced that she was not the object which he was seeking of her he took no notice and her resolution of accosting him failing when she approached she walked hastily past in hopes that she might escape him entirely as she passed she heard him talking and laughing to himself and thence concluded that he was not a felon but a lunatic escaped from confinement horrible as this idea was her fear was so far overcome by pity that she had a wish to return and offer him some of the refreshment which she had procured for herself and child when she heard him following her very fast and was convinced by the sound the dreadful sound of his chain that he was coming up to her the clanking of a fetter when one knows that it is fastened round the limbs of a fellowcreature always calls forth in the soul of sensibility a sensation of horror what then at this moment must have been its effect on agnes who was trembling for her life for that of her child and looking in vain for a protector around the still solemn waste breathless with apprehension she stopped as the maniac gained upon her and motionless and speechless awaited the consequence of his approach woman said he in a hoarse hollow tonewoman do you see them do you see themsir pray what did you say sir cried agnes in a tone of respect and curtsying as she spokefor what is so respectful as feari cant see them resumed he not attending to her i have escaped them rascals cowards i have escaped them and then he jumped and clapped his hands for joy agnes relieved in some measure from her fears and eager to gain the poor wretchs favour told him that she rejoiced at his escape from the rascals and hoped that they would not overtake him but while she spoke he seemed wholly inattentive and jumping as he walked made his fetter clank in horrid exultation the noise at length awoke the child who seeing a strange and indistinct object before him and hearing a sound so unusual screamed violently and hid his face in his mothers bosom take it away take it away exclaimed the maniaci do not like childrenagnes terrified at the thought of what might happen tried to sooth the trembling boy to rest but in vain the child still screamed and the angry agitation of the maniac increasedstrangle it strangle it he crieddo it this moment or agnes almost frantic with terror conjured the unconscious boy if he valued his life to cease his cries and then the next moment she conjured the wretched man to spare her child but alas she spoke to those incapable of understanding hera child and a madmanthe terrified boy still shrieked the lunatic still threatened and clenching his fist seized the left arm of agnes who with the other attempted to defend her infant from his fury when at the very moment that his fate seemed inevitable a sudden gale of wind shook the leafless branches of the surrounding trees and the madman fancying that the noise proceeded from his pursuers ran off with his former rapidity immediately the child relieved from the sight and the sound which alarmed it and exhausted by the violence of its cries sunk into a sound sleep on the throbbing bosom of its mother but alas agnes knew that this was but a temporary escapethe maniac might return and again the child might wake in terrorsand scarcely had the thought passed her mind when she saw him coming back but as he walked slowly the noise was not so great as before i hate to hear children cry said he as he approachedmine is quiet now replied agnes then recollecting that she had some food in her pocket she offered some to the stranger in order to divert his attention from the child he snatched it from her hand instantly and devoured it with terrible voraciousness but again he exclaimed i do not like childrenif you trust them they will betray you and agnes offered him food again as if to bribe him to spare her helpless boyi had a child oncebut she is dead poor soul continued he taking agnes by the arm and leading her gently forwardand you loved her very tenderly i suppose said agnes thinking that the loss of his child had occasioned his malady but instead of answering her he went onthey said that she ran away from me with a loverbut i knew they lied she was good and would not have deserted the father who doted on herbesides i saw her funeral myselfliars rascals as they aredo not tell any one i got away from them last night and am now going to visit her grave a deathlike sickness an apprehension so horrible as to deprive her almost of sense took possession of the soul of agnes she eagerly tried to obtain a sight of the strangers face the features of which the darkness had hitherto prevented her from distinguishing she however tried in vain as his hat was pulled over his forehead and his chin rested on his bosom but they had now nearly gained the end of the forest and day was just breaking and agnes as soon as they entered the open plain seized the arm of the madman to force him to look towards herfor speak to him she could not he felt and perhaps resented the importunate pressure of her handfor he turned hastily roundwhen dreadful confirmation of her fears agnes beheld her father it was indeed fitzhenry driven to madness by his daughters desertion and disgrace after the elopement of agnes fitzhenry entirely neglected his business and thought and talked of nothing but the misery which he experienced in vain did his friends represent to him the necessity of his making amends by increased diligence for some alarming losses in trade which he had lately sustained she for whom alone he toiled had deserted himand ruin had no terrors for himi was too proud of her he used mournfully to repeatand heaven has humbled me even in her by whom i offended month after month elapsed and no intelligence of agnesfitzhenrys dejection increased and his affairs became more and more involved at length absolute and irretrievable bankruptcy was become his portion when he learned from authority not to be doubted that agnes was living with clifford as his acknowledged mistressthis was the deathstroke to his reason and the only way in which his friends relations he had none or only distant ones could be of any further service to him was by procuring him admission into a private madhouse in the neighbourhood of his recovery little hope was entertainedthe constant theme of his ravings was his daughtersometimes he bewailed her as dead at other times he complained of her as ungratefulbut so complete was the overthrow which his reason had received that he knew no one and took no notice of those whom friendship or curiosity led to his cell yet he was always meditating his escape and though ironed in consequence of it the night he met agnes he had after incredible difficulty and danger effected his purpose but to return to agnes who when she beheld in her insane companion her injured father the victim probably of her guilt let fall her sleeping child and sinking on the ground extended her arms towards fitzhenry articulating in a faint voice o god my father then prostrating herself at his feet she clasped his knees in an agony too great for utterance at the name of father the poor maniac started and gazed on her earnestly with savage wildness while his whole frame became convulsed then rudely disengaging himself from her embrace he ran from her a few paces and dashed himself on the ground in all the violence of phrensy he raved he tore his hair he screamed and uttered the most dreadful execrations and with his teeth shut and his hands clenched he repeated the word father and said the name was mockery to him agnes in mute and tearless despair beheld the dreadful scene in vain did her affrighted child cling to her gown and in its halfformed accents entreat to be taken to her arms again she saw she heeded nothing but her father she was alive to nothing but her own guilt and its consequences and she awaited with horrid composure the cessation of fitzhenrys phrensy or the direction of its fury towards her child at last she saw him fall down exhausted and motionless and tried to hasten to him but she was unable to move and reason and life seemed at once forsaking her when fitzhenry suddenly started up and approached heruncertain as to his purpose agnes caught her child to her bosom and falling again on her knees turned on him her almost closing eyes but his countenance was mildand gently patting her forehead on which hung the damps of approaching insensibility poor thing he cried in a tone of the utmost tenderness and compassion poor thing and then gazed on her with such inquiring and mournful looks that tears once more found their way and relieved her bursting brain while seizing her fathers hand she pressed it with frantic emotion to her lips fitzhenry looked at her with great kindness and suffered her to hold his handthen exclaimed poor thingdont crydont cryi cant cryi have not cried for many yearsnot since my child diedfor she is dead is she not looking earnestly at agnes who could only answer by her tearscome said he come taking hold of her arm then laughing wildly poor thing you will not leave me will youleave you she replied neveri will live with youdie with youtrue true cried he she is dead and we will go visit her graveso saying he dragged agnes forward with great velocity but as it was along the path leading to the town she made no resistance indeed it was such a pleasure to her to see that though he knew her not the sight of her was welcome to her unhappy parent that she sought to avoid thinking of the future and to be alive only to the present she tried also to forget that it was to his not knowing her that she owed the looks of tenderness and pity which he bestowed on her and that the hand which now kindly held hers would if recollection returned throw her from him with just indignation but she was soon awakened to redoubled anguish by hearing fitzhenry as he looked behind him exclaim they are coming they are coming and as he said this he ran with frantic haste across the common agnes immediately looking behind her saw three men pursuing her father at full speed and concluded that they were the keepers of the bedlam whence he had escaped soon after she saw the poor lunatic coming towards her and had scarcely time to lay her child gently on the ground before fitzhenry threw himself in her arms and implored her to save him from his pursuers in an agony that mocks description agnes clasped him to her heart and awaited in trembling agitation the approach of the keepershear me hear me she cried i conjure you to leave him to my care he is my father and you may safely trust him with meyour father replied one of the men and what then child you could do nothing for him and you should be thankful to us young woman for taking him off your handsso come along master come along he continued seizing fitzhenry who could with difficulty be separated from agneswhile another of the keepers laughing as he beheld her wild anguish said we shall have the daughter as well as the father soon i see for i do not believe there is a pin to choose between them but severe as the sufferings of agnes were already a still greater pang awaited her the keepers finding it a very difficult task to confine fitzhenry threw him down and tried by blows to terrify him into acquiescence at this outrage agnes became frantic indeed and followed them with shrieks entreaties and reproaches while the struggling victim called on her to protect him as they bore him by violence along till exhausted with anguish and fatigue she fell insensible on the ground and lost in a deep swoon the consciousness of her misery when she recovered her senses all was still around her and she missed her child then hastily rising and looking round with renewed phrensy she saw it lying at some distance from her and on taking it up she found that it was in a deep sleep the horrid apprehension immediately rushed on her mind that such a sleep in the midst of cold so severe was the sure forerunner of death monster she exclaimed destroyer of thy child as well as fatherbut perhaps it is not yet too late and my curse is not completedso saying she ran or rather flew along the road and seeing a house at a distance she made towards it and bursting open the door beheld a cottager and his family at breakfastthen sinking on her knees and holding out to the woman of the house her sleeping boy for the love of god she cried look here look here save him o save him a mother appealing to the heart of a mother is rarely unsuccessful in her appealthe cottagers wife was as eager to begin the recovery of the child of agnes as agnes herself and in a moment the whole family was employed in its service nor was it long before they were rewarded for their humanity by its complete restoration the joy of agnes was frantic as her grief had beenshe embraced them all by turns in a loud voice invoked blessings on their heads and promised if she was ever rich to make their fortunelastly she caught the still languid boy to her heart and almost drowned it in her tears in the cottager and his family a scene like this excited wonder as well as emotion he and his wife were good parents they loved their childrenwould have been anxious during their illness and would have sorrowed for their loss but to these violent expressions and actions the result of cultivated sensibility they were wholly unaccustomed and could scarcely help imputing them to insanityan idea which the pale cheek and wild look of agnes strongly confirmed nor did it lose strength when agnes who in terror at her childs danger and joy for his safety had forgotten even her father and his situation suddenly recollecting herself exclaimed have i dared to rejoicewretch that i am oh nothere is no joy for me the cottager and his wife on hearing these words looked significantly at each other agnes soon after started up and clasping her hands cried out o my father my dear dear father thou art past cure and despair must be my portion oh you are unhappy because your father is ill observed the cottagers wife but do not be so sorrowful on that account he may get better perhaps never never replied agnesyet who knows aye who knows indeed resumed the good woman but if not you nurse him yourself i suppose and it will be a comfort to you to know he has every thing done for him that can be done agnes sighed deeply i lost my own father continued she last winter and a hard trial it was to be sure but then it consoled me to think i made his end comfortable besides my conscience told me that except here and there i had always done my duty by him to the best of my knowledge agnes started from her seat and walked rapidly round the room he smiled on me resumed her kind hostess wiping her eyes to the last moment and just before the breath left him he said good child good child o it must be a terrible thing to lose ones parents when one has not done ones duty to them at these words agnes contrasting her conduct and feelings with those of this artless and innocent woman was overcome with despair and seizing a knife that lay by her endeavoured to put an end to her existence but the cottager caught her hand in time to prevent the blow and his wife easily disarmed her as her violence instantly changed into a sort of stupor then throwing herself back on the bed on which she was sitting she lay with her eyes fixt and incapable of moving the cottager and his wife now broke forth into expressions of wonder and horror at the crime which she was going to commit and the latter taking little edward from the lap of her daughter held it towards agnessee cried she as the child stretched forth its little arms to embrace herunnatural mother would you forsake your child these words assisted by the caresses of the child himself roused agnes from her stuporforsake him never never she faltered out then snatching him to her bosom she threw herself back on a pillow which the good woman had placed under her head and soon to the great joy of the compassionate family both mother and child fell into a sound sleep the cottager then repaired to his daily labour and his wife and children began their household tasks but ever and anon they cast a watchful glance on their unhappy guest dreading lest she should make a second attempt on her life the sleep of both agnes and her child was so long and heavy that night was closing in when the little boy awoke and by his cries for food broke the rest of his unhappy mother but consciousness returned not with returning senseagnes looked around her astonished at her situation at length by slow degrees the dreadful scenes of the preceding night and her own rash attempt burst on her recollection she shuddered at the retrospect and clasping her hands together remained for some moments in speechless prayerthen she arose and smiling mournfully at sight of her little edward eating voraciously the milk and bread that was set before him she seated herself at the table and tried to partake of the coarse but wholesome food provided for her as she approached she saw the cottagers wife remove the knives this circumstance forcibly recalled her rash action and drove away her returning appetiteyou may trust me now she said i shrink with horror from my wicked attempt on my life and swear in the face of heaven never to repeat it nomy only wish now is to live and to suffer soon after the cottagers wife made an excuse for bringing back a knife to the table to prove to agnes her confidence in her word but this wellmeant attention was lost on hershe sat leaning on her elbow and wholly absorbed in her own meditations when it was completely night agnes arose to departmy kind friends said she who have so hospitably received and entertained a wretched wanderer believe me i shall never forget the obligations which i owe you though i can never hope to repay them but accept this taking her last halfguinea from her pocket as a pledge of my inclination to reward your kindness if i am ever rich you shall here her voice failed her and she burst into tears this hesitation gave the virtuous people whom she addressed an opportunity of rejecting her offerswhat we did we did because we could not help it said the cottageryou would not have had me see a fellowcreature going to kill soul and body too and not prevent it would youand as to saving the child cried the wife am i not a mother myself and can i help feeling for a mother poor little thing it looked so piteous too and felt so cold agnes could not speak but still by signs she tendered the money to their acceptanceno no resumed the cottager keep it for those who may not be willing to do you a service for nothingand agnes reluctantly replaced the halfguinea but then a fresh source of altercation began the cottager insisted on seeing agnes to the town and she insisted on going by herself at last she agreed that he should go with her as far as the street where her friends lived wait for her at the end of it and if they were not living or were removed she was to return and sleep at the cottage then with a beating heart and dejected countenance agnes took her child in her arms and leaning on her companion with slow and unsteady steps she began to walk to her native place once the scene of her happiness and her glory but now about to be the witness of her misery and her shame as they drew near the town agnes saw on one side of the road a new building and instantly hurried from it as fast as her trembling limbs could carry herdid you hear them asked the cottagerhear whom said agnesthe poor creatures returned her companion who are confined there that is the new bedlam andhark what a loud scream that was agnes unable to support herself staggered to a bench that projected from the court surrounding the building while the cottager unconscious why she stopped observed it was strange that she should like to stay and hear the poor creaturesfor his part he thought it shocking to hear them shriek and still more so to hear them laughfor it is so piteous said he to hear those laugh who have so much reason to cry agnes had not power to interrupt him and he went onthis house was built by subscription and it was begun by a kind gentleman of the name of fitzhenry who afterwards poor soul being made low in the world by losses in trade and by having his brain turned by a goodfornothing daughter was one of the first patients in it himselfhere agnes to whom this recollection had but too forcibly occurred already groaned aloud what tired so soon said her companion i doubt you have not been used to stir aboutyou have been too tenderly brought up ah tender parents often spoil children and they never thank them for it when they grow up neither and often come to no good besides agnes was going to make some observations wrung from her by the poignancy of selfupbraiding when she heard a loud cry as of one in agony fancying it her fathers voice she started up and stopping her ears ran towards the town so fast that it was with difficulty that the cottager could overtake her when he did so he was surprised at the agitation of her mannerwhat i suppose you thought they were coming after you said he but there was no dangeri dare say it was only an unruly one whom they were beatingagnes on hearing this absolutely screamed with agony and seizing the cottagers arm let us hasten to the town said she in a hollow and broken voice while i have strength enough left to carry me thither at length they entered its walls and the cottager said here we are at lasta welcome home to you young womanwelcome and home to me cried agnes wildlyi have no home nowi can expect no welcome once indeed here overcome with recollections almost too painful to be endured she turned from him and sobbed aloud while the kindhearted man could scarcely forbear shedding tears at sight of such mysterious yet evidently real distress in happier days when agnes used to leave home on visits to her distant friends anticipation of the welcome she should receive on her return was perhaps the greatest pleasure that she enjoyed during her absence as the adventurer to india while toiling for wealth never loses sight of the hope that he shall spend his fortune in his native landso agnes whatever company she saw whatever amusements she partook of looked eagerly forward to the hour when she should give her expecting father and her affectionate companions a recital of all that she had heard and seen for though she had been absent a few weeks only her presence made a little holiday and she was received by fitzhenry with delight too deep to be expressed while even earlier than decorum warranted her friends were thronging to her door to welcome home the heightener of their pleasures and the gentle soother of their sorrows for agnes loved and felt for all she had a smile ready to greet the child of prosperity and a tear for the child of adversityas she was thus honoured thus beloved no wonder the thoughts of home and of returning home were wont to suffuse the eyes of agnes with tears of exquisite pleasure and that when her native town appeared in view a group of expecting and joyful faces used to swim before her sight while hastening forward to have the first glance of her fancy used to picture her fathernow dread reverse after a long absence an absence of years she was returning to the same place inhabited by the same friends but the voices that used to be loud in pronouncing her welcome would now be loud in proclaiming indignation at her sight the eyes that used to beam with gladness at her presence would now be turned from her with disgust and the fond father who used to be counting the moments till she arrived was nowi shall not go onsuffice that agnes felt to her hearts core all the bitterness of the contrast when they arrived near the place of her destination agnes stopped and told the cottager that they must partso much the worse said the good man i do now know how it is but you are so sorrowful yet so kind and gentle somehow that both my wife and i have taken a liking to youyou must not be angry but we cannot help thinking you are not one of us but a lady though you are so disguised and so humblebut misfortune spares no one you know agnes affected and gratified by these artless expressions of good will replied i have indeed known better daysand will again i hope with all my heart and soul interrupted the cottager with great warmthi fear not replied agnes my dear worthy friendnay young lady rejoined he my wife and i are proper to be your servants not friendsyou are my friends perhaps my only friends returned agnes mournfully perhaps there is not at this moment another hand in the universe that would not reject mine or another tongue that would not upbraid methey must be hardhearted wretches indeed who could upbraid a poor woman for her misfortunes cried the cottager however you shall never want a friend while i live you know i saved your life and somehow i feel therefore as if you belonged to me i once saved one of my pigeons from a hawk and i believe were i starving i could not now bear to kill the little creature it would seem like eating my own flesh and bloodso i am sure i could never desert youyou have not yet heard my story replied agnes but you shall know who i am soon and then if you still feel disposed to offer me your friendship i shall be proud to accept it the house to which agnes was hastening was that of her nurse from whom she had always experienced the affection of a mother and hoped now to receive a temporary asylum but she might not be livingand with a beating heart agnes knocked at the door it was opened by fanny her nurses daughter the playfellow of agness childhoodthank heaven said agnes as she hastened back to the cottager i hope i have at least one friend left and telling him he might go home again as she was almost certain of shelter for the night the poor man shook her heartily by the hand prayed god to bless her and departed agnes then returned to fanny who was still standing by the door wondering who had knocked at so late an hour and displeased at being kept so long in the coldwill you admit me fanny and give me shelter for the night said agnes in a faint and broken voicegracious heaven who are you cried fanny starting back do you not know me she replied looking earnestly in her facefanny again started then bursting into tears as she drew agnes forward and closed the dooro god it is my dear young ladyand are you sorry to see me replied agnessorry answered the otheroh no but to see you thuso my dear lady what you must have suffered thank heaven my poor mother is not alive to see this day and is she dead cried agnes turning very faint and catching hold of a chair to keep her from falling then is the measure of my affliction full i have lost my oldest and best friendi am not dead said fanny respectfullyexcellent kind creature continued agnes i hoped so much alleviation of my misery from her affectiondo you hope none from mine rejoined fanny in a tone of reproachindeed my dear young lady i love you as well as my mother did and will do as much for you as she would have done do i not owe all i have to you and now that you are in trouble perhaps in want toobut no that cannot and shall not be wringing her hands and pacing the room with frantic violence i cant bear to think of such a thing that ever i should live to see my dear young lady in want of the help which she was always so ready to give agnes tried to comfort her but the sight of her distress notwithstanding was soothing to her as it convinced her that she was still dear to one pure and affectionate heart during this time little edward remained covered up so closely that fanny did not know what the bundle was that agnes held in her lap but when she lifted up the cloak that concealed him fanny was in an instant kneeling by his side and gazing on him with admiration is itis it said fanny with hesitationit is my child replied agnes sighing and fanny lavished on the unconscious boy the caresses which respect forbade her to bestow on the mother fanny said agnes you say nothing of your husbandhe is dead replied fanny with emotionhave you any childrennonethen will you promise me if i die to be a mother to this childfanny seized her hand and in a voice half choked by sobs said i promise youenough cried agnes then holding out her arms to her humble friend fannys respect yielded to affection and falling on agness neck she sobbed aloud my dear fanny said agnes i have a question to ask and i charge you to answer it trulydo not ask me do not ask me for indeed i dare not answer you replied fanny in great agitation agnes guessed the cause and hastened to tell her that the question was not concerning her father as she was acquainted with his situation already and proceeded to ask whether her elopement and ill conduct had at all hastened the death of her nurse who was in ill health when she went awayoh no replied fanny she never believed that you could be gone off willingly but was sure you was spirited away and she died expecting that you would some day return and take the law of the villain and no doubt she was right though nobody thinks so now but me for you were always too good to do wrong agnes was too honourable to take to herself the merit which she did not deserve she therefore owned that she was indeed guilty nor should i she added have dared to intrude myself on you or solicit you to let me remain under your roof were i not severely punished for my crime and resolved to pass the rest of my days in solitude and labouryou should not presume to intrude yourself on me replied fannydo not talk thus if you do not mean to break my heartnay fanny answered agnes it would be presumption in any woman who has quitted the path of virtue to intrude herself however high her rank might be on the meanest of her acquaintance whose honour is spotless nor would i thus throw myself on your generosity were i not afraid that if i were to be unsoothed by the presence of a sympathizing friend i should sink beneath my sorrows and want resolution to fulfill the hard task which my duty enjoins me i shall not attempt to describe the anguish of fanny when she thought of her young lady the pride of her heart as she used to call her being reduced so low in the world nor the sudden bursts of joy to which she gave way the next moment when she reflected that agnes was returned never perhaps to leave her again agnes wore away great part of the night in telling fanny her mournful tale and in hearing from her a full account of her fathers sufferings bankruptcy and consequent madness at daybreak she retired to bednot to sleep but to ruminate on the romantic yet in her eyes feasible plan which she had formed for the futurewhile fanny wearied out by the violent emotions which she had undergone sobbed herself to sleep by her side the next morning agnes did not rise till fanny had been up some time and when she seated herself at the breakfasttable she was surprised to see it spread in a manner which ill accorded with her or fannys situation on asking the reason fanny owned she could not bear that her dear young lady should fare as she did only and had therefore provided a suitable breakfast for herbut you forget said agnes that if i remain with you neither you nor i can afford such breakfasts as thesetrue replied fanny mournfully then you must consider this as only a welcome madamaye replied agnes the prodigal is returned and you have killed the fatted calf fanny burst into tears while agnes shocked at having excited them by the turn which she unguardedly gave to her poor friends attention tried to sooth her into composure and affected a gaiety which she was far from feeling now then to my first task said agnes rising as soon as she had finished her breakfast i am going to call on mr seymour you say he lives where he formerly didto call on mr seymour exclaimed fanny o my dear madam do not go near him i beseech you he is a very severe man and will affront you depend upon itno matter rejoined agnes i have deserved humiliation and will not shrink from it but his daughter caroline you know was once my dearest friend and she will not suffer him to trample on the fallen besides it is necessary that i should apply to him in order to succeed in my schemewhat scheme replied fannyyou would not approve it fanny therefore i shall not explain it to you at present but when i return perhaps i shall tell you allbut you are not going so soon not in daylight surelyif you should be insulted agnes started with horror at this proof which fanny had unguardedly given how hateful her guilt had made her in a place that used to echo with her praisesbut recovering herself she said that she should welcome insults as part of the expiation which she meant to perform but if you will not avoid them for your own sake pray pray do for mine exclaimed fanny if you were to be ill used i am sure i should never survive it so if you must go to mr seymours at least oblige me in not going before darkand affected by this fresh mark of her attachment agnes consented to stay at six oclock in the evening while the family was sitting round the fire and caroline seymour was expecting the arrival of her lover to whom she was to be united in a few days agnes knocked at mr seymours door having positively forbidden fanny to accompany her caroline being on the watch for her intended bridegroom started at the sound and though the knock which agnes gave did not much resemble that of an impatient lover still it might be hehe might mean to surprise her and half opening the parlour door she listened with a beating heart for the servants answering the knock by this means she distinctly heard agnes ask whether mr seymour was at home the servant started and stammered out that he believed his master was withinwhile caroline springing forward exclaimed i know that voiceo yes it must be shebut her father seizing her arm pushed her back into the parlour saying i also know that voice and i command you to stay where you arethen going up to agnes he desired her to leave his house directly as it should be no harbour for abandoned women and unnatural children but will you not allow it to shelter for one moment the wretched and the penitent she repliedfather my dear dear father cried caroline again coming forward but was again driven back by mr seymour who turning to agnes bade her claim shelter from the man for whom she had left the best of parents and desiring the servant to shut the door in her face he reentered the parlour whence agnes distinctly heard the sobs of the compassionate caroline but the servant was kinder than the master and could not obey the orders which he had receivedo madam miss fitzhenry do you not know me said he i once lived with you have you forgotten little william i shall never forget you you were the sweetesttempered young ladythat ever i should see you thus before agnes could reply mr seymour again angrily asked why his orders were not obeyed and agnes checking her emotion besought william to deliver a message to his master tell him said she all i ask of him is that he will use his interest to get me the place of servant in the house the bedlam i would say wherehe will know what i mean she added unable to utter the conclusion of the sentenceand william in a broken voice delivered the message o my poor agnes cried caroline passionatelya servant she a servant and in such a place toowilliam adding in a low voice ah miss and she looks so poor and wretched meanwhile mr seymour was walking up and down the room hesitating how to act but reflecting that it was easier to forbid any communication with agnes than to check it if once begun he again desired william to shut the door against her you must do it yourself then replied william for i am not hardhearted enoughand mr seymour summoning up resolution told agnes that there were other governors to whom she might apply and then locked the door against her himselfwhile agnes slowly and sorrowfully turned her steps towards the more hospitable roof of fanny she had not gone far however when she heard a light footstep behind her and her name pronounced in a gentle faltering voice turning round she beheld caroline seymour who seizing her hand forced something into it hastily pressed it to her lips and without saying one word suddenly disappeared leaving agnes motionless as a statue and but for the parcel she held in her hand disposed to think that she was dreamingthen eager to see what it contained she hastened back to fanny who heard with indignation the reception which she had met from mr seymour but on her knees invoked blessings on the head of caroline when on opening the parcel she found that it contained twenty guineas inclosed in a paper on which was written but almost effaced with tears for my still dear agneswould i dare say more this money the generous girl had taken from that allowed her for weddingclothes and felt more delight in relieving with it the wants even of a guilty fellowcreature than purchasing the most splendid dress could have afforded her and her present did more than she expected it relieved the mind of agnes she had taught herself to meet without repining the assaults of poverty but not to encounter with calmness the scorn of the friends whom she loved but caroline and her kindness soon vanished again from her mind and the idea of her father and her scheme took entire possession of itbut it might not succeed no doubt mr seymour would be her enemystill he had hinted that she might apply to the other governors and fanny having learnt that they were all to meet at the bedlam on business the next day she resolved to write a note requesting to be allowed to appear before them this note fanny who was not acquainted with its contents undertook to deliver and to the great surprise of agnes as she expected that mr seymour would oppose it her request was instantly granted indeed it was he himself who urged the compliance there was not a kinderhearted man in the world than mr seymour and in his severity towards agnes he acted more from what he thought his duty than from his inclination he was the father of several daughters and it was his opinion that a parent could not too forcibly inculcate on the minds of young women the salutary truth that loss of virtue must be to them the loss of friends besides his eldest daughter caroline was going to be married to the son of a very severe rigid mother then on a visit at the house and he feared that if he took any notice of the fallen agnes the old lady might conceive a prejudice against him and her daughterinlaw added to these reasons mr seymour was a very vain man and never acted in any way without saying to himself what will the world say hence though his first impulses were frequently good the determinations of his judgement were often contemptible but however satisfied mr seymour might be with his motives on this occasion his feelings revolted at the consciousness of the anguish which he had occasioned agnes he wished ardently wished that he had dared to have been kinder and when caroline who was incapable of the meanness of concealing any action which she thought it right to perform told him of the gift which she had in person bestowed on agnes he could scarcely forbear commending her conduct and while he forbade any future intercourse between them he was forced to turn away his head to hide the tear of gratified sensibility and the smile of parental exultation nevertheless he did not omit to bid her keep her own counsel for if your conduct were known added he what would the world say no wonder then that softened as he was by agness application though he deemed the scheme wild and impracticable and afraid that he had treated her unkindly he was pleased to have an opportunity of obliging her without injuring himself and that her request to the governors was strengthened by his representations nor is it extraordinary that alive as he always was to the opinion of everyone he should dread seeing agnes after the reception which he had given her more than she dreaded to appear before the board agnes who had borrowed of fanny the dress of a respectable maidservant when summoned to attend the governors entered the room with modest but dignified composure prepared to expect contumely but resolved to endure it as became a contrite heartbut no contumely awaited her in the hour of her prosperity she had borne her faculties so meekly and had been so careful never to humble any one by showing a consciousness of superiority that she had been beloved even more than she had been admired and hard indeed must the heart of that man have been who could have rejoiced that she herself was humbled a dead nay a solemn silence took place on her entrance every one present beheld with surprise and with stolen looks of pity the ravages which remorse and anguish had made in her form and the striking change in her apparel for every one had often followed with delight her graceful figure through the dance and gazed with admiration on the tasteful varieties of her dress every one had listened with pleasure to the winning sound of her voice and envied fitzhenry the possession of such a daughter as they now beheld her these recollections forcibly occurred to themthey agonizedthey overcame themthey thought of their own daughters and secretly prayed heaven to keep them from the voice of the seduceraway went all their resolutions to receive agnes with that open disdain and detestation which her crime deserved the sight of her disarmed them and not one amongst them had for some moments firmness enough to speak at last pray sit down miss fitzhenry said the president in a voice hoarse with emotion here is a chair added another and mr seymour bowing as he did it placed a seat for her near the fire agnes who had made up her mind to bear expected indignity with composure was not proof against unexpected kindness and hastily turning to the window she gave vent to her sensations in an agony of tears but recollecting the importance of the business on which she came she struggled with her feelings and on being desired by the president to explain to the board what she wanted she began to address them in a faint and faltering voice however as she proceeded she gained courage remembering that it was her interest to affect her auditors and make them enter warmly into her feelings and designs she told her whole story in as concise a manner as possible from the time of her leaving clifford to her rencontre with her father in the forest and his being torn from her by the keepers and when she was unable to go on from the violence of her emotions she had the satisfaction of seeing that the tears of her auditors kept pace with her own when her narrative was ended she proceeded thus i come now gentlemen to the reason why i have troubled you with this narrationfrom the impression which the sight of me made on my father i feel a certain conviction that were i constantly with him i might in time be able to restore him to that reason of which my guilt had deprived him to effect this purpose it is my wish to become a servant in this house if i should not succeed in my endeavours i am so sure he will have pleasure in seeing me that i feel it my duty to be with him even on that account and if there be any balm for a heart and conscience so wounded as mine i must find it in devoting all my future days to alleviate though i cannot cure the misery which i have occasioned and if added she with affecting enthusiasm it should please heaven to smile on my endeavours to restore him to reason how exquisite will be my satisfaction in labouring to maintain him to this plan it is to be supposed the governors saw more objection than agnes did but though they rejected the idea of her being a servant in the house they were not averse to giving her an opportunity of making the trial which she desired if it were only to alleviate her evident wretchedness and having consulted the medical attendants belonging to the institution they ordered that agnes should be permitted two hours at a time morning and evening to see fitzhenry and she who had not dared to flatter herself that she should obtain so much was too full of emotion to show otherwise than by incoherent expressions and broken sentences her sense of the obligation our next care observed the president must be as friends of your poor father to see what we can do for your future supportthat sir i shall provide for myself replied agnes i will not eat the bread of idleness as well as of shame and affliction and shall even rejoice in being obliged to labour for my support and that of my childhappy if in fulfilling well the duties of a mother i may make some atonement for having violated those of a daughter but miss fitzhenry answered the president accept at least some assistance from us till you can find means of maintaining yourselfnever never cried agnes i thank you for your kindness but i will not accept it nor do i need it i have already accepted assistance from one kind friend and merely because i should under similar circumstances have been hurt at having a gift of mine refused but allow me to say that from the wretchedness into which my guilt has plunged me nothing henceforward but my industry shall relieve me so saying she curtsied to the gentlemen and hastily withdrew leaving them all deeply affected by her narrative and her proposed expiatory plan of life and ready to grant her their admiration should she have resolution to fulfill her good intentions after the strong impression which the meeting with her father in the forest had made on her mind should have been weakened by time and occupation agnes hastened from the governors room to put in force the leave which she had obtained and was immediately conducted to fitzhenrys cell she found him with his back to the door drawing with a piece of coal on the wall as he did not observe her entrance she had an opportunity of looking over his shoulder and she saw that he had drawn the shape of a coffin and was then writing on the lid the name of agnes a groan which involuntarily escaped her made him turn round at sight of her he started and looked wildly as he had done in the forest then shaking his head and sighing deeply he resumed his employment still occasionally looking back at agnes who at length overcome by her feelings threw herself on the bed beside him and burst into tears hearing her sobs he immediately turned round again and patting her cheek as he had done on their first meeting said poor thing poor thing and fixing his eyes steadfastly on her face while agnes turned towards him and pressed his hand to her lips he gazed on her as before with a look of anxious curiosity then turning from her muttered to himself she is dead for all that soon after he asked her to take a walk with him adding in a whisper we will go find her grave and taking her under his arm he led her to the garden smiling on her from time to time as if it gave him pleasure to see her and sometimes laughing as if at some secret satisfaction which he would not communicate when they had made one turn round the garden he suddenly stopped and began singingtears such as tender fathers shed that affecting song of handels which he used to delight to hear agnes sing i cant go on he observed looking at agnes can you as if there were in his mind some association between her and that song and agnes with a bursting heart took up the air where he left off fitzhenry listened with restless agitation and when she had finished he desired her to sing it again but say the words first he added and agnes repeated tears such as tender fathers shed warm from my aged eyes descend for joy to think when i am dead my son will have mankind his friend no no cried fitzhenry with quickness for joy to think when i am dead agnes will have mankind her friend i used to sing it so and so did she when i bade her oh she sung it so wellbut she can sing it no more now for she is dead and we will go look for her grave then he walked hastily round the garden while agnes whom the words of this song by recalling painful recollections had almost deprived of reason sat down on a bench nearly insensible till he again came to her and taking her hand said in a hurried manner you will not leave me will you on her answering no in a very earnest and passionate manner he looked delighted and saying poor thing again gazed on her intently and again agness hopes that he would in time know her returnedvery pale very pale cried fitzhenry the next moment stroking her cheek and she had such a bloomsing again for the love of god sing againand in a hoarse broken voice agnes complied she sung better than you rejoined he when she had doneso sweet so clear it wasbut she is gone so saying he relapsed into total indifference to agnes and every thing around himand again her newraised hopes vanished the keeper now told her it was time for her to depart and she mournfully arose but first seizing her fathers hand she leaned for a moment her head on his arm then bidding god bless him walked to the door with the keeper but on seeing her about to leave him fitzhenry ran after her as fast as his heavy irons would let him wildly exclaiming you shall not goyou shall not go agnes overjoyed at this evident proof of the pleasure her presence gave him looked at the keeper for permission to stay but as he told her it would be against the rules she thought it more prudent to submit and before fitzhenry could catch hold of her in order to detain her by force she ran through the house and the grated door was closed on her and this said agnes to herself turning round to survey the melancholy mansion which she had left while mingled sounds of groans shrieks shouts laughter and the clanking of irons burst upon her ears this is the abode of my father and provided for him by methis is the recompense bestowed on him by the daughter whom he loved and trusted in return for years of unparalleled fondness and indulgence the idea was too horrible and agnes calling up all the energy of her mind remembered the uselessness of regret for the past but thought with pleasure on the advantages of amendment for the present and the future and by the time she reached fannys door her mind had recovered its sad composure her countenance at her return was very different to what it had been at her departure hope animated her sunk eye and she seemed full of joyful though distant expectations nay so much was she absorbed in pleasing anticipations that she feebly returned the caresses of her child who climbed up her knees to express his joy at seeing her and even while she kissed his ruddy cheek her eye looked beyond it with the open gaze of absence i have seen him again she cried turning to fanny and he almost knew me he will know me entirely in time and next he will know every thing and then i shall be happy fanny to whom agnes had given no clue to enable her to understand this language was alarmed for her intellects till she explained her plans and her hopes which fanny though she could not share in them was too humane to discourage but now continued agnes let us consult on my future means of gaining a livelihood and finding that fanny besides keeping a dayschool took in shawlwork a considerable shawl manufacture being carried on in the town it was settled that she would procure the same employment for agnes and that a small back room in fannys little dwelling should be fitted up for her use in the mean while the governors of the bedlam had returned to their respective habitations with feelings towards agnes very different to those with which they had assembled but too prudent to make even a penitent sinner the subject of praise in their own families they gave short evasive answers to the inquiries that were made there mr seymour on the contrary thought it his duty to relieve the generous and affectionate heart of his daughter by a minute detail of what had passed at the meeting but he had no opportunity of doing this when he first returned home as he found there a large party assembled to dinner caroline however watched his countenance and manner and seeing on the first an expression of highlyawakened feelings and in the latter a degree of absence and aversion to talking which it always displayed whenever his heart had been deeply interested she flattered herself that agnes was the cause of these appearances and hoped to hear of something to her advantage during dinner a lady asked caroline which of her young friends would accompany her to church in the capacity of bridemaid caroline started and turned pale at the questionfor melancholy were the reflections which it excited in her mind it had always been an agreement between her and agnes that whichever of the two was married first should have the other for her bridemaid and the question was repeated before caroline could trust her voice to answer it i shall have no bridemaids but my sisters she replied at length with a quivering lip i cannot indeed i wish to have no other now then looking at her father she saw that his eyes were filled with tears and unable to suppress but wishing to conceal his emotion he abruptly left the room there is scarcely any human being whose heart has not taught him that we are never so compassionate and benevolent towards others as when our own wishes are completely gratifiedwe are never so humble as then this was the case with mr seymour he was about to marry his eldest daughter in a manner even superior to his warmest expectations and his paternal care therefore was amply rewarded but his heart told him that his care and his affection had not exceeded perhaps not equalled that of fitzhenry nor had the promise of his daughters youth fair as it was ever equalled that of the unhappy agnes yet caroline was going to aggrandize her family and agnes had disgraced hers she was happyagnes miserable he was the possessor of a large fortune and all the comforts of life and fitzhenry was in a madhouse this contrast between their situations was forcibly recalled to his mind by the question addressed to caroline and already softened by the interview of the morning he could not support his feelings but was obliged to hasten to his chamber to vent in tears and thanksgivings the mingled sensations of humility and gratitude caroline soon followed him and heard with emotions as violent her fathers description of agness narration and her conduct before the governors but it is not sufficient said she that you tell me this you must tell it wherever you hear the poor penitents name mentioned and avow the change which it has made in your sentiments towards her you must be her advocate her advocate what would the world say just what you wish it to say believe me my dear father the world is in many instances like a spoiled child who treats with contempt the foolish parent that indulges his caprices but behaves with respect to those who regardless of his clamours give the law to him instead of receiving it you speak from the untaught enthusiasm and confidence of youth caroline but experience will teach you that no one can with impunity run counter to the opinions of the world my experience has taught me that already but in this case you do not seem to do the world justice the world would blame you and justly too if while talking of the unhappy agnes you should make light of her guilt but why not while you acknowledge that to be enormous descant with equal justice on the deep sense of it which she entertains and on the excellence of her present intentions to this what can the world say but that you are a just judge and even suppose they should think you too lenient a one will not the approbation of your own conscience be an ample consolation for such a condemnation o my dear father were you not one of the best and most unspoilable of men your anxious attention to what the world will say of your actions must long ere this have made you one of the worst enough enough cried mr seymour wounded selflove contending in his bosom with parental pride for he had some suspicion that caroline was right what would the world say if it were to hear you schooling your father when the world hears me trying to exalt my own wisdom by doubting my fathers i hope it will treat me with the severity which i shall deserve mr seymour clasped her to his bosom as she said this and involuntarily exclaimed oh poor fitzhenryand poor agnes tooretorted caroline throwing her arms round his neck it will be my parting request when i leave my paternal roof that you will do all the justice you can to my oncehonoured friendand let the world say what it pleaseswell well i will indulge you by granting your request cried mr seymour or rather i will indulge myself and then contented with each other they returned to the company a few days after this conversation carolines marriage took place and was celebrated by the ringing of bells and other rejoicings what are the bells ringing for today said agnes to fanny as she was eating her breakfast with more appetite than usual fanny hesitated and then in a peevish tone replied that she supposed they rang for miss caroline seymour as she was married that morningadding such a fuss indeed such preparations one would think nobody was ever married before yet spitefully as fanny spoke this she had no dislike to the amiable caroline her pettishness proceeded merely from her love for agnes just such preparations just such rejoicings she had hoped to see one day for the marriage of her dear young ladyand though agnes had not perceived it fanny had for the last two days shed many a tear of regret and mortification while news of the intended wedding reached her ear on every side and she had not courage to tell agnes what she heard lest the feelings of agnes on the occasion should resemble hers but in a more painful degree caroline seymour married cried agnes rising from her unfinished meal well married i hopeo yes very well indeedmr seymour is so proud of the connexion thank god said agnes ferventlymay she be as happy as her virtues deserveand then with a hasty step she retired to her own apartment it is certain that agnes had a mind above the meanness of envy and that she did not repine at the happiness of her friend yet while with tears trickling down her cheek she faltered out the words happy carolinemr seymour proud well may he be so her feelings were as bitter as those which envy excites oh my poor father i once hoped added she but overcome with the acuteness of regret and remorse she threw herself on the bed in speechless anguish then the image of caroline as she last saw her weeping for her misfortunes and administering to her wants recurred to her mind and in a transport of affection and gratitude she took the paper that contained the gift from her bosom kissed the blotted scrawl on the back of it and prayed fervently for her happiness but surely cried she starting up and running into the next room to fanny i should write a few lines of congratulation to the bride fanny did not answer indeed she could not for the affectionate creature was drowned in tears which agnes well understood and was gratified though pained to behold at length still more ashamed of her own weakness when she saw it reflected in another agnes gently reproved fanny telling her it seemed as if she repined at miss seymours happiness no replied fanny i only repine at your misery dear me she is a sweet young lady to be sure but no more to be compared to youhush fanny tis i who am now not to be compared to herremember my misery is owing to my guiltit is not the less to be repined at on that account replied fanny to this remark unconsciously severe agnes with a sigh assented and unable to continue the conversation in this strain she again asked whether fanny did not think she ought to congratulate the generous caroline by all means replied fanny but before she answered agnes had determined that it would be kinder in her not to damp the joy of caroline by calling to her mind the image of a wretched friend true she observed it would gratify my feelings to express the love and gratitude i bear her and my selflove would exult in being recollected by her with tenderness and regret even in the hour of her bridal splendour but the gratification would only be a selfish one and therefore i will reject it having formed this laudable resolution agnes after trying to compose her agitated spirits by playing with her child who was already idolized by the faithful fanny bent her steps as usual to the cell of her father unfortunately for agnes she was obliged to pass the house of mr seymour and at the door she saw the carriages waiting to convey the bride and her train to the country seat of her motherinlaw agnes hurried on as fast as her trembling limbs could carry her but as she cast a hasty glance on the splendid liveries and the crowd gazing on them she saw mr seymour bustling at the door with all the pleased consequence of a happy parent in his countenance and not daring to analyse her feelings she rushed forward from the mirthful scene and did not stop again till she found herself at the door of the bedlam but when there and when looking up at its grated windows she contemplated it as the habitation of her fatherso different to that of the father of carolineand beheld in fancy the woeworn sallow face of fitzhenry so unlike the healthy satisfied look of mr seymouri cant go in i cant see him today she faintly articulated overcome with a sudden faintnessand as soon as she could recover her strength she returned home and shutting herself up in her own apartment spent the rest of the day in that mournful and solitary meditation that maketh the heart better it would no doubt have gratified the poor mourner to have known that surrounded by joyous and congratulating friends caroline sighed for the absent agnes and felt the want of her congratulationssurely she will write to me said she mentally i am sure she wishes me happy and one of my greatest pangs at leaving my native place is the consciousness that i leave her miserable the last words that caroline uttered as she bade adieu to the domestics were be sure to send after me any note or letter that may come but no note or letter from agnes arrived and had caroline known the reason she would have loved her once happy friend the more the next day earlier than usual agnes went in quest of her father she did not absolutely flatter herself that he had missed her the day before still she did not think it impossible that he might she dared not however ask the question but luckily for her the keeper told her unasked that fitzhenry was observed to be restless and looking out of the door of his cell frequently both morning and evening as if expecting somebody and that at night as he was going to bed he asked whether the lady had not been there indeed cried agnes her eyes sparkling with pleasurewhere is helet me see him directly but after the first joyful emotion which he always showed at seeing her had subsided she could not flatter herself that his symptoms were more favourable than before the keeper also informed her that he had been thrown into so violent a raving fit by the agitation he felt at parting with her the last time she was there that she must contrive to slip away unperceived whenever she came and this visit having passed away without any thing material occurring agnes contrived to make her escape unseen on her return she repeated to fanny several times with a sort of pathetic pleasure the question her father had askedhe inquired whether the lady had not been therethink of that fanny while so incoherent was her language and so absent were her looks that fanny again began to fear her afflictions had impaired her reason after staying a few days with the newmarried couple mr seymour returned home caroline having before he left her again desired him to be the friend of the penitent agnes whenever he heard her unpityingly attacked and an opportunity soon offered of gratifying his daughters benevolence and his own mr seymour was drinking tea in a large party when a lady to whose plain awkward uninteresting daughters the once beautiful graceful and engaging agnes had formerly been a powerful rival said with no small share of malignity sofine impudence indeedi hear that good for nothing minx fitzhenrys daughter is come to town i wonder for my part she dares show her face herebut the assurance of these creatures is amazing aye so it is echoed from one lady to another but this girl must be a hardened wretch indeed resumed mrs macfiendy the first speaker i suppose her fellow is tired of her and she will be on the town soon in the churchyard rather replied mr seymour whom a feeling of resentment at these vulgar expressions of female spite had hitherto kept silentmiss fitzhenry has lost all power of charming the eye of the libertine and even the wishbut she is an object whom the compassionate and humane cannot behold or listen to without the strongest emotion no to be sure replied mrs macfiendy bridlingthe girl had always a plausible tongue of her ownand as to her beauty i never thought that was made for lastingwhat then you have seen her mr seymour i wonder that you could condescend to look at such trash yes madam i have seen and heard her tooand if heartfelt misery contrition and true penitence may hope to win favour in the sight of god and expiate past offences a ministering angel might this frail one be though we lay howling i lie howling indeed screamed out mrs macfiendy speak for yourself if you please mr seymour for my part i do not expect when i go to another world to keep such company as miss fitzhenry if with the same measure you mete it should be meted to you again madam replied mr seymour i believe there is little chance in another world that you and miss fitzhenry will be visiting acquaintance then bespeaking the attention of the company he gave that account of agnes her present situation and her intentions for the future which she gave the governors and all the company save the outrageously virtuous mother and her daughters heard it with as much emotion as he felt in relating itexclamations of poor unfortunate girl what a pity she should have been guiltybut fallen as she is she is still agnes fitzhenry resounded through the room mrs macfiendy could not bear this in silence but with a cheek pale nay livid with malignity and in a voice sharpened by passion which at all times resembled the scream of a peahen she exclaimed well for my part some people may do any thing yet be praised up to the skies other peoples daughters would not find such mercy before she went off it was miss fitzhenry this and miss fitzhenry thatthough other peoples children could perhaps do as much though they were not so fond of showing what they could do no cried one of the miss macfiendys miss fitzhenry had courage enough for any thing true child resumed the mother and what did it end in why in becoming awhat i do not choose to name fie madam fie cried mr seymour why thus exult over the fallen oh then you do allow her to be fallen she is fallen indeed madam said mr seymour but even in her proudest hour miss fitzhenry never expressed herself towards her erring neighbours with unchristian severitybut set you an example of forbearance which you would do well to follow she set me an example vociferated mrs macfiendyshe indeed a creaturei will not stay nor shall my daughters to hear such immoral talk but tis as i saidsome people may do any thingfor wicked as she is miss fitzhenry is still cried up as something extraordinary and is even held up as an example to modest women so saying she arose but mr seymour rose also and said there is no necessity for your leaving the company madam as i will leave it for i am tired of hearing myself so grossly misrepresented no one abhors more than i do the crime of miss fitzhenry and no one would more strongly object for the sake of other young women to her being again received into general company but at the same time i will always be ready to encourage the penitent by the voice of just praise and i feel delight in reflecting that however the judges of this world may be fond of condemning her she will one day appeal from them to a merciful and longsuffering judge then bowing respectfully to all but mrs macfiendy he withdrew and gave her an opportunity of remarking that mr seymour was mighty warm in the creatures defence she did not know he was so interested about her but she always thought him a gay man and she supposed miss fitzhenry as he called her would be glad to take up with any thing now this speech sorry am i to say was received with a general and complaisant smile though it was reckoned unjust for there are few who have virtue and resolution enough to stand forward as champions for an absent and calumniated individual if there be any thing ludicrous in the tale against himand the precise careful elderly mr seymour who was always shrinking from censure like a sensitive plant from the touch accused by implication of being the private friend of the youthful agnes excited a degree of merry malice in the company not unpleasant to their feelings but in spite of the efforts of calumny the account mr seymour had given of agnes and her penitence became town talk and as it was confirmed by the other governors every one except the ferociously chaste was eager to prevent agnes from feeling pecuniary distress by procuring her employment still she was not supplied with work as fast as she executed it for except during the hours which she was allowed to spend with her father she was constantly employed and she even deprived herself of her accustomed portion of rest and was never in bed before one or after four in proportion as her business and profits increased were her spirits elevated but the more she gained the more saving she became she would scarcely allow herself sufficient food or clothing and to the astonishment of fanny the once generous agnes appeared penurious and a lover of money what does this change mean my dear lady said fanny to her one dayi have my reasons for it replied agnes coldly then changed the subject and fanny respected her too much to urge an explanation but agnes soon after began to wonder at an obvious change in fanny at first when agnes returned from visiting her father fanny used to examine her countenance and she could learn from that without asking a single question whether fitzhenry seemed to show any new symptoms of amendment or whether his insanity still appeared incurable if the former fanny tenderly pressing her hand would say thank god and prepare their dinner or supper with more alacrity than usual if the latter fanny would say nothing but endeavour by bringing little edward to her or by engaging her in conversation to divert the gloom which she could not remove and agnes though she took no notice of these artless proofs of affection observed and felt them deeply and as she drew near the house she always anticipated them as one of the comforts of her home but for some days past fanny had discontinued this mode of welcome so grateful to the feelings of agnes and seemed wholly absorbed in her own she was silent reserved and evidently oppressed with some anxiety which she was studious to conceal once or twice when agnes came home rather sooner than usual she found her in tears and when she affectionately asked the reason of them fanny pleaded mere lowness of spirits as the cause but the eye of anxious affection is not easily blinded agnes was convinced that fannys misery had some more important origin and secretly fearing that it proceeded from her she was on the watch for something to confirm her suspicions one day as she passed through the room where fanny kept her school agnes observed that the number of her scholars was considerably diminished and when she asked fanny where the children whom she missed were there was a confusion and hesitation in her manner while she made different excuses for their absence which convinced agnes that she concealed from her some unwelcome truth a very painful suspicion immediately darted across her mind the truth of which was but too soon confirmed a day or two after while again passing through the schoolroom she was attracted by the beauty of a little girl who was saying her lesson and smoothing down her curling hair she stooped to kiss her ruddy cheek but the child uttering a loud scream sprang from her arms and sobbing violently hid her face on fannys lap agnes who was very fond of children was much hurt by symptoms of a dislike so violent towards her and urged the child to give a reason for such strange conduct on which the artless girl owned that her mother had charged her never to touch or go near miss fitzhenry because she was the most wicked woman that ever breathed agnes heard this new consequence of her guilt with equal surprise and grief but on looking at fanny though she saw grief in her countenance there was no surprise in it and she instantly told her she was convinced that the loss of her scholars was occasioned by her having allowed her to reside with her fanny bursting into tears at last confessed that her suspicions were just while to the shuddering agnes she unfolded a series of persecutions which she had undergone from her employers because she had declared her resolution of starving rather than drive from her house her friend and benefactress agnes was not long in forming her resolution and the next morning without saying a word to fanny on the subject she went out in search of a lodging for herself and childas gratitude and justice forbade her to remain any longer with her persecuted companion but after having in vain tried to procure a lodging suitable to the low state of her finances or rather to her saving plan she hired a little cottage on the heath above the town adjoining to that where she had been so hospitably received in the hour of her distress and having gladdened the hearts of the friendly cottager and his wife by telling them that she was coming to be their neighbour she went to break the unwelcome tidings to fanny passionate and vehement indeed was her distress at hearing that her young lady as she still persisted to call her was going to leave her but her expostulations and tears were vain and agnes after promising to see fanny every day took possession that very evening of her humble habitation but her intention in removing was frustrated by the honest indignation and indiscretion of fanny she loudly raved against the illiberality which had robbed her of the society of all that she held dear and as she told every one that agnes left her by her own choice and not at her desire those children who had been taken away because agnes resided with her were not sent back to her on her removal at last the number of her scholars became so small that she gave up schoolkeeping and employed herself in shawlworking only while her leisure time was spent in visiting agnes or in inveighing to those who would listen to her against the cruelty that had driven her young lady from her house fanny used to begin by relating the many obligations which her mother and she had received from agnes and her father and always ended with saying yet to this woman who saved me and mine from a workhouse they wanted me to refuse a home when she stood in need of one they need not have been afraid of her being too happy such a mind as hers can never be happy under the consciousness of having been guilty and could she ever forget her crime one visit to her poor father would make her remember it again thus did fanny talk as i said before to those who would listen to her and there was one auditor who could have listened to her for ever on this subject and who thought fanny looked more lovely while expressing her affection for her penitent mistress and pleading her cause with a cheek flushed with virtuous indignation and eyes suffused with the tears of artless sensibility than when attended by the then happy agnes she gave her hand in the bloom of youth and beauty to the man of her heart this auditor was a respectable tradesman who lived in fannys neighbourhood to whom her faithful attachment to agnes had for some time endeared her while fanny in return felt grateful to him for entering with such warmth into her feelings and for listening so patiently to her complaints and it was not long before he offered her his hand to so advantageous an offer and to a man so amiable fanny could make no objection especially as agnes advised her accepting the proposal but fanny declared to her lover that she would not marry him unless he would promise that agnes and her child should whenever they chose have a home with her to this condition he consented telling fanny he loved her the better for making it and agnes had soon the satisfaction of witnessing the union of this worthy couple but they tried in vain to persuade agnes to take up her residence with them she preferred living by herself to her solitude was a luxury as while the little edward was playing on the heath with the cottagers children agnes delighted to brood in uninterrupted silence over the soothing hope the fond idea that alone stimulated her to exertion and procured her tranquillity all the energies of her mind and body were directed to one end and while she kept her eye steadfastly fixed on the future the past lost its power to torture and the present had some portion of enjoyment but were not these soothing reveries sometimes disturbed by the pangs of illrequited love and could she who had loved so fondly as to sacrifice to the indulgence of her passion every thing that she held most dear rise superior to the power of tender recollection and at once tear from her heart the image of her fascinating lover it would be unnatural to suppose that agnes could entirely forget the once honoured choice of her heart and the father of her child or that although experience had convinced her of its unworthiness she did not sometimes contemplate with the sick feelings of disappointed tenderness the idol which her imagination had decked in graces all its own but these remembrances were rare she oftener beheld him as he appeared before the tribunal of her reasona cold selfish profligate hypocritical deceiver as the unfeeling destroyer of her hopes and happiness and as one who as she had learned from his own lips when he most invited confidence was the most determined to betray she saw him also as a wretch so devoid of the common feelings of nature and humanity that though she left her apartments in london in the dead of night and in the depth of a severe winter an almost helpless child in her arms and no visible protector near he had never made a single inquiry concerning her fate or that of his offspring at times the sensations of agnes bordered on phrensy when in this heartless unnatural wretch she beheld the being for whom she had resigned the matchless comforts of her home and destroyed the happiness and reason of her father at these moments and these only she used to rush wildly forth in search of company that she might escape from herself but more frequently she directed her steps to the abode of the poor to those who in her happier hours had been supported by her bounty and who now were eager to meet her in her walks to repay her past benefactions by a god bless you lady uttered in a tone of respectful pity when her return was first known to the objects of her benevolence agnes soon saw herself surrounded by them and was in her humble apparel and dejected state followed by them with more blessings and more heartfelt respect than in the proudest hour of her prosperity thank god ejaculated agnes as she turned a glistening eye on her humble followers there are yet those whose eyes mine may meet with confidence there are some beings in the world towards whom i have done my duty but the next minute she recollected that the guilty flight which made her violate the duty which she owed her father at the same time removed her from the power of fulfilling that which she owed the indigent for it is certain that our duties are so closely linked together that as the breaking one pearl from a string of pearls hazards the loss of all so the violation of one duty endangers the safety of every other alas exclaimed agnes as this melancholy truth occurred to her it is not for me to exult for even in the squalid meagre countenances of these kind and grateful beings i read evidences of my guiltthey looked up to me for aid and i deserted them in time however these acute feelings wore away and agnes by entering again on the offices of benevolence and humanity towards the distressed lost the consciousness of past neglect in that of present usefulness true she could no longer feed the hungry or clothe the naked but she could soften the pangs of sickness by expressing sympathy in its sufferings she could make the nauseous medicine more welcome if not more salutary by administering it herself for though poor she was still superior to the sufferers whom she attended and it was soothing to them to see such a lady take so much trouble for those so much beneath herand she could watch the livelong night by the bed of the dying join in the consoling prayer offered by the lips of another or in her own eloquent and impassioned language speak peace and hope to the departing soul these tender offices these delicate attentions so dear to the heart of every one but so particularly welcome to the poor from their superiors as they are acknowledgements of the relationship between them and confessions that they are of the same species as themselves and heirs of the same hopes even those who bestow money with generous profusion do not often pay but agnes was never content to give relief unaccompanied by attendance she had reflected deeply on the nature of the human heart and knew that a participating smile a sympathizing tear a friendly pressure of the hand the shifting of an uneasy pillow and patient attention to an unconnected tale of twicetold symptoms were in the esteem of the indigent sufferer of as great a value as pecuniary assistance agnes therefore in her poverty had the satisfaction of knowing that she was as consoling to the distressed if not as useful as she was in her prosperity and if there could be a moment when she felt the glow of exultation in her breast it was when she left the habitation of indigence or sorrow followed by the wellearned blessings of its inhabitants had agnes been capable of exulting in a consciousness of being revenged another source of exultation might have been hers provided she had ever deigned to inquire concerning her profligate seducer whom she wrongfully accused of having neglected to make inquiries concerning her and her child agnes two months after her return from london saw in the paper an account of cliffords marriage and felt some curiosity to know what had so long retarded an union which when she left town was fixed for the monday following and fanny observed an increased degree of gloom and abstraction in her appearance all that day but dismissing this feeling from her mind as unworthy of it from that moment she resolved if possible to recall clifford to her imagination as one who towards her had been guilty not of perfidy and deceit only but of brutal and unnatural neglect in this last accusation however as i said before she was unjust when clifford awoke the next morning after his last interview with agnes and the fumes of the wine he had drunk the night before were entirely dissipated he recollected with great uneasiness the insulting manner in which he had justified his intended marriage and the insight into the baseness of his character which his unguarded confessions had given to her penetration the idea of having incurred the contempt of agnes was insupportable yet when he recollected the cold calm and dignified manner in which she spoke and acted when he bade her adieu he was convinced that he had taught her to despise him and knowing agnes he was also certain that she must soon cease to love the man whom she had once learned to despise but i will go to her directly exclaimed he to himself ringing his bell violently and i will attribute my infernal folly to drunkenness he then ordered his servant to call a coach finding himself too languid from his late intemperance to walk and was just going to step into it when he saw mrs askew pale and trembling and heard her in a faltering voice demand to see him in private for a few minutes i shall not attempt to describe his rage and astonishment when he heard of the elopement of agnes but these feelings were soon followed by those of terror for her safety and that of his child and his agitation for some moments was so great as to deprive him of the power of considering how he should proceed in order to hear some tidings of the fugitives and endeavour to recall them it was evident that agnes had escaped the night before because a servant sitting up for a gentleman who lodged in the house was awakened from sleep by the noise which she made in opening the door and running into the hall she saw the skirt of agness gown as she shut it again and looking to see who was gone out she saw a lady who she was almost certain was miss fitzhenry running down the street with great speed but to put its being agnes beyond all doubt she ran up to her room and finding the door open went in and could see neither her nor her child to this narration clifford listened with some calmness but when mrs askew told him that agnes had taken none of her clothes with her he fell into an agony amounting to phrensy and exclaiming then it must be soshe has destroyed both herself and the child his senses failed him and he dropped down insensible on the sofa this horrible probability had occurred to mrs askew and she had sent servants different ways all night in order to find her if she were still in existence that she might spare clifford if possible the pain of conceiving a suspicion like her own clifford was not so fortunate as to remain long in a state of unconsciousness but soon recovered to a sense of misery and unavailing remorse at length he recollected that a coach set off that very night for her native place from the whitehorse cellar and that it was possible that she might have obtained a lodging the night before where she meant to stay till the coach was ready to set off the following evening he immediately went to piccadilly to see whether places for a lady and child had been takenbut no such passengers were on the list he then inquired whether a lady and child had gone from that inn the night before in the coach that went within a few miles of the town of but as agnes had reached the inn just as the coach was setting off no one belonging to it but the coachman knew that she was a passenger well i flatter myself said clifford to mrs askew endeavouring to smile that she will make her appearance here at night if she do not come today and i will not stir from this spot till the coach set off and will even go in it some way to see whether it do not stop to take her up on the road this resolution he punctually put in practice all day clifford was stationed at a window opposite to the inn or in the bookkeepers office but night came the coach was ready to set off and still no agnes appeared however clifford having secured a place got in with the other passengers and went six miles or more before he gave up the hope of hearing the coachman ordered to stop in the soft voice of agnes at last all expectation failed him and complaining of a violent headache he desired to be set down sprang out of the carriage and relieved the other passengers from a very restless and disagreeable companion and clifford in a violent attack of fever was wandering on the road to london in hopes of meeting agnes at the very time when his victim was on the road to her native place in company with her unhappy father by the time clifford reached london he was bordering on a state of delirium but had recollection enough to desire his confidential servant to inform his father of the state in which he was and then take the road to and ask at every inn on the road whether a lady and child describing agnes and little edward had been there the servant obeyed and the anxious father who had been informed of the cause of his sons malady soon received the following letter from wilson while he was attending at his bedside my lord sad news of miss fitzhenry and the child and reason to fear they both perished with cold for being told at one of the inns on this road that a young woman and child had been found frozen to death last night and carried to the next town to be owned i set off for there directly and while i was taking a drap of brandy to give me spirits to see the bodies for a qualm came over me when i thought of what cant be helped and how pretty and goodnatured and happy she once was a woman came down with a silk wrapper and a shawl that i knew belonged to the poor lady and said the young woman found dead had those things on this was proof positive my lordand it turned me sick still it is better so than selfmurder so my master had best know it i think and humbly hoping your lordship will think so too i remain your lordships most humble servant to command j wilson ps if i gain more particulars shall send them dreadful as the supposed death of agnes and her child appeared to the father of clifford he could not be sorry that so formidable a rival to his future daughterinlaw was no longer to be feared and as clifford in the ravings of his fever was continually talking of agnes as selfmurdered and the murderer of her child and of himself as the abandoned cause and as that idea seemed to haunt and terrify his imagination he thought with his sons servant that he had better take the first opportunity of telling clifford the truth melancholy as it was and taking advantage of a proper opportunity he had done so before he received this second letter from wilson my lord it was all fudgemiss fitzhenry is alive and alive like at she stopped at an inn on the road and parted with her silk coat and shawl for some things she wanted and a hussey of a chambermaid stole them and went off in the night with them and her little byblowbut justice overtakes us sooner or later i suppose his honour my master will be cheery at thisbut as joy often distracts as much as grief they say though i never believed it i take it you will not tell him this good news handoverheadand am your lordships most humble to command j wilson ps i have been to and have heard for certain miss f and her child are there his lordship was even more cautious than wilson wished him to be for he resolved not to communicate the glad tidings to clifford cautiously or incautiously as he thought there would be no chance of his sons fulfilling his engagements with miss sandford if he knew agnes was living especially as her flight and her supposed death had proved to clifford how necessary she was to his happiness nay he went still further and resolved that clifford should never know if he could possibly help it that the report of her death was false how to effect this was the difficulty but wisely conceiving that wilson was not inaccessible to a bribe he offered him so much ayear on condition of his suffering his master to remain convinced of the truth of the story that agnes and her child had perished in the snow and of intercepting all letters which he fancied came from agnes telling him at the same time that if ever he found he had violated the conditions the annuity should immediately cease to this wilson consented and when clifford recovered he made his compliance with the terms more easy by desiring wilson and the friends to whom his connection with agnes had been known never to mention her name in his presence again if they valued his health and reason as the safety of both depended on his forgetting a woman of whom he had never felt the value sufficiently till he had lost her for ever soon after he marriedand the disagreeable qualities of his wife made him recollect with more painful regret the charms and virtues of agnes the consequence was that he plunged deeper than ever into dissipation and had recourse to intoxication in order to banish care and disagreeable recollectionsand while year after year passed away in fruitless expectation of a child to inherit the estate and the longdisputed title he remembered with agonizing regrets the beauty of his lost edward and reflected that by refusing to perform his promises to the injured agnes he had deprived himself of the heir that he so much coveted and of a wife who would have added dignity to the title which she bore and been the delight and ornament of his family such were the miserable feelings of cliffordsuch the corroding cares that robbed his mind of its energy and his body of health and vigour though courted caressed flattered and surrounded by affluence and splendour he was disappointed and selfcondemned and while agnes for the first time condemning him unjustly attributed his silence and neglect of her and her offspring to a degree of indifference and hardheartedness at which human nature shudders clifford was feeling all the horrors of remorse without the consolations of repentance i have before observed that one idea engrossed the mind and prompted the exertions of agnesand this was the probable restoration of her father to reasoncould i but once more hear him call me by my name and bless me with his forgiveness i should die in peace and something within me tells me that my hopes will not be in vain and who knows but we may pass a contented if not a happy life together yetso toil on toil on agnes and expect the fruit of thy labours these words she was in the habit of repeating not only to fanny and her nextdoor neighbours whom she had acquainted with her story but to herself as she sat at work or traversed the heath even in the dead of night she would start from a troubled sleep and repeating these words they would operate as a charm on her disturbed mind and as she spoke the last sentence she would fall into a quiet slumber from which she awoke the next morning at daybreak to pursue with increased alacrity the labours of the day meanwhile agnes and her exemplary industry continued to engage the attention and admiration of the candid and liberal in the town of mr seymour who did not venture to inquire concerning her of fanny while she lived at her house now often called there to ask news of agnes and her employments and his curiosity was excited to know to what purpose she intended to devote the money earned with so much labour and hoarded with such parsimonious care but fanny was as ignorant on this subject as himself and the only new information which she could give him was that agnes had begun to employ herself in fancyworks in order to increase her gains and that it was her intention soon to send little edward then four years old to town to offer artificial flowers painted needlebooks workbags c at the doors of the opulent and humane nor was it long before this design was put in execution and mr seymour had the satisfaction of buying all the lovely boys first cargo himself for presents to his daughters the little merchant returned to his anxious mother bounding with delight not at the good success of his first venture for its importance he did not understand but at the kindness of mr seymour who had met him on the road conducted him to his house helped his daughters to load his pockets with cakes and put in his basket in exchange for his merchandize tongue chicken and other things to carry home to his mother agnes heard the childs narration with more pleasure than she had for some time experiencedthey do not despise me then said she they even respect me too much to offer me pecuniary aid or presents of any kind but in a way that cannot wound my feelings but this pleasure was almost immediately checked by the recollection that he whose wounded spirit would have been soothed by seeing her once more an object of delicate attention and respect and for whose sake alone she could now ever be capable of enjoying them was still unconscious of her claims to it and knew not that they were so generally acknowledged in the words of jane de montfort she could have said he to whose ear my praise most welcome was hears it no more but i will hope on agnes used to exclaim as these thoughts occurred to her and again her countenance assumed the wild expression of a dissatisfied but still expecting spirit three years had now elapsed since agnes first returned to her native place the next year said agnes to fanny with unusual animation cannot fail of bringing forth good to me you know that according to the rules of the new bedlam a patient is to remain five years in the house at the end of that time if not cured he is to be removed to the apartments appropriated to incurables and kept there for life his friends paying a certain annuity for his maintenance or he is on their application to be returned to their careand what then said fanny wondering at the unusual joy that animated agness countenance why then replied she as my fathers time for being confined expires at the end of the next year he will either be cured by that time or he will be given up to my care and then who knows what the consequences may bewhat indeed returned fanny who foresaw great personal fatigue and anxiety if not danger to agnes in such a plan and was going to express her fears and objections but agnes in a manner overpoweringly severe desired her to be silent and angrily withdrew soon after agnes received a proof of being still dear to her friend caroline which gave her a degree of satisfaction amounting even to joy mr seymour in a letter to his daughter had given her an account of all the proceedings of agnes and expressed his surprise at the eagerness with which she laboured to gain money merely as it seemed for the sake of hoarding it as she had then and always would have only herself and child to maintain as it was certain that her father would be allowed to continue free of all expenses an inhabitant of an asylum which owed its erection chiefly to his benevolent exertions but caroline to whom the mind of agnes was well known and who had often contemplated with surprise and admiration her boldness in projecting her promptness in deciding and her ability in executing the projects which she had formed and above all that sanguine temper which led her to believe probable what others only conceived to be possiblefound a reason immediately for the passion of hoarding which seemed to have taken possession of her friend and following the instant impulse of friendship and compassion she sent agnes the following letter in which was inclosed a bank note to a considerable amount i have divined your secret my dear agnes i know why you are so anxious to hoard what you gain with such exemplary industry in another year your father will have been the allotted time under the care of the medical attendants in your part of the world and you are hoarding that you may be able when that time comes to procure for him elsewhere the best possible advice and assistance yes yes i know i am righttherefore lest your own exertions should not in the space of a twelvemonth be crowned with sufficient success i conjure you by our long friendship to appropriate the inclosed to the purport in question and should the scheme which i impute to you be merely the creature of my own brain as it is a good scheme employ the money in executing it to silence all your scruples i assure you that my gift is sanctioned by my husband and my father who join with me in approbation of your conduct and in the most earnest wishes that you may receive the reward of it in the entire restoration of your afflicted parent already have the candid and enlightened paid you their tribute of recovered esteem it is the slang of the present day if i may be allowed this vulgar but forcible expression to inveigh bitterly against society for excluding from its circle with unrelenting rigour the woman who has once transgressed the salutary laws of chastity and some brilliant and persuasive but in my opinion mistaken writers of both sexes have endeavoured to prove that many an amiable woman has been for ever lost to virtue and the world and become the victim of prostitution merely because her first fault was treated with illjudging and criminal severity this assertion appears to me to be fraught with mischief as it is calculated to deter the victim of seduction from penitence and amendment by telling her that she would employ them in her favour in vain and it is surely as false as it is dangerous i know many instances and it is fair to conclude that the experience of others is similar to mine of women restored by perseverance in a life of expiatory amendment to that rank in society which they had forfeited by one false step while their fault has been forgotten in their exemplary conduct as wives and mothers but it is not to be expected that society should open its arms to receive its prodigal children till they have undergone a long and painful probationtill they have practised the virtues of selfdenial patience fortitude and industry and she whose penitence is not the mere result of wounded pride and caprice will be capable of exerting all these virtues in order to regain some portion of the esteem which she has lost what will difficulties and mortifications be to her keeping her eye steadily fixed on the end which she has in view she will bound lightly over them all nor will she seek the smiles of the world till instead of receiving them as a favour she can demand them as a right agnes my dear agnes do you not know the original of the above picture you by a life of selfdenial patience fortitude and industry have endeavoured to atone for the crime which you committed against society and i hear her voice saying thy sins are forgiven thee and ill befall the hand that would uplift the sacred pall which penitence and amendment have thrown over departed guilt such was the letter of carolinea letter intended to speak peace and hope to the heart of agnes to reconcile the offender to herself and light up her dim eye with the beams of selfapprobation thus did she try to console her guilty and unhappy friend in the hour of her adversity and degradation but caroline had given a still greater proof of the sincerity of her friendshipshe had never wounded the feelings or endeavoured to mortify the selflove of agnes in the hour of her prosperity and acknowledged superiority she had seen her attractions and heard her praises without envy nor ever with seeming kindness but real malignity related to her in the accents of pretended wonder and indignation the censures which she had incurred or the ridicule which she had excitedbut in every instance she had proved her friendship a memorable exception to what are sarcastically termed the friendships of women yesshe has indeed divined my secret said agnes when she had perused the letter while tears of tenderness trickled down her cheeks and she deserves to assist me in procuring means for my poor fathers recoveryan indulgence which i should be jealous of granting to any one else except you fanny she added seeing on fannys countenance an expression of jealousy of this richer friend and on the strength of this noble present looking with a smile at her darned and pieced though neat apparel i will treat myself with a new gownnot before it was wanted said fanny peevishlynay replied agnes with a forced smile surely i am well dressed enough for a runaway daughter my father loved to see me fine as poor clarissa says and had i never left him i should not have been forced to wear such a gown as this but fanny let me but see him once more capable of knowing me and of loving me if it be possible for him to forgive me added she in a faltering voice and i will then if he wishes it be fine again though i work all night to make myself so my dear dear lady said fanny sorrowfully i am sure i did not mean any thing by what i said but you have such a way with you and talk so sadlyyet i cant bear indeed i cant to see such a lady in a gown not good enough for me and then to see my young master no better dressed than the cottagers boys next doorand then to hear them call master edward little fitzhenry as if he was not their bettersi cant bear itit does not signify talking i cant bear to think of it how then answered agnes in a solemn tone and grasping her hand as she spoke how can i bear to think of the guilt which has thus reduced so low both me and my child o would to god my boy could exchange situation with the children whom you think his inferiors i have given him life indeed but not one legal claim to what is necessary to the support of life except the scanty pittance which i might by a public avowal of my shame wring from his father i would beg my bread with him through the streets before you should do that hastily exclaimed fanny and for the love of god say no more on this subjecthe is my child as well as yours she continued snatching little edward to her bosom who was contentedly playing with his top at the door and agnes in contemplating the blooming graces of the boy forgot that he was an object of compassion the next year passed away as the former had done and at the end of it fitzhenry being pronounced incurable but perfectly quiet and harmless agnes desired in spite of the advice and entreaties of the governors that he might be delivered up to her that she might put him under the care of dr w luckily for agnes the assignees of her father recovered a debt of a hundred pounds which had long been due to him and this sum they generously presented to agnes in order to further the success of her last hope on the day fixed for fitzhenrys release agnes purchased a complete suit of clothes for him such as he used to wear in former days and dressed herself in a manner suited to her birth rather than her situation then set out in a postchaise attended by the friendly cottager as it was judged imprudent for her to travel with her father alone to take up fitzhenry at the bedlam while fanny was crying with joy to see her dear lady looking like herself again and travelling like a gentlewoman but the poor whom gratitude and affection made constantly observant of the actions of agnes were full of consternation when some of them heard and communicated to the others that a postchaise was standing at miss fitzhenrys door o dear she is going to leave us again what shall we do without her was the general exclamation and when agnes came out to enter her chaise she found it surrounded by her humble friends lamenting and inquiring though with cautious respect whether she ever meant to come back again fanny will tell you every thing said agnes overcome with grateful emotion at observing the interest which she excited unable to say more she waved her hand as a token of farewell to them and the chaise drove off is miss fitzhenry grown rich again was the general question addressed to fanny and i am sure it was a disinterested one and that at the moment they asked it without a view to their profiting by her change of situation and merely as anxious for her welfareand when fanny told them whither and wherefore agnes was gone could prayers good wishes and blessings have secured success to the hopes of agnes her father even as soon as she stopped at the gate of the bedlam would have recognised and received her with open arms but when she arrived she found fitzhenry as irrational as ever though delighted to hear that he was going to take a ride with the lady as he always called agnes and she had the pleasure of seeing him seat himself beside her with a look of uncommon satisfaction nothing worth relating happened on the road fitzhenry was very tractable except at night when the cottager who slept in the same room with him found it difficult to make him keep in bed and was sometimes forced to call agnes to his assistance at sight of her he always became quiet and obeyed her implicitly the skilful and celebrated man to whom she applied received her with sympathizing kindness and heard her story with a degree of interest and sensibility peculiarly grateful to the afflicted heart agnes related with praiseworthy ingenuousness the whole of her sad history judging it necessary that the doctor should know the cause of the malady for which he was to prescribe it was peculiarly the faculty of agnes to interest in her welfare those with whom she conversed and the doctor soon experienced a more than ordinary earnestness to cure a patient so interesting from his misfortunes and recommended by so interesting a daughter six months said he will be a sufficient time of trial and in the mean while you shall reside in a lodging near us fitzhenry then became an inmate of the doctors house agnes took possession of apartments in the neighbourhood and the cottager returned to the ensuing six months were passed by agnes in the soulsickening feeling of hope deferred and while the air of the place agreed so well with her father that he became fat and healthy in his appearance anxiety preyed on her delicate frame and made the doctor fear that when he should be forced to pronounce his patient beyond his power to cure she would sink under the blow unless the hope of being still serviceable to her father should support her under its pressure he resolved therefore to inform her in as judicious and cautious a manner as possible that he saw no prospect of curing the thoroughlyshattered intellect of fitzhenry i can do nothing for your father said he to agnes when he had been under his care six months laying great stress on the word iagnes with a face of horror started from her seat and laid her hand on his armbut you can do a great deal can i can i exclaimed agnes sobbing convulsivelyblessed hearing but the meansthe means it is very certain he replied that he experiences great delight when he sees you and sees you too employed in his serviceand when he lives with you and sees you again where he has been accustomed to see you you advise his living with me then interrupted agnes with eagerness i do most strenuously replied the doctor blessings on you for those words answered agnes they said you would oppose it you are a wise and a kindhearted man my dear child rejoined the doctor when an evil cant be cured it should at least be alleviated you think it cant be cured then again interrupted agnes not absolutely soi know not what a course of medicine and living with you as much in your old way as possible may do for him let him resume his usual habits his usual walks live as near your former habitation as you possibly can let him hear his favourite songs and be as much with him as you can contrive to be and if you should not succeed in making him rational again you will at least make him happy happyi make him happy now exclaimed agnes pacing the room in an agonyi made him happy oncebut now you must hire some one to sleep in the room with him resumed the doctor no no cried agnes impatientlyno one shall wait on him but myselfi will attend him day and night and should your strength be worn out by such incessant watching who would take care of him thenremember you are but mortalagnes shook her head and was silentbesides the strength of a man may sometimes be necessary and for his sake as well as yours i must insist on being obeyed you shall be obeyed said agnes mournfully then now rejoined he let me give you my advice relative to diet medicine and managementthis he did in detail as he found agnes had a mind capacious enough to understand his system and promising to answer her letters immediately whenever she wrote to him for advice he took an affectionate farewell of her and agnes and her father accompanied by a man whom the doctor had procured for the purpose set off for fanny was waiting at the cottage with little edward to receive thembut the dejected countenance of agnes precluded all necessity of asking concerning the state of fitzhenry scarcely could the caresses of her child and the joy which he expressed at seeing her call a smile to her lips and as she pressed him to her bosom tears of bitter disappointment mingled with those of tenderness in a day or two after agnes in compliance with the doctors desire hired a small tenement very near the house in which they formerly lived and in the garden of which as it was then empty they obtained leave to walk she also procured a person to sleep in the room with her father instead of the man who came with them and he carried back a letter from her to the doctor informing him that she had arranged every thing according to his directions it was a most painfully pleasing sight to behold the attention of agnes to fitzhenry she knew that it was not in her power to repair the enormous injury which she had done him and that all she could now do was but a poor amends still it was affecting to see how anxiously she watched his steps whenever he chose to wander alone from home and what pains she took to make him neat in his appearance and cleanly in his person her child and herself were clothed in coarse apparel but she bought for her father everything of the best materials and altered as he was fitzhenry still looked like a gentleman sometimes he seemed in every respect so like himself that agnes hurried away by her imagination would after gazing on him some minutes start from her seat seize his hand and breathless with hope address him as if he were a rational beingwhen a laugh of vacancy or a speech full of the inconsistency of phrensy would send her back on her chair again with a pulse quickened and a cheek flushed with the fever of disappointed expectation however he certainly was pleased with her attentionsbut alas he knew not who was the bestower of them he knew not that the child whose ingratitude or whose death he still lamented in his ravings in the dead of night was returned to succour to soothe him and to devote herself entirely to his service he heard her but he knew her not he saw her but in her he was not certain that he beheld his child and this was the pang that preyed on the cheek and withered the frame of agnes but she persisted to hope and patiently endured the pain of today expecting the joy of tomorrow nor did her hopes always appear illfounded the first day that agnes led him to the garden once his own he ran through every walk with eager delight but he seemed surprised and angry to see the long grass growing in the walks and the few flowers that remained choked up with weedsand began to pluck up the weeds with hasty violence it is time to go home said agnes to him just as the day began to close in and fitzhenry immediately walked to the door which led into the house and finding it locked looked surprised then turning to agnes he asked her if she had not the key in her pocket and on her telling him that that was not his home he quitted the house evidently with great distress and reluctance and was continually looking back at it as if he did not know how to believe her on this little circumstance poor agnes lay ruminating the whole night after with joyful expectation and she repaired to the garden at daybreak with a gardener whom she hired to make the walks look as much as possible as they formerly did but they had omitted to tie up some straggling flowersand when agnes fanny and the cottager accompanied fitzhenry thither the next evening though he seemed conscious of the improvement that had taken place he was disturbed at seeing some gilliflowers trailing along the ground and suddenly turning to agnes he said why do you not bind up these to do these little offices in the garden and keep the parterre in order was formerly agness employment what delight then must these words of fitzhenry so evidently the result of an association in his mind between her and his daughter have excited in agnes with a trembling hand and a glowing cheek she obeyed and fitzhenry with manifest satisfaction saw her tie up every straggling flower in the garden while he eagerly followed her and bent attentively over her at last when she had gone the whole round of the flowerbeds he exclaimed good girl good girl and putting his arms round her waist suddenly kissed her cheek surprise joy and emotion difficult to be defined overcame the irritable frame of agnes and she fell senseless to the ground but the care of fanny soon recovered her againand the first question that she asked was how her father whom she saw in great agitation running round the garden behaved when he saw her fall he raised you up replied fanny and seemed so distressed he would hold the salts to your nose himself and would scarcely suffer me to do anything for you but hearing you mutter father dear father as you began to come to yourself he changed colour and immediately began to run round the garden as you now see him say no more say no more my dear friend cried agnes it is enough i am happy quite happyit is clear that he knew meand i have again received a fathers embracethen his anxiety too while i was illoh there is no doubt now that he will be quite himself in time perhaps he may replied fannybut but and perhaps cried agnes pettishlyi tell you he will he certainly will recover and those are not my friends who doubt it so saying she ran hastily forward to meet fitzhenry who was joyfully hastening towards her leaving fanny grieved and astonished at her petulance but few are the tempers proof against continual anxiety and the souring influence of still renewed and still disappointed hope and even agnes the once gentle agnes if contradicted on this one subject became angry and unjust but she was never conscious of having given pain to the feelings of another without bitter regret and an earnest desire of healing the wound which she had made and when leaning on fitzhenrys arm she returned towards fanny and saw her in tears she felt a pang severer than that which she had inflicted and said every thing that affection and gratitude could dictate to restore her to tranquillity again her agitation alarmed fitzhenry and exclaiming poor thing he held the smellingbottle almost by force to her nose and seemed terrified lest she was going to faint again you see you see said agnes triumphantly to fanny and fanny made cautious by experience declared the conviction that her young lady must know more of all matters than she did but month after month elapsed and no circumstances of a similar nature occurred to give new strength to the hopes of agnes however she had the pleasure to see that fitzhenry not only seemed to be attached to her but pleased with little edward she had indeed taken pains to teach him to endeavour to amuse her fatherbut sometimes she had the mortification of hearing when fits of loud laughter from the child reached her ear edward was only laughing at grandpapas odd faces and actions mamma and having at last taught him that it was wicked to laugh at such things because his grandfather was not well when he distorted his face her heart was nearly as much wrung by the pity which he expressed for whenever these occasional slight fits of phrensy attacked fitzhenry little edward would exclaim poor grandpapa he is not well nowi wish we could make him well mamma but on the whole she had reason to be tolerably cheerful every evening when the weather was fine agnes holding her fathers arm was seen taking her usual walk her little boy gamboling before them and never in their most prosperous hours were they met with curtsies more low or bows more respectful than on these occasions and many a one grasped with affectionate eagerness the meagre hand of fitzhenry and the feverish hand of agnes for even the most rigid hearts were softened in favour of agnes when they beheld the ravages which grief had made in her form and gazed on her countenance which spoke in forcible language the sadness yet resignation of her mind she might if she had chosen it have been received at many houses where she had formerly been intimate but she declined it as visiting would have interfered with the necessary labours of the day with her constant attention to her father and with the education of her child but when my father recovers said she to fanny as he will be pleased to find that i am not deemed wholly unworthy of notice i shall have great satisfaction in visiting with him to be briefanother year elapsed and agnes still hoped and fitzhenry continued the same to every eye but hersshe every day fancied that his symptoms of returning reason increased and no one of her friends dared to contradict her but in order if possible to accelerate his recovery she had resolved to carry him to london to receive the best advice that the metropolis afforded when fitzhenry was attacked by an acute complaint which confined him to his bed this event instead of alarming agnes redoubled her hopes she insisted that it was the crisis of his disorder and expected that health and reason would return together not for one moment therefore would she leave his bedside and she would allow herself neither food nor rest while with earnest attention she gazed on the fast sinking eyes of fitzhenry eager to catch in them an expression of returning recognition one day after he had been sleeping some time and she as usual was attentively watching by him fitzhenry slowly and gradually awoke and at last raising himself on his elbow looked round him with an expression of surprise and seeing agnes exclaimed my child are you there gracious god is this possible let those who have for years been pining away life in fruitless expectation and who see themselves at last possessed of the longdesired blessing figure to themselves the rapture of agneshe knows me he is himself again burst from her quivering lips unconscious that it was too probable that restored reason was here the forerunner of dissolution o my father she cried falling on her knees but not daring to look up at himo my father forgive me if possiblei have been guilty but i am penitent fitzhenry as much affected as agnes faltered out thou art restored to meand god knows how heartily i forgive thee then raising her to his arms agnes happy in the fullfilment of her utmost wishes felt herself once more pressed to the bosom of the most affectionate of fathers but surely you are not now come back asked fitzhenry i have seen you before and very latelyseen me o yes replied agnes with passionate rapidityfor these last five years i have seen you daily and for the last two years you have lived with me and i have worked to maintain youindeed answered fitzhenrybut how pale and thin you are you have worked too muchhad you no friends my child o yes and guilty as i have been they pity nay they respect me and we may yet be happy as heaven restores you to my prayerstrue i have suffered much but this blessed moment repays methis is the only moment of true enjoyment which i have known since i left my home and you agnes was thus pouring out the hasty effusions of her joy unconscious that fitzhenry overcome with affection emotion and perhaps sorrowful recollections was struggling in vain for utteranceat lastfor so many yearsand i knew you notworked for meattended mebless bless her heaven he faintly articulated and worn out with illness and choaked with contending emotions he fell back on his pillow and expired that blessing the hope of obtaining which alone gave agnes courage to endure contumely poverty fatigue and sorrow was for one moment her own and then snatched from her for everno wonder then that when convinced her father was really dead she fell into a state of stupefaction from which she never recoveredand at the same time were borne to the same grave the father and daughter the day of their funeral was indeed a melancholy onethey were attended to the grave by a numerous procession of respectable inhabitants of both sexeswhile the afflicted and lamenting poor followed mournfully at a distance even those who had distinguished themselves by their violence against agnes at her return dropped a tear as they saw her borne to her long home mrs macfiendy forgot her beauty and accomplishments in her misfortunes and early death and the mother of the child who had fled from the touch of agnes felt sorry that she had ever called her the wickedest woman in the world but the most affecting part of the procession was little edward as chief mourner led by fanny and her husband in all the happy insensibility of childhood unconscious that he was the pitiable hero of that show which by its novelty and parade so much delighted himwhile his smiles poor orphan excited the tears of those around him just before the procession began to move a postchariot and four with white favours drove into the yard of the largest inn in the town it contained lord and lady mountcarrol who were married only the day before and were then on their way to her ladyships country seat his lordship who seemed incapable of resting in one place for a minute together did nothing but swear at the postillions for bringing them that road and express an earnest desire to leave the town again as fast as possible while he was gone into the stable for the third time to see whether the horses were not sufficiently refreshed to go on a waiter came in to ask lady mountcarrols commands and at that moment the funeral passed the window the waiter who was the very servant that at mr seymours had refused to shut the door against agnes instantly turned away his head and burst into tears this excited her ladyships curiosity and she drew from him a short but full account of agnes and her father he had scarcely finished his story when lord mountcarrol came in saying that the carriage was ready and no sooner had his bride begun to relate to him the story which she had just heard than he exclaimed in a voice of thunder it is as false as hell madam miss fitzhenry and her child both died years ago then rushing into the carriage he left lady mountcarrol terrified and amazed at his manner but when she was seating herself by his side she could not help saying that it was impossible for a story to be false which all the people in the inn averred to be true and as he did not offer to interrupt her she went through the whole story of agnes and her sufferings but before she could proceed to comment on them the procession returning from church crossed the road in which they were going and obliged the postillions to stop foremost came the little edward with all his mothers beauty in his face poor little orphan said lady mountcarrol giving a tear to the memory of agnes see my lord what a lovely boy as she spoke the extreme elegance of the carriage attracted edwards attention and springing from fannys hand who in vain endeavoured to hold him back he ran up to the door to examine the figures on the pannel at that instant lord mountcarrol opened the door lifted the child into the chaise and throwing his card of address to the astonished mourners ordered the servants to drive on as fast as possible they did so in despite of mr seymour and others for astonishment had at first deprived them of the power of moving and the horses before the witnesses of this sudden and strange event had recovered their recollection had gone too far to allow themselves to be stopped the card with lord mountcarrols name explained what at first had puzzled and confounded as well as alarmed them and fanny who had fainted at sight of his lordship because she knew him altered as he was to be edwards father and the bane of agnes now recovering herself conjured mr seymour to follow him immediately and tell him that edward was bequeathed to her care mr seymour instantly ordered post horses and in about an hour after set off in pursuit of the ravisher but the surprise and consternation of fanny and the rest of the mourners was not greater than that of lady mountcarrol at sight of her lords strange conduct what does this outrage mean my lord she exclaimed in a faltering voice and whose child is thatit is my child madam replied he and i will never resign him but with life then pressing the astonished boy to his bosom he for some minutes sobbed aloudwhile lady mountcarrol though she could not help feeling compassion for the agony which the seducer of agnes must experience at such a moment was not a little displeased and shocked at finding herself the wife of that clifford whose name she had so lately heard coupled with that of villain but her attention was soon called from reflections so unpleasant by the cries of edward whose surprise at being seized and carried away by a stranger now yielded to terror and who bursting from lord mountcarrol desired to go back to his mamma fanny and mr seymour what and leave your own father edward asked his agitated parentlook at mei am your fatherbut i suppose your mother as well she might taught you to hate memy mamma told me it was wicked to hate any body and i am sure i have no papa i had a grandpapa but he is gone to heaven along with my mamma fanny says and she is my mamma now and again screaming and stamping with impatience he insisted on going back to her but at length by promises of riding on a fine horse and of sending for fanny to ride with him he was pacified then with artless readiness he related his mothers way of life and the odd ways of his grandpapa and thus by acquainting lord mountcarrol with the sufferings and the virtuous exertions of agnes he increased his horror of his own conduct and his regret at not having placed so nobleminded a woman at the head of his family but whence arose the story of her death he had yet to learn in a few hours they reached the seat which he had acquired by his second marriage and there too in an hour after arrived mr seymour and the husband of fanny lord mountcarrol expected this visit and received them courteously while mr seymour was so surprised at seeing the once healthy and handsome clifford changed to an emaciated valetudinarian and carrying in his face the marks of habitual intemperance that his indignation was for a moment lost in pity but recovering himself he told his lordship that he came to demand justice for the outrage which he had committed and in the name of the friend to whom miss fitzhenry had in case of her sudden death bequeathed her child to insist on his being restored to her we will settle that point presently replied lord mountcarrol but first i conjure you to tell me all that has happened since we parted to her whose name i have not for years been able to repeat and whom as well as this child i have also for years believed dead i will my lord answered mr seymour but i warn you that if you have any feeling it will be tortured by the narration if i have any feeling cried his lordship but go on sir from you sirfrom you asas her friend i can bear any thing words could not do justice to the agonies of lord mountcarrol while mr seymour beginning with agness midnight walk to went through a recital of her conduct and sufferings and hopes and anxieties and ended with the momentary recovery and deathscene of her father but when lord mountcarrol discovered that agnes supposed his not making any inquiries concerning her or the child proceeded from brutal indifference concerning their fate and that considering him as a monster of inhumanity she had regarded him not only with contempt but abhorrence and seemed to have dismissed him entirely from her remembrance he beat his breast he cast himself on the floor in frantic anguish lamenting in all the bitterness of fruitless regret that agnes died without knowing how much he loved her and without suspecting that while she was supposing him unnaturally forgetful of her and her child he was struggling with illness caused by her desertion and with a dejection of spirits which he had never at times been able to overcome execrating at the same time the memory of his father and wilson whom he suspected of having intentionally deceived him to concludepity for the misery and compunction of lord mountcarrol and a sense of the advantages both in education and fortune that would accrue to little edward from living with his father prevailed on mr seymour and the husband of fanny to consent to his remaining where he wasand from that day edward was universally known as his lordships sonwho immediately made a will bequeathing him a considerable fortune lord mountcarrol was then sinking fast into his grave the victim of his vices and worn to the bone by the corroding consciousness that agnes had died in the persuasion of his having brutally neglected herthat was the bitterest pang of all she had thought him so vile that she could not for a moment regret him his first wife he had despised because she was weak and illiterate and hated because she had brought him no children his second wife was too amiable to be disliked but though he survived his marriage with her two years she also failed to produce an heir to the title and while he contemplated in edward the mind and person of his mother he was almost frantic with regret that he was not legally his son and he cursed the hour when with shortsighted cunning he sacrificed the honour of agnes to his views of family aggrandizement but selfish to the last moment of his existence it was a consciousness of his own misery not of that which he had inflicted which prompted his expressions of misery and regret and he grudged and envied agnes the comfort of having been able to despise and forget him peace to the memory of agnes fitzhenryand may the woman who like her has been the victim of artifice selfconfidence and temptation like her endeavour to regain the esteem of the world by patient suffering and virtuous exertion and look forward to the attainment of it with confidencebut may she whose innocence is yet secure and whose virtues still boast the stamp of chastity which can alone make them current in the world tremble with horror at the idea of listening to the voice of the seducer lest the image of a father a mother a brother a sister or some other fellowbeing whose peace of mind has been injured by her deviation from virtue should haunt her path through life and she who might perhaps have contemplated with fortitude the wreck of her own happiness be doomed to pine with fruitless remorse at the consciousness of having destroyed that of anotherfor where is the mortal who can venture to pronounce that his actions are of importance to no one and that the consequences of his virtues or his vices will be confined to himself alone the end printed by richard taylor shoelane london

the poacher by captain marryat captain frederick marryat was born july and died august he retired from the british navy in in order to devote himself to writing in the following years he wrote books many of which are among the very best of english literature and some of which are still in print marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories he says somewhere that when he sat down for the day's work he never knew what he was going to write he certainly was a literary genius the poacher was published in the eighteenth book to flow from marryat's pen this e text was transcribed in by nick hodson and was reformatted in and again in the poacher by captain frederick marryat chapter one in which there is more ale than argument it was on a blusterous windy night in the early part of november that three men were on the high road near to the little village of grassford in the south of devonshire the moon was nearly at the full but the wild scud and occasionally the more opaque clouds passed over in such rapid succession that it was rarely and but for a moment or two that the landscape was thrown into light and shadow and the wind which was keen and piercing bent and waved the leafless branches of the trees which were ranged along the hedgerows between which the road had been formed the three individuals to whom we have referred appeared all of them to have been indulging too freely in the ale which was sold at the public house about half a mile from the village and from which they had just departed two of them however comparatively speaking sober were assisting home by their joint efforts the third who supported between them could with difficulty use his legs thus did they continue on the two swayed first on the one side of the road and then on the other by the weight of the third whom they almost carried between them at last they arrived at a bridge built over one of those impetuous streams so common in the county when as if by mutual understanding for it was without speaking the two more sober deposited the body of the third against the parapet of the bridge and then for some time were silently occupied in recovering their breath one of the two who remained leaning on the parapet by the side of their almost lifeless companion was a man of about forty years of age tall and slender dressed in a worn out black coat and a pair of trousers much too short for him the original colour of which it would have been difficult to have surmised a sort of clerical hat equally the worse for wear was on his head although his habiliments were mean still there was something about his appearance which told of better days and of having moved in a different sphere in society and such had been the case some years before he had been the head of a grammar school with a comfortable income but a habit of drinking had been his ruin and he was now the preceptor of the village of grassford and gained his livelihood by instructing the children of the cottagers for the small modicum of twopence a head per week this unfortunate propensity to liquor remained with him and he no sooner received his weekly stipend than he hastened to drown his cares and the recollection of his former position at the ale house which they had just quitted the second personage whom we shall introduce was not of a corresponding height with the other he was broad square chested and short dressed in knee breeches leggings and laced boots his coat being of a thick fustian and cut short like a shooting jacket his profession was that of a pedlar it's odd to me said the pedlar at last breaking silence as he looked down upon the drunken man who lay at his feet why ale should take a man off his legs they say that liquor gets into the head not the feet well replied the schoolmaster who was much more inebriated than the pedlar there's argument even in that and you see the perpendicular deviation must arise from the head being too heavy that's clear and then you see the feet from the centre of gravity being destroyed become too light and if you put that and that together why a man can't stand you understand my demonstration it was heavy wet that ale and so i suppose it's all right replied the pedlar but still ale a'n't poured into the head or into the feet of a man but into the internals which are right in the middle of a man so how do you make out your case mr furness why byres you talk of the residuum never said a word about it and as i stand here never even heard the word before perhaps not the residuum is you see byres what is left if that's residgium i didn't mean to say a word about it there was none left for you drained the pot good byres you have never been to college that's clear now observe when a man pours down into his stomach a certain quantity of liquor the spirituous or lighter part ascends to his head and that makes his head heavy do you understand no what's light can't make things heavy can't it you know nothing about the matter have you not a proof before you replied the schoolmaster reeling and catching hold of the parapet for support look at that unfortunate man who has yielded to excess very true i see that he's drunk but i want to know how it is that he got drunk by drinking that i knew before then why ask any more questions had we not better proceed and take him home to his expectant and unhappy wife 'tis a sad sad thing that a man should put an enemy into his mouth to steal away his brains' half a pint will do that with rushbrook replied the pedlar they say that he was wounded on his head and that half his brains are gone already and that's why he has a pension yes seventeen pounds a year paid quarterly without deduction and only to walk four miles to get it replied furness yet how misplaced is the liberality on the part of the government does he work no he does nothing but drink and lie in bed all day while i must be up early and remain late teaching the young idea at twopence per week friend byres mercy is not itself which oft looks so' now it is my opinion that it would be a kindness to this poor wretch if we were to toss him as he now is over the bridge into the rushing stream it would end all his troubles and save us the trouble of getting him home replied byres who determined to humour his more inebriated companion well mr furness i've no objection why should he live is he not a sinecurist one of the locusts who fatten on the sweat and blood of the people as the sunday paper says don't you remember my reading it this morning very true master byres what d'ye say then shall we over with him we must think a little replied the schoolmaster who put his hand up to his chin and remained silent for a minute or two no resumed he at last on second thoughts i cannot do it he halves his beer with me no pension no beer that's a self evident proposition and conclusion it were ingratitude on my part and i cannot consent to your proposal continued the schoolmaster nay more i will defend him against your murderous intentions to the very last why master furness you must be somewhat the worse for liquor yourself it was your proposal to throw him over the bridge not mine take care what you say replied the schoolmaster would you accuse me of murder or intent to murder no not by no means only you proposed heaving him over the bridge i will say that friend byres it's my opinion you'll say anything but your prayers but in your present state i overlook it let us go on or i shall have two men to carry home instead of one come now take one of his arms while i take the other and raise him up it is but a quarter of a mile to the cottage byres who as we observed was by far the more sober of the two did not think it worth his while to reply to the pedagogue after a few staggers on the part of the latter their comrade was raised up and led away between them the drunken man appeared to be so far aware of what was going on that he moved his legs mechanically and in a short time they arrived at the cottage door which the pedagogue struck with his fist so as to make it rattle on its hinges the door was opened by a tall handsome woman holding a candle in her hand i thought so said she shaking her head the old story now he will be ill all night and not get up till noon what a weary life it is with a drunken husband bring him and thank you kindly for your trouble it has been hard work and hot work observed the schoolmaster sitting down in a chair after they had placed their comrade on the bed indeed and it must be replied the wife will you have a drop of small beer mr furness yes if you please and so will mr byres too what a pity it is your good man will not keep to small beer yes indeed replied the wife who went into the back premises and soon returned with a quart mug of beer the schoolmaster emptied half the mug and then handed it to the pedlar and my little friend joey fast asleep i'll warrant yes poor child and so should i have been by this time the clock has gone twelve well mrs rushbrook i wish you a good night come mr byres mrs rushbrook must want to be in bed good night mr furness and good night sir and many thanks the schoolmaster and pedlar quitted the cottage mrs rushbrook after having watched them for a minute carefully closed the door they're gone now said she as she turned to her husband what would have created much astonishment could anybody else have witnessed it as soon as his wife had spoken rushbrook immediately sprang upon his feet a fine looking man six feet in height very erect in his bearing and proved to be perfectly sober jane my dear said he there never was such a night but i must be quick and lose no time is my gun ready everything's ready joey is lying down on his bed but all ready dressed and he awakes in a minute call him then for there is no time to lose that drunken fool furness proposed throwing me over the bridge it was lucky for them that they did not try it or i should have been obliged to settle them both that they might tell no tales where's mum in the wash house i'll bring him and joey directly the wife left the room while rushbrook took down his gun and ammunition and prepared himself for his expedition in a minute or two a shepherd's dog which had been released from the wash house made his appearance and quietly lay down close to his master's feet it was soon followed by mrs rushbrook accompanied by joey a thin meagre looking boy of about twelve years old very small for his age but apparently as active as a cat and with energy corresponding no one would have thought he had been roused from his sleep there was no yawning or weariness of motion on the contrary his large eye was as bright as an eagle's as he quietly although quickly provided himself with a sack which he threw over his shoulders and a coil of line which he held in his hand waiting until his father was ready to start the wife put out the lights softly opened the cottage door looked well round and then returned to her husband who giving a low whistle as a summons to joey and the dog walked out of the door not a word was spoken the door was softly shut to and the trio crept stealthily away chapter two in which the hero of the tale is formally introduced before we proceed with our narrative perhaps it will be better to explain what may appear very strange to the reader joseph rushbrook who has just left the cottage with his son and his dog was born in the village in which he was then residing during his younger days some forty years previous to his present introduction to the reader the law was not so severe or the measures taken against poachers so strong as they were at the period of which we write in his youth he had been very fond of carrying a gun as his father had been before him but he never was discovered and after having poached for many years and gained a perfect knowledge of the country for miles round he was persuaded in a fit of semi intoxication at a neighbouring fair to enlist in a marching regiment he had not been more than three months at the depot when he was ordered out to india where he remained eleven years before he was recalled he had scarcely been six months in england when the exigency of the war demanded the services of the regiment in the mediterranean where he remained for twelve years and having received a severe wound in the head he was then pensioned off and discharged he resolved to return to his native village and settle down quietly hoping by moderate labour and his pension to gain a comfortable living on his return he was hardly known many had emigrated to a foreign clime many had been transported for offences against the laws particularly for the offence of poaching and as most of his former allies had been so employed he found himself almost a stranger where he expected to meet with friends the property also about the village had changed hands people recollected squire so and so and the baronet but now their lands were held by wealthy manufacturers or retired merchants all was new to joe rushbrook and he felt himself anywhere but at home jane ashley a very beautiful young woman who was in service at the hall the mansion appertaining to the adjacent property and the daughter of one of his earliest friends who had been transported for poaching was almost the only one who could talk to him after his absence of twenty four years not that she knew the people at the time for she was then an infant but she had grown up with them after joe had left and could narrate anecdotes of them and what had been their eventual destinies jane having been the daughter of a man who had been transported for poaching was to joe a sort of recommendation and it ended in his taking her for his wife they had not been long settled in their cottage before joe's former propensities returned in fact he could not be idle he had carried a musket too long and had lived such a life of excitement in the service of his country that he found it impossible to exist without shooting at something all his former love of poaching came strong upon him and his wife so far from checking him encouraged him in his feelings the consequence was that two years after his marriage joe rushbrook was the most determined poacher in the county although often suspected he had never been detected one great cause of this was his appearing to be such a drunkard a plan hit upon by his wife who had observed that drunken men were not suspected of being poachers this scheme had therefore been hit upon and very successfully for proving before a magistrate that a man was carried home dead drunk and speechless at midnight was quite as good an alibi as could be brought forward joe rushbrook had therefore the credit of being a worthless drunken fellow who lived upon his pension and what his wife could earn but no one had an idea that he was not only earning his livelihood but laying by money from his successful night labours not that joe did not like a drop occasionally on the contrary he would sometimes drink freely but generally speaking the wounds in his head were complained of and he would if the wind was fresh and set in the right quarter contrive to be carried home on the night in which he had most work to do such was the case as we have represented in the first chapter little joey who as the reader may anticipate will be our future hero was born the first year after marriage and was their only child he was a quiet thoughtful reflective boy for his years and had imbibed his father's love of walking out on a dark night to an extraordinary degree it was strange to see how much prudence there was mingled with the love of adventure in this lad true it is his father had trained him early first to examine the snares and conceal the game which a little shrimp like joey could do without being suspected to be otherwise employed than in picking blackberries before he was seven years old joey could set a springe as well as his father and was well versed in all the mystery and art of unlawful taking of game indeed he was very valuable to his father and could do what his father could not have ventured upon without exciting suspicion it was perhaps from his constant vigils that the little boy was so small in size at all events his diminutive size was the cause of there being no suspicion attached to him joey went very regularly to the day school of mr furness and although often up the best part of the night he was one of the best and most diligent of the scholars no one could have supposed that the little fair haired quiet looking boy who was so busy with his books or his writing could have been out half the night on a perilous excursion for such it was at the time we are speaking of it need hardly be observed that joey had learned one important lesson which was to be silent not even mum the dog who could not speak was more secret or more faithful it is astonishing how much the nature and disposition of a child may be altered by early tuition let a child be always with its nurse even under the guidance of a mother regularly brought up as children usually are and it will continue to be a child and even childish after childhood is gone but take the same child put it by degrees in situations of peril requiring thought and observation beyond its years accustom it to nightly vigils and to watching and to hold its tongue and it is astonishing how the mind of that child however much its body may suffer will develop itself so as to meet the demand upon it thus it is with lads that are sent early to sea and thus it was with little joey he was a man in some points although a child in others he would play with his companions laugh as loudly as the others but still he would never breathe a hint of what was his father's employment he went to church every sunday as did his father and mother for they considered that poaching was no crime although punished as such by the laws and he of course considered it no crime as he only did what his father and mother wished let it not be thought therefore that the morals of our little hero were affected by his father's profession for such was not the case having entered into this necessary explanation we will now proceed no band of north american indians could have observed a better trail than that kept by our little party rushbrook walked first followed by our hero and the dog mum not a word was spoken they continued their route over grass lands and ploughed fields keeping in the shade of the hedgerows if rushbrook stopped for a while to reconnoitre so did joey and so did mum at their relative distances until the march was resumed for three miles and a half did they thus continue until they arrived at a thick cover the wind whistled through the branches of the bare trees chiefly oak and ash the cold damp fog was now stationary and shrouded them as they proceeded cautiously by the beaten track in the cover until they had passed through it and arrived on the other side where the cottage of a gamekeeper was situated a feeble light was burning and shone through the diamond paned windows rushbrook walked out clear of the cover and held up his hand to ascertain precisely the direction of the wind having satisfied himself he retreated into the cover in a direction so as to be exactly to leeward of the keeper's house that the noise of the report of his gun might not be heard having cleared the hedge he lowered his gun so as to bring the barrel within two or three inches of the ground and walked slowly and cautiously through the brushwood followed as before by joey and mum after about a quarter of a mile's walk a rattling of metal was heard and they stopped short it was the barrel of the fowling piece which had brushed one of the wires attached to a spring gun set for the benefit of poachers rushbrook lifted up his left hand as a sign to joey not to move and following the wire by continually rattling his barrel against it he eventually arrived at the gun itself opened the pan threw out all the priming leaving it with the pan open so that it could not go off in case they fell in with another of the wires rushbrook then proceeded to business for he well knew that the gun would be set where the pheasants were most accustomed to roost he put a small charge of powder in his fowling piece that being so near he might not shatter the birds and because the noise of the report would be much less walking under an oak tree he soon discovered the round black masses which the bodies of the roosting pheasants presented between him and the sky and raising his piece he fired a heavy bound on the earth near his feet followed the discharge joey then slipped forward and put the pheasant into his bag another and another shot and every shot brought an increase to joey's load seventeen were already in it when mum gave a low growl this was the signal for people being near rushbrook snapped his finger the dog came forward to his side and stood motionless with ears and tail erect in a minute's time was heard the rustling of branches as the party forced their way through the underwood rushbrook stood still waiting the signal from mum for the dog had been taught if the parties advancing had another dog with them always to raise his fore feet up to rushbrook's knees but not otherwise mum made no such sign and then rushbrook lay down in the brushwood his motions being closely followed by his son and his dog voices in whispers were now heard and the forms of two men with guns were to be seen not four yards from where they were lying somewhere about here i'll swear said one yes i think so but it may be further on the wind has brought down the sound very true let's follow them and they may fall back upon the spring gun the parties then advanced into the cover and were soon out of sight after a time rushbrook held his ear to the wind and satisfied that all was safe moved homewards and arrived without further adventure having relieved joey of the heavy sack as soon as they were in the open fields at three o'clock in the morning he tapped at the back door of the cottage jane opened it and the spoils of the night having been put away in a secret place they were all soon in bed and fast asleep chapter three train a child in the way he should go and he will not depart from it it is an old saying that if there were no receivers there would be no thieves and it would have been of very little use for rushbrook to take the game if he had not had the means of disposing of it in this point byres the pedlar was a valuable accessory byres was a radical knave who did not admire hard work at first he took up the profession of bricklayer's labourer one that is of a nature only affording occasional work and moderate wages he did this that he might apply to the parish for relief and do nothing for the major portion of the year but even a few months' work would not suit him and subsequently he gained his sustenance by carrying on his head a large basket of crockery and disposing of his wares among the cottagers at last he took out a pedlar's license perhaps one of the most dangerous permits ever allowed by a government and which has been the cause of much of the ill will and discontent fomented among the lower classes latterly the cheapness of printing and easiness of circulation have rendered the profession of less consequence twenty years ago the village ale houses were not provided with newspapers it was an expense never thought of the men went to drink their beer and talk over the news of the vicinity and if there was a disturbance in any other portion of the united kingdom the fact was only gained by rumour and that vaguely and long after it had taken place but when the pedlar byres made his appearance which he at last did weekly or oftener as it might happen there was a great change he was the party who supplied information and in consequence he was always welcome and looked upon as an oracle the best seat near the fire was reserved for him and having deposited his pack upon the table or in a corner he would then produce the propeller or some other publication full of treason and blasphemy and read it aloud for the benefit of the labourers assembled a few months were more than sufficient to produce the most serious effects men who had worked cheerfully through the day and retired to bed satisfied with their lot and thankful that work was to be obtained now remained at the public house canvassing the conduct of government and leaving their resort satisfied in their own minds that they were ill used harshly treated and in bitter bondage if they met their superiors those very parties to whom they were indebted for employment there was no respect shown to them as formerly or if so it was sullen and forced acknowledgement the church was gradually deserted the appearance of the pastor was no longer a signal for every hat to be lifted from the head on the contrary boys of sixteen or seventeen years of age would lean against the church or the walls of the churchyard with their hands in both pockets and a sort of leer upon their faces as though they defied the pastor on his appearance and there would they remain outside during the service meeting unquailed and without blushing his eyes cast upon them as he came out again such was the state of things in the village of grassford in one year after the pedlar had added it to his continual rounds and byres was a great favourite for he procured for the women what they commissioned him to obtain supplied the girls with ribbons and gewgaws and trusted to a considerable extent his reappearance was always anxiously looked for he lived scot free at the public house for he brought so much custom and was the occasion of the drinking of so much ale that the landlord considered his coming as a godsend his box of ware was well supplied in the sunnier months for the fine weather was the time for the wearing of gay ribbons but in the winter he travelled more to receive orders or to carry away the game supplied to him by the poachers with whom he was in league had his box been examined during the shooting season it would have been found loaded with pheasants not with trinkets and ribbons it need hardly be observed after this that byres was the party who took off the hands of rushbrook all the game which he procured and which he had notice to call for before daylight generally the second morning after it had been obtained for rushbrook was too cautious to trust byres with his secret that of never going out of a night without having previously pretended intoxication and having suffered himself to be led or carried home our readers will acknowledge that little joey was placed in a very dangerous position it is true that he was not aware that he was doing wrong in assisting his father nevertheless being a reflective boy it did sometimes occur to him that it was odd that what was right should be done so secretly and he attempted to make out how it was that the birds that flew about everywhere and appeared to belong to every one might not be shot in the open day he knew that the laws forbade it but he inquired of himself why such laws should be joey had heard but one side of the question and was therefore puzzled it was fortunate for him that the pastor of the parish although he did not reside in it did at least once a week call in at mr f's school and examine the boys mr furness who was always sober during the school hours was very proud of these visits and used to point out little joey as his most promising scholar this induced the pastor to take more immediate notice of our hero and the commendation which he received and the advice that was bestowed upon him was probably the great cause why joey did attend assiduously to his lessons which his otherwise vagrant life would have disinclined him to do and also kept a character for honesty and good principle which he really deserved indeed his father and mother setting aside poaching and the secrecy resorted to in consequence were by no means bad examples in the ordinary course of life they did to their neighbours as they would be done by were fair and honest in their dealings and invariably inculcated probity and a regard to truth on their son this may appear anomalous to many of our readers but there are many strange anomalies in this world it may therefore be stated in a very few words that although our little hero had every chance of eventually following the road to ruin yet up to the present time he had not entered it such was the life led by little joey for three years subsequent to our introduction of him to the reader every day he became more useful to his father latterly he had not attended school but in the forenoon for as we have before observed joey could from his diminutive size and unsuspicious appearance do much that his father would not have ventured to attempt he was as well versed in the art of snaring as his father and sauntering like a child about the fields and hedge rows would examine his nooses take out the game and hide it till he could bring it home sometimes he would go out at night attended only by mum and the dog would invariably give him mute notice by simply standing with his ears and tail erect when the keepers had discovered the snares and were lying in wait for the poacher to lay hold of him when he came to ascertain his success even in such a case joey very often would not retreat but crawling on his stomach would arrive at the snare and take out the animal without the keepers perceiving him for their eyes were invariably directed to the horizon watching the appearance of some stout figure of a man while joey crawled along bearing away the prize unseen at other times joey would reap a rich harvest in the broad day by means of his favourite game cock having put on the animal his steel spurs he would plunge into the thickest of the cover and selecting some small spot of cleared ground for the combat he would throw down his gallant bird and conceal himself in the brushwood the game cock would immediately crow and his challenge was immediately answered by the pugnacious male pheasant who flew down to meet him the combat was short for the pheasant was soon pierced by the sharp steel of his adversary and as one antagonist fell dead again would the game cock crow and his challenge be accepted by another in an hour or two the small arena was a field of blood joey would creep forward put his victorious cock into his bag together with many dead adversaries and watch an opportunity for a safe retreat such was the employment of our hero and although suspicion had often been attached to his father none had an idea that there had been a violation of the laws on the part of the son when an event took place which changed our hero's destiny chapter four in which the author has endeavoured with all his power to suit the present taste of the public we have said that byres was the receiver of the game obtained by rushbrook it so happened that in these accounts byres had not adhered to his duty towards his neighbour in fact he attempted to over reach but without success and from that time byres became rushbrook's determined but secret enemy some months had passed since their disagreement and there was a mutual mistrust as both men were equally revengeful in their tempers when they happened to meet late on a saturday night at the ale house which was their usual resort furness the schoolmaster was there he and many others had already drunk too much all were boisterous and noisy a few of the wives of those drinking were waiting patiently and sorrowfully outside their arms folded in their aprons as a defence against the cold watching for their husbands to come out that they might coax them home before the major part of the week's earnings had been spent in liquor byres had the paper in his hand he had taken it from the schoolmaster who was too far gone to read it and was declaiming loudly against all governments monarchy and laws when a stranger entered the tap room where they were all assembled rushbrook was at the time sitting down intending quietly to take a pint and walk home as he had too much respect for the sabbath to follow his profession of poacher on the morning of that day he did not intend therefore to resort to his usual custom of pretending to be intoxicated but when the stranger came in to his great surprise he observed a glance of recognition between him and byres after which they appeared as if they were perfect strangers rushbrook watched them carefully but so as not to let them perceive he was so doing when a beckon from the stranger to byres was again made byres continued to read the paper and to harangue but at the same time took an opportunity of making a signal in reply there was something in the stranger's appearance which told rushbrook that he was employed as a keeper or something in that way for we often single out our enemies by instinct that there was mischief in the wind rushbrook felt sure and his heart misgave him the more so as occasionally the eyes of both were turned towards him after a little reflection rushbrook determined to feign intoxication as he had so often done before he called for another pint for some time talked very loud and at last laid his head on the table after a time he lifted it up again drank more and then fell back on the bench by degrees the company thinned until there was no one left but the schoolmaster the pedlar and the stranger the schoolmaster as usual offered to assist the pedlar in helping rushbrook to his cottage but byres replied that he was busy and that he need not wait for rushbrook the friend he had with him would assist him in taking home the drunken man the schoolmaster reeled home leaving the two together they sat down on the bench not far from rushbrook who appeared to them to be in the last stage of inebriety their conversation was easily overheard the pedlar stated that he had watched several nights but never could find when rushbrook left his cottage but he had traced the boy more than once that r had promised to have game ready for him on tuesday and would go out on monday night for it in short rushbrook discovered that byres was about to betray him to the man whom in the course of their conversation he found out to be a game keeper newly hired by the lord of the manor after a while they broke up byres having promised to join the keeper in his expedition and to assist in securing his former ally having made these arrangements they then took hold of rushbrook by the arms and shaking him to rouse him as much as they could they led him home to the cottage and left him in charge of his wife as soon as the door was closed rushbrook's long repressed anger could no longer be restrained he started on his feet and striking his fist on the table so as to terrify his wife swore that the pedlar should pay dear for his peaching upon his wife's demanding an explanation rushbrook in a few hurried sentences explained the whole jane however she might agree with him in his indignation like all women shuddered at the thought of shedding blood she persuaded her husband to go to bed he consented but he slept not he had but one feeling which was vengeance towards the traitor when revenge enters into the breast of a man who has lived peaceably at home fiercely as he may be impelled by the passion he stops short at the idea of shedding blood but when a man who had like rushbrook served so long in the army witnessed such scenes of carnage and so often passed his bayonet through his adversary's body is roused up by this fatal passion the death of a fellow creature becomes a matter of indifference provided he can gratify his feelings thus it was with rushbrook who before he rose on the morning of that sabbath in which had he gone to church he could have so often requested his trespasses might be forgiven as he forgave them who trespassed against him had made up his mind that nothing short of the pedlar's death would satisfy him at breakfast he appeared to listen to his wife's entreaties and promised to do the pedlar no harm and told her that instead of going out on the monday night as he had promised he should go out on that very night and by that means evade the snare laid for him jane persuaded him not to go out at all but this rushbrook would not consent to he told her that he was determined to show them that he was not to be driven off his beat and would make byres believe on tuesday night that he had been out on the monday night rushbrook's object was to have a meeting with byres if possible alone to tax him with his treachery and then to take summary vengeance aware that byres slept at the ale house he went down there a little before dark and told him that he intended going out on that night that it would be better if instead of coming on tuesday he were to meet him at the corner of one of the covers which he described at an hour agreed upon when he would make over to him the game which he might have procured byres who saw in this an excellent method of trapping rushbrook consented to it intending to inform the keeper so that he should meet rushbrook the time of meeting was arranged for two o'clock in the morning rushbrook was certain that byres would leave the ale house an hour or two before the time proposed which would be more than sufficient for his giving information to the keeper he therefore remained quietly at home till twelve o'clock when he loaded his gun and went out without joey or the dog his wife perceiving this was convinced that he had not gone out with the intention to poach but was pursuing his scheme of revenge she watched him after he left the cottage and observed that he had gone down in the direction of the ale house and she was afraid that there would be mischief between him and byres and she wakened joey desiring him to follow and watch his father and do all he could to prevent it her communication was made in such a hurried manner that it was difficult for joey to know what he was to do except to watch his father's motions and see what took place this joey perfectly understood and he was off in an instant followed as usual by mum and taking with him his sack our hero crept softly down the pathway in the direction of the ale house the night was dark for the moon did not rise till two or three hours before the morning broke and it was bitterly cold but to darkness and cold joey had been accustomed and although not seen himself there was no object could move without being scanned by his clear vision he gained a hedge close to the ale house mum wanted to go on by which joey knew that his father must be lurking somewhere near to him he pressed the dog down with his hand crouched himself and watched in a few minutes a dark figure was perceived by joey to emerge from the ale house and walk hastily over a turnip field behind the premises it had gained about half over when another form which joey recognised as his father's stealthily followed after the first joey waited a little time and was then with mum on the steps of both for a mile and a half each party kept at their relative distances until they came near a furze bottom which was about six hundred yards from the cover then the steps of rushbrook were quickened and those of joey in proportion the consequence was that the three parties rapidly neared each other byres for it was he who had quitted the ale house walked along leisurely having no suspicion that he was followed rushbrook was now within fifteen yards of the pedlar and joey at even less distance from his father when he heard the lock of his father's gun click as he cocked it father said joey not over loud don't who's there cried the pedlar turning round the only reply was the flash and report of the gun and the pedlar dropped among the furze oh father father what have you done exclaimed joey coming up to him you here joey said rushbrook why are you here mother sent me replied joey to be evidence against me replied his father in wrath oh no to stop you what have you done father what i almost wish i had not done now replied he mournfully but it is done and and what father i am a murderer i suppose replied rushbrook he would have peached joey have had me transported to work in chains for the rest of my days merely for taking a few pheasants let us go home but rushbrook did not move although he proposed so doing he leant upon his gun with his eyes fixed in the direction where byres had fallen joey stood by him for nearly ten minutes not a word was spoken at last rushbrook said joey my boy i've killed many a man in my time and i have thought nothing of it i slept as sound as ever the next night but then you see i was a soldier and it was my trade and i could look on the man i had killed without feeling sorrow or shame but i can't look upon this man joey he was my enemy but i've murdered him i feel it now go up to him boy you are not afraid to meet him and see if he be dead joey although generally speaking fear was a stranger to him did however feel afraid his hands had often been dyed with the blood of a hare or of a bird but he had not yet seen death in his fellow creatures he advanced slowly and tremulously through the dark towards the furze bush in which the body laid mum followed raising first one paw and pausing then the other and as they came to the body the dog raised his head and gave such a mournful howl that it induced our hero to start back again after a time joey recovered himself and again advanced to the body he leant over it he could distinguish but the form he listened and not the slightest breathing was to be heard he whispered the pedlar's name but there was no reply he put his hand upon his breast and removed it reeking with warm blood father he must be dead quite dead whispered joey who returned trembling what shall we do we must go home replied rushbrook this is a bad night's work and without exchanging another word until their arrival rushbrook and joey proceeded back to the cottage followed by mum chapter five the sins of the father are visited upon the child jane had remained in a state of great anxiety during her husband's absence watching and listening to every sound every five minutes raising the latch of the door and looking out hoping to see him return as the time went on her alarm increased she laid her head down on the table and wept she could find no consolation no alleviation of her anxiety she dropped down on her knees and prayed she was still appealing to the most high when a blow on the door announced her husband's return there was a sulken gloom over his countenance as he entered he threw his gun carelessly on one side so that it fell and rattled against the paved floor and this one act was to her ominous of evil he sat down without speaking falling back in the chair and lifting his eyes up to the rafters above he appeared to be in deep thought and unconscious of her presence what has happened inquired his wife trembling as she laid her hand on his shoulder don't speak to me now was the reply joey said the frightened woman in a whisper what has he done joey answered not but raised his hand red with the blood which was now dried upon it jane uttered a faint cry dropped on her knees and covered her face while joey walked into the back kitchen and busied himself in removing the traces of the dark deed a quarter of an hour had elapsed joey had returned and taken his seat upon his low stool and not a word had been exchanged there certainly is a foretaste of the future punishment which awaits crime for how dreadful were the feelings of those who were now sitting down in the cottage rushbrook was evidently stupefied from excess of feeling first the strong excitement which had urged him to the deed and now from the reaction the prostration of mental power which had succeeded it jane dreaded the present and the future whichever way she turned her eyes the gibbet was before her the clanking of chains in her ears in her vision of the future scorn misery and remorse she felt only for her husband joey poor boy he felt for both even the dog showed as he looked up into joey's face that he was aware that a foul deed had been done the silence which it appeared none would venture to break was at last dissolved by the clock of the village church solemnly striking two they all started up it was a warning it reminded them of the bell tolling for the dead of time and of eternity but time present quickly effaced for the moment other ideas yes it was time to act in four hours more it would be daylight and the blood of the murdered man would appeal to his fellow men for vengeance the sun would light them to the deed of darkness the body would be brought home the magistrates would assemble and who would be the party suspected merciful heaven exclaimed jane what can be done there is no proof muttered rushbrook yes there is observed joey i left my bag there when i stooped down to silence cried rushbrook yes continued he bitterly to his wife this is your doing you must send the boy after me and now there will be evidence against me i shall owe my death to you oh say not so say not so replied jane falling down on her knees and weeping bitterly as she buried her face in his lap but there is yet time cried she starting up joey can go and fetch the bag you will joey won't you dear you are not afraid you are innocent better leave it where it is mother replied joey calmly rushbrook looked up at his son with surprise jane caught him by the arm she felt convinced the boy had some reason for what he said probably some plan that would ward off suspicion yet how could that be it was evidence against them and after looking earnestly at the boy's face she dropped his arm why so joey said she with apparent calmness because replied joey i have been thinking about it all this time i am innocent and therefore i do not mind if they suppose me guilty the bag is known to be mine the gun i must throw into a ditch two fields off you must give me some money if you have any if not i must go without it but there is no time to be lost i must be off and away from here in ten minutes to morrow ask every one if they have seen or heard of me because i have left the house some time during the night i shall have a good start before that besides they may not find the pedlar for a day or two perhaps at all events not till some time after i am gone and then you see mother the bag which is found by him and the gun in the ditch will make them think it is me who killed him but they will not be able to make out whether i killed him by accident and ran away from fear or whether i did it on purpose so now mother that's my plan for it will save father and i shall never see you again my child replied his mother that's as may be you may go away from here after a time mother when the thing has blown over come mother there is no time to lose rushbrook what say you what think you said jane to her husband why jane at all events the boy must have left us for you see i told byres and i've no doubt but he told the keeper if he met him that i should bring joey with me i did it to deceive him and as sure as i sit here they will have that boy up as evidence against his father to be sure they will cried joey and what could i do i dare not i don't think i could tell a lie and yet i would not peach upon father neither what can i do but be out of the way that's the truth away with you then my boy and take a father's blessing with you a guilty father's it is true god forgive me jane give him all the money you have lose not a moment quick woman quick and rushbrook appeared to be in agony jane hastened to the cupboard opened a small box and poured the contents into the hands of joey farewell my boy said rushbrook your father thanks you heaven preserve you my child cried jane embracing him as the tears rained down her cheeks you will write no you must not mercy mercy i shall never see him again and the mother fainted on the floor the tears rose in our hero's eyes as he beheld the condition of his poor mother once more he grasped his father's hand and then catching up the gun he went out at the back door and driving back the dog who would have followed him made over the fields as fast as his legs would carry him chapter six the world before him where to choose we have no doubt but many of our readers have occasionally when on a journey come to where the road divides into two forking out in different directions and the road being new to them have not known which of the two branches they ought to take this happens as it often does in a novel to be our case just now shall we follow little joey or his father and mother that is the question we believe that when a road does thus divide the wider of the two branches is generally selected as being supposed to be the continuation of the high road we shall ourselves act upon that principle and as the hero of the tale is of more consequence than characters accessory we shall follow up the fortunes of little joey as soon as our hero had deposited the gun so that it might be easily discovered by any one passing by he darted into the high road and went off with all the speed that he was capable of and it was not yet light when he found himself at least ten miles from his native village as the day dawned he quitted the high road and took to the fields keeping a parallel course so as to still increase the distance it was not until he had made fifteen miles that finding himself exhausted he sat down to recover himself from the time that he had left the cottage until the present joey had had but one overwhelming idea in his head which was to escape from pursuit and by his absence to save his father from suspicion but now that he had effected that purpose and was in a state of quiescence other thoughts rushed upon his mind first the scenes of the last few hours presented themselves in rapid array before him he thought of the dead man and he looked at his hand to ascertain if the bloody marks had been effaced and then he thought of his poor mother's state when he quitted the cottage and the remembrance made him weep bitterly his own position came next upon him a boy twelve years of age adrift upon the world how was he to live what was he to do this reminded him that his mother had given him money he put his hand into his pocket and pulled it out to ascertain what he possessed he had pound shillings to him a large sum and it was all in silver as he had become more composed he began to reflect upon what he had better do where should he go to london it was a long way he knew but the farther he was away from home the better besides he had heard much of london and that every one got employment there joey resolved that he would go to london he knew that he had taken the right road so far and having made up his mind he rose up and proceeded he knew that if possible he must not allow himself to be seen on the road for a day or two and he was puzzled how he was to get food which he already felt would be very acceptable and then what account was he to give of himself if questioned such were the cogitations of our little hero as he wended his way till he came to a river which was too deep and rapid for him to attempt to ford he was obliged to return to the high road to cross the bridge he looked around him before he climbed over the low stone wall and perceiving nobody he jumped on the footpath and proceeded to the bridge where he suddenly faced an old woman with a basket of brown cakes something like ginger bread taken by surprise and hardly knowing what to say he inquired if a cart had passed that way yes child but it must be a good mile ahead of you said the old woman and you must walk fast to overtake it i have had no breakfast yet and i am hungry do you sell your cakes yes child what else do i make them for three a penny and cheap too joey felt in his pocket until he had selected a sixpence and pulling it out desired the old woman to give him cakes for it and taking the pile in his hand he set off as fast as he could as soon as he was out of sight he again made his way into the fields and breakfasted upon half his store he then continued his journey until nearly one o'clock when tired out with his exertions as soon as he had finished the remainder of his cakes he laid down under a rick of corn and fell fast asleep having made twenty miles since he started in his hurry to escape pursuit and the many thoughts which occupied his brain joey had made no observation on the weather if he had he probably would have looked after some more secure shelter than the lee side of a haystack he slept soundly and he had not been asleep more than an hour when the wind changed and the snow fell fast nevertheless joey slept on and probably never would have awakened more had it not been that a shepherd and his dog were returning home in the evening and happened to pass close to the haystack by this time joey had been covered with a layer of snow half an inch deep and had it not been for the dog who went up to where he laid and commenced pawing the snow off of him he would have been passed by undiscovered by the shepherd who after some trouble succeeded in rousing our hero from his torpor and half dragging half lifting him contrived to lead him across one or two fields until they arrived at a blacksmith's shop in a small village before joey could have been said to have recovered his scattered senses two hours' more sleep and there would have been no further history to give of our little hero he was dragged to the forge the fire of which glowed under the force of the bellows and by degrees as the warmth reached him he was restored to self possession to the inquiries made as to who he was and from where he came he now answered as he had before arranged in his mind his father and mother were a long way before him he was going to london but having been tired he had fallen asleep under the haystack and he was afraid that if he went not on to london directly he never might find his father and mother again oh then replied the shepherd they have gone on before have they well you'll catch them no doubt the blacksmith's wife who had been a party to what was going on now brought up a little warm ale which quite re established joey and at the same time a waggon drove up to the door and stopped at the blacksmith's shop i must have a shoe tacked on the old mare my friend said the driver you won't be long not five minutes replied the smith you're going to london yes sure here's a poor boy that has been left behind by his father and mother somehow you wouldn't mind giving him a lift well i don't know i suppose i must be paid for it in the world to come and good pay too if you earn it observed the blacksmith well it won't make much difference to my eight horses i expect said the driver looking at joey so come along youngster you may perch yourself on top of the straw above the goods first come in with me child said the wife of the blacksmith you must have some good victuals to take with you so while you shoe the horse john i'll see to the boy the woman put before joey a dish in which were the remains of more than one small joint and our hero commenced his attack without delay have you any money child inquired the woman joey who thought she might expect payment replied yes ma'am i've got a shilling and he pulled one out of his pocket and laid it out on the table bless the child what do you take me for to think that i would touch your money you are a long way from london yet although you have got such a chance to get there do you know where to go when you get there yes ma'am replied joey i shall get work in the stables i believe well i dare say that you will but in the meantime you had better save your shilling so we'll find something to put this meat and bread up for your journey are you quite warm now yes thank'ee ma'am joey who had ceased eating had another warm at the fire and in a few minutes having bade adieu and giving his thanks to the humane people he was buried in the straw below the tilt of the waggon with his provisions deposited beside him and the waggon went on his slow and steady pace to the tune of its own jingling bells joey who had quite recovered from his chill nestled among the straw congratulating himself that he should now arrive safely in london without more questioning and such was the case in three days and three nights without any further adventure he found himself although he was not aware of it in oxford street somewhat about eight or nine o'clock in the evening do you know your way now boy said the carman i can ask it replied joey as soon as i can go to the light and read the address good bye and thank you continued he glad at last to be clear of any more evasive replies the carman shook him by the hand as they passed the boar and castle and bade him farewell and our hero found himself alone in the vast metropolis what was he to do he hardly knew but one thought struck him which was that he must find a bed for the night he wandered up and down oxford street for some time but every one walked so quick that he was afraid to speak to them at last a little girl of seven or eight years of age passed by him and looked him earnestly in the face can you tell me where i can get a bed for the night said joey have you any brads was the reply what are those said joey any money to be sure why you're green quite yes i have a shilling that will do come along and you shall sleep with me joey followed her very innocently and very glad that he had been so fortunate she led him to a street out of tottenham court road in which there were no lamps the houses however were large and many stories high take my hand said the girl and mind how you tread guided by his new companion joey arrived at a door that was wide open they entered and assisted by the girl he went up a dark staircase to the second storey she opened a room door when joey found himself in company with about twenty other children of about the same age of both sexes here were several beds on the floor of the room which was spacious in the centre were huddled together on the floor round a tallow candle eight or ten of the inmates two of them playing with a filthy pack of cards while the others looked over them others were lying down or asleep on the several beds this is my bed said the girl if you are tired you can turn in at once i shan't go to bed yet joey was tired and he went to bed it was not very clean but he had been used to worse lodgings lately it need hardly be observed that joey had got into very bad company the whole of the inmates of the room consisting of juvenile thieves and pickpockets who in the course of time obtain promotion in their profession until they are ultimately sent off to botany bay attempts have been made to check these nurseries of vice but pseudo philanthropists have resisted such barbarous innovation and upon the mosaic principle that you must not seethe the kid in the mother's milk they are protected and allowed to arrive at full maturity and beyond the chance of being reclaimed until they are ripe for the penalties of the law joey slept soundly and when he awoke next morning found that his little friend was not with him he dressed himself and then made another discovery which was that every farthing of his money had been abstracted from his pockets of this unpleasant fact he ventured to complain to one or two boys who were lying on other beds with their clothes on they laughed at him called him a greenhorn and made use of other language which at once let joey know the nature of the company with whom he had been passing the night after some altercation three or four of them bundled him out of the room and joey found himself in the street without a farthing and very much inclined to eat a good breakfast there is no portion of the world small as it is in comparison with the whole in which there is more to be found to eat and to drink more comfortable lodgings or accommodation and convenience of every kind than in the metropolis of england provided you have the means to obtain it but notwithstanding this abundance there is no place probably where you will find it more difficult to obtain a portion of it if you happen to have an empty pocket joey went into a shop here and there to ask for employment he was turned away everywhere he spent the first day in this manner and at night tired and hungry he laid down on the stone steps of a portico and fell asleep the next morning he awoke shivering with the cold faint with hunger he asked at the areas for something to eat but no one would give him anything at a pump he obtained a drink of water that was all he could obtain for it cost nothing another day passed without food and the poor boy again sheltered himself for the night at a rich man's door in berkeley square chapter seven if you want employment go to london the exhausted lad awoke again and pursued his useless task of appeals for food and employment it was a bright day and there was some little warmth to be collected by basking in the rays of the sun when our hero wended his way through saint james's park faint hungry and disconsolate there were several people seated on the benches and joey weak as he was did not venture to go near them but crawled along at last after wandering up and down looking for pity in everybody's face as they passed and receiving none he felt that he could not stand much longer and emboldened by desperation he approached a bench that was occupied by one person at first he only rested on the arm of the bench but as the person sitting down appeared not to observe him he timidly took a seat at the farther end the personage who occupied the other part of the bench was a man dressed in a morning suit a la militaire and black stock he had clean gloves and a small cane in his hand with which he was describing circles on the gravel before him evidently in deep thought in height he was full six feet and his proportions combined strength with symmetry his features were remarkably handsome his dark hair had a natural curl and his whiskers and mustachios for he wore those military appendages were evidently the objects of much attention and solicitude we may as well here observe that although so favoured by nature still there would have been considered something wanting in him by those who had been accustomed to move in the first circles to make him the refined gentleman his movements and carriage were not inelegant but there was a certain retinue wanting he bowed well but still it was not exactly the bow of a gentleman the nursery maids as they passed by said dear me what a handsome gentleman but had the remark been made by a higher class it would have been qualified into what a handsome man his age was apparently about five and thirty it might have been something more after a short time he left off his mechanical amusements and turning round perceived little joey at the farther end whether from the mere inclination to talk or that he thought it presuming in our hero to seat himself upon the same bench he said to him i hope you are comfortable my little man but perhaps you've forgot your message i have no message sir for i know no one and i am not comfortable for i am starving replied joey in a tremulous voice are you in earnest now when you say that boy or is it that you're humbugging me joey shook his head i have eaten nothing since the day before yesterday morning and i feel faint and sick replied he at last his new companion looked earnestly in our hero's face and was satisfied that what he said was true as i hope to be saved exclaimed he it's my opinion that a little bread and butter would not be a bad thing for you here continued he putting his hand into his coat pocket take these coppers and go and get some thing into your little vitals thank you sir thank you kindly but i don't know where to go i only came up to london two days ago then follow me as fast as your little pins can carry you said the other they had not far to go for a man was standing close to spring garden gate with hot tea and bread and butter and in a few moments joey's hunger was considerably appeased do you feel better now my little cock yes sir thank you that's right and now we will go back to the bench and then you shall tell me all about yourself just to pass away the time now said he as he took his seat in the first place who is your father if you have any and if you haven't any what was he father and mother are both alive but they are a long way off father was a soldier and he has a pension now a soldier do you know in what regiment yes it was the rd i think by the powers my own regiment and what is your name then and his rushbrook replied joey my pivot man by all that's holy now haven't you nicely dropped on your feet i don't know sir replied our hero but i do your father was the best fellow i had in my company the best forager and always took care of his officer as a good man should do if there was a turkey or a goose or a duck or a fowl or a pig within ten miles of us he would have it he was the boy for poaching and now tell me and mind you tell the truth when you meet with a friend what made you leave your father and mother i was afraid of being taken up and here joey stopped for he hardly knew what to say trust his new acquaintance with his father's secret he dare not neither did he like to tell what was directly false as the reader will perceive by his reply he partly told the truth afraid of being taken up why what could they take up a spalpeen like you for poaching replied joey father poached too they had proof against me so i came away with father's consent poaching well i'm not surprised at that for if ever it was in the blood it is in yours that's truth and what do you mean to do now anything i can to earn my bread what can you do besides poaching of course can you read and write oh yes would you like to be a servant clean boots brush clothes stand behind a cab run messages carry notes and hold your tongue i could do all that i think i am twelve years old the devil you are well then for your father's sake i'll see what i can do for you till you can do better i'll fit you out as a tiger and what's more unless i am devilish hard up i won't sell you so come along what's your name joey sure that was your father's name before you i now recollect and should any one take the trouble to ask you what may be the name of your master you may reply with a safe conscience that it's captain o'donahue now come along not close after me you may as well keep open file just now till i've made you look a little more decent chapter eight a dissertation upon pedigree our readers will not perhaps be displeased if we introduce captain o'donahue more particularly to their notice we shall therefore devote this chapter to giving some account of his birth parentage and subsequent career if the father of captain o'donahue was to be believed the race of the o'donahues were kings in ireland long before the o'connors were ever heard of how far this may be correct we cannot pretend to offer an opinion further than that no man can be supposed to know so much of a family's history as the descendant himself the documents were never laid before us and we have only the positive assertion of the squireen o'donahue who asserted not only that they were kings in ireland before the o'connors whose pretensions to ancestry he treated with contempt but further that they were renowned for their strength and were famous for using the longest bows in battle that were ever known or heard of here we have circumstantial evidence although not proof if strong they might have been kings in ireland for there might has been right for many centuries and certainly their acquirements were handed down to posterity as no one was more famous for drawing the long bow than the squireen o'donahue upon these points however we must leave our readers to form their own opinions perhaps some one more acquainted with the archives of the country may be able to set us right if we are wrong or to corroborate our testimony if we are right in his preface to anne of geierstein sir walter scott observes that errors however trivial ought in his opinion never to be pointed out to the author without meeting with a candid and respectful acknowledgement following the example of so great a man we can only say that if any gentleman can prove or disprove the assertion of the squireen o'donahue to wit that the o'donahues were kings of ireland long before the o'connors were heard of we shall be most happy to acknowledge the favour and insert his remarks in the next edition we should be further obliged to the same party or indeed any other it they would favour us with an idea of what was implied by a king of ireland in those days that is to say whether he held a court taxed his subjects collected revenue kept up a standing army sent ambassadors to foreign countries and did all which kings do nowadays or whether his shillelagh was his sceptre and his domain some furze crowned hills and a bog the intricacies of which were known only to himself whether he was arrayed in jewelled robes with a crown of gold weighing on his temples or whether he went bare legged and bare armed with his bare locks flowing in luxurious wildness to the breeze we request an answer to this in full simplicity we observe that even in ireland now a fellow six feet high and stout in proportion is called a prince of a fellow although he has not wherewithal to buy a paper of tobacco to supply his dhudeen and arguing from this fact we are inclined to think that a few more inches in stature and commensurate muscular increase of power would in former times have raised the heir apparent to the dignity of the irish throne but these abstruse speculations have led us from our history which we must now resume whatever may once have been the importance of the house of o'donahue one thing is certain that there are many ups and downs in this world every family in it has its wheel of fortune which revolves faster or slower as the fates decree and the descendant of kings before the o'connor's time was now descended into a species of viceroy squireen o'donahue being the steward of certain wild estates in the county of galway belonging to a family who for many years had shown a decided aversion to the natural beauties of the country and had thought proper to migrate to where if people were not so much attached to them they were at all events more civilised these estates were extensive but not lucrative they abounded in rocks brushwood and woodcocks during the season and although the squireen o'donahue did his best if not for his employer at least for himself it was with some difficulty that he contrived to support with anything like respectability which in that part of the country means dacent clothes to wear a very numerous family lineally descended from the most ancient of all the kings of ireland before the squireen had obtained his employment he had sunk his rank and travelled much as a courier thereby gaining much knowledge of the world if therefore he had no wealth to leave his children at all events he could impart to them that knowledge which is said to be better than worldly possessions having three sons and eight daughters all of them growing up healthy and strong with commensurate appetites he soon found that it was necessary to get rid of them as fast as he could his eldest who strange to say for an o'donahue was a quiet lad he had as a favour lent to his brother who kept a small tobacconist and grocer's shop in dublin and his brother was so fond of him that eventually o'carroll o'donahue was bound to him as an apprentice it certainly was a degradation for the descendant of such ancient kings to be weighing out pennyworths of sugar and supplying halfpenny papers of tobacco to the old apple and fish women but still there we must leave the heir apparent while we turn to the second son mr patrick o'donahue whose history we are now relating having already made the reader acquainted with him by an introduction in saint james's park chapter nine in which the advice of a father deserves peculiar attention it may be supposed that as steward of the estates squireen o'donahue had some influence over the numerous tenants on the property and this influence he took care to make the most of his assistance in a political contest was rewarded by the offer of an ensigncy for one of his sons in a regiment then raising in ireland and this offer was too good to be refused so one fine day squireen o'donahue came home from dublin well bespattered with mud and found his son patrick also well bespattered with mud having just returned home from a very successful expedition against the woodcocks patrick my jewel said the squireen taking a seat and wiping his face for he was rather warm with his ride you're a made man and well made too father if the girls are anything of judges replied patrick you put me out replied the squireen you've more to be vain of than your figure and what may that be that you're discoursing about father nothing more nor less nor better nor worse but you're an ensign in his majesty's new regiment the number has escaped my memory i'd rather be a colonel father replied patrick musing the colonel's to come you spalpeen said the squireen and the fortune to make i expect replied patrick you've just hit it but haven't you the whole world before you to pick and choose well replied patrick after a pause i've no objection no objection why don't you jump out of your skin with delight at all events you might jump high enough to break in the caling there's no ceiling to break replied patrick looking up at the rafters that's true enough but still you might go out of your seven senses in a rational sort of a way i really can't see for why father dear you tell me i'm to leave my poor old mother who doats upon me my sisters who are fond of me my friends here patting the dogs who follow me the hills that i love and the woodcocks which i shoot to go to be shot at myself and buried like a dead dog without being skinned on the field of battle i tell you to go forth into the world as an officer and make your fortune to come back a general and be the greatest man of your family and don't be too unhappy about not being skinned before you are older or wiser dead or alive you'll be skinned i'll answer for it well father i'll go but i expect there'll be a good deal of ground to march over before i'm a general and you've a good pair of legs so i'm told every day of my life i'll make the best use of them when i start but it's the starting i don't like and that's the real truth the reader may be surprised at the indifference shown by patrick at the intelligence communicated by his father but the fact was mr patrick o'donahue was very deep in love this cooled his national ardour and it must be confessed that there was every excuse for a more lovely creature than judith mccrae never existed to part with her was the only difficulty and all his family feelings were but a cloak to the real cause of his unwillingness nevertheless you must start to morrow my boy said his father what must be must replied patrick so there's an end of the matter i'll just go out for a bit of a walk just to stretch my legs they require a deal of stretching pat considering you've been twenty miles at least this morning over the mountains replied the squireen but patrick was out of hearing he had leapt over a stone wall which separated his father's potato ground from cornelius mccrae's and had hastened to judith whom he found very busy getting the dinner ready judith my dear said patrick my heart's quite broke with the bad news i have to tell you sure i'm going to leave you to morrow morning now patrick you're joking surely devil a joke in it i'm an ensign in a regiment then i'll die patrick more like that i will judith what with grief and a bullet to help it perhaps now what d'ye mean to do patrick mean to go sure because i can't help myself and to come back again if ever i've the luck of it my heart's leaping out of my mouth entirely and mine's dead replied judith in tears it's no use crying mavourneen i'll be back to dance at my own wedding if so be i can there'll be neither wedding for you patrick nor wake either for you'll lie on the cold ground and be ploughed in like muck that's but cold comfort from you judith but we'll hope for a better ending but i must go back now and you'll meet me this evening beyond the shealing won't it be for the last time patrick replied judith with her apron up to her eyes if i've any voice in the matter i say no please the pigs i'll come back a colonel then you'll be no match for judith mccrae replied the sobbing girl shoot easy my judith that's touching my honour if i'm a general it will be all the same oh patrick patrick patrick folded judith in his arms took one kiss and then hastened out of the house saying remember the shealing judith dear there we'll talk the matter over easy and comfortable patrick returned to his house where he found his mother and sisters in tears they had received orders to prepare his wardrobe which by the bye did not give them much trouble from its extent they only had to mend every individual article his father was sitting down by the hearth and when he saw patrick he said to him now just come here my boy and take a stool while you listen to me and learn a little worldly wisdom for i may not have much time to talk to you when we are at dublin patrick took a seat and was all attention you'll just observe pat that it's a very fine thing to be an officer in the king's army nobody dares to treat you ill although you may ill treat others which is no small advantage in this world there's truth in that replied patrick you see when you get into an enemy's country you may help yourself and if you look sharp there's very pretty pickings all in a quiet way you understand that indeed you observe pat that as one of his officers the king expects you to appear and live like a gentleman only he forgets to give you the means of so doing you must therefore take all you can get from his majesty and other people must make up the difference that's a matter o' course said patrick you'll soon see your way clear and find out what you may be permitted to do and what you may not for the king expects you to keep up the character of a gentleman as well as the appearance o' course mayhap you may be obliged to run in debt a little a gentleman may do that mayhap you may not be able to pay that's a gentleman's case very often if so never go so far as twenty pounds first because the law don't reach and secondly because twenty pound is quite enough to make a man suffer for the good of his country there's sense in that father and patrick recollect that people judge by appearances in this world especially when they've nothing else to go by if you talk small your credit will be small but if you talk large it will be just in proportion i perceive father it's not much property we possess in this said county of galway that's certain but you must talk of this property as if i was the squire and not the steward and when you talk of the quantity of woodcocks you have bagged you must say on our property i understand father and you must curse your stars at being a younger brother it will be an excuse for your having no money but will make them believe it's in the family at all events i perceive replied patrick there's one thing more pat it's an irish regiment so you must get out of it as soon as possible by exchange for why this for why you will be among those born too near home and who may doubt all you say because your story may interfere with their own get into an english regiment by all means and there you'll be beyond the reach of contradiction which ain't pleasant true enough father treasure up all i have told you it's worldly wisdom and you have your fortune to make so now recollect never hold back at a forlorn hope volunteer for everything volunteer to be blown from a cannon's mouth so that they will give you promotion for that same volunteer to go all over the world into the other world and right through that again into the one that comes after that if there is any and then one thing will be certain either that you'll be colonel or general or else else what father that you won't require to be made either seeing that you'll be past all making but luck's all and lucky it is by the bye that i have a little of the squire's rent in hand to fit you out with or how we should have managed the saints only know as it is i must sink it on the next year's account but that's more easy to do than to fit you out with no money i must beg the tenants off make the potato crop fail entirely and report twenty by name at least dead of starvation serve him right for spending his money out of old ireland it's only out of real patriotism that i cheat him just to spend the money in the country and now patrick i've done now you may go and square your accounts with judith for i know now where the cat jumps but i'll leave old time alone for doing his work such was the advice of the squireen to his son and as worldly wisdom it was not so bad and certainly when a lad is cast adrift in the world the two best things you can bestow on him are a little worldly wisdom and a little money for without the former the latter and he will soon part company the next day they set off for dublin patrick's head being in a confused jumble of primitive good feeling judith mccrae his father's advice and visions of future greatness he was fitted out introduced to the officers and then his father left him his blessing and his own way to make in the world in a fortnight the regiment was complete and they were shipped to liverpool and from liverpool to maidstone where being all newly raised men they were to remain for a time to be disciplined before the year had expired patrick had followed his father's advice and exchanged receiving a difference with an ensign of a regiment going on foreign service he was sent to the west indies but the seasons were healthy and he returned home an ensign he volunteered abroad again after five years and gained his lieutenant's commission from a death vacancy without purchase after a fifteen years' hard service the desired captain's commission came at last and o'donahue having been so unsuccessful in his military career retired upon half pay determined if possible to offer his handsome person in exchange for competence but during the fifteen years which had passed away a great change had come over the ingenuous and unsophisticated patrick o'donahue he had mixed so long with a selfish and heartless world that his primitive feelings had gradually worn away judith had indeed never been forgotten but she was now at rest for by mistake patrick had been returned dead of the yellow fever and at the intelligence she had drooped like a severed snowdrop and died the only tie strong enough to induce him to return to ireland was therefore broken his father's worldly advice had not been forgotten and o'donahue considered the world as his oyster expensive in his habits and ideas longing for competence while he vegetated on half pay he was now looking out for a matrimonial speculation his generosity and his courage remained with him two virtues not to be driven out of an irishman but his other good qualities lay in abeyance and yet his better feelings were by no means extinguished they were dormant but by favourable circumstances were again to be brought into action the world and his necessities made him what he was for many were the times for years afterwards that he would in his reveries surmise how happy he might have been in his own wild country where half pay would have been competence had his judith been spared to him and he could have laid his head upon her bosom chapter ten in which major mcshane narrates some curious matrimonial speculations our hero was soon fitted out with the livery of a groom and installed as the confidential servant of captain o'donahue who had lodgings on the third floor in a fashionable street he soon became expert and useful and as the captain breakfasted at home and always ordered sufficient for joey to make another cold meal of during the day he was at little or no expense to his master one morning when captain o'donahue was sitting in his dressing gown at breakfast joey opened the door and announced major mcshane is it yourself o'donahue said the major extending his hand and now what d'ye think has brought me here this fine morning it's to do a thing that's rather unusual with me neither more nor less than to pay you the pounds which you lent me a matter of three years ago and which i dare say you never expected to see anything but the ghost of why mcshane if the truth must be told it will be something of a resurrection when it appears before me replied o'donahue i considered it dead and buried and like those who are dead and buried it has been long forgotten nevertheless here it is in four notes one two three four four times five are twenty there's arithmetic for you and your money to boot and many thanks in the bargain by way of interest and now o'donahue where have you been what have you been doing what are you doing and what do you intend to do that's what i call a comprehensive inquiry and a very close one too i have been in london a month i have done nothing i am doing nothing and i don't know what i intend to do you may take that for a comprehensive answer i'll tell you all about myself without your asking i have been in london for nearly two years one of which i spent in courting and the other in matrimony why you don't mean to say that you are married mcshane if so as you've been married a year you can tell me am i to give you joy why yes i believe you may there's nothing so stupid o'donahue as domestic happiness that's a fact but altogether i have been so large a portion of my life doubtful where i was to get a dinner that i think that on the whole i have made a very good choice and may i inquire who is the party to whom major mcshane has condescended to sacrifice his handsome person is it handsome you mane as the ugly lady said to the looking glass i beg no reflections you wish to know who she is well then you must be content to listen to all my adventures from the time we parted for she is at the end of them and i can't read backwards i am at your service so begin as you please let me see o'donahue where was it that we parted if i recollect it was at the landing made at where you were reported killed very true but that i gave my honour was all a lie it was fat sergeant murphy that was killed instead of me he was a terrible fellow that sergeant murphy he got himself killed on purpose because he never could have passed his accounts well he fought like a devil so peace be with him i was knocked down as you know with a bullet in my thigh and as i could not stand i sat upon the carcass of sergeant murphy bound up my leg and meditated on sublunary affairs i thought what a great rogue he was that sergeant murphy and how he'd gone out of the world without absolution and then i thought it very likely that he might have some money about him and how much better it would be that i should have it to comfort me in prison than any rascally frenchman so i put my hand in his pocket and borrowed his purse which was taking the difference of size as well lined as himself well as you had all retreated and left me to be taken prisoner i waited very patiently till they should come and carry me to the hospital or wherever else they pleased they were not long coming for me one fellow would have passed his bayonet through me but i had my pistol cocked so he thought it advisable to take me prisoner i was taken into the town not to the hospital or the prison but quartered at the house of an old lady of high rank and plenty of money well the surgeon came and very politely told me that he must cut off my leg and i very politely told him to go to the devil and the old lady came in and took my part when she saw what a handsome leg it was and sent for another doctor at her own expense who promised to set me on my pins in less than a month well the old lady fell in love with me and although she was not quite the vision of youthful fancy as the saying is for she had only one tooth in her head and that stuck out half an inch beyond her upper lip still she had other charms for a poor devil like me so i made up my mind to marry her for she made cruel love to me as i laid in bed and before i was fairly out of bed the thing was settled and a week afterwards the day was fixed but her relatives got wind of it for like an old fool she could not help blabbing and so one day there came a file of soldiers with a corporal at their head informing me that i was now quite well and therefore if it was all the same to me i must go to prison this was anything but agreeable and contrary to rule as an officer i was entitled to my parole and so i wrote to the commanding officer who sent for me and then he told me i had my choice to give up the old lady whose friends were powerful and would not permit her to make a fool of herself a personal remark by the bye which it was unhandsome to make to a gentleman in my circumstances or to be refused parole and remain in prison and that he would give me an hour to decide then he made me a very low bow and left me i was twisting the affair over in my mind one moment thinking of her purse and carriage and doubloons and another of that awful long tooth of hers when one of her relatives came in and said he had a proposal to make which was that i should be released and sent to gibraltar without any conditions with a handsome sum of money to pay my expenses if i would promise to give up the old lady now and for ever that suited my book i took the money took my leave and a small vessel took me to gibraltar so after all you see o'donahue the thing did not turn out so bad i lost only an old woman with a long tooth and i gained my liberty no you got out of that affair with credit and with money which is quite as good so when i returned and proved myself alive i was reinstated and had all my arrears paid up what with sergeant murphy's purse and the foreign subsidy and my arrears i was quite flush so i resolved to be circumspect and make hay while the sun shone notwithstanding which i was as nearly trapped by a cunning devil of a widow two days more and i should have made a pretty kettle of fish of it what at your age mcshane ah bother but she was a knowing one a widow on a first floor good looking buxom a fine armful and about thirty met her at a party pointed out to me as without encumbrance and well off made up to her escorted her home begged permission to call was graciously received talked of her departed husband thought me like him everything so comfortable plenty of plate good furniture followed her up received notes by a little boy in sky blue and silver sugar loaf buttons sent me all her messages one day in the week to her banker's to cash a check would you believe the cunning of the creature she used to draw out pounds every week sending me for the money and as i found out afterwards paid it in again in fifties every fortnight and she only had pounds in all wasn't i regularly humbugged made proposals was accepted all settled and left off talking about her departed one day and only two days before the wedding found the street door open and heard a noise between her and her landlady of the top of the stairs so i waited at the bottom the landlady was insisting upon her rent and having all her plate back again my charming widow entreating for a little delay as she was to be married landlady came downstairs red as a turkey cock so i very politely begged her to walk into the parlour and i put a few questions when i discovered that my intended was a widow with a pension of pounds a year and had six children sent out of the way until she could find another protector which i resolved at all events should not be major mcshane so i walked out of the door and have never seen her since by the head of saint patrick but that was an escape yes indeed the she devil with six children and pounds a year it's a wicked world this o'donahue well i kept clear of such cunning articles and only looked after youth and innocence in the city at last i discovered the only daughter of a german sugar baker in the minories a young thing about seventeen but very little for her age she went to a dancing school and i contrived by bribing the maid to carry on the affair most successfully and she agreed to run away with me everything was ready the postchaise was at the corner of the street she came with her bundle in her hand i thrust it into the chaise and was just tossing her in after it when she cried out that she had forgotten something and must go back for it and away she went slipping through my fingers well i waited most impatiently for her appearance and at last saw her coming and what d'ye think she'd gone back for by the powers for her doll which she held in her hand and just as she came to the chaise who should come round the corner but her father who had walked from mincing lane he caught my mincing miss by the arm with her doll and her bundle and bundled her home leaving me and the postchaise looking like two fools i never could see her again or her confounded doll either you have been out of luck mcshane i'm not sure of that as the affair has ended now comes another adventure in which i turned the tables anyhow i fell in with a very pretty girl the daughter of a lawyer in chancery lane who was said to have and i paid a shilling at doctors' commons and read the will it was true enough an independent fortune from her grandmother she was always laughing full of mischief and practical jokes she pretended to be pleased the hussey with my addresses and at last she consented as i thought to run away with me i imagined that i had clinched the business at last when one dark night i handed her into a chaise wrapped up in a cloak and crying however i got her in and away we went as if the devil was behind us i coaxed her and soothed her and promised to make her happy but she still kept her handkerchief up to her eyes and would not permit me a chaste salute even pushed me away when i would put my arm round her waist all which i ascribed to the extra shame and modesty which a woman feels when she is doing wrong at last when about fifteen miles from town there was a burst of laughter and i think we have gone far enough major mcshane' by all the saints in the calendar it was her scamp of a brother that had taken her place my young gentleman' said i i think you have not only gone far enough but as i shall prove to you perhaps a little too far' for i was in no fool of a passion so i set to beat him to a mummy broke his nose blackened both his eyes and knocked half his teeth down his throat and when he was half dead i opened the chaise door as it whirled along and kicked him out to take his chance of the wheels or any other wheels which the wheel of fortune might turn up for him so he went home and told his sister what a capital joke it was i've no doubt i'll be bound the young gentleman has never run away with an irishman since that however i never heard any more about him or his lovely sister now then for the wind up mcshane courting's very expensive especially when you order postchaises for nothing at all and i was very nearly at the end of my rhino so i said to myself mcshane you must retrench' and i did so instead of dining at the coffee house i determined to go to an eating house and walked into one in holborn where i sat down to a plate of good beef and potatoes and a large lump of plum pudding paid shilling and pence and never was better pleased in my life so i went there again and became a regular customer and the girls who waited laughed with me and the lady who kept the house was very gracious now the lady was good looking but she was rather too fat there was an amiable look about her even when she was carving beef and by degrees we became intimate and i found her a very worthy creature and as simple minded as a child although she could look sharp after her customers it was and is now a most thriving establishment nearly two hundred people dine there every day i don't know how it was but i suppose i first fell in love with her beef and then with her fair self and finding myself well received at all times i one day as she was carving a beefsteak pie which might have tempted a king for its fragrance put the question to her as to how she would like to marry again she blushed and fixed her eyes down upon the hole she had made in the pie and then i observed that if there was a hole in my side as big as there was in the pie before her she would see her image in my heart this pretty simile did the business for me and in a month we were married and i never shall want a dinner as long as i live either for myself or friend i will put you on the free list o'donahue if you can condescend to a cook's shop and i can assure you that i think i have done a very wise thing for i don't want to present any wife at court and i have a very comfortable home you have done a wise thing in my opinion mcshane you have a wife who makes money instead of one who spends it and moreover i have found my bargain better that i anticipated which is seldom the case in this world of treachery and deceit she has plenty of money and is putting by more every year which you have the control of at your disposition do you mean to say why yes i may say that now but o'donahue that is owing to my circumspection and delicacy at first starting i determined that she should not think that it was only her money that i wanted so after we were married i continued to find myself which paying nothing for board and lodging and washing i could easily do upon my half pay and i have done so ever since until just now i had not been married a week before i saw that she expected i would make inquiries into the state of her finances but i would not at last finding that i would not enter into the business she did and told me that she had pounds consols laid by and that the business was worth pounds per annum you may fish at cheltenham a long while o'donahue before you get such a haul as that so i told her i was very glad she was well off and then i pretended to go fast asleep as i never interfered with her and never asked for money at last she didn't like it and offered it to me but i told her i had enough and did not want it since which she has been quite annoyed at my not spending money and when i told her this morning that there was a brother officer of mine arrived in town to whom i had owed some money for a long while she insisted upon my taking money to pay it put a pile of bank notes in my had and was quite mortified when she found i only wanted pounds now you see o'donahue i have done this from principle she earns the money and therefore she shall have the control of it as long as we are good friends and upon my honour i really think i love her better than i ever thought i could love any woman in the world for she has the temper the kindness and the charity of an angel although not precisely the figure but one can't have everything in this world and so now you have the whole of my story and what do you think of it you must present me to your wife mcshane that i will with pleasure she's like her rounds of beef it's cut and come again but her heart is a beauty and so is her beefsteak pie when you taste it chapter eleven in which an interchange and confidence take place and now o'donahue said mcshane if you are not yet tired of my company i should like to hear what you have been doing since we parted be quite as explicit but not quite so long winded as myself for i fear that i tired you i will be quite as explicit my good fellow but i have no such marvellous adventures to relate and not such a fortunate wind up i have been to bath to cheltenham to harrogate to brighton and everywhere else where people meet and people are met with who would not meet or be met with elsewhere i have seen many nice girls but the nice girls were like myself almost penniless and i have seen many ill favoured who had money the first i could only afford to look at the latter i have had some dealings with i have been refused by one or two and i might have married seven or eight but somehow or other when it came near the point the vision of a certain angel now in heaven has risen before me and i have not had the heart or the heartlessness to proceed indeed i may safely say that i have seen but one person since we parted who ever made the least impression on me or whom i could fancy in any degree to replace her whom i have lost and she i fear is lost also so we may as well say no more about it i have determined to marry for money as you well know but it appears to me as if there was something which invariably prevents the step being taken and upon my honour fortune seems so inclined to balk me in my wishes that i begin to snap my fingers at her and am becoming quite indifferent i suffer now under the evil of poverty but it is impossible to say what other evils may be in store if i were to change my condition as the ladies say come what will in one thing i am determined that if i marry a girl for money i will treat her well and not let her find it out and as that may add to the difficulty of a man's position when he is not in love with his wife why all i can say is captain o'donahue doesn't go cheap that's decided you're right my jewel there's not such a broth of a boy to be picked up every day in the week widows might bid for you for without flattery i think you a moral of a man and an honour to old ireland but o'donahue begging your pardon if it's not a secret who may have been this lady who appears to have bothered your brains not a little since she could you forget somebody else i met her at the lakes of cumberland and being acquainted with some of the party was invited to join them i was ten days in her company at windermere ambleside derwentwater and other places she was a foreigner and titled murder and irish you don't say so yes and moreover as i was informed by those who were with her has large property in poland she was in fact everything that i could desire handsome witty speaking english and several other languages and about two or three and twenty years old and her name if it's no offence to ask it princess czartorinski and a princess in the bargain and did you really pretend to make love to a princess am not i an irishman mcshane and is a princess anything but a woman after all by the powers i'd make love to and run away with the pope himself if he were made of the same materials as pope joan is said to have been then upon my faith o'donahue i believe you so now go on i not only made love to her but in making love to her i got most terribly singed myself and i felt before i quitted her that if i had ten thousand a year and she was as poor as my dear judith was that she should have taken her place that's the truth i thought that i never could love again and that my heart was as flinty as a pawnbroker's but i found out my mistake when it was too late and did she return you the compliment that i was not indifferent to her i may without vanity believe i had a five minutes alone with her just before we parted and i took that opportunity of saying how much pain it was to part with her and for once i told the truth for i was almost choking when i said it i'm convinced that there was sincerity in my face and that she saw that it was there so she replied if what you say is true we shall meet at saint petersburg next winter good bye i shall expect you' well that was as much as to say come at all events it was i stammered out my determination so to do if possible but i felt at the time that my finances rendered it impossible so there was an end of that affair by my hopes of salvation i'd not only go to saint petersburg but round the whole world and to the north pole afterwards if i had the means only to see her once more you're in a bad way o'donahue your heart's gone and your money too upon my soul i pity you but it's always the case in this world when i was a boy the best and ripest fruit was always on the top of the wall and out of my reach shall i call to morrow and then if you please i'll introduce you to mrs mcshane i will be happy to see you and your good wife mcshane health and happiness to you stop while i ring for my little factotum to let you out by the bye a sharp boy that o'donahue with an eye as bright as a hawk where did you pick him up in saint james's park well that's an odd place to hire a servant in do you recollect rushbrook in my company to be sure i do your best soldier and a famous caterer he was at all times it is his son and now i think of it he's very like him only somewhat better looking o'donahue then acquainted mcshane with the circumstances attending his meeting with joey and they separated the next day about the same time mcshane came to see his friend and found o'donahue dressed and ready to go out with him now o'donahue you mustn't be in such a hurry to see mrs mcshane for i have something to tell you which will make her look more pretty in your eyes than she otherwise might have done upon first introduction take your chair again and don't be putting on your gloves yet while you listen to a little conversation which took place between us last night just before we dropped into the arms of murfy i'll pass over all the questions she asked about you and all the compliments i paid you behind your back because if i didn't it would make you blush irishman as you are but this she did say that it was great kindness on your part to lend me that money and that she loved you for it upon which i replied i was sorry you were not easy in your mind and so very unhappy upon which she in course like every woman asked me why and then i told her merely that it was a love affair and a long story as if i wished to go to sleep this made her more curious so to oblige her i stayed awake and told her just what you told me and how the winter was coming on and you not able to keep your appointment and what d'ye think the good soul said now' says she mcshane if you love me and have any gratitude to your friend for his former kindness you will to morrow take him money enough and more than enough to do as he wishes and if he gains his wife he can repay you if not the money is not an object' that's very kind of you dearest' said i but then will you consent to another thing for this may prove a difficult affair and he may want me with him and would you have any objection to that dearest' for you see o'donahue i took it into my head that i might be of the greatest use to you and moreover i should like the trip just by way of a little change couldn't he do without you' replied she gravely i'm afraid not and although i thought i was in barracks for life and never to leave you again yet still for his sake poor fellow who has been such a generous fellow to me ' an' how long would you be away' said she why it might be two months at the most' replied i but who can tell it to a day' well' said she i don't like that part of the concern at all but still if it is necessary as you say things shouldn't be done by halves' and then she sighed poor soul then i won't go' says i yes' says she after a pause i think it's your duty and therefore you must' i'll do just what you wish my soul' replied i but let's talk more about it to morrow' this morning she brought up the subject and said that she had made up her mind and that it should be as we had said last night and she went to the drawer and took out three hundred pounds in gold and notes and said that if it was not enough we had only to write for more now ain't she a jewel o'donahue and here's the money mcshane she is a jewel not because she has given me money but because her heart's in the right place and always will be but i really do not like taking you away with me perhaps you don't think i'd be of any use yes i do not doubt but that you will be although at present i do not know how but i do for i've thought upon it and i shall take it very unkind if you don't let me go with you i want a little divarsion for you see o'donahue one must settle down to domestic happiness by degrees be it so then all i fear is i shall occasion pain to your excellent wife she has plenty to do and that drives care away besides only consider the pleasure you'll occasion to her when i come back i forgot that now if you please i'll call and pay my respects and also return my grateful thanks then come along captain o'donahue found mrs mcshane very busily employed supplying her customers she was as mcshane had said a very good looking woman although somewhat corpulent and there was an amiability frankness and kindness of disposition so expressed in her countenance that it was impossible not to feel interested with her they dined together o'donahue completely established himself in her good graces and it was agreed that on that day week the gentlemen should embark for hamburg and proceed on to petersburg joey to go with them as their little valet chapter twelve an expedition as of yore across the waters for a wife the first step taken by o'donahue was to obtain a passport for himself and suit and here there was a controversy mcshane having made up his mind that he would sink the officer and travel as o'donahue's servant in which capacity he declared that he would not only be more useful but also swell his friend's dignity after a long combat on the part of o'donahue this was consented to and the passport was filled up accordingly but by saint patrick i ought to get some letters of introduction said o'donahue and how is that to be managed at all events to the english ambassador let me see i'll go to the horse guards o'donahue went accordingly and as was always the case there was admitted immediately to an audience with the commander of the forces o'donahue put his case forward stating that he was about to proceed on a secret mission to russia and requested his royal highness to give him a few letters of introduction his royal highness very properly observed that if sent on a secret mission he would of course obtain all the necessary introductions from the proper quarters and then inquired of o'donahue what his rank was where he had served etcetera to the latter questions o'donahue gave a very satisfactory reply and convinced the duke that he was an officer of merit then came the question as to his secret mission which his royal highness had never heard of may it please your royal highness there's a little mistake about this same secret mission it's not on account of government that i'm going but on my own secret service and o'donahue finding himself fairly in for it confessed that he was after a lady of high rank and that if he did not obtain letters of introduction he should not probably find the means of entering the society in which she was to be found and that as an officer who had served faithfully he trusted that he should not be refused his royal highness laughed at his disclosure and as there was no objection to giving o'donahue a letter or two with his usual good nature he ordered them to be written and having given them to him wished him every success o'donahue bowed to the ground and quitted the horse guards delighted with the success of his impudent attempt being thus provided the party set off in a vessel bound to hamburg where they arrived without any accident although very sea sick from hamburg they proceeded to lubeck and re embarked at travemunde in a brig which was bound for riga the wind was fair and their passage was short on their arrival they put up at an hotel and finding themselves in a country where english was not understood o'donahue proceeded to the house of the english consul informing him that he was going on a secret mission to petersburg and showing as evidences of his respectability and the truth of his assertions the letters given him by his royal highness these were quite sufficient for the consul who immediately offered his services not being able to procure at riga a courier who could speak french or english the consul took a great deal of trouble to assist them in their long journey to petersburg he made out a list of the posts the number of versts and the money that was to be paid he changed some of o'donahue's gold into russian paper money and gave all the necessary instructions the great difficulty was to find any carriage to carry them to the capital but at last they found an old cabriolet on four wheels which might answer and bidding adieu to the consul they obtained horses and set off now mcshane you must take care of the money and pay the driver said o'donahue pulling out several pieces of thick paper some coloured red some blue and others of a dirty white is this money said mcshane with astonishment yes that's roubles roubles are they i wonder what they'd call them in ireland they look like soup tickets never mind and now mcshane there are two words which the consul has told me to make use of one is scoro and when you say that it means go fast' and you hold up a small bit of money at the same time scoro well that's a word i sha'n't forget but then there's another which is scorae and what may be the english of that why that means go faster' and with that you hold up a larger piece of money why then it's no use remembering scoro at all for scorae will do much better so we need not burden ourselves with the first at all suppose we try the effect of that last word upon our bear skin friend who is driving mcshane held up a rouble and called out to the driver scorae the fellow turned his head smiled and lashed his horses until they were at the full speed and then looked back at them for approval by the powers that's no fool of a word it will take us all the way to saint petersburg as fast as we wish we do not sleep on the road but travel night and day said o'donahue for there is no place worth sleeping at and the 'ating o'donahue we must get that by signs for we have no other means on that point they soon found they had no difficulty and thus they proceeded without speaking a word of the language day and night until they arrived at the capital at the entrance their passports were demanded and the officer at the guard house came out and told them that a cossack would accompany them a cossack with a spear as long as a fir tree and a beard not quite so long then took them in charge and trotted before the carriage the driver following him at a slow pace an't we prisoners inquired mcshane i don't know but it looks very like it replied o'donahue this however was not the case the carriage drove to a splendid street called the neffsky perspective and as soon as it stopped at the entrance of an hotel the cossack after speaking to the landlord who came out took his departure a journey of four hundred miles day and night is no joke our travellers fell fast asleep in their spacious apartment and it was not till the next day that they found themselves clean and comfortable joey being dressed in a rich livery as a sort of page and mcshane doing duty as valet when others were present and when sitting alone with o'donahue taking his fair share of the bottle two days after their arrival the landlord procured for o'donahue a courier who could speak both english and french as well as russian and almost every other language it was resolved by o'donahue and mcshane in council to dress him up in a splendid uniform and a carriage having been hired for the month o'donahue felt that he was in a position to present his credentials to the english ambassador and the other parties for whom he had received letters of introduction chapter thirteen in which there is some information relative to the city of st petersburg for roubles a month o'donahue had procured a drosky very handsomely fitted up the shaft horse was a splendid trotter and the other a beautiful shaped animal capered about curving his neck until his nose almost touched his knee and prancing so as to be the admiration of the passers by his coachman whose name was athenasis had the largest beard in saint petersburg joey was the smallest tiger dimitri one of the tallest and handsomest yagers altogether captain o'donahue had laid out his money well and on a fine sunny day he set off to present his letters to the english ambassador and other parties although the letters were very short it was quite sufficient that they were written by so distinguished and so universally beloved a person as his royal highness the ambassador lord saint h immediately desired o'donahue to consider his house open to him requesting the pleasure of his company to dinner on the following day and offered to present him to the emperor at the first levee o'donahue took his leave delighted with his success and then drove to the hotel of the princess woronzoff count nesselrode and prince gallitzin where he found himself equally well received after his visits were all paid o'donahue sported his handsome equipage on the english and russian quays and up and down the neffsky perspective for an hour or two and then returned to the hotel i am very sorry said o'donahue after he had narrated to mcshane all that had taken place that i permitted you to put yourself down on the passport as valet in the foolish way you have you would have enjoyed yourself as much as i probably shall and have been in your proper position in society then i'm not sorry at all o'donahue and i'll tell you why i should have enjoyed myself i do not doubt but i should have enjoyed myself too much and after dining with ambassadors and princes and counts and all that thing should i ever have gone back comfortable and contented to mrs mcshane and the cook's shop no no i'm not exactly reconciled as it is and if i were to be drinking champagne and 'ating french kickshaws with the russian nobility for three or four months dancing perhaps with princesses and whispering in the ears of duchesses wouldn't my nose turn up with contempt at the beefsteak pie and poor mrs mcshane with all her kind smiles look twice as corpulent as ever no no i'm better here and i'm a wise man although i say it myself well perhaps you are mcshane but still i do not like that i should be spending your money in this way without your having your share of it at least my share of it now o'donahue suppose i had come over here on my own account where should i have been i could not have mustered up the amiable impudence you did to persuade the commander in chief to give me letters to the ambassador nor could i have got up such a turn out nor have fitted the turn out so well as you do i should have been as stupid as an owl just doing what i have done the whole of the blessed morning for want of your company looking after one of the floating bridges across the river and spitting into the stream just to add my mite to the baltic sea i'm sorry you were not better amused i was amused for i was thinking of the good humoured face of mrs mcshane which was much better than being in high company and forgetting her entirely let me alone for amusing myself after my own fashion o'donahue and that's all i wish i suppose you have heard nothing in your travels about your powlish princess of course not it will require some tact to bring in her name i must do it as if by mere accident shall i ask the courier if she is an acquaintance of his an acquaintance mcshane i don't mean on visiting terms but if he knows anything about the family or where they live no mcshane i think you had better not we do not know much of him at present i shall dine at the ambassador's tomorrow and there will be a large party during the day invitations for evening parties were brought in from the prince gallitzin and princess woronzoff the plot thickens fast as the saying is observed mcshane you'll be certain to meet your fair lady at some of these places that is what i trust to do replied o'donahue if not as soon as i'm intimate i shall make inquiries about her but we must first see how the land lies o'donahue dined at the ambassador's and went to the other parties but did not meet with the object of his search being a good musician he was much in request in so musical a society as that of saint petersburg the emperor was still at his country palace and o'donahue had been more than a fortnight at the capital without there being an opportunity for the ambassador to present him at court dimitri the person whom o'donahue engaged as courier was a very clever intelligent fellow and as he found that o'donahue had all the liberality of an irishman and was in every respect a most indulgent master he soon had his interest at heart perhaps the more peculiar intimacy between o'donahue and mcshane as a valet assisted dimitri in forming a good opinion of the former as the hauteur and distance generally preserved by the english towards their domestics are very displeasing to the continental servants who if permitted to be familiar will not only serve you more faithfully but be satisfied with more moderate wages dimitri spoke english and french pretty well german and russian of course perfectly he was a russian by birth had been brought up at the foundling hospital at moscow and therefore was not a serf he soon became intimate with mcshane and as soon as the latter discovered that there was no intention on the part of dimitri to be dishonest he was satisfied and treated him with cordiality tell your master this said dimitri never to give his opinion on political matters before any one while in petersburg or he will be reported to the government and will be looked upon with suspicion all the servants and couriers here indeed every third person you meet is an agent of police then it's not at all unlikely that you are one yourself replied mcshane i am so replied dimitri coolly and all the better for your master i shall be ordered to make my report in a few days and i shall not fail to do so and what will they ask you said mcshane they will ask me first who and what your master is whether i have discovered from you if he is of family and importance in his own country whether he has expressed any political opinions and whether i have discovered the real business which brought him here and what will you reply to all this answered mcshane why i hardly know i wish i knew what he wishes me to say for he is a gentleman whom i am very fond of and that's the truth perhaps you can tell me why yes i know a good deal about him that's certain as for his family there's not a better in ireland or england for he's royal if he had his right what exclaimed dimitri as sure as i'm sitting in this old arm chair didn't he bring letters from the brother of the present king does that go for nothing in this country of yours or do you value men by the length of their beards men are valued here not by their titles but by their rank as officers a general is a greater man than a prince replied dimitri with all my heart for then i'm somebody replied mcshane you replied the courier i mean my master returned mcshane correcting himself for he's an officer and a good one too yes that may be but you said yourself replied the courier laughing my good friend a valet to any one in petersburg is no better than one of the mujiks who work in the streets well i know that our master is an officer and of high rank as for his political opinions i have never heard him express any except his admiration of the city and of course of the emperor most decidedly and of the empress also replied mcshane that is not at all necessary continued dimitri laughing in fact he has no business to admire the empress but he admires the government and the laws said mcshane and you may add my good fellow the army and the navy by the powers he's all admiration all over you may take my word for it well i will do so but then there is one other question to reply to which is why did he come here what is his business to look about him to be sure to spend his money like a gentleman to give his letters of introduction and to amuse himself replied mcshane but this is dry talking so dimitri order a bottle of champagne and then we'll wet our whistle before we go on champagne will your master stand that inquired dimitri stand it to be sure and he'd be very angry if he thought i did not make myself comfortable tell them to put it down in the bill for me if they doubt the propriety let them ask my master dimitri went and ordered the champagne as soon as they had a glass dimitri observed your master is a fine liberal fellow and i would serve him to the last day of my life but you see that the reasons you give for your master being here are the same as are given by everybody else whether they come as spies or secret emissaries or to foment insurrection that answer therefore is considered as no answer at all by the police although very often a true one and they will try to find out whether it is so or not what other cause can a gentleman like him have for coming here he is not going to dirty his hands with speculation information or any other botheration replied mcshane tossing off his glass i don't say so but his having letters from the king's brother will be considered suspicious the devil it will now in our country that would only create a suspicion that he was a real gentleman that's all you don't understand this country replied dimitri no it beats my comprehension entirely and that's a fact so fill up your glass i hope it's not treason but if it is i can't help saying it my good friend dimitri stop said dimitri rising and shutting the door now what is it why just this i haven't seen one good looking woman since i've been in this good looking town of yours now that's the truth there's more truth than treason in that replied the courier but still there are some beautiful women among the higher classes it's to be hoped so for they've left no beauty for the lower at all events we have very beautiful women in poland said the courier why don't you bring a few here then there are a great many polish ladies in petersburg at this moment then go down and order another bottle said mcshane and we'll drink their healths the second bottle was finished and mcshane who had been drinking before became less cautious you said observed he that you have many polish ladies in petersburg did you ever hear of a princess czartowinky i think that's the name czartorinski you mean replied dimitri to be sure i did i served in the family some years ago when the old prince was alive but where did you see her in england to be sure well that's probable for she has just returned from travelling with her uncle is she now in petersburg my good fellow i believe she is but why do wish to know merely asked that's all now macshanovich for such was the familiar way in which dimitri addressed his supposed brother servant i suspect this princess czartorinski is some way connected with your master's coming here tell me the truth is such the case i'm sure it is then you know more than i do replied mcshane correcting himself for i'm not exactly in my master's secrets all that i do know is that my master met her in england and i thought her very handsome and so did he that's as may be between ourselves i've an idea he was a little smitten in that quarter but that's only my own opinion nothing more has he ever spoken about her since you were here said dimitri just once as i handed his waistcoat to him he said i wonder if all the ladies are as handsome as that polish princess that we met in cumberland' if i thought he wished it or cared for her i would make inquiry and soon find out all about her but otherwise it's no use taking the trouble replied the courier well then will you give me your hand and promise to serve faithfully if i tell you all i know about the matter by the blessed saint nicholas i do replied dimitri you may trust me well then it's my opinion that my master's over head and ears in love with her and has come here for no other purpose well i'm glad you told me that it will satisfy the police the police why murder and irish you're not going to inform the police you villain not with whom he is in love most certainly but that he has come here on that account it will satisfy them for they have no fear of a man that's in love and he will not be watched depend upon it i cannot do a better thing to serve our master well then perhaps you are right i don't like this champagne get a bottle of burgundy dimitri don't look so hard it's all right the captain dines out every day and has ordered me to drink for the honour of the house he's a capital master replied dimitri who had begun to feel the effects of the former bottles as soon as the third bottle was tapped mcshane continued now dimitri i've given my opinion and i can tell you if my master has as i suspect come here about this young lady and succeeds in obtaining her it will be a blessed thing for you and me for he's as generous as the day and has plenty of money do you know who she is to be sure i do she is an only daughter of the late prince czartorinski and now a sort of ward under the protection of the emperor she inherits all the estates except one which was left to found an hospital at warsaw and is a rich heiress it is supposed the emperor will bestow her upon one of his generals she is at the palace and a maid of honour to the empress whew whistled mcshane won't there be a difficulty i should think so replied the courier gravely he must run away with her said mcshane after a pause how will he get to see her he will not see her so as to speak with her in the palace that is not the custom here but he might meet her elsewhere to be sure at a party or a ball said mcshane no that would not do ladies and gentlemen keep very apart here in general company he might say a word or two when dancing but that is all but how is he to meet her when in this cursed place of yours if men and women keep at arm's length that must depend upon her tell me does she love him well now that's a home question she never told him she did and she never told me that's certain but still i've an idea that she does then all i can say macshanovich is that your master had better be very careful what he is about of course he knows not that you have told me anything but as soon as he thinks proper to trust me i then will do my utmost in his service you speak like a very rational sensible intelligent courier replied mcshane and so now let us finish the bottle here's good luck to captain o'donahue alive or dead and now please the fleas i'll be asleep in less than ten minutes chapter fourteen going to court and courting when mcshane awoke the next morning he tried to recall what had passed between him and dimitri and did not feel quite convinced that he had not trusted him too much i think said he it was all upon an if yes sure if o'donahue was in love and if she was yes i'm sure that it was all upon ifs however i must go and tell o'donahue what has taken place mcshane did so and o'donahue after a little thought replied well i don't know perhaps it's all for the best for you see i must have trusted somebody and the difficulty would have been to know whom to trust for everybody belongs to the police here i believe i think myself the fellow is honest at all events i can make it worth his while to be so he would not have told me he belonged to the police if he wished to trap us replied mcshane that's very true and on the whole i think we could not do better but we are going on too fast who knows whether she meant anything by what she said to me when we parted or if she did then whether she may not have altered her mind since such things have been that's a fact o'donahue and will be as long as the world lasts however to morrow i am to be presented perhaps i may see her i'm glad that i know that i may chance to meet her as i shall now be on my guard and what shall i say to dimitri say that you mentioned her name and where she was and that i had only replied that i should like to see her again exactly that will leave it an open question as the saying is replied mcshane the next day o'donahue in his uniform drove to the ambassador's hotel to accompany him to the annishkoff palace where he was to be presented to the emperor o'donahue was most graciously received the emperor walking up to him as he stood in the circle and inquiring after the health of his royal highness the commander in chief what service he had been employed upon etcetera he then told o'donahue that the empress would be most glad to make his acquaintance and hoped that he would make a long stay at saint petersburg it was with a quickened pulse that o'donahue followed the ambassador into the empress's apartments he had not waited there more than five minutes in conversation with the ambassador when the doors opened and the empress attended by her chamberlain and followed by her ladies in waiting and maids of honour entered the room o'donahue had made up his mind not to take his eyes off the empress until the presentation was over as soon as he had kissed hands and answered the few questions which were graciously put to him he retired to make room for others and then for the first time did he venture to cast his eyes on the group of ladies attending the empress the first that met his view were unknown but behind all the rest he at length perceived the princess czartorinski talking and laughing with another lady after a short time she turned round and their eyes met the princess recognised him with a start and then turned away and put her hand up to her breast as if the shock had taken away her breath once more she turned her face to o'donahue and this time he was fully satisfied by her looks that he was welcome ten minutes after the ambassador summoned o'donahue and they quitted the palace i have seen her mcshane said o'donahue she is more beautiful and i am more in love than ever and now what am i to do that's just the difficulty replied mcshane shall i talk with dimitri or shall i hold my tongue or shall i think about it while you go to dinner at the ambassador's i cannot dine out to day mcshane i will write an excuse well now i do believe you're in for it in good earnest my love never spoiled my appetite on the contrary it was my appetite that made me fall in love i wish she had not been a princess said o'donahue throwing himself on the sofa that's nothing at all here replied mcshane a princess is to be had now if she had been a general it would have been all up with you military rank is everything here as dimitri says she's an angel replied o'donahue with a sigh that's rank in heaven but goes for nothing in petersburg replied mcshane dimitri tells me they've civil generals here which i conceive are improvements on our staff for devil a civil general i've had the pleasure of serving under what shall i do said o'donahue getting up and preparing to write his note to the ambassador eat your dinner drink a bottle of champagne and then i'll come and talk it over with you that's all you can do at present give me the note and i'll send dimitri off with it at once and order up your dinner mcshane's advice not being very bad it was followed o'donahue had finished his dinner and was sitting by the fire with mcshane when there was a knock at the door mcshane was summoned and soon returned saying there's a little fellow that wants to speak with you and won't give his message he's a queer little body and not so bad looking either with a bolster on the top of his head and himself not higher than a pillow a pigeon could sit upon his shoulder and peck up peas out of his shoes he struts like a grenadier and by the powers a grenadier's cap would serve as an extinguisher for him shall i show him in certainly replied o'donahue the reader may not be aware that there is no part of the globe where there are so many dwarfs as at saint petersburg there is scarcely an hotel belonging to a noble family without one or two if not more they are very kindly treated and are both in appearance and temper very superior to the dwarfs occasionally met with elsewhere one of this diminutive race now entered the room dressed in a turkish costume he was remarkably well made and handsome in person he spoke sufficient french to inquire if he addressed himself to captain o'donahue and on being replied to in the affirmative he gave him a small billet and then seated himself on the sofa with all the freedom of a petted menial o'donahue tore open the note it was very short as i know you cannot communicate with me i write to say that i was delighted at your having kept your promise you shall hear from me again as soon as i know where i can meet you in the meantime be cautious the bearer is to be trusted he belongs to me c o'donahue pressed the paper to his lips and then sat down to reply we shall not trouble the reader with what he said it is quite sufficient that the lady was content with the communication and also at the report from her little messenger of the captain's behaviour when he had read her billet two or three days afterwards o'donahue received a note from a german widow lady a countess erhausen particularly requesting he would call upon her in the afternoon at three o'clock as he had not as yet had the pleasure of being introduced to the countess although he had often heard her spoken of in the first society o'donahue did not fail in his appointment as he considered that it was possible that the princess czartorinski might be connected with it nor was he deceived for on his entering the saloon he found the princess sitting on the sofa with madame erhausen a young and pretty woman not more than twenty five years of age the princess rose and greeted captain o'donahue and then introduced the countess as her first cousin a few minutes after his introduction the countess retired leaving them alone o'donahue did not lose this opportunity of pouring out the real feelings of his heart you have come a long way to see me captain o'donahue and i ought to be grateful replied the princess indeed i have much pleasure in renewing our acquaintance o'donahue however did not appear satisfied with this mere admission he became eloquent in his own cause pointed out the cruelty of having brought him over to see her again if he was not to be rewarded and after about an hour's pleading he was sitting on the sofa by her side with her fair hand in his and his arm round her slender waist they parted but through the instrumentality of the little dwarf they often met again at the same rendezvous occasionally they met in society but before others they were obliged to appear constrained and formal there was little pleasure in such meetings and when o'donahue could not see the princess his chief pleasure was to call upon madame erhausen and talk about her you are aware captain o'donahue said the countess one day that there will be a great difficulty to overcome in this affair the princess is a sort of ward of the emperor's and it is said that he has already in his own mind disposed of her hand i am aware of that replied o'donahue and i know no other means than running away with her that would never do replied the countess you could not leave petersburg without passports nor could she leave the palace for more than an hour or two without being missed you would soon be discovered and then you would lose her for ever then what can i do my dear madame shall i throw myself upon the indulgence of the emperor no that would not answer either she is too rich a prize to be permitted to go into foreign hands i'll tell you what you must first do i'm all attention you must make love to me replied the countess nay understand me i mean that you must appear to make love to me and the report of our marriage must be spread the emperor will not interfere in such a case you must do so to avoid suspicion you have been here very often and your equipage has been constantly seen at the door if it is supposed you do not come on my account it will be inquired why you do come and there is no keeping a secret at petersburg after it is supposed that it is a settled affair between us we then may consider what next ought to be done my regard for my cousin alone induces me to consent to this indeed it is the only way she could avoid future misery but is the emperor so despotic on these points an emperor is not to be trifled with a ward of the emperor is considered sacred at least so far that if a russian were to wed one without permission he probably would be sent to siberia with an englishman it is different perhaps and once married you would be safe as you could claim the protection of your ambassador the great point is to let it be supposed that you are about to marry some one else and then suspicion not being awakened you may gain your wish but tell me madame that i may be safe from the emperor's displeasure is true but would the princess after he discovered it could he not take her away from me and send her to siberia for disobedience i hope by the means i propose to get you both clear of the emperor at least till his displeasure is softened down me he cannot hurt he can only order me out of his dominions as for the princess i should think that if once married to you she would be safe for you could claim the protection of the ambassador for her as your wife as well as for yourself do you comprehend me now i do madame and may blessings follow you for your kindness i shall in future act but by your directions that is exactly what i wished you to say and so now captain o'donahue farewell chapter fifteen a runaway and a hard pursuit well now said mcshane after he had been informed by o'donahue of what had passed between him and the countess this is all very pretty and looks very well but tell me are we to trust that fellow dimitri can we do without him i should say not when it comes to the finale and is it not dangerous to keep him out of our confidence being such a sharp keen witted fellow nay more as he has stated his wish to serve you in any way it is only treating him fairly he knows the little dwarf who has been here so often indeed they were fellow servants in the czartorinski family for he told me so i would trust him i think so too but we must not tell him all no that we certainly need not for he will find it out without telling well mcshane do as you please but on second thoughts i will speak to the countess to morrow o'donahue did so the countess called upon the princess at the palace and the next morning o'donahue received a note stating that dimitri was to be trusted o'donahue then sent for the courier and told him that he was about to put confidence in him on a promise of his fidelity i understand you sir and all you intend to do there is no occasion to say anything more to me until you want my assistance i will not in the meantime neglect your interest for i hope to remain with you and that is the only reward i ask for any services i may perform i have only one remark to make now which is that it will be necessary a few days before you leave petersburg to let me know that i may advertise it advertise it yes sir you must advertise your departure that you may not run away in debt such is the custom and without three notices being put in the gazette the police will not give you your passport i am glad that you mentioned it of course you are aware that i am paying attention to the countess erhausen and shall leave petersburg with her i trust as my wife i understand sir and shall take care that your intimacy there shall be known to everybody so saying dimitri left the room the winter now set in with unusual severity the river was one mass of ice the floating bridges had been removed the montagnes russes became the amusement of the day and the sledges were galloping about in every direction for more than a month o'donahue continued his pretended addresses to the fair cousin of the princess and during that time he did not once see the real object of his attachment indeed the dwarf never made his appearance and all communication except an occasional note from her to the countess was from prudence given up the widow was rich and had often been pressed to renew her bonds but had preferred her liberty o'donahue therefore was looked upon as a fortunate man and congratulated upon his success nor did the widow deny the projected union except in a manner so as to induce people to believe in the certainty of its being arranged o'donahue's equipage was always at her door and it was expected that the marriage would immediately take place when o'donahue attended a levee given by the emperor on the feast of saint nicholas the emperor who had been very civil to o'donahue as he walked past him said well captain o'donahue so i understand that you intend to run away with one of our fairest and prettiest ladies one of the greatest ornaments of my court i trust that i have your majesty's permission so to do replied o'donahue bowing low oh certainly you have and moreover our best wishes for your happiness i humbly thank your majesty replied o'donahue still i trust your majesty does not think that i wish to transplant her to my own country altogether and that i shall be permitted to reside for the major part of the year in your majesty's dominions nothing will give me greater pleasure and it will be a satisfaction to feel that i shall gain instead of losing by the intended marriage by the powers but i will remind him of this some day or another thought o'donahue haven't i his permission to the marriage and to remain in the country everything was now ripe for the execution of the plot the countess gave out that she was going to her country seat about ten miles from saint petersburg and it was naturally supposed that she was desirous that the marriage should be private and that she intended to retire there to have the ceremony performed and o'donahue advertised his departure in the gazette the princess czartorinski produced a letter from the countess requesting her as a favour to obtain leave from the empress to pass two or three days with her in the country and the empress as the countess was first cousin to the princess did not withhold her consent on the contrary when the princess left the palace she put a case of jewels in her hand saying these are for the bride with the good wishes and protection of the empress as long as she remains in this country one hour afterwards o'donahue was rewarded for all his long forbearance by clasping his fair one in his arms a priest had been provided and was sent forward to the country chateau and at ten in the morning all the parties were ready the princess and her cousin set off in the carriage followed by o'donahue with mcshane and his suite everything was en regle the passports had been made out for germany to which country it was reported the countess would proceed a few days after the marriage and the princess was to return to the palace as soon as they arrived at the chateau the ceremony was performed and o'donahue obtained his prize and to guard against any mishap it was decided that they should leave the next morning on their way to the frontier dimitri had been of the greatest use had prepared against every difficulty and had fully proved his fidelity the parting between the countess and her cousin was tender how much do i owe dear friend said the princess what risk do you incur for me how will you brave the anger of the emperor i care little for his anger i am a woman and not a subject of his but before you go you must both write a letter your husband to the emperor reminding him of his having given his consent to the marriage and his wish that he should remain in his dominions and let him add his sincere wish if permitted to be employed in his majesty's service you my dear cousin must write to the empress reminding her of her promise of protection and soliciting her good offices with the emperor i shall play my own game but depend upon it it will all end in a laugh o'donahue and his wife both wrote their letters and o'donahue also wrote one to the english ambassador informing him of what had taken place and requesting his kind offices as soon as they were finished the countess bade them farewell saying i shall not send these letters until you are well out of reach depend upon it and with many thanks for her kindness o'donahue and his bride bade her adieu and set off on their long journey the carriage procured for their journey was what is called a german batarde which is very similar to an english chariot with coach box fixed upon a sleigh inside were o'donahue and his young bride mcshane preferring to ride outside on the box with joey that he might not be in the way as a third person invariably is with a newly married couple the snow was many feet deep on the ground but the air was dry and the sun shone bright the bride was handed in enveloped in a rich mantle of sable o'donahue followed equally protected against the cold while mcshane and joey fixed themselves on the box so covered up in robes of wolf skins and wrappers of bear skins for their feet that you could see but the tips of their noses on the front of the sleigh below the box of the carriage were seated the driver and the courier four fiery young horses were pawing with impatience the signal was given and off they went at the rate of sixteen miles an hour where's the guns joey and the pistols and the ammunition inquired mcshane we're going through a wild sort of country i expect i have put them in myself and i can lay my hands on them immediately sir replied joey the guns are behind us and your pistols and the ammunition are at my feet the captain's are in the carriage that's all right then i like to know where to lay my hands upon my tools just have the goodness to look at my nose now and then joey and if you see a white spot on the tip of it you'll be pleased to tell me and i'll do the same for you mrs mcshane would be anything but pleased if i came home with only half a handle to my face the journey was continued at the same rapid pace until the close of the day when they arrived at the post house there they stopped mcshane and joey with the assistance of the courier preparing their supper from the stores which they brought with them after supper they retired o'donahue and his wife sleeping in the carriage which was arranged so as to form a bed if required while mcshane and joey made it out how they could upon the cloaks and what little straw they could procure on the floor of the post house where as mcshane said the next morning they had more bed fellows than were agreeable although he contrived to get a few hours' sleep in spite of the jumping vagabonds when they rose the next morning they found that the snow had just begun to fall fast as soon as they had breakfasted they set out nevertheless and proceeded at the same pace mcshane telling joey who was as well as himself almost embedded in it before the day was half over that it was better than rain at all events to be sure that was cold comfort but any comfort is better than none o'donahue's request for mcshane to come inside was disregarded he was as tough as little joey at all events and it would be a pity to interrupt the conversation about four o'clock they had changed their horses at a small village and were about three miles on their last stage for that day's journey when they passed through a pine forest there's a nice place for an ambuscade joey if there were any robbers about here observed mcshane murder and irish what's those chaps running among the trees so fast and keeping pace with us i say dimitri continued mcshane pointing to them what are those the courier looked in the direction pointed out and as soon as he had done so spoke to the driver who casting his eyes hastily in the direction applied the lash to his horses and set off with double speed wolves sir replied the courier who then pulled out his pistols and commenced loading them wolves said mcshane and hungry enough i'll warrant but they don't hope to make a meal of us do they at all events we will give them a little fight for it come joey i see that dimitri don't like it so we must shake off the snow and get our ammunition ready this was soon done the guns were unstrapped from the back of the coach box the pistols got from beneath their feet and all were soon ready loaded and primed it's lucky there's such a mist on the windows of the carriage that the lady can't see what we're after or she'd be frightened perhaps said joey the rapid pace at which the driver had put his horses had for a time left the wolves in the rear but now they were seen following the carriage at about a quarter of a mile distant having quitted the forest and taken to the road here they come the devils one two three there are seven of them i suppose this is what they call a covey in these parts were you ever wolf hunting before joey i don't call this wolf hunting replied joey i think the wolves are hunting us it's all the same my little poacher it's a hunt at all events they are gaining on us fast we shall soon come to an explanation the courier now climbed up to the coach box to reconnoitre and he shook his head telling them in very plain english that he did not like it that he had heard that the wolves were out in consequence of the extreme severity of the weather and that he feared that these seven were only the advance of a whole pack that they had many versts to go for the stage was a long one and it would be dark before they were at the end of it have you ever been chased by them before said joey yes replied the courier more than once it's the horses that they are so anxious to get hold of three of our horses are very good but the fourth is not very well the driver says and he is fearful that he will not hold out however we must keep them off as long as we can we must not shoot at them till the last moment why not inquired mcshane because the whole pack would scent the blood at miles and redouble their efforts to come up with us there is an empty bottle by you sir throw it on the road behind the carriage that will stop them for a time an empty bottle stop them well that's queer it may stop a man drinking because he can get no mote out of it however as you please gentlemen here's to drink my health bad manners to you said mcshane throwing the bottle over the carriage the courier was right at the sight of the bottle in the road the wolves who are of a most suspicious nature and think that there is a trap laid for them in everything stopped short and gathered round it cautiously the carriage proceeded and in a few minutes the animals were nearly out of sight well that bothers me entirely said mcshane an empty bottle is as good to them as a charged gun but look sir they are coming on again said joey and faster than ever i suppose they were satisfied that there was nothing in it the courier mounted again to the box where joey and mcshane were standing i think you had a ball of twine said he to joey when you were tying down the baskets where is it it is here under the cushion replied joey searching for the twine and producing it what shall we find to tie to it said the courier something not too heavy a bottle won't do what's it for inquired mcshane to trail sir replied the courier to trail i think they're fast enough upon our trail already but if you want to help them a red herring's the thing no sir a piece of red cloth would do better replied the courier red cloth one would think you were fishing for mackerel replied mcshane will this piece of black cloth do which was round the lock of the gun said joey yes i think it will replied the courier the courier made fast the cloth to the end of the twine and throwing it clear of the carriage let the ball run out until he had little more than the bare end in his hand and the cloth was about forty yards behind the carriage dragging over the snow they will not pass the cloth sir said the courier they think that it's a trap sure enough the wolves which had been gaining fast on the carriage now retreated again and although they continued the pursuit it was at a great distance we have an hour and a half more to go before we arrive and it will be dark i'm afraid said the courier all depends upon the horse holding out i'm sure the pack is not far behind and how many are there in a pack inquired mcshane the courier shrugged up his shoulders perhaps two or three hundred oh the devil don't i wish i was at home with mrs mcshane for half an hour they continued their rapid pace when the horse referred to showed symptoms of weakness still the wolves had not advanced beyond the piece of black cloth which trailed behind the carriage i think that considering that they are so hungry they are amazing shy of the bait said mcshane by all the powers they've stopped again the string has broke sir and they are examining the cloth cried joey is there much line left inquired the courier with some alarm no it has broken off by rubbing against the edge of the carriage behind the courier spoke to the driver who now rose from his seat and lashed his horses furiously but although three of the horses were still fresh the fourth could not keep up with them and there was every prospect of his being dragged down on his knees as more than once he stumbled and nearly fell in the meantime the wolves had left the piece of cloth behind them and were coming up fast with the carriage we must fire on them now sir said the courier going back to his seat or they will tear the flanks of the horses mcshane and joey seized their guns the headmost wolf was now nearly ahead of the carriage joey fired and the animal rolled over in the snow that's a good shot joey load again here's at another mcshane fired and missed the animal which rushed forward the courier's pistol however brought it down just as he was springing on the hindmost horses o'donahue astonished at the firing now lowered down the glass and inquired the reason mcshane replied that the wolves were on them and that he'd better load his pistols in case they were required the wolves hung back a little upon the second one falling but still continued the chase although at a more respectable distance the road was now on a descent but the sick horse could hardly hold on his legs a little half hour more and we shall be in the town said the courier climbing up to the coach seat and looking up the road they had passed but saint nicholas preserve us he exclaimed and he turned round and spoke in hurried accents to the driver in the russian language again the driver lashed furiously but in vain the poor horse was dead beat what is the matter now inquired mcshane do you see that black mass coming down the hill it's the main pack of wolves i fear we are lost the horse cannot go on then why not cut his traces and go on with the three others cried joey the boy is right replied the man and there is no time to lose the courier went down on the sleigh spoke to the driver in russian and the horses were pulled up the courier jumped out with his knife and commenced cutting the traces of the tired horse while the other three who knew that the wolves were upon them plunged furiously in their harness that they might proceed it was a trying moment the five wolves now came up the first two were brought down by the guns of mcshane and joey and o'donahue killed a third from the carriage windows one of the others advanced furiously and sprang upon the horse which the courier was cutting free joey leapt down and put his pistol to the animal's head and blew out his brains while mcshane who had followed our hero with the other pistol disabled the only wolf that remained but this danger which they had escaped from was nothing compared to that which threatened them the whole pack now came sweeping like a torrent down the hill with a simultaneous yell which might well strike terror into the bravest the horse which had fallen down when the wolf seized him was still not clear of the sleigh and the other three were quite unmanageable mcshane joey and the courier at last drew him clear from the track they jumped into their places and away they started again like the wind for the horses were maddened with fear the whole pack of wolves was not one hundred yards from them when they recommenced their speed and even then mcshane considered that there was no hope but the horse that was left on the road proved their salvation the starved animals darted upon it piling themselves one on the other snarling and tearing each other in their conflict for the feast it was soon over in the course of three minutes the carcass had disappeared and the major portion of the pack renewed their pursuit but the carriage had proceeded too far ahead of them and their speed being now uninterrupted they gained the next village and o'donahue had the satisfaction of leading his terrified bride into the chamber of the post house where she fainted as soon as she was placed in a chair i'll tell you what joey i've had enough of wolves for all my life said mcshane and joey my boy you're a good shot in the first place and a brave little fellow in the next here's a handful of roubles as they call them for you to buy lollipops with but i don't think you'll find a shop that sells them hereabouts never mind keep your sweet tooth till you get to old england again and after i tell mrs mcshane what you have done for us this day she will allow you to walk into a leg of beef or round a leg of mutton or dive into a beefsteak pie as long as you live whether it be one hundred years more or less i've said it and don't you forget it and now as the wolves have not made their supper upon us let us go and see what we can sup upon ourselves chapter sixteen return to england the remainder of the journey was completed without any further adventure and they at last found themselves out of the russian dominions when they were met by the uncle of the princess who as a pole was not sorry that his niece had escaped from being wedded to a russian he warmly greeted o'donahue as his connection and immediately exerted all the interest which he had at the court to pacify the emperor when the affair first became known which it soon did by the princess not returning to court his majesty was anything but pleased at being outwitted but the persuasions of the empress the pleading of the english ambassador who exerted himself strenuously for o'donahue with the efforts made in other quarters and more than all the letter of o'donahue proving that the emperor had given his consent unwittingly it is true coupled with his wish to enter into his service at last produced the desired effect and after two months a notice of their pardon and permission to return was at last despatched by the empress o'donahue considered that it was best to take immediate advantage of this turn in his favour and retrace his way to the capital mcshane who had been quite long enough in the situation of a domestic now announced his intention to return home and o'donahue aware that he was separating him from his wife did not of course throw any obstacle in the way of his departure our little hero who has lately become such a cipher in our narrative was now the subject of consideration o'donahue wished him to remain with him but mcshane opposed it i tell you o'donahue that it's no kindness to keep him here the boy is too good to be a page at a lady's shoestring or even a servant to so great a man as you are yourself now besides how will he like being buried here in a foreign country and never go back to old england but what will he do better in england mcshane depend upon it major said the princess for she was now aware of mcshane's rank i will treat him like a son still he will be a servant my lady and that's not the position although begging your pardon an emperor might be proud to be your servant yet that's not the position for little joey prove that you will do better for him mcshane and he is yours but without you do i am too partial to him to like to part with him his conduct on the journey yes exactly his conduct on the journey when the wolves would have shared us out between them is one great reason for my objection he is too good for a menial and that's the fact you ask me what i intend to do with him it is not so easy to answer that question because you see my lady there's a certain mrs mcshane in the way who must be consulted but i think that when i tell her what i consider to be as near the truth as most things which are said in this world that if it had not been for the courage and activity of little joey a certain major mcshane would have been by this time eaten and digested by a pack of wolves why i then think as mrs mcshane and i have no child nor prospect of any as i know of that she may be well inclined to come into my way of thinking and of adopting him as her own son but of course this cannot be said without my consulting with mrs mcshane seeing as how the money is her own and she has a right to do as she pleases with it that indeed alters the case replied o'donahue and i must not stand in the way of the boy's interest still i should like to do something for him you have done something for him o'donahue you have prevented his starving and if he has been of any use to you it is but your reward so you and he are quits well then it is agreed that i take him with me yes replied o'donahue i cannot refuse my consent after what you have said two days after this conversation the parties separated o'donahue with his wife accompanied by dimitri set off on their return to saint petersburg while mcshane who had provided himself with a proper passport got into the diligence accompanied by little joey on his way back to england chapter seventeen the day after the murder we must now return to the village of grassford and the cottage in which we left rushbrook and his wife who had been raised up from the floor by her husband and having now recovered from her swoon was crying bitterly for the loss of her son and the dread of her husband's crime being discovered for some time rushbrook remained in silence looking at the embers in the grate mum sometimes would look piteously in his master's face at other times he would slowly approach the weeping woman the intelligence of the animal told him that something was wrong finding himself unnoticed he would then go to the door by which joey had quitted snuff at the crevice and return to his master's side i'm glad that he's off at last muttered rushbrook he's a fine boy that yes he is replied jane but when shall i behold him again by and bye never fear wife we must not stay in this place provided this affair blows over if it does indeed come come jane we have every reason to hope it will now let's go to bed it would not do if any one should happen to have been near the spot and to have found out what has taken place for us to be discovered not to have been in bed all night or even for a light to be seen at the cottage by any early riser come jane let's to bed rushbrook and his wife retired the light was extinguished and all was quiet except conscience which still tormented and kept rushbrook turning to the right and left continually jane slept not she listened to the wind the slightest noise the crowing of the cock startled her and soon footsteps were heard of those passing the windows they could remain in bed no longer jane arose dressed and lighted the fire rushbrook remained sitting on the side of the bed in deep thought i've been thinking jane said he at last it would be better to make away with mum with the dog why it can't speak poor thing no no don't kill the poor dog he can't speak but the dog has sense he may lead them to the spot and if he were to do so what then it would prove nothing no only it would go harder against joey against the boy yes it might convince them that joey did the deed but still the very killing of the animal would look suspicious tie him up rushbrook that will do as well perhaps better replied he tie him up in the back kitchen there's a good woman jane did so and then commenced preparing the breakfast they had taken their seats when the latch of the door was lifted up and furness the schoolmaster looked in this he was often in the habit of doing to call joey out to accompany him to school good morning said he now where's my friend joey come in come in neighbour and shut the door said rushbrook i wish to speak to you mayhap you'll take a cup of tea if so my missus will give you a good one well as mrs rushbrook does make everything so good i don't care if i do although i have had breakfast but where's my friend joey the lazy little dog is he not up yet why mrs rushbrook what's the matter you look distressed i am indeed replied jane putting her apron to her eyes why mrs rushbrook what is it inquired the pedagogue just this we are in great trouble about joey when we got up this morning we found that he was not in bed and he has never been home since well that is queer why where can the young scamp be gone to we don't know but we find that he took my gun with him and i'm afraid and here rushbrook paused shaking his head afraid of what that he has gone poaching and has been taken by the keepers but did he ever do so before not by night if he did by day i can't tell he always has had a hankering that way well they do whisper the same of you neighbour why do you keep a gun i've carried a gun all my life replied rushbrook and i don't choose to be without one but that's not to the purpose the question is what would you advise us to do why you see friend rushbrook replied the schoolmaster advice in this question becomes rather difficult if joey has been poaching as you imagine and has been taken up as you suspect why then you will soon hear of it you of course have had no hand in it hand in it hand in what replied rushbrook do you think we trust a child like him with a gun i should think not and therefore it is evident that he has acted without the concurrence of his parents that will acquit you but still it will not help joey neither do i think you will be able to recover the gun which i anticipate will become a deodand to the lord of the manor but the child what will become of him exclaimed jane what will become of him why as he is of tender years they will not transport him at least i should think not they may imprison him for a few months and order him to be privately whipped i do not see what you can do but remain quiet i should recommend you not to say one syllable about it until you hear more but suppose we do not hear that is to suppose that he did not go out with the gun to poach but upon some other expedition what else could the boy have gone out for said rushbrook hastily very true it is not very likely that he went out to commit murder replied the pedagogue at the word murder rushbrook started from his chair but recollecting himself he sat down again no no joey commit murder cried he ha ha ha no no joey is no murderer i should suspect not well master rushbrook i will dismiss my scholars this morning and make every inquiry for you byres will be able to ascertain very soon for he knows the new keeper at the manor house byres help you did you say no no byres never will replied rushbrook solemnly and why not my friend why replied rushbrook recollecting himself he has not been over cordial with me lately nevertheless depend upon it he will if he can replied furness if not for you he will for me good morning mrs rushbrook i will hasten away now but will you not go with me continued furness appealing to rushbrook i will go another way it's no use both going the same road very true replied the pedagogue who had his reasons for not wishing the company of rushbrook and furness then left the house mr furness found all his boys assembled in the school room very busily employed thumbing their books he ordered silence and informed them that in consequence of joey being missing he was going to assist his father to look after him and therefore they would have a holiday for that day he then ranged them all in a row made them turn to the right face clap their hands simultaneously and disperse although mr furness had advised secrecy to the rushbrooks he did not follow the advice he had given indeed his reason for not having wished rushbrook to be with him was that he might have an opportunity of communicating his secret through the village which he did by calling at every cottage and informing the women who were left at home that joey rushbrook had disappeared last night with his father's gun and that he was about to go in quest of him some nodded and smiled others shook their heads some were not at all surprised at it others thought that things could not go on so for ever mr furness having collected all their various opinions then set off to the ale house to find byres the pedlar when he arrived he found that byres had not come home that night and where he was nobody knew which was more strange as his box was up in his bed chamber mr furness returned to the village intending to communicate this information to rushbrook but on calling he found that rushbrook had gone out in search of the boy furness then resolved to go up at once to the keeper's lodge and solve the mystery he took the high road and met rushbrook returning well have you gained any tidings inquired the pedagogue none replied rushbrook then it's my opinion my worthy friend that we had better at once proceed to the keeper's cottage and make inquiry for strange to say i have been to the ale house and my friend byres is also missing indeed exclaimed rushbrook who had now completely recovered his self possession be it so then let us go to the keeper's they soon arrived there and found the keeper at home for he had returned to his dinner rushbrook who had been cogitating how to proceed was the first to speak you haven't taken my poor joey have you sir said he to the keeper not yet replied the keeper surlily you don't mean to say that you know nothing about him replied rushbrook yes i know something about him and about you too my chap replied the keeper but mr lucas interrupted the pedagogue allow me to put you in possession of the facts it appears that this boy a boy of great natural parts and who has been for some time under my tuition did last night but at what hour is unknown to his disconsolate parents leave the cottage taking with him his father's gun and has not been heard of since well i only hope he's shot himself that's all replied the keeper so you have a gun then have you my honest chap continued he turning to rushbrook which replied furness as i have informed him already will certainly be forfeited as a deodand to the lord of the manor but mr lucas this is not all our mutual friend byres the pedlar is also missing having left the cat and fiddle last night and not having been heard of since indeed that makes out a different case and must be inquired into immediately i think you were not the best of friends were you said the keeper looking at rushbrook and then he continued come mary give me my dinner quick and run up as fast as you can for dick and martin tell them to come down with their retrievers only never fear mr furness we will soon find it out never fear my chap we'll find your son also and your gun to boot you may hear more than you think for all i want to know replied rushbrook fiercely for his choler was raised by the sneers of the keeper is where my boy may be so saying he quitted the cottage leaving the schoolmaster with the keeper as rushbrook returned home he revolved in his mind what had passed and decided that nothing could be more favourable for himself however it might turn out for joey this conviction quieted his fears and when the neighbours came in to talk with him he was very cool and collected in his replies in the meantime the keeper made a hasty meal and with his subordinates and the dogs set off to the covers which they beat till dark without success the gun however which joey had thrown down in the ditch had been picked up by one of the labourers returning from his work and taken by him to the ale house none could identify the gun as rushbrook had never permitted it to be seen lucas the keeper came in about an hour after dusk and immediately took possession of it such were the events of the first day after joey's departure notwithstanding that the snow fell fast the cat and fiddle was as it may be supposed unusually crowded on that night various were the surmises as to the disappearance of the pedlar and of little joey the keeper openly expressed his opinion that there was foul play somewhere and it was not until near midnight that the ale house was deserted and the doors closed rushbrook and his wife went to bed tired with watching and excitement they found oblivion for a few hours in a restless and unrefreshing sleep chapter eighteen a coroner's inquest day had scarcely dawned when the keeper and his satellites were again on the search the snow had covered the ground for three or four inches and as the covers had been well examined on the preceding day they now left them and went on in the direction towards where the gun had been picked up this brought them direct to the furze bottom where the dogs appeared to quicken their movements and when the keepers came up with them again they found them lying down by the frozen and stiffened corpse of the pedlar murder as i expected said lucas as they lifted up the body and scraped off the snow which covered it right through his heart poor fellow who would have expected this from such a little varmint look about my lads and see if we can find anything else what is nap scratching at a bag take it up martin dick do you go for some people to take the body to the cat and fiddle while we see if we can find anything more in a quarter of an hour the people arrived the body was carried away while the keeper went off in all haste to the authorities furness the schoolmaster as soon as he had obtained the information hastened to rushbrook's cottage that he might be the first to convey the intelligence rushbrook however from the back of the cottage had perceived the people carrying in the body and was prepared my good people i am much distressed but it must be told believe me i feel for you your son my pupil has murdered the pedlar impossible cried rushbrook it is but too true i cannot imagine how a boy brought up under my tuition nay mrs rushbrook don't cry brought up i may say with such strict notions of morality promising so fairly blossoming so sweetly he never murdered the pedlar cried jane whose face was buried in her apron who then could have replied furness he never shot him intentionally i'll swear said rushbrook if the pedlar has come to his death it must have been by some accident i suppose the gun went off somehow or other yes that must be it and my poor boy frightened at what had taken place has run away well replied the schoolmaster such may have been the case and i do certainly feel as if it were impossible that a boy like joey brought up by me grounded in every moral duty i may add religiously and piously instructed could ever commit such a horrible crime indeed he never did replied jane i am sure he never would do such a thing well i must wish you good bye now my poor people i will go down to the cat and fiddle and hear what they say cried the pedagogue quitting the cottage jane be careful said rushbrook our great point now is to say nothing i wish that man would not come here oh rushbrook cried jane what would i give if we could live these last three days over again then imagine jane what i would give replied rushbrook striking his forehead and now say no more about it at twelve o'clock the next day the magistrates met and the coroner's inquest was held upon the body of the pedlar on examination of the body it was ascertained that a charge of small shot had passed directly through the heart so as to occasion immediate death that the murder had not been committed with the view of robbing it was evident as the pedlar's purse watch and various other articles were found upon his person the first person examined was a man of the name of green who had found the gun in the ditch the gun was produced and he deposed to its being the one which he had picked up and given into the possession of the keeper but no one could say to whom the gun might belong the next party who gave his evidence was lucas the game keeper he deposed that he knew the pedlar byres and that being anxious to prevent poaching he had offered him a good sum if he would assist him in convicting any poacher that byres had then confessed to him that he had often received game from rushbrook the father of the boy and still continued to do so but rushbrook had treated him ill and he was determined to be revenged upon him and get him sent out of the country that byres had informed him on the saturday night before the murder was committed that rushbrook was to be out on monday night to procure game for him and that if he looked out sharp he was certain to be taken byres had also informed him that he had never yet found out when rushbrook left his cottage or returned although he had been tracking the boy joey as the boy was missing on monday morning and byres did not return to the ale house after he went out on saturday night he presumed that it was on the sunday night that the pedlar was murdered the keeper then farther deposed as to the finding of the body and also of a bag by the side of it that the bag had evidently been used for putting game in not only from the smell but from the feathers of the birds which were still remaining inside of it the evidence as to the finding of the body and the bag was corroborated by that of martin and dick the underkeepers mr furness then made his appearance to give voluntary evidence notwithstanding his great regard expressed for the rushbrooks he deposed that calling at the cottage on monday morning for his pupil he found the father and mother in great distress at the disappearance of their son whom they stated to have left the cottage some time during the night and to have taken away his father's gun with him and that their son had not since returned that he pointed out to rushbrook the impropriety of his having a gun and that rushbrook had replied that he had carried one all his life and did not choose to be without one that they told him they supposed that he had gone out to poach and was taken by the keepers and had requested him to go and ascertain if such was the fact mr furness added that he really imagined that to be the case now that he saw the bag which he recognised as having been once brought to him by little joey with some potatoes which his parents had made him a present of that he could swear to the bag and so could several others as well as himself mr furness then commenced a long flourish about his system of instruction in which he was stopped by the coroner who said that it had nothing to do with the business it was then suggested that rushbrook and his wife should be examined there was a demur at the idea of the father and mother giving evidence against their child but it was over ruled and in ten minutes they both made their appearance mrs rushbrook who had been counselled by her husband was the first examined but she would not answer any question put to her she did nothing but weep and to every question her only reply was if he did kill him it was by accident my boy would never commit murder nothing more was to be obtained from her and the magistrates were so moved by her distress that she was dismissed rushbrook trembled as he was brought in and saw the body laid out on the table but he soon recovered himself and became nerved and resolute as people often will do in extremity he had made up his mind to answer some questions but not all do you know at what time your son left the cottage i do not does that gun belong to you yes it is mine do you know that bag yes it belongs to me it has been used for putting game into has it not i shall not answer that question i'm not on trial many other questions were put to him but he refused to answer them and as they would all more or less have criminated himself as a poacher his refusals were admitted rushbrook had played his game well in admitting the gun and bag to be his property as it was of service to him and no harm to joey after summing up the whole evidence the coroner addressed the jury and they returned a unanimous verdict of wilful murder against joseph rushbrook the younger and the magistrates directed the sum of pounds to be offered for our hero's apprehension chapter nineteen a friend in need is a friend indeed rushbrook and jane returned to their cottage jane closed the door and threw herself into her husband's arms you are saved at least she cried thank heaven for that you are spared alas we do not know how much we love till anger comes upon us rushbrook was much affected he loved his wife and had good reason to love her jane was a beautiful woman not yet thirty tall in her person her head was finely formed yet apparently small for her height her features were full of expression and sweetness had she been born to a high station she would have been considered one of the greatest belles as it was she was loved by those around her and there was a dignity and commanding air about her which won admiration and respect no one could feel more deeply than she did the enormity of the offence committed by her husband and yet never in any moment since her marriage did she cling so earnestly and so closely by him as she did now she was of that bold and daring temperament that she could admire the courage that propelled to the crime while the crime itself she abhorred it was not therefore anything surprising that at such a moment with regard to a husband to whom she was devoted she thought more of the danger to which he was exposed than she did of the crime which had been committed to do rushbrook himself justice his person and mind were of no plebeian mould he was a daring venturous fellow ready at any emergency cool and collected in danger had a pleasure in the excitement created by the difficulty and risk attending his nocturnal pursuits caring little or nothing for the profits he as well as his wife had not been neglected in point of education he had been born in humble life and had by enlisting chosen a path by which advancement became impossible but had rushbrook been an officer instead of a common soldier his talents would probably have been directed to more noble channels and the poacher and pilferer for his captain might have exerted his dexterity so as to have gained honourable mention his courage had always been remarkable and he was looked upon by his officers and so he was by his companions as the most steady and collected man under fire to be found in the whole company we are the creatures of circumstances frederick of prussia had no opinion of phrenology and one day he sent for the professor and dressing up a highwayman and a pickpocket in uniforms and orders he desired the phrenologist to examine their heads and give his opinion as to their qualifications the savant did so and turning to the king said sire this person pointing to the highwayman whatever he may be would have been a great general had he been employed as for the other he is quite in a different line he may be or if he is not he would make an admirable financier the king was satisfied that there was some truth in the science for as he very rightly observed what is a general but a highwayman and what is a financier but a pickpocket calm yourself dear jane said rushbrook all is well now all well yes but my poor child pounds offered for his apprehension if they were to take him i have no fear of that and if they did they could not hurt him it is true that they have given their verdict but still they have no positive proof but they have hanged people upon less proof before now rushbrook jane replied rushbrook our boy shall never be hanged i promise you that so make your mind easy then you must confess to save him and i shall lose you a step at the door interrupted their colloquy rushbrook opened it and mr furness the schoolmaster made his appearance well my good friends i am very sorry the verdict has been such as it is but it cannot be helped the evidence was too strong and it was a sad thing for me to be obliged to give mine you exclaimed rushbrook why did they call you up yes and put me on my oath an oath to a moral man is a very serious responsibility the nature of an oath is awful and when you consider my position in this place as the inculcator of morals and piety to the younger branches of the community you must not be surprised at my telling the truth and what had you to tell inquired rushbrook with surprise had to tell why i had to tell what you told me this morning and i had to prove the bag as belonging to you for you know you sent me some potatoes in it by little joey poor fellow wilful murder and two hundred pounds upon apprehension and conviction rushbrook looked at the pedagogue with surprise and contempt pray may i ask how they came to know that anything had passed between us yesterday morning for if i recollect right you desired me to be secret very true and so i did but then they knew what good friends we always were i suppose and so they sent for me and obliged me to speak upon my oath i don't understand it replied rushbrook they might have asked you questions but how could they have guessed that i had told you anything my dear friend you don't understand it but in my situation looking up to me as every one does as an example of moral rectitude and correctness of conduct as a pattern to the juvenile branches of the community you see yes i do see that under such circumstances you should not go to the ale house and get tipsy two days at least out of the week replied rushbrook turning away and why do i go to the ale house my dear friend but to look after those who indulge too freely yourself for instance how often have i seen you home yes when you were drunk and i was jane put her hand upon her husband's mouth and you were what friend inquired furness anxiously worse than you perhaps and now friend furness as you must be tired with your long evidence i wish you a good night shall i see you down at the cat and fiddle not for some time if ever friend furness that you may depend upon never go to the cat and fiddle a little wholesome drink drowns care my friend and therefore although i should be sorry that you indulged too much yet with me to look after you and drink half my ale eh no no friend furness those days are gone well you are not in a humour for it now but another time mrs rushbrook have you a drop of small beer i have none to spare replied jane turning away you should have applied to the magistrates for beer oh just as you please replied the pedagogue it certainly does ruffle people's temper when there is a verdict of wilful murder and two hundred pounds for apprehension and conviction of the offender good night furness banged the cottage door as he went out rushbrook watched till he was out of hearing and then said he's a scoundrel i think so too replied jane but never mind we will go to bed now thank god for his mercies and pray for his forgiveness come dearest the next morning mrs rushbrook was informed by the neighbours that the schoolmaster had volunteered his evidence rushbrook's indignation was excited and he vowed revenge whatever may have been the feelings of the community at the time of the discovery of the murder certain it is that after all was over there was a strong sympathy expressed for rushbrook and his wife and the condolence was very general the gamekeeper was avoided and his friend furness fell into great disrepute after his voluntarily coming forward and giving evidence against old and sworn friends the consequence was his school fell off and the pedagogue whenever he could raise the means became more intemperate than ever one saturday night rushbrook who had resolved to pick a quarrel with furness went down to the ale house furness was half drunk and pot valiant rushbrook taunted him so as to produce replies one word brought on another till furness challenged rushbrook to come outside and have it out this was just what rushbrook wished and after half an hour furness was carried home beaten to a mummy and unable to leave his bed for many days as soon as this revenge had been taken rushbrook who had long made up his mind so to do packed up and quitted the village no one knowing whither he and jane went and furness who had lost all means of subsistence did the same in a very few days afterwards his place of retreat being equally unknown chapter twenty in which we again follow up our hero's destiny after the resolution that major mcshane came to it is not to be surprised that he made during the journey home every inquiry of joey relative to his former life to these joey gave him a very honest reply in everything except that portion of his history in which his father was so seriously implicated he had the feeling that he was bound in honour not to reveal the circumstances connected with the murder of the pedlar mcshane was satisfied and they arrived in london without further adventure as soon as mcshane had been embraced by his wife he gave a narrative of his adventures and did not forget to praise little joey as he deserved mrs mcshane was all gratitude and then it was that mcshane expressed his intentions towards our hero and as he expected he found his amiable wife wholly coincide with him in opinion it was therefore decided that joey should be put to a school and be properly educated as soon as an establishment that was eligible could be found their full intentions towards him however were not communicated to our hero he was told that he was to go to school and he willingly submitted it was not however for three months that mcshane would part with him a difficulty was raised against every establishment that was named during this time little joey was very idle for there was nothing for him to do books there were none for mrs mcshane had no time to read and major mcshane no inclination his only resort was to rummage over the newspapers which were taken in for the benefit of the customers and this was his usual employment one day in turning over the file he came to the account of the murder of the pedlar with the report of the coroner's inquest he read all the evidence particularly that of furness the schoolmaster and found that the verdict was wilful murder with a reward of pounds for his apprehension the term wilful murder he did not exactly comprehend so after laying down the paper with a beating heart he went to mrs mcshane and asked her what was the meaning of it meaning child replied mrs mcshane who was then very busy in her occupation it means child that a person is believed to be guilty of murder and if taken up he will be hanged by the neck till he is dead but replied joey suppose he has not committed the murder well then child he must prove that he has not and suppose although he has not committed it he cannot prove it mercy on me what a number of supposes why then he will be hanged all the same to be sure a fortnight after these queries joey was sent to school the master was a very decent man the mistress a very decent woman the tuition was decent the fare was decent the scholars were children of decent families altogether it was a decent establishment and in this establishment little joey made very decent progress going home every half year how long joey might have remained there it is impossible to say but having been there for a year and a half and arrived at the age of fourteen he had just returned from the holidays with three guineas in his pocket for mcshane and his wife were very generous and very fond of their protege when a circumstance occurred which again ruffled the smooth current of our hero's existence he was walking out as all boys do walk out in decent schools that is in a long line two by two as the animals entered noah's ark when a sort of shabby genteel man passed their files he happened to cast his eyes upon joey and stopped master joseph rushbrook i am most happy to see you once more said he extending his hand joey looked up into his face there was no mistake it was furness the schoolmaster don't you recollect me my dear boy don't you recollect him who taught the infant idea how to shoot don't you recollect your old preceptor yes replied joey colouring up i recollect you very well i am delighted to see you you know you were my fairest pupil but we are all scattered now your father and mother have gone no one knows where you went away and i also could no longer stay what pleasure it is to meet you once more joey did not respond exactly to the pleasure the stoppage of the line had caused some confusion and the usher who had followed it now came up to ascertain the cause this is my old pupil or rather i should say my young pupil but the best pupil i ever had i am most delighted to see him sir said furness taking off his hat may i presume to ask who has the charge of this dear child at this present moment the usher made no difficulty in stating the name and residence of the preceptor and having gained this information furness shook joey by the hand bade him farewell and wishing him every happiness walked away joey's mind was confused during the remainder of his walk and it was not until their return home that he could reflect on what had passed that furness had given evidence upon the inquest he knew and he had penetration when he read it to feel that there was no necessity for furness having given such evidence he also knew that there was a reward of two hundred pounds for his apprehension and when he thought of furness's apparent kindness and his not reverting to a subject so important as wilful murder having been found against him he made up his mind that furness had behaved so with the purpose of lulling him into security and that the next day he would certainly take him up for the sake of the reward now although we have not stopped our narrative to introduce the subject we must here observe that joey's love for his parents particularly his father was unbounded he longed to see them again they were constantly in his thoughts and yet he dared not mention them in consequence of the mystery connected with his quitting his home he fully perceived his danger he would be apprehended and being so he must either sacrifice his father or himself having weighed all this in his mind he then reflected upon what should be his course to steer should he go home to acquaint major mcshane he felt that he could trust him and would have done so but he had no right to intrust any one with a secret which involved his father's life no that would not do yet to leave him and mrs mcshane after all their kindness and without a word this would be too ungrateful after much cogitation he resolved that he would run away so that all clue to him should be lost that he would write a letter for mcshane and leave it he wrote as follows dear sir do not think me ungrateful for i love you and mrs mcshane dearly but i have been met by a person who knows me and will certainly betray me i left my father's home not for poaching but a murder that was committed i was not guilty this is the only secret i have held from you and the secret is not mine i could not disprove it and never will i now leave because i have been discovered by a bad man who will certainly take advantage of having fallen in with me we may never meet again i can say no more except that i shall always pray for you and mrs mcshane and remember your kindness with gratitude yours truly joey mcshane since his return from saint petersburg joey had always by their request called himself joey mcshane and he was not sorry when they gave him the permission although he did not comprehend the advantages which were to accrue from taking the name joey having finished his letter sat down and cried bitterly but in a school there is no retiring place for venting your feelings and he was compelled to smother his tears he performed his exercise and repeated his lessons as if nothing had happened and nothing was about to happen for joey was in essence a little stoic at night he went to his room with the other boys he could only obtain a small portion of his clothes these he put up in a handkerchief went softly downstairs about one o'clock in the morning put his letter addressed to mcshane on the hall table opened the back door climbed over the play ground wall and was again on the road to seek his fortune but joey was much improved during the two years since he had quitted his father's house before that he was a reflective boy now he was more capable of action and decision his ideas had been much expanded from the knowledge of the world gained during his entry as it were into life he had talked much seen much listened much and thought more and naturally quiet in his manner he was now a gentlemanlike boy at the eating house he had met with every variety of character and as there were some who frequented the house daily with those joey had become on intimate terms he was no longer a child but a lad of undaunted courage and presence of mind he had only one fear which was that his father's crime should be discovered and now he was again adrift with a small bundle three guineas in his pocket and the world before him at first he had but one idea that of removing to a distance which should elude the vigilance of furness and he therefore walked on and walked fast joey was capable of great fatigue he had grown considerably it is true during the last two years still he was small for his age but every muscle in his body was a wire and his strength as had been proved by his school mates was proportionate he was elastic as india rubber and bold and determined as one who had been all his life in danger chapter twenty one the scene is again shifted and the plot advances it will be necessary that for a short time we again follow up the fortunes of our hero's parents when rushbrook and jane had quitted the village of grassford they had not come to any decision as to their future place of abode all that rushbrook felt was a desire to remove as far as possible from the spot where the crime had been committed such is the feeling that will ever possess the guilty who although they may increase their distance attempt in vain to fly from their consciences or that all seeing eye which follows them everywhere jane had a similar feeling but it arose from her anxiety for her husband they wandered away for they had sold everything before their departure until they found themselves in the west riding of yorkshire and there they at length settled in a small village rushbrook easily obtained employment for the population was scanty and some months passed away without anything occurring of interest rushbrook had never taken up his employment as a poacher since the night of the murder of the pedlar he had abjured it from that hour his knowledge of woodcraft was however discovered and he was appointed first as under and eventually as head keeper to a gentleman of landed property in the neighbourhood in this situation they had remained about a year rushbrook giving full satisfaction to his employer and comparatively contented for no man could have such a crime upon his conscience and not pass occasional hours of misery and remorse and jane was still mourning in secret for her only and darling child when one day a paper was put into rushbrook's hands by his master desiring him to read an advertisement which it contained and which was as follows if joseph rushbrook who formerly lived in the village of grassford in the county of devon should be still alive and will make his residence known to messrs pearce james and simpson of chancery lane he will hear of something greatly to his advantage should he be dead and this advertisement meet the eye of his heirs they are equally requested to make the communication to the above address what does it mean sir inquired rushbrook it means that if you are that person in all probability there is some legacy bequeathed to you by a relative replied mr s is it you yes sir replied rushbrook changing colour i did once live at grassford then you had better write to the parties and make yourself known i will leave you the newspaper what think you jane said rushbrook as soon as mr had quitted i think he is quite right replied jane but jane you forgot this may be a trap they may have discovered something about you know what i mean yes i do and i wish we could forget it but in this instance i do not think you have anything to fear there is no reward offered for your apprehension but for my poor boy's who is now wandering over the wide world and no one would go to the expense to apprehend you if there was nothing to be gained by it true replied rushbrook after a minute's reflection but alas i am a coward now i will write rushbrook wrote accordingly and in reply received a letter inclosing a bank bill for pounds and requesting that he would come to town immediately he did so and found to his astonishment that he was the heir at law to a property of pounds per annum with the only contingency that he was as nearest of kin to take the name of austin having entered into all the arrangements required by the legal gentleman he returned to yorkshire with pounds in his pocket to communicate the intelligence to his wife and when he did so and embraced her she burst into tears rushbrook do not think i mean to reproach you by these tears but i cannot help thinking that you would have been happier had this never happened your life will be doubly sweet to you now and joey's absence will be a source of more vexation than ever do you think that you will be happier jane dearest i have been thinking of it as well as you and on reflection i think i shall be safer who would know the poacher rushbrook in the gentleman of pounds a year of the name of austin who would dare accuse him even if there were suspicion i feel that once in another county under another name and in another situation i shall be safe but our poor boy should he ever come back will also be forgotten he will have grown up a man and having another name will never be recognised they will not even know what our former name was i trust that it will be as you say what do you now mean to do i shall say that i have a property of four or five hundred pounds left me and that i intend to go up to london replied rushbrook yes that will be wise it will be an excuse for our leaving this place and will be no clue to where we are going replied jane rushbrook gave up his situation sold his furniture and quitted yorkshire in a few weeks afterwards he was installed into his new property a splendid mansion and situated in the west of dorsetshire report had gone before them some said that a common labourer had come into the property others said it was a person in very moderate circumstances as usual both these reports were contradicted by a third which represented him as a half pay lieutenant in the army rushbrook had contrived to mystify even the solicitor as to his situation in life he stated to him that he had retired from the army and lived upon the government allowance and it was in consequence of a reference to the solicitor made by some of the best families in the neighbourhood who wished to ascertain if the newcomers were people who could be visited that this third report was spread and universally believed we have already observed that rushbrook was a fine tall man and if there is any class of people who can be transplanted with success from low to high life it will be those who have served in the army the stoop is the evidence of a low bred vulgar man the erect bearing equally so that of the gentleman now the latter is gained in the army by drilling and discipline and being well dressed will provide for all else that is required as far as mere personal appearance is concerned when therefore the neighbours called upon mr and mrs austin they were not surprised to find an erect military looking man but they were very much surprised to find him matched with such a fine and even elegant looking woman as his wife timid at first jane had sufficient tact to watch others and copy and before many months were passed in their new position it would have been difficult to suppose that mrs austin had not been born in the sphere in which she then moved austin was brusque and abrupt in his manners as before but still there was always a reserve about him which he naturally felt and which assisted to remove the impression of vulgarity people who are distant are seldom considered ungentlemanlike although they may be considered unpleasant in their manners it is those who are too familiar who obtain the character of vulgarity austin therefore was respected but not liked jane on the contrary whose beauty had now all the assistance of dress and whose continued inward mourning for her lost son had improved that beauty by the pensive air which she wore was a deserved and universal favourite people of course said that austin was a harsh husband and pitied poor mrs austin but that people always do say if a woman is not inclined to mirth austin found ample amusement in sporting over his extensive manor and looking after his game in one point the neighbouring gentlemen were surprised that although so keen a sportsman himself he never could be prevailed upon to convict a poacher he was appointed a magistrate and being most liberal in all his subscriptions was soon considered as a great acquisition to the county his wife was much sought after but it was invariably observed that when children were mentioned the tears stood in her eyes before they had been a year in their new position they had acquired all the knowledge and tact necessary their establishment was on a handsome scale they were visited and paid visits to all the aristocracy and gentry and were as popular as they could have desired to be but were they happy alas no little did those who envied austin his property and establishment imagine what a load was on his mind what a corroding care was wearing out his existence little did they imagine that he would gladly have resigned all and been once more the poacher in the village of grassford to have removed from his conscience the deed of darkness which he had committed and once more have his son by his side and poor jane her thoughts were day and night upon one object where was her child it deprived her of rest at night she remained meditating on her fate for hours during the day it would rush into her mind in the gayest scenes and the happiest moments it was one incessant incubus one continual source of misery of her husband she thought less for she knew how sincerely contrite he was for the deed he had done how bitterly he had repented it ever since and how it would as long as he lived be a source of misery a worm that would never die but gnaw till the last hour of his existence but her boy her noble self sacrificed little joey he and his destiny were ever in her thoughts and gladly would she have been a pauper applying for relief if she had but that child to have led up in her hand and yet all the county thought how happy and contented the austins ought to be to have suddenly come into possession of so much wealth 'tis god alone that knows the secrets of the heart of man chapter twenty two a very long chapter but in which our hero obtains employment in a very short time the preparatory establishment for young gentlemen to which our hero had been sent was situated on clapham rise joey did not think it prudent to walk in the direction of london he therefore made a cut across the country so as to bring him before seven o'clock in the morning not very far from gravesend the night had been calm and beautiful for it was in the month of august and it had for some time been broad daylight when our hero who had walked fifteen or sixteen miles sat down to repose himself and as he remained quietly seated on the green turf on the way side he thought of his father and mother of the kindness of the mcshanes and his own hard fate until he became melancholy and wept and as the tears were rolling down his cheeks a little girl of about ten years old very neatly dressed and evidently above the lower rank of life came along the road her footsteps so light as not to be perceived by joey she looked at him as she passed and perceived that he was in tears and her own bright pretty face became clouded in a moment joey did not look up and after hesitating awhile she passed on a few steps and then she looked round and observing that he was still weeping she paused turned round and came back to him for a minute or two she stood before him but joey was unconscious of her presence for he was now in the full tide of his grief and not having forgotten the precepts which had been carefully instilled into him he thought of the god of refuge and he arose fell on his knees and prayed the little girl whose tears had already been summoned by pity and sympathy dropped her basket and knelt by his side not that she prayed for she knew not what the prayer was for but from an instinctive feeling of respect towards the deity which her new companion was addressing and a feeling of kindness towards one who was evidently suffering joey lifted up his eyes and beheld the child on her knees the tears rolling down her cheeks he hastily wiped his eyes for until that moment he imagined that he had been alone he had been praying on account of his loneliness he looked up and he was not alone but there was one by his side who pitied him without knowing wherefore he felt relieved by the sight they both regained their feet at the same time and joe went up to the little girl and taking her by the hand said thank you why do you cry said the little girl because i am unhappy i have no home replied joey no home said the little girl it is boys who are in rags and starving who have no home not young gentlemen dressed as you are but i have left my home replied joey then go back again how glad they will be to see you yes indeed they would replied joey but i must not you have not done anything wrong have you no i'm sure you have not you must have been be a good boy or you would not have prayed no i have done nothing wrong but i must not tell you any more indeed joey was much more communicative with the little girl than he would have been with anybody else but he had been surprised into it and moreover he had no fear of being betrayed by such innocence he now recollected himself and changed the conversation and where are you going to inquired he i am going to school at gravesend i go there every morning and stay till the evening this is my dinner in my basket are you hungry no not particularly are you going to gravesend yes replied joey what is your name emma phillips have you a father and mother i have no father he was killed fighting a little while after i was born and your mother lives with grandmother at that house you see there through the large trees and what are you going to do with yourself will you come home with me and i'll tell my mother all you have told me and she is very kind and will write to your friends no no you must not do that i am going to seek for employment why what can you do i hardly know replied joey but i can work and am willing to work so i hope i shall not starve with such conversation they continued their way until the little girl said there is my school so now i must wish you good bye good bye i shall not forget you replied joey although we may never meet again tears stood in the eyes of our hero as they reluctantly unclasped their hands and parted joey once more left alone now meditated what was the best course for him to pursue the little emma's words not young gentlemen dressed as you are reminded him of the remarks and suspicions which must ensue if he did not alter his attire this he resolved to do immediately the only idea which had presented itself to his mind was if possible to find some means of getting back to captain o'donahue who he was sure would receive him if he satisfied him that it was not safe for him to remain in england but then must he confess to him the truth or not on this point our hero was not decided so he put off the solution of it till another opportunity a slop warehouse now attracted his attention he looked into the door after having examined the articles outside and seeing that a sailor boy was bargaining for some clothes he went in as if waiting to be served but in fact more to ascertain the value of the articles which he wished to purchase the sailor had cheapened a red frock and pair of blue trousers and at last obtained them from the jew for shillings joey argued that as he was much smaller than the lad he ought to pay less he asked for the same articles but the jew who had scanned in his own mind the suit of clothes which joey had on argued that he ought to pay more joey was however firm and about to leave the shop when the jew called him back and after much haggling joey obtained the dress for shillings having paid for the clothes joey begged permission to be permitted to retire to the back shop and put them on to ascertain if they fitted him to which the jew consented a jew asks no questions when a penny is to be turned who joey was he cared little his first object was to sell him the clothes and having so done he hoped to make another penny by obtaining those of joey at a moderate price perceiving that our hero was putting his own clothes which he had taken off into a bundle the jew asked him whether he would sell them and joey immediately agreed but the price offered by the jew was so small that they were returned to the bundle and once more was joey leaving the shop when the jew at last offered to return to him the money he had paid for the sailor's dress and take his own clothes in exchange provided that joey would also exchange his hat for one of tarpaulin which would be more fitting to his present costume to this our hero consented and thus was the bargain concluded without joey having parted with any of his small stock of ready money no one who had only seen him dressed as when he quitted the school would have easily recognised joey in his new attire joey sallied forth from the shop with his bundle under his arm intending to look out for a breakfast for he was very hungry turning his head right and left to discover some notice of where provender might be obtained he observed the sailor lad who had been in the shop when he went in with his new purchase under his arm looking very earnestly at some prints in a shop window joey ranged up alongside of him and inquired of him where he could get something to eat the lad turned round stared and after a little while cried well now you're the young gentleman chap that came into the shop i say aren't you after a rig eh given them leg bail i'll swear no consarn of mine old fellow come along i'll show you joey walked by his new acquaintance a few yards when the lad turned to him i say did your master whop you much no replied joey well then that's more than i can say of mine for he was at it all day hold out your right hand now your left continued he mimicking my eyes how it used to sting i don't think i should mind it much now continued the lad turning up his hand it's a little harder than it was then here's the shop come in if you haven't no money i'll give you a breakfast the lad took his seat on one side of a narrow table joey on the other and his new acquaintance called for two pints of tea a twopenny loaf and two penny bits of cheese the loaf was divided between them and with their portion of cheese and pint of tea each they made a good breakfast as soon as it was over the young sailor said to joey now what are you going arter do you mean to ship i want employment replied joey and i don't much care what it is well then look you i ran away from my friends and went to sea and do you know i've only repented of it once and that's ever since better do anything than go to sea winter coming on and all besides you don't look strong enough you don't know what it is to be coasting in winter time thrashed up to furl the top gallant sail when it is so dark you can't see your way and so cold that you can't feel your fingers holding on for your life and feeling as if life after all was not worth caring for cold and misery aloft kicks and thumps below don't you go to sea if you do after what i've told you why then you're a greater fool than you look to be i don't want to be a sailor replied joey but i must do something to get my living you are very kind will you tell me what to do why do you know when i saw you come up to me when i was looking at the pictures in your frock and trousers you put me in mind because you are so much like him of a poor little boy who was drowned the other day alongside of an india ship that's why i stared for i thought you were he at first how was he drowned poor fellow responded joey why you see his aunt is a good old soul who keeps a bumboat and goes off to the shipping what's a bumboat a boat full of soft tommy soldiers pipes and backey rotten apples stale pies needles and threads and a hundred other things besides a fat old woman sitting in the stern sheets joey stared he did not know that soft tommy meant loaves of bread or that soldiers was the term for red herrings he only thought that the boat must be very full now you see that little peter was her right hand man for she can't read and write can you but of course you can yes i can replied joey well little peter was holding on by the painter against a hard sea but his strength was not equal to it and so when a swell took the boat he was pulled right overboard and he was drowned was the painter drowned too inquired joey ha ha that's capital why the painter is a rope now the old woman has been dreadfully put out and does nothing but cry about little peter and not being able to keep her accounts now you look very like him and i think it very likely the old woman would take you in his place if i went and talked her over that's better than going to sea for at all events you sleep dry and sound on shore every night even if you do have a wet jacket sometimes what d'ye think i think you are very kind and i should be glad to take the place well she's a good old soul and has a warm heart and trusts them who have no money too much i'm afraid for she loses a great deal so now i'll go and speak to her for she'll be alongside of us when i go on board and where shall i find you when i come on shore in the evening wherever you say i will be well then meet me here at nine o'clock that will make all certain come i must be off now i'll pay for the breakfast i have money i thank you replied joey then keep it for it's more than i can do and what's your name joey well then joey my hearty if i get you this berth when we come in and i am short you must let me go on tick till i can pay what's tick you'll soon find out what tick is after you have been a week in the bumboat replied the lad laughing nine o'clock my hearty good bye so saying the young sailor caught up his new clothes and hastened down to the beach the room was crowded with seamen and women but they were too busy talking and laughing to pay any attention to joey and his comrade our little hero sat some little time at the table after his new acquaintance had left and then walked out into the streets telling the people of the house that he was coming back again and requesting them to take care of his bundle you'll find it here my little fellow all right when you ask for it said the woman at the bar who took it inside and put it away under the counter joey went out with his mind more at ease the nature of his new employment should he succeed in obtaining it he could scarcely comprehend but still it appeared to him one that he could accomplish he amused himself walking down the streets watching the movements of the passers by the watermen in their wherries and the people on board of the vessels which were lying off in the stream it was a busy and animating sight as he was lolling at the landing place a boat came on shore which from the description given by his young sailor friend he was convinced was a bumboat it had all the articles described by him as well as many others such as porter in bottles a cask probably containing beer leeks onions and many other heterogeneous matters and moreover there was a fat woman seated in the stern the waterman shoved in with his boat hook and the wherry grounded the fat personage got out and the waterman handed to her a basket a long book and several other articles which she appeared to consider indispensable among others a bundle which looked like dirty linen for the wash dear me how shall i get up all these things exclaimed the woman and william you can't leave the boat and there's nobody here to help me i'll help you said joey coming down the steps what shall i carry for you well you are a good kind boy replied she can you carry that bundle i'll manage all the rest joey tossed the bundle on his shoulder in a moment well you are a strong little chap said the waterman he is a very nice little fellow and a kind one now come along and i'll not forget you joey followed with the bundle until they arrived at a narrow door not eighty yards from the landing place and the woman asked him if he would carry it upstairs to the first floor which he did do you want me any more said joey setting down the bundle no dear no but i must give you something for your trouble what do you expect nothing at all replied joey and i shall not take anything you're very welcome good bye and so saying joey walked downstairs although the woman halloed after him and recommenced his peregrination in the streets of gravesend but he was soon tired of walking on the pavement which was none of the best and he then thought that he would go out into the country and enjoy the green fields so off he set the same way that he came into the town passed by the school of little emma and trudged away on the road stopping every now and then to examine what attracted his notice watching a bird if it sang on the branch of a tree and not moving lest he should frighten it away at times sitting down by the road side and meditating or the past and the future the day was closing in and joey was still amusing himself as every boy who has been confined to a schoolroom would do he sauntered on until he came to the very spot where he had been crying and had met with little emma phillips and as he sat down again he thought of her sweet little face and her kindness towards him and there he remained some time till he was roused by some one singing as they went along the road he looked up and perceived it was the little girl who was returning from school joey rose immediately and walked towards her to meet her but she did not appear to recognise him and would have passed him if he had not said don't you know me yes i do now replied she smiling but i did not at first you have put on another dress i have been thinking of you all day and do you know i've got a black mark for not saying my lesson added the little girl with a sigh and then it is my fault replied joey i'm very sorry oh never mind it is the first that i have had for a long while and i shall tell mamma why but you are dressed as a sailor boy are you going to sea no i believe not i hope to have employment in the town here and then i shall be able to see you sometimes when you come from school may i walk with you as far as your own house yes i suppose so if you like it joey walked with her until they came to the house which was about two hundred yards farther but said joey hesitating you must make me a promise what is that you must keep my secret you must not tell your mother that you saw me first in what you call gentleman's clothes it might do me harm and indeed it's not for my own sake i ask it don't say a word about my other clothes or they may ask me questions which i must not answer for it's not my secret i told you more this morning than i would have told any one else i did indeed well replied the little girl after thinking a little i suppose i have no right to tell a secret if i am begged not to do it so i will say nothing about your clothes but i must tell mother that i met you oh yes tell her you met me and that i was looking for some work and all that and to morrow or next day i will let you know if i get any will you come in now said emma no not now i must see if i can get this employment promised for me and then i shall see you again if i should not see you again i shall not forget you indeed i won't good bye emma bade him adieu and they separated and joey remained and watched her till she disappeared under the porch of the entrance our hero returned towards gravesend in rather a melancholy mood there was something so unusual in his meeting with the little girl something so uncommon in the sympathy expressed by her that he felt pain at parting but it was getting late and it was time that he kept his appointment with his friend the sailor boy joey remained at the door of the eating house for about a quarter of an hour when he perceived the sailor lad coming up the street he went forward to meet him oh here we are well young fellow i've seen the old woman and had a long talk with her and she won't believe there can be another in the world like her peter but i persuaded her to have a look at you and she has consented so come along for i must be on board again in half an hour joey followed his new friend down the street until they came to the very door to which he had carried the bundle the sailor boy mounted the stairs and turning into the room at the first landing joey beheld the woman whom he had assisted in the morning here he is mrs chopper and if he won't suit you i don't know who will said the boy he's a regular scholar and can sum up like winkin' this character given so gratuitously by his new acquaintance made joey stare and the woman looked hard into joey's face well now said she where have i seen you before dear me and he is like poor peter as you said jim i vow he is i saw you before to day replied joey for i carried a bundle up for you and so you did and would have no money for your trouble well jim he is like poor peter i told you so old lady ay and he'll just do for you as well as peter did but i'll leave you to settle matters for i must be a board so saying the lad tipped a wink to joey the meaning of which our hero did not understand and went downstairs well now it's very odd but do you know you are like poor peter and the more i look at you the more you are like him poor peter did you hear how i lost him yes the sailor lad told me this morning poor fellow he held on too fast most people drown by not holding on fast enough he was a good boy and very smart indeed and so it was you who helped me this morning when i missed poor peter so much well it showed you had a good heart and i love that and where did you meet with jim paterson i met him first in a slop shop as he calls it when i was buying my clothes well jim's a wild one but he has a good heart and pays when he can i've been told by those who know his parents that he will have property by and bye well and what can you do i am afraid you can't do all peter did i can keep your accounts and i can be honest and true to you well peter could not do more are you sure you can keep accounts and sum up totals yes to be sure i can try me well then i will here is pen ink and paper well you are the very image of peter and that's a fact now write down beer pence tobacco pence is that down yes let me see duck for trousers shillings pence beer again pence tobacco pence is that down well then say beer again pence now sum that all up joey was perfect master of the task and as he handed over the paper announced the whole sum to amount to shillings pence well says mrs chopper it looks all right but just stay here a minute while i go and speak to somebody mrs chopper left the room went downstairs and took it to the bar girl at the next public house to ascertain if it was all correct yes quite correct mrs chopper replied the lass and is it as good as peter's was poor fellow much better replied the girl dear me who would have thought it and so like peter too mrs chopper came upstairs again and took her seat well said she and now what is your name joey joey what joey o'donahue replied our hero for he was fearful of giving the name of mcshane and who are your parents they are poor people replied joey and live a long way off and why did you leave them joey had already made up his mind to tell his former story i left there because i was accused of poaching and they wished me to go away poaching yes i understand that killing hares and birds well but why did you poach because father did oh well i see then if you only did what your father did we must not blame his child and so you come down here to go to sea if i could not do better but you shall do better my good boy i will try you instead of poor peter and if you are an honest and good careful boy it will be much better than going to sea dear me how like he is but now i must call you peter it will make me think i have him with me poor fellow if you please said joey who was not sorry to exchange his name well then where do you sleep to night i did intend to ask for a bed at the house where i left my bundle then don't do so go for your bundle and you shall sleep in peter's bed poor fellow his last was a watery bed as the papers say and then to morrow morning you can go off with me joey accepted the offer went back for his bundle and returned to mrs chopper in a quarter of an hour she was then preparing her supper which joey was not sorry to partake of after which she led him into a small room in which was a small bed without curtains the room itself was hung round with strings of onions papers of sweet herbs and flitches of bacon the floor was strewed with empty ginger beer bottles oakum in bags and many other articles altogether the smell was anything but agreeable here is poor peter's bed said mrs chopper i changed his sheets the night before he was drowned poor fellow can i trust you to put the candle out oh yes i'll be very careful then good night boy do you ever say your prayers poor peter always did yes i do replied joey good night mrs chopper left the room joey threw open the window for he was almost suffocated undressed himself put out the light and when he had said his prayers his thoughts naturally reverted to the little emma who had knelt with him on the road side chapter twenty three in which our hero goes on duty at five o'clock the next morning joey was called up by mrs chopper the waterman was in attendance and with the aid of joey carried down the various articles into the boat when all was ready mrs chopper and joey sat down to their breakfast which consisted of tea bread and butter and red herrings and as soon as it was finished they embarked and the boat shoved off well mrs chopper said the waterman so i perceive you've got a new hand yes replied mrs chopper don't you think he's the moral of poor peter well i don't know but there is a something about the cut of his jib which reminds me of him now you mention it peter was a good boy aye that he was and as sharp as a needle you see said mrs chopper turning to joey sharp's the word in a bumboat there's many who pay and many who don't some i trust and some i don't that is those who won't pay me old debts we lose a bit of money at times but it all comes round in the end but i lose more by not booking the things taken than in any other way for sailors do pay when they have the money that is if ever they come back again poor fellows now peter what is his name peter too yes i must call him peter william he is so like poor peter well that will suit me i hate learning new names well but peter continued mrs chopper you must be very careful for you see i'm often called away here and there after wash clothes and such things and then you must look out and if they do take up anything why you must book it at all events you'll learn by and bye who to trust and who not to trust for i know the most of my customers you must not trust a woman i mean any of the sailors' wives unless i tell you and you must be very sharp with them for they play all manner of tricks you must look two ways at once now there's a girl on board the brig we are pulling to called nancy why she used to weather poor peter sharp as he was she used to pretend to be very fond of him and hug him close to her with one arm so as to blind him while she stole the tarts with the other so don't admit her familiarities if you do i shall pay for them then who am i to trust bless the child you'll soon find out that but mind one thing never trust a tall lanky seaman without his name's on the books those chaps never pay there's the book kept by poor peter and you see names upon the top of each score at least i believe so i have no learning myself but i've a good memory i can't read nor write and that's why peter was so useful that peter could read his own writing it is to be presumed but certain it was that joey could not make it out until after many days examination when he discovered that certain hieroglyphics were meant to represent certain articles after which it became more easy they had now reached the side of the vessel and the sailors came down into the boat and took up several articles upon credit joey booked them very regularly has bill been down yet said a soft voice from the gangway no nancy he has not then he wants two red herrings a sixpenny loaf and some 'baccy joey looked up and beheld a very handsome fair blue eyed girl with a most roguish look who was hanging over the side then he must come himself nancy replied mrs chopper for you know the last time you took up the things he said that you were never told to do so and he would not pay for them that's because the fool was jealous i lost the tobacco mrs chopper and he said i had given it to dick snapper i can't help that he must come himself but he's away in the boat and he told me to get the things for him who have you there not peter no it's not peter but what a dear little boy i told you so said mrs chopper to our hero now if i wasn't in the boat she would be down in it in a minute and persuade you to let her have the things and she never pays joey looked up again and as he looked at nancy felt that it would be very unkind to refuse her now what a hard hearted old woman you are mrs chopper bill will come on board and as sure as i stand here he'll whack me he will pay you you may take my word for it your word nancy replied mrs chopper shaking her head stop a moment said nancy coming down the side with very little regard as to showing her well formed legs stop mrs chopper and i'll explain to you it's no use coming down nancy i tell you replied mrs chopper well we shall see replied nancy taking her seat in the boat and looking archly in mrs chopper's face the fact is mrs chopper you don't know what a good tempered woman you are i know nancy what you are replied mrs chopper oh so does everybody i'm nobody's enemy but my own they say ah that's very true child more's the pity now i didn't come down to wheedle you out of anything mrs chopper but merely to talk to you and look at this pretty boy there you go nancy but ain't he like peter well and so he is very like peter he has peter's eyes and his nose and his mouth is exactly peter's how very strange i never see'd such a likeness exclaimed mrs chopper no indeed replied nancy who by agreeing with mrs chopper in all she said and praising joey and his likeness to peter at last quite came over the old bumboat woman and nancy quitted her boat with the two herrings the loaf and the paper of tobacco shall i put them down mrs chopper said joey oh dear replied mrs chopper coming to her recollection i'm afraid that it's no use but put them down anyhow they will do for bad debts shove off william we must go to the large ship now i do wish that that nancy was at any other port exclaimed mrs chopper as they quitted the vessel's side i do lose so much money by her well said the waterman laughing you're not the only one she can wheedle man or woman or as they say the devil to boot if she would try during the whole of the day the wherry proceeded from ship to ship supplying necessaries in many instances they were paid for in ready money in others joey's capabilities were required and they were booked down against the customers at last about five o'clock in the evening the beer barrel being empty most of the contents of the baskets nearly exhausted and the wherry loaded with the linen for the wash biscuits empty bottles and various other articles of traffic or exchange mrs chopper ordered william the waterman to pull on shore to the landing place as soon as the baskets and other articles had been carried up to the house mrs chopper sent out for the dinner which was regularly obtained from a cook's shop joey sat down with her and when his meal was finished mrs chopper told him he might take a run and stretch his legs a little if he pleased while she tended to the linen which was to go to the wash joey was not sorry to take advantage of this considerate permission for his legs were quite cramped from sitting so long jammed up between baskets of eggs red herrings and the other commodities which had encompassed him we must now introduce mrs chopper to the reader a little more ceremoniously she was the widow of a boatswain who had set her up in the bumboat business with some money he had acquired a short time before his death and she had continued it ever since on her own account people said that she was rich but riches are comparative and if a person in a seaport town and in her situation could show or pounds at her bankers she was considered rich if she was rich in nothing else she certainly was in bad and doubtful debts having seven or eight books like that which joey was filling up for her during the whole day all containing accounts of long standing and most of which probably would stand for ever but if the bad debts were many the profits were in proportion and what with the long standing debts being occasionally paid the ready money she continually received and the profitable traffic which she made in the way of exchange etcetera she appeared to do a thriving business although it is certain the one half of her goods were as much given away as were the articles obtained from her in the morning by nancy it is a question whether these books of bad debts were not a source of enjoyment to her for every night she would take one of the books down and although she could not read yet by having them continually read to her and knowing the pages so exactly she could almost repeat every line by heart which the various bills contained and then there was always a story which she had to tell about each something relative to the party of whom the transaction reminded her and subsequently when joey was fairly domiciled with her she would make him hand down one of the books and talk away from it for hours they were the ledgers of her reminiscences the events of a considerable portion of her life were all entered down along with the 'baccy porter pipes and red herrings a bill for these articles was to her time place and circumstance and what with a good memory and bad debts to assist it many were the hours which were passed away and pleasantly enough too for one liked to talk and the other to listen between mrs chopper and our little hero but we must not anticipate the permission given to joey to stretch his legs induced him to set off as fast as he could to gain the high road before his little friend emma phillips had left her school he sat down in the same place waiting for her coming the spot had become hallowed to the poor fellow for he had there met with a friend with one who sympathised with him when he most required consolation he now felt happy for he was no longer in doubt about obtaining his livelihood and his first wish was to impart the pleasing intelligence to his little friend she was not long before she made her appearance in her little straw bonnet with blue ribbons joey started up and informed her that he had got a very nice place explained to her what it was and how he had been employed during the day and i can very often come out about this time i think added joey and then i can walk home with you and see that you come to no harm but replied the little girl my mother says that she would like to see you as she will not allow me to make acquaintance with people i meet by accident don't you think that mother is right yes i do she's very right replied joey i didn't think of that will you come and see her then not now because i am not very clean i'll come on sunday if i can get leave they separated and joey returned back to the town as he walked on he thought he would spend the money he had got in a suit of sunday clothes of a better quality than those he had on the materials of which were very coarse on second thoughts he resolved to apply to mrs chopper as he did not exactly know where to go for them and was afraid that he would be imposed upon well peter said his new mistress do you feel better for your walk yes thank you ma'am peter continued mrs chopper you appear to be a very handy good boy and i hope we shall live together a long while how long have you been at sea i was going to sea i have never been to sea yet and i don't want to go i would rather stay with you and so you shall that's a settled thing what clothes have you got peter i have none but what i stand in and a few shirts in a bundle and they are sunday ones but when i left home i had some money given me and i wish to buy a suit of clothes for sunday to go to church in that's a good boy and so you shall but how much money have you got quite enough to buy a suit of clothes replied joey handing out two sovereigns and seventeen shillings in silver oh i suppose they gave you all that to fit you out with when you left home poor people i dare say they worked hard for it well i don't think the money will be of any use to you so you had better buy a sunday suit and i will take care you want for nothing afterwards don't you think i'm right yes i wish to do so to day is tuesday i may have them made by next sunday so you can and as soon as william comes in which he will soon from the washerwoman's we will go out and order them here he comes up the stairs no that foot's too light for his well it's nancy i declare why nancy now continued mrs chopper in a deprecating tone what do you want here well i leave you to guess replied nancy looking very demurely and taking a seat upon a hamper guess i fear there's no guess in it nancy but i will not now it's no use i will not trust another shilling but i know you will mrs chopper lord love you you're such a good natured creature you can't refuse any one and certainly not me why don't you take me in your boat with you as your assistant then there would be something in it worth looking at i should bring you plenty of custom you're too wild nancy too wild girl but now what do you want recollect you've already had some things to day i know i have and you are a good natured old trump that you are now i'll tell you gold must pass between us this time mercy on me nancy why you're mad i've no gold nothing but bad debts look you mrs chopper look at this shabby old bonnet of mine don't i want a new one then you must get somebody else to give you money nancy replied mrs chopper coolly and decidedly don't talk so fast mrs chopper now i'll let you know how it is when bill came on board he asked the captain for an advance the captain refused him before but this time he was in a good humour and he consented so then i coaxed bill out of a sovereign to buy a new bonnet and he gave it me and then i thought what a kind soul you were and i resolved that i would bring you the sovereign and go without the new bonnet so here it is take it quick or i shall repent well nancy said mrs chopper you said right gold has passed between us and i am surprised now i shall trust you again and so you ought it's not every pretty girl like me who will give up a new bonnet only look what a rubbishy affair this is continued nancy giving her own a kick up in the air i wish i had a sovereign to give away said joey to mrs chopper i wish i had not said a word about the clothes do as you like with your own money my dear said the bumboat woman then nancy i'll give you a sovereign to buy yourself a new bonnet with said joey taking one out of his pocket and putting into her hand nancy looked at the sovereign and then at joey bless the boy said she at last kissing him on the forehead he has a kind heart may the world use him better than it has me here take your sovereign child any bonnet's good enough for one like me so saying nancy turned hastily away and ran downstairs chapter twenty four in which mrs chopper reads her ledger ah poor girl said mrs chopper with a sigh as nancy disappeared you are a good boy peter i like to see boys not too fond of money and if she had taken it and i wish she had poor thing i would have made it up to you is the man she calls bill her husband inquired joey oh i know nothing about other people's husbands replied mrs chopper hastily now then let us go and order the clothes and then you'll be able to go to church on sunday i will do without you what won't you go to church bless you child who is to give the poor men their breakfast and their beer a bumboat woman can't go to church any more than a baker's man for people must eat on a sunday church like everything else in this world appears to me only to be made for the rich i always take my bible in the boat with me on sunday but then i can't read it so it's of no great use no dear i can't go to church but i can contrive if it don't rain in the evening to go to meeting and hear a little of the word but you can go to church dear a suit of blue cloth made in sailor's fashion having been ordered by mrs chopper she and joey returned home and after their tea mrs chopper desired joey to hand her one of the account books which she put upon her knees and opened there said she looking at the page i know that account well it was tom alsop's a fine fellow he was only he made such a bad marriage his wife was a very fiend and the poor fellow loved her which was worse one day he missed her and found she was on board another vessel and he came on shore distracted like and got very tipsy as sailors always do when they're in trouble and he went down to the wharf and his body was picked up next day did he drown himself yes so people think peter and he owed me pound shillings pence if i recollect right aren't that the figure peter yes ma'am replied joey that's the sum total of the account exactly poor fellow continued mrs chopper with a sigh he went to his long account without paying me my short one never mind i wish he was alive and twice as much in my debt there's another i recollect that well peter for it's a proof that sailors are honest and i do believe that if they don't pay it's more from thoughtlessness than anything else and then the women coax all their money from them for sailors don't care for money when they do get it and then those jews are such shocking fellows but look you peter this is almost the first bill run up after i took up the business he was a nice fair haired lad from shields and the boy was cast away and he was picked up by another vessel and brought here and i let him have things and lent him money to the amount of a matter of pounds and he said he would save all and pay me and he sailed away again and i never heard of him for nine years i thought that he was drowned or that he was not an honest lad i didn't know which and it was a deal of money to lose but i gave it up when one day a tall stout fellow with great red whiskers called upon me and said do you know me' no' said i half frightened how should i know you i never see'd you before' yes you did' says he and here's a proof of it' and he put down on the table a lot of money and said now missus help yourself better late than never i'm jim sparling who was cast away and who you were as good as a mother to but i've never been able to get leave to come to you since i'm boatswain's mate of a man of war and have just received my pay and now i've come to pay my debts' he would make me take pounds more than his bill to buy a new silk gown for his sake poor fellow he's dead now here's another that was run up by one of your tall lanky sailors who wear their knives in a sheath and not with a lanyard round their waists those fellows never pay but they swear dreadfully let me see what can this one be read it peter how much is it pounds shillings pence replied our hero yes yes i recollect now it was the dutch skipper there's murder in that bill peter it was things i supplied to him just before he sailed and an old man was passenger in the cabin he was a very rich man although he pretended to be poor he was a diamond merchant they say and as soon as they were at sea the dutch captain murdered him in the night and threw him overboard out of the cabin window but one of the sailors saw the deed done and the captain was taken up at amsterdam and had his head cut off the crew told us when the galliot came back with a new captain so the dutch skipper paid the forfeit of his crime he paid my bill too that's certain oh deary me continued the old lady turning to another page i shan't forget this in a hurry i never see poor nancy now without recollecting it look peter i know the sum pounds shillings pence exactly it was the things taken up when tom freelove married nancy it was the wedding dinner and supper what nancy who was here just now yes that nancy and a sweet modest young creature she was then and had been well brought up too she could read and write beautifully and subscribed to a circulating library they say she was the daughter of a baker in this town i recollect it well such a fine day it was when they went to church she looking so handsome in her new ribbons and smart dress and he such a fine looking young man i never seed such a handsome young couple but he was a bad one and so it all ended in misery tell me how said joey i'll tell all you ought to know boy you are too young to be told all the wickedness of this world her husband treated her very ill before he had been married a month he left her and went about with other people and was always drunk and she became jealous and distracted and he beat her cruelly and deserted her and then to comfort her people would persuade her to keep her spirits up and gave her something to drink and by degrees she became fond of it her husband was killed by a fall from the mast head and she loved him still and took more to liquor and that was her ruin she don't drink now because she don't feel as she used to do she cares about nothing she is much to be pitied poor thing for she is still young and very pretty it's only four years ago when i saw her come out of church and thought what a happy couple they would be where are her father and mother both dead don't let's talk about it any more it's bad enough when a man drinks but if a woman takes to it it is all over with her but some people's feelings are so strong that they fly to it directly to drown care and misery put up the book peter i can't look at it any more to night we'll go to bed joey every day gave more satisfaction to his employer and upon his own responsibility allowed his friend the sailor lad to open an account as soon as his money was all gone finding that the vessel was going up the river to load joey determined to write a few lines to the mcshanes to allay the uneasiness which he knew his absence must have occasioned jim paterson promising to put the letter in the post as soon as he arrived at london our hero simply said my dear sir i am quite well and have found employment so pray do not grieve about me as i never shall forget your kindness joey mcshane on the following sunday joey was dressed in his sailor's suit and looked very well in it he was not only a very good looking but a gentlemanlike boy in his manners he went to church and after church he walked out to the abode of his little friend emma phillips she ran out to meet him was delighted with his new clothes and took him by the hand to present him to her mother mrs phillips was a quiet looking pleasing woman and the old lady was of a very venerable appearance they made many inquiries about his friends and joey continued in the same story that he and his father had been poachers that he had been discovered and obliged to go away and that he went with the consent of his parents they were satisfied with his replies and prepossessed in his favour and as joey was so patronised by her little daughter he was desired to renew his visits which he occasionally did on sundays but preferred meeting emma on the road from school and the two children if joey could be called a child became very intimate and felt annoyed if they did not every day exchange a few words thus passed the first six months of joey's new life the winter was cold and the water rough and he blew his fingers while mrs chopper folded her arms up in her apron but he had always a good dinner and a warm bed after the day's work was over he became a great favourite with mrs chopper who at last admitted that he was much more useful than even peter and william the waterman declared that such was really the case and that he was in his opinion worth two of the former peter who had come to such an untimely end chapter twenty five in which the biter is bit the disappearance of joey from the school was immediately communicated to mcshane by the master who could not imagine how such an incident could have occurred in such a decent establishment as his preparatory seminary it was an epoch in his existence and ever afterwards his chronology was founded upon it and everything that occurred was so many months or weeks before or after the absconding of young master mcshane the letter had of course been produced and as soon as the schoolmaster had taken his departure mcshane and his wife were in deep council i recollect said mrs mcshane who was crying in an easy chair i recollect now that one day the boy came up and asked me the meaning of wilful murder and i told him and now i think of it i do also remember the people at number table close to the counter some time ago talking about a murder having been committed by a mere child and a long report of it in the newspapers i am sure however as joey says in his letter that he is not guilty and so am i replied mcshane however bring up the file of newspapers dear and let me look over them how long back do you think it was why let me see it was about the time you went away with captain o'donahue i think or a little before that was in october mcshane turned over the file of newspapers and after a quarter of an hour's search found the report of the coroner's inquest here it is my dear sure enough said mcshane as soon as he had read it over and came to the end he said yes wilful murder against joseph rushbrook the younger and pounds for his apprehension this it was that drove the boy away from home and not poaching although i have no doubt that poaching was the cause of the murder now my dear continued mcshane i think i can unravel all this the murder has been committed that's evident by somebody but not by joey i'll be sworn he says that he is not guilty and i believe him nevertheless joey runs away and a verdict is found against him my dear wife i happen to know the father of joey well he was a fine bold soldier but one who would stick at nothing and if i could venture an opinion it is that the murder was committed by rushbrook and not by the boy and that the boy has absconded to save his father the reader will acknowledge that mcshane was very clear sighted that's my opinion continued mcshane how it has been managed to make the boy appear as the party i cannot tell but knowing the father and knowing the son i'd stake my commission that i've guessed at the truth poor boy exclaimed mrs mcshane well the commandments say that the sins of the father shall be visited upon the children what can be done mcshane nothing at present it would injure joey to raise a hue and cry after him for you see if he is apprehended he must either be tried for his life and convicted himself or prove that he did not do it which probably he could not do without convicting his father i will however make some inquiries about rushbrook himself and if i can i will see him the same evening the schoolmaster again called upon mcshane to say that two persons had come to the school in the afternoon and asked to see him that one of them shabbily dressed but evidently a person who was not of so low a class in life as the other had accosted him when he came into the parlour with i believe i have the pleasure of speaking to mr slappum if so may i request the favour to see my little friend joey whom i met yesterday walking out with the other young gentlemen under your care as i have a message to him from his father and mother the dear boy was once under my tuition and did me much credit as i have no doubt that he has done you now the usher had told mr slappum that joey had been addressed by this person the day before and the schoolmaster presuming of course that it was joey mcshane replied i am sorry to say that he left this house last night and has absconded we know not where he left a letter for major mcshane which i have this day delivered to him acquainting him with the unpleasant circumstance bolted by all that's clever said the second personage to the first who looked very much surprised and confounded you really have astonished me my dear sir replied the first person whom the reader will of course recognise to be furness that a lad brought up by me in such strict moral principles such correct notions of right and wrong and i may add such pious feelings should have taken such a step is to me incomprehensible major mcshane i think you said lives at major mcshane lives at number in holborn replied the schoolmaster and the lad has not gone home to him no he has not he left a letter which i took to major mcshane but i did not break the seal and am ignorant of its contents i really am stupefied with grief and vexation replied furness and will not intrude any longer bless the poor boy what can have come of him so saying furness took his departure with the peace officer whom he had intrusted with the warrant which he had taken out to secure the person of our hero mcshane heard the schoolmaster's account of this visit without interruption and then said i have no doubt but that this person who has called upon you will pay me a visit oblige me therefore by describing his person particularly so that i may know him at first sight the schoolmaster gave a most accurate description of furness and then took his leave as the eating house kept by mrs mcshane had a private door furness who as mcshane had prophesied came the next afternoon after having read the name on the private door which was not on the eating house which went by the name of the chequers imagined that it was an establishment apart and thought it advisable to enter into it and ascertain a little about major mcshane before he called upon him although mcshane seldom made his appearance in the room appropriated for the dinners it so happened that he was standing at the door when furness entered and sat down in a box calling for the bill of fare and ordering a plate of beef and cabbage mcshane recognised him by the description given of him immediately and resolved to make his acquaintance incognito and ascertain what his intentions were he therefore took his seat in the same box and winking to one of the girls who attended also called for a plate of beef and cabbage furness who was anxious to pump any one he might fall in with immediately entered into conversation with the major a good house this sir and well attended apparently yes sir replied mcshane it is considered a very good house do you frequent it much yourself always sir i feel much interested in its success replied mcshane for i know the lady who keeps it well and have a high respect for her i saw her as i passed by a fine woman sir pray may i ask who is major mcshane who i observe lives in the rooms above he is a major in the army sir now on half pay do you know him remarkably well replied mcshane he's a countryman of mine he's married sir i think i'll trouble you for the pepper he is married sir to a very amiable woman any family sir not that i know of they have a young protege i believe now at school a boy they call joey indeed how very kind of them really now it's quite refreshing for me to see so much goodness of heart still remaining in this bad world adopted him i presume i really cannot exactly say that i know that they treat him as their own child have you seen major mcshane lately sir saw him this morning sir just after he got up indeed this is remarkably good ale sir will you honour me by tasting it sir you are very kind but the fact is i never drink malt liquor here girl bring a half pint of brandy i trust sir you will not refuse to join me in a glass although i cannot venture to accept your polite offer furness drank off his pot of ale and made ready for the brandy which had been offered him mcshane filled his own glass and then handed the decanter over to furness i have the pleasure of drinking your good health sir said mcshane you are from the country i presume may i inquire from what part i am from devonshire i was formerly head of the grammar school at but sir my principles would not allow me to retain my situation rectitude of conduct sir is absolutely necessary to the profession which inculcates morality and virtue as well as instruction to youth sir here's to our better acquaintance sir sir to your's i honour your sentiments by the powers but you're right mr i beg your pardon but i don't catch your name exactly furness sir at your service yes sir the directors of the foundation which i presided over i may say with such credit to myself and such advantage to the pupils under my care wished to make a job yes sir of a charity i could not consent to such deeds and i resigned and you have been in london ever since no sir i repaired to the small village of grassford where i set up a school but circumstances compelled me to resign and i am now about to seek for employment in another hemisphere in short i have an idea of going out to new south wales as a preceptor i understand they are in great want of tuition in that quarter i should think so replied mcshane and they have a great deal to unlearn as well as to learn i speak of the junior branches the scions or offsets i may say born in the colony and who i trust will prove that crime is not hereditary well i wish you luck sir replied mcshane you must oblige me by taking another glass for i never shall be able to finish this decanter myself i gladly avail myself of the pleasure of your company sir as the reader is well aware that furness was an intemperate man it is not surprising that he accepted the offer and before the second glass was finished the ale and brandy had begun to have the effect and he had become very communicative what was the name of the village which you stated you had resided in lately sir inquired mcshane the village of grassford there is something i recollect about that village let me see something that i read in the newspapers i remember now it was the murder of a pedlar very true sir such a circumstance did take place it was a dreadful affair and what is more strange committed by a mere child who absconded indeed what was his name rushbrook sir his father was a well known poacher a man who had been in the army and had a pension for wounds there is an old saying sir of high authority bring up a child in the way he should go and he will not depart from it' i instructed that boy sir but alas what avails the instruction of a preceptor when a father leads a child into evil ways that's the truth and no mistake replied mcshane so the boy ran away yes i recollect now and what became of the father the father sir and mother have since left the village and gone nobody knows where indeed are you sure of that quite sure sir for i was most anxious to discover them and took great pains but without success what did the people say thereabouts was there no suspicion of the father being implicated i do not think there was he gave evidence at the inquest and so did i sir as you may suppose most unwillingly for the boy was a favourite of mine i beg your pardon sir you say you are acquainted with major mcshane and saw him this morning is the interesting little boy you speak of as under his protection now at home or still at school i really cannot positively say replied mcshane but this is not holiday time come sir we must not part yet your conversation is too interesting you must allow me to call for some more brandy poor as i am i must treat myself and you too i wish i knew where i could pick up a little money for to tell you the truth cash begins to run low furness was now more than half drunk well sir said he i have known money picked up without any difficulty for instance now suppose we should fall in with this young rascal who committed the murder there is pounds offered for his apprehension and conviction i thought as much muttered mcshane the infernal scoundrel i suspect that you will find him where you are going to mr furbish he's got that far by this time between you and i i think not sir my name is furness sir i beg your pardon not furbish why you do not think he would be such a fool as to remain in the country after such an act the wicked are foolish sir as well as others replied furness putting his finger to his nose and looking very knowingly that's truth sir help yourself you drink nothing excuse me one minute i'll be back directly mcshane left the box for a few minutes to explain to his wife what he was about and to give time for the liquor to operate upon furness as he expected he found on his return that furness had finished his glass and was more tipsy than when he left him the conversation was renewed and mcshane again pleading his poverty and his wish to obtain money brought out the proposal of furness who informed him that he had recognised the protege of major mcshane to be the identical joseph rushbrook that the boy had absconded from the school and was concealed in the house he concluded by observing to mcshane that as he was so intimate with the major it would be very easy for him to ascertain the fact and offered him pounds as his share of the reward if he would assist him in the boy's capture it was lucky for furness that mcshane was surrounded by others or in all probability there would have been another murder committed the major however said he would think of it and fell back in deep thought what he was thinking of was what he should do to punish furness at last an idea came into his head the rascal was drunk and he proposed that he should go to another house where they might find the major and he would present him furness consented and reeled out of the box mcshane although he would as soon have touched a viper controlled himself sufficiently to give furness his arm and leading him down by two or three back courts he took him into an ale house where there was a rendezvous for enlisting marines for the navy as soon as they were seated and had liquor before them mcshane spoke to the sergeant tipped him a guinea and said he had a good recruit for him if he could be persuaded to enlist he then introduced the sergeant as the major and advised furness to pretend to agree with him in everything the sergeant told long stories clapped furness who was now quite intoxicated on the back called him a jolly fellow and asked him to enlist say yes' to please him said mcshane in his ear furness did so received the shilling and when he came to his senses next day found his friend had disappeared and that he was under an escort for portsmouth all remonstrances were unavailing mcshane had feed paid a fee to the sergeant and had promised him a higher fee not to let furness off and the latter having but a few shillings in his pocket was compelled to submit to his fate chapter twenty six in which our hero again falls in with an old acquaintance for nearly two years joey had filled his situation as chancellor of the exchequer to mrs chopper he certainly did not feel himself always in the humour or the disposition for business especially during the hard winter months when seated almost immovably in the boat during the best portion of the day he would find his fingers so completely dead that he could not hold his pen but there is no situation under any of the powers that be that has not some drawback people may say that a sinecure is one that has not its disadvantages but such is not the case there is the disgrace of holding it at all events joey's place was no sinecure for he was up early and was employed the whole of the day nancy the young woman we have introduced to our readers had contracted a great regard for our hero ever since his offering her his money and joey was equally partial to her for she possessed a warm heart and much good feeling she would very often run upstairs into mrs chopper's room to talk with the old lady and to see joey and would then take out her thimble and needle examine his clothes and make the necessary repairs i saw you walking with little emma phillips peter said nancy where did you come to know her i met her in the road the day that i came down to gravesend well i'm sure and do you speak to every young lady you chance to meet no but i was unhappy and she was very kind to me she's a very sweet child or rather i can only say that she was when i knew her when did you know her four or five years ago i lived for a short time with mrs phillips that was when i was a good girl yes indeed nancy said mrs chopper shaking her head why ain't you good now nancy replied joey because said nancy because why because i am not good replied the girl and now peter don't ask any more questions or you'll make me cry heigho i think crying very pleasant now and then one's heart feels fresher like flowers after the rain peter where are your father and mother i don't know i left them at home you left them at home but do you never hear from them do you never write no but why not i am sure they have brought you up well they must be very good people are they not joey could not answer how could he say that his father was a good man after what had passed you don't answer me peter don't you love your father and mother dearly yes indeed i do but i must not write to them well i must say there is something about peter and his parents which i cannot understand and which i have often tried to make him tell and he will not said mrs chopper poaching ain't such a great crime especially in a boy i can't see why he should not write to his father and mother at all events i hope peter you have told me the truth i have told you what is true but my father was a poacher and they know it and if they did not punish me they would him and transport him too if i gave evidence against him which i must do if put to my oath i've told you all i can tell i must not tell of father must i no no child i dare say you are right replied mrs chopper now i don't ask you to tell me peter said nancy for i can guess what has taken place you and your father have been out poaching there has been a scuffle with the keepers and there has been blood shed and that's the reason why you keep out of the way ain't i right you are not far wrong replied joey but i will not say a word more upon it and i won't ask you my little peter there that's done and now i shall have a peep out of the window for it's very close here mrs chopper nancy threw the window open and leaned out of it watching the passers by mercy on us here's three soldiers coming up the street with a deserter handcuffed cried she who can it be he's a sailor why i do believe it's sam oxenham that belongs to the thomas and mary of sunderland poor fellow yes it is him joey went to the window and took his stand by the side of nancy what soldiers are those inquired he they're not soldiers after all replied nancy they are jollies a sergeant and two privates jollies what are they why marines to be sure joey continued looking at them until they passed under the window when nancy who had a great disgust at anything like arbitrary power could not refrain from speaking i say master sergeant you're a nice brave fellow with your two jollies d'ye think the young man will kill you all three that you must put the darbies on so tight at this appeal the sergeant and privates looked up at the window and laughed when they saw such a pretty girl as nancy the eyes of one of the privates were however soon fixed on our hero's face and deeply scrutinising it when joey looked at him as soon as joey recognised him he drew back from the window pale as death the private still remaining staring at the window why what's the matter peter said nancy what makes you look so pale do you know that man yes replied joey drawing his breath and he knows me i'm afraid why do you fear replied nancy see if he's gone said joey yes he has he has gone up the street with the sergeant but every now and then he looks back at this window but perhaps that's to see me why peter what harm can that marine do you inquired mrs chopper a great deal he will never be quiet until he has me taken up and then what will become of my poor father continued joey with the tears running down his cheeks give me my bonnet peter i'll soon find out what he is after said nancy leaving the window she threw her bonnet on her head and ran downstairs mrs chopper in vain endeavoured to console our hero or make him explain he did nothing but sit mournfully by her side thinking what he had best do and expecting every minute to hear the tramp of furness for it was he who had recognised joey coming up the stairs mrs chopper at last said joey i must leave you i'm afraid i was obliged to leave my former friends on this man's account leave me boy no no you must not leave me how could i get on without you if i don't leave you myself i shall be taken up that is certain but indeed i have not done wrong don't think that i have i'm sure of it child you've only to say so and i'll believe you but why should he care about you he lived in our village and knows all about it he gave evidence at at what boy at the time that i ran away from home he proved that i had the gun and bag which were found well and suppose you had what then mrs chopper there was a reward offered and he wants to get the money oh i see now a reward offered then it must be as nancy said there was blood shed and mrs chopper put her apron up to her eyes joey made no answer after a few minutes' silence he rose and went to his room where he slept and put his clothes up in a bundle having so done he sat down on the side of his bed and reflected what was the course he ought to pursue our hero was now sixteen and much increased in stature he was no longer a child although in heart almost as innocent his thoughts wandered he yearned to see his father and mother and reflected whether he might not venture back to the village and meet them by stealth he thought of the mcshanes and imagined that he might in the same way return to them then little emma phillips rose in his imagination and his fear that he should never see her again captain o'donahue was at last brought to his recollection and he longed to be once more with him in russia and lastly he reviewed the happy and contented life he had lately led with his good friend mrs chopper and how sorry he should be to part with her after a time he threw himself on his bed and hid his face in the pillow and overcome with the excess of his feelings he at last fell asleep in the mean time nancy had followed the marines up the street and saw them enter with their prisoner into a small public house where she was well known she followed them spoke a few kind words to the seaman who had been apprehended and with whom she was acquainted and then sat down by furness to attract his attention furness had certainly much improved in his appearance since he had much against his will been serving his majesty being a tall man he had by drilling become perfectly erect and the punishment awarded to drunkenness as well as the difficulty of procuring liquor had kept him from his former intemperance and his health had in consequence improved he had been more than once brought up to the gangway upon his first embarkation but latterly had conducted himself properly and was in expectation of being made a corporal for which situation his education certainly qualified him on the whole he was now a fine looking marine although just as unprincipled a scoundrel as ever well my pretty lass didn't i see you looking out of a window just now to be sure you did and you might have heard me too replied nancy and when i saw such a handsome fellow as you didn't i put on my bonnet in a hurry and come after you what ship do you belong to the mars at the nore well i should like to go on board of a man of war will you take me to be sure i will come have a drink of beer here's to the jollies said nancy putting the pewter pot to her lips when do you go on board again not till to morrow we've caught our bird and now we'll amuse ourselves a little do you belong to this place yes bred and born here but we hardly ever see a man of war they stay at the nore or go higher up nancy did all she could to make furness believe she had taken a fancy to him and knew too well how to succeed before an hour had passed furness had as he thought made every arrangement with her and congratulated himself on his good fortune in the mean time the beer and brandy went round even the unfortunate captive was persuaded to drink with them and drown reflection at last furness said to nancy who was that lad that was looking out of the window with you was it your brother my brother bless you no you mean that scamp peter who goes in the bumboat with old mother chopper does he well i have either seen him before or some one like him he's not of our town replied nancy he came here about two years ago nobody knows where from and has been with mrs chopper ever since two years ago muttered furness that's just the time come girl take some more beer nancy drank a little and put down the pot where does mrs chopper live inquired furness where you saw me looking out of the window replied nancy and the boy lives with her i will call upon mrs chopper by and bye yes to be sure he does but why are you talking so about the boy why don't you talk to me and tell me what a pretty girl i am for i like to be told that furness and his comrades continued the carouse and were getting fast into a state of intoxication the sergeant only was prudent but furness could not let pass this opportunity of indulging without fear of punishment he became more loving towards nancy as he became more tipsy when nancy who cajoled him to the utmost of her power again mentioned our hero and then it was that furness who when inebriated could never hold a secret first told her there was a reward offered for his apprehension and that if she would remain with him they would spend the money together to this nancy immediately consented and offered to assist him as much as she could as she had the entrance into mrs chopper's house and knew where the lad slept but nancy was determined to gain more from furness and as he was now pretty far gone she proposed that they should take a walk out for it was a beautiful evening furness gladly consented nancy again explained to him how she should manage to get joey into her power and appeared quite delighted at the idea of there being a reward which they were to obtain and finding that furness was completely deceived and that the fresh air had increased his inebriety she then persuaded him to confide to her all the circumstances connected with the reward offered for our hero's apprehension she then learned what had occurred at the inquest joey's escape his being again discovered by furness and his second escape from the school to which he had been put by the mcshanes and his father and mother where are they when i think of them i must say that i do not much like to assist in taking up the boy poor people how they will suffer when they hear of it really i don't know what to say continued nancy biting the tip of her finger as if hesitating don't let them stop you said furness they will not be likely even to hear of it they left the village before me and no one knows where they are gone i tried to find out myself but could not it's very clear that they are gone to america indeed said nancy who had put the questions because she wished to give joey some information relative to his parents gone to america do you say yes i am inclined to think so for i lost all trace of them well then replied nancy that scruple of mine is got over she then pointed out to furness the propriety of waiting an hour or two till people were in bed that there might be no chance of a rescue and they returned to the public house furness took another glass of ale and then fell fast asleep on the bench with his head over the table so thought nancy as she left the public house the drunken fool makes sure of his pounds but there is no time to be lost nancy hastened back to mrs chopper whom she found sitting with a candle turning over the leaves of one of the old account books o nancy is that you i was just sighing over you here's the things that were ordered for your wedding poor girl i fear you have not often been to church since nancy was silent for a short time i'm sick of my life and sick of myself mrs chopper but what can i do a wretch like me i wish i could run away as poor peter must directly and go to where i never was known i should be so happy peter must go do you say nancy is that certain most certain mrs chopper and he must be off directly i have been with the marines and the fellow has told me everything he is only waiting now for me to go back to come and take him but tell me nancy has peter been guilty i believe from my heart that he has done nothing but still murder was committed and peter will be apprehended unless you give him the means of running away where is he now asleep fast asleep i didn't like to wake him poor fellow then he must be innocent mrs chopper they say the guilty never sleep but what will he do he has no money he has saved me a mint of money and he shall not want it replied mrs chopper what shall i do without him i can't bear to part with him but you must mrs chopper and if you love him you will give him the means and let him be off directly i wish i was going too continued nancy bursting into tears go with him nancy and look after him and take care of my poor peter said mrs chopper whimpering go my child go and lead a good life i should better part with him if i thought you were with him and away from this horrid place will you let me go with him mrs chopper will you indeed cried nancy falling on her knees oh i will watch him as a mother would her son as a sister would her brother give us but the means to quit this place and the good and the wicked both will bless you that you shall have my poor girl it has often pained my heart to look at you for i felt that you are too good for what you are and you will be again a good honest girl you both shall go poor peter i wish i were young enough i would go with you but i can't how i shall be cheated again when he is gone but go he must here nancy take the money take all i have in the house and mrs chopper put upwards of pounds into nancy's hand as she was kneeling before her nancy fell forward with her face in the lap of the good old woman suffocated with emotion and tears come come nancy said mrs chopper after a pause and wiping her eyes with her apron you mustn't take on so my poor girl recollect poor peter there's no time to lose that is true replied nancy rising up mrs chopper you have done a deed this night for which you will have your reward in heaven may the god of mercy bless you and as soon as i dare night and morning will i pray for you mrs chopper went into joey's room with the candle in her hand followed by nancy see how sound he sleeps said the old woman he is not guilty peter peter come get up child joey rose from his bed confused at first with the light in his eyes but soon recovered himself peter you must go my poor boy and go quickly nancy says i was sure of it replied joey i am very very sorry to leave you mrs chopper pray think well of me for indeed i have done nothing wrong i am sure of it but nancy knows it all and away you must go i wish you were off i'm getting fidgety about it although i cannot bear to lose you so good bye at once peter and god bless you i hope we shall meet again yet i hope so indeed mrs chopper for you have been very kind to me as kind as a mother could be mrs chopper hugged him to her breast and then said in a hurried tone as she dropped on the bed there go go nancy took up joey's bundle in one hand and joey by the other and they went down stairs as soon as they were in the street nancy turned short round and went to the house where she usually slept desiring joey to wait a moment at the door she soon returned with her own bundle and then with a quick pace walked on desiring joey to follow her they proceeded in this manner until they were clear of the town when joey came up to nancy and said thank you nancy i suppose we'd better part now no we don't part yet peter replied nancy but where are you going and why have you that bundle i am going with you peter replied nancy but nancy replied joey and then after a pause i will do all i can for you i will work for you but i have no money and i hope we shall not starve bless you boy bless you for that kind feeling but we shall not starve i have mrs chopper's leave to go with you indeed she wished me so to do and she has given me money for you it is for you although she said for both she is very kind but why should you go with me nancy you have nothing to fear we must not talk now peter let us walk on i have more to fear than you how is that i fear being taken up for that of which i am not guilty but you have nothing to fear peter dear replied nancy solemnly i do not fear for anything the world can do to me but don't talk now let us go on chapter twenty seven in which the wheel of fortune brings our hero's nose to a grindstone when nancy and our hero had proceeded about three miles on their way nancy slackened her pace and they entered into conversation which way are you going demanded joey i'm cutting right across the country peter or rather joey as i shall in future call you for that is your real name the marine told me it was joseph rushbrook is it not yes it is replied joey then in future i shall call you so for i do not want to hear even a name which would remind me of the scene of my misery and joey do you never call me nancy again the name is odious to me call me mary i will if you wish it but i cannot imagine why you should run away from gravesend mary what do you mean to do i ran away from fear of being taken up and i joey do more i fly from the wrath to come you ask me what i intend to do i will answer you in the words of the catechism which i used once to repeat to lead a new life have a thankful remembrance of christ's death and be in charity with all men' i shall seek for service i care not how humble it will be good enough i will sift cinders for brick making make bricks do anything as long as what i do is honest i am very glad to hear you say that mary replied joey for i was always very fond of you yes joey and you were the first who offered to do a kind thing for me for a long while i have never forgotten it and this night i have done something to repay it nancy then entered into a detail of all that had passed between her and furness of which joey had been ignorant and which proved to him what a narrow escape he had had i little thought you had done all this while i slept replied joey but i am very grateful mary i know you are so say no more about it you see joey he gave me all your history and appears to believe that you committed the murder i do not believe it i do not believe you would do such a thing although your gun might have gone off by accident no mary i did not do it either on purpose or by accident but you must ask me no more questions for if i were put on my trial i should not reveal the secret then i will never speak to you any more about it if i can help it i have my own thoughts on the business but now i drop it it is nearly daylight and we have walked a good many miles i shall not be sorry to sit down and rest myself do you know how far we have to go before we come to any town mary we are not far from maidstone it is on our right but it will be as well not to go through so large a town so near to gravesend besides some of the soldiers may know me as soon as we come to a good place where we can find a drink of water we will sit down and rest ourselves about a mile further on they came to a small rivulet which crossed the road this will do joey said nancy now we'll sit down it was then daylight they took their seats on their bundles as soon as they had drunk from the stream now joey said mary as we shall call her for the future let us see what money we have mrs chopper put all she had in my hands poor good old woman bless her count it joey it is yours no mary she gave it for both of us never mind do you keep it for you see joey it might happen that you might have to run off at a moment's warning and it would not do for you to be without money if i was to run off at a minute's warning i should then take it all with me and it would not do for you to be left without any money mary so we must halve it between us although we will always make one purse well be it so for if you were robbed or i were robbed on the way the other might escape they then divided the money joey putting his share into his pocket and tying it in with a string mary dropped hers down into the usual deposit of women for bank notes and billets doux as soon as this matter had been arranged mary opened her bundle and took out a handkerchief which she put on her shoulders combed out the ringlets which she had worn and dressed her hair flat on her temples removed the gay ribbons from her bonnet and substituted some plain brown in their stead there says she now joey don't i look more respectable you do look more neat and more more modest you would say joey well and i hope in future to become what i look but i look more fit to be your sister joey for i have been thinking we had better pass off as brother and sister to avoid questioning we must make out some story to agree in who shall we say that we are as we dare not say who we really are i am looking out for service and so are you that's very clear father and mother are both dead father was a baker that's all true as far as relates to me and as you are my brother why you must take my father and mother it's no very great story after all but it won't do to say we came from gravesend no we need not say that and yet tell no story the village we passed through last night was wrotham so we came from thence but where do you think of going mary a good way farther off yet at all events before we look out for service we will get into another county now if you are ready we will go on joey and look out for some breakfast and then i shall be able to change my gown for a quieter one in half an hour they arrived at a village and went into a public house mary went up stairs and changed her dress and now that she had completed her arrangements she looked a very pretty modest young woman and none could have supposed that the day before she had been flaunting in the street of a seafaring town inquiries were made as might be supposed and mary replied that she was going to service and that her brother was escorting her they had their breakfast and after resting two hours they proceeded on their journey for some days they travelled more deliberately until they found themselves in the village of manstone in dorsetshire where they as usual put up at an humble public house here mary told a different story she had been disappointed in a situation and they intended to go back to their native town the landlady of the hotel was prepossessed in favour of such a very pretty girl as mary as well as with the appearance of joey who although in his sailor's dress was very superior in carriage and manners to a boy in his supposed station in life and she said that if they would remain there a few days she would try to procure them some situation the third day after their arrival she informed mary that she had heard of a situation as under housemaid at the squire's about a mile off if she would like to take it and mary gladly consented mrs derborough sent up word and received orders for mary to make her appearance and mary accordingly went up to the hall accompanied by joey when she arrived there and made known her business she was desired to wait in the servants' hall until she was sent for in about a quarter of a hour she was summoned and leaving joey in the hall she went up to see the lady of the house who inquired whether she had ever been out at service before and if she had a good character mary replied that she had never been out at service and that she had no character at all which by the bye was very true the lady of the house smiled at this apparently naive answer from so very modest looking and pretty a girl and asked who her parents were to this question mary's answer was ready and she further added that she had left home in search of a place and had been disappointed that her father and mother were dead but her brother was down below and had escorted her and that mrs chopper was an old friend of her mother's and could answer to her character the lady was prepossessed by mary's appearance by the report of mrs derborough and by the respectability of her brother travelling with her and agreed to try her but at the same time said she must have mrs chopper's address that she might write to her but the place being vacant she might come to morrow morning her wages were named and immediately accepted and thus did mary obtain her situation people say you cannot be too particular when you choose servants and to a certain degree this is true but this extreme caution however selfishness and prudence may dictate it is but too often the cause of servants who have committed an error and have in consequence been refused a character being driven to destitution and misery when they had a full intention and would have had they been permitted redeemed their transgression mary was resolved to be a good and honest girl had the lady of the house been very particular and had others to whom she might afterwards have applied been the same all her good intentions might have been frustrated and she might have been driven to despair if not to her former evil courses it is perhaps fortunate that everybody in the world is not so particular as your very good people and that there is an occasional loophole by which those who have erred are permitted to return to virtue mary left the room delighted with her success and went down to joey in the servants' hall the servants soon found out from mary that she was coming to the house and one of the men chucked her under the chin and told her she was a very pretty girl mary drew back and joey immediately resented the liberty stating that he would not allow any man to insult his sister for joey was wise enough to see that he could not do a better thing to serve mary the servant was insolent in return and threatened to chastise joey and ordered him to leave the house the women took our hero's part the housekeeper came down at the time and hearing the cause of the dispute was angry with the footman the butler took the side of the footman and the end of it was that the voices were at the highest pitch when the bell rang and the men being obliged to answer it the women were for the time left in possession of the field what is that noise below inquired the master of the house it is a boy sir the brother i believe of the girl who has come as under housemaid who has been making a disturbance desire him to leave the house instantly yes sir replied the butler who went down to enforce the order little did the master of the house imagine that in giving that order he was turning out of the house his own son for the squire was no other than mr austin little did the inconsolable mrs austin fancy that her dear lamented boy was at that moment under the same roof with her and been driven out of it by her menials but such was the case so joey and mary quitted the hall and bent their way back to the village inn well mary said joey i am very glad that you have found a situation and so i am very thankful indeed joey replied she and only hope that you will be able to get one somewhere about here also and then we may occasionally see something of one another no mary replied joey i shall not look for a situation about here the only reason i had for wishing it was that i might see you but that will be impossible now why so do you think that i will ever put my foot into that house again after the manner i was treated to day never i was afraid so replied mary mournfully no mary i am happy that you are provided for for i can seek my own fortune and i will write to you and let you know what i do and you will write to me mary won't you it will be the greatest pleasure that will be left to me joey for i love you as dearly as it you were my own brother the next day our hero and mary parted with many tears on her side and much sorrow on his joey refused to take more of the money than what he had in his possession but promised in case of need to apply to mary who said that she would hoard up everything for him and she kept her word joey having escorted mary to the hall lodge remained at the inn till the next morning and then set off once more on his travels our hero started at break of day and had walked by a western road from manstone about six miles when he met two men coming towards him they were most miserably clad neither of them had shoes or stockings one had only a waistcoat and a pair of trousers with a sack on his back the other had a pair of blue trousers torn to ribbons a guernsey frock and a tarpaulin hat they appeared what they represented themselves to be when they demanded charity two wrecked seamen who were travelling to a northern port to obtain employment but had these fellows been questioned by a sailor he would soon have discovered by their total ignorance of anything nautical that they were impostors perhaps there is no plan more successful than this which is now carried on to an enormous extent by a set of rogues and depredators who occasionally request charity but too often extort it and add to their spoils by robbing and plundering everything in their way it is impossible for people in this country to ascertain the truth of the assertions of these vagabonds and it appears unfeeling to refuse assistance to a poor seaman who has lost his all even the cottager offers his mite and thus do they levy upon the public to an extent which is scarcely credible but it should be known that in all cases of shipwreck sailors are now invariably relieved and decently clothed and supplied with the means of travelling to obtain employment and whenever a man appeals for charity in a half naked state he is invariably an impostor or a worthless scoundrel the two men were talking loud and laughing when they approached our hero as soon as they came near they looked hard at him and stopped right before him so as to block up the footpath hilloah my little sailor where are you bound to said one to joey who had his common sailor's dress on and i say what have you got in that bundle said the other and how are you off for brads haven't you something to spare for brother seamen come feel in your pockets or shall i feel for you joey did not much like this exordium he replied stepping into the road at the same time i've no money and the bundle contains my clothes come come said the first you're not going to get off that way if you don't wish your brains beaten out you'll just hand over that bundle for me to examine and so saying the man stepped into the road towards joey who continued to retreat to the opposite side there was no footpath at the side of the road to which joey retreated but a very thick quick set hedge much too strong for any man to force his way through joey perceived this and as the man came at him to seize his bundle he contrived by a great effort to swing it over the hedge into the field on the other side the man exasperated at this measure on the part of our hero ran to seize him but joey dodged under him and ran away down the road for a few yards where he picked up a heavy stone for his defence and there remained prepared to defend himself and not lose his bundle if he could help it you get hold of him bill while i go round for the bundle said the man who had followed across the road and he immediately set off to find the gate or some entrance into the field while the other man made after joey our hero retreated at full speed the man followed but could not keep pace with our hero as the road was newly gravelled and he had no shoes joey perceiving this slackened his pace and when the man was close to him turned short round and aiming the stone with great precision hit him on the forehead and the fellow fell down senseless in the meantime the other miscreant had taken the road in the opposite direction to look for the gate and joey now rid of his assailant perceived that in the hedge opposite to the part of the road where he now stood there was a gap which he could get through he scrambled into the field and ran for his bundle the other man who had been delayed the gate being locked and fenced with thorns had but just gained the field when joey had his bundle in his possession our hero caught it up and ran like lightning to the gap tossed over his bundle and followed it while the man was still a hundred yards from him once more in the high road joey took to his heels and having run about two hundred yards he looked back to ascertain if he was pursued and perceived the man standing over his comrade who was lying where he had fallen satisfied that he was now safe joey pursued his journey at a less rapid rate although he continued to look back every minute just by way of precaution but the fellows although they would not lose an opportunity of what appeared such an easy robbery had their own reasons for continuing their journey and getting away from that part of the country our hero pursued his way for two miles looking out for some water by the wayside to quench his thirst when he observed in the distance that there was something lying on the roadside as he came nearer he made it out to be a man prostrate on the grass apparently asleep and a few yards from where the man lay was a knife grinder's wheel and a few other articles in the use of a travelling tinker a fire nearly extinct was throwing up a tiny column of smoke and a saucepan which appeared to have been upset was lying beside it there was something in the scene before him which created a suspicion in the mind of our hero that all was not right so instead of passing on he walked right up to where the man lay and soon discovered that his face and dress were bloody joey knelt down by the side of him and found that he was senseless but breathing heavily joey untied the handkerchief which was round his neck and which was apparently very tight and almost immediately afterwards the man appeared relieved and opened his eyes after a little time he contrived to utter one word water and joey taking up the empty saucepan proceeded in search of it he soon found some and brought it back the tinker had greatly recovered during his absence and as soon as he had drunk the water sat upright don't leave me boy said the tinker i feel very faint i will stay by you as long as i can be of any use to you replied joey what has happened robbed and almost murdered replied the man with a groan was it by those two rascals without shoes and stockings who attempted to rob me inquired joey yes the same i've no doubt i must lie down for a time my head is so bad replied the man dropping back upon the grass in a few minutes the exhausted man fell asleep and joey remained sitting by his side for nearly two hours at last his new companion awoke raised himself up and dipping his handkerchief into the saucepan of water washed the blood from his head and face this might have been worse my little fellow said he to joey after he had wiped his face one of those rascals nearly throttled me he pulled my handkerchief so tight well this is a wicked world this to take away a fellow creature's life for thirteenpence halfpenny for that was all the money they found in my pocket i thought an itinerant tinker was safe from highway robbery at all events did you not say that they attacked you or did i dream it i did say so it was no dream and how did a little midge like you escape joey gave the tinker a detail of what had occurred cleverly done boy and kindly done now to come to my help and to remain by me i was going down the road and as you have come down i presume we are going the same way replied the tinker do you feel strong enough to walk now yes i think i can but there's the grindstone oh i'll wheel that for you do that's a good boy for i tremble very much and it would be too heavy for me now joey fixed his bundle with the saucepan etcetera upon the knife grinder's wheel and rolled it along the road followed by the tinker until they came to a small hamlet about two miles from the spot from which they had started they halted when they were fifty yards from the first cottage and the tinker having selected a dry place under the hedge said i must stop here a little while joey who had heard the tinker say that the men had robbed him of thirteenpence halfpenny imagined that he was destitute and as he wished to proceed on his way he took out two shillings and held them out to the man saying this will keep you till you can earn some more good bye now i must go on the tinker looked at joey you're a kind hearted lad at all events and a clever bold one if i mistake not said he put up your money nevertheless for i do not want any i have plenty if they had only known where to look for it joey was examining his new companion during the time that he was speaking to him there was a free and independent bearing about the man and a refinement of manner and speech very different from what might be expected from one in so humble a situation the tinker perceived this scrutiny and after meeting our hero's glance said well what are you thinking of now i was thinking that you have not always been a tinker and i fancy that you have not always been a sailor my young master but however oblige me by going into the village and getting some breakfast for us i will pay you the money when you return and then we can talk a little joey went into the village and finding a small chandler's shop bought some bread and cheese and a large mug which held a quart of beer both of which he also purchased and then went back to the tinker as soon as they had made their breakfast joey rose up and said i must go on now i hope you'll find yourself better to morrow are you in a very great hurry my lad inquired the tinker i want to find some employment replied joey and therefore i must look for it tell me what employment you want what can you do i don't exactly know i have been keeping accounts for a person then you are a scholar and not a seafaring person i am not a sailor if you mean that but i have been on the river well if you wish to get employment as i know this country well and a great many people i think i may help you at all events a few days can make no difference for you see my boy to morrow i shall be able to work and then i'll answer for it i'll find meat and drink for both of us so what do you say suppose you stay with me and we'll travel together for a few days and when i have found work that will suit you then we can part i will if you wish it replied joey then that's agreed said the tinker i should like to do you a good turn before we part and i hope i shall be able at all events if you stay with me a little while i will teach you a trade which will serve you when all others fail what to mend kettles and to grind knives exactly and depend upon it if you would be sure of gaining your livelihood you will choose a profession which will not depend upon the caprice of others or upon patronage kettles my boy will wear out knives will get blunt and therefore for a good trade give me kettles to mend knives to grind' i've tried many trades and there is none that suits me so well and now that we've had our breakfast we may just as well look out for lodgings for the night for i suppose you would not like the heavens for your canopy which i very often prefer now put yourself to the wheel and i'll try my old quarters the knife grinder walked into the village followed by joey who rolled the wheel until they stopped at a cottage where he was immediately recognised and welcomed joey was ordered to put the wheel under a shed and then followed the tinker into the cottage the latter told his story which created a good deal of surprise and indignation and then complained of his head and retired to lie down while joey amused himself with the children they ate and slept there that night the people refusing to take anything for their reception the next day the tinker was quite recovered and having mended a kettle and ground three or four knives for his hostess he set off again followed by joey who rolled the wheel chapter twenty eight on the science of tinkering and the art of writing despatches they had proceeded about two miles when the tinker said come my lad let us sit down now and rest ourselves a bit for it is past noon and you must be tired with shoving that wheel along i would have taken it from you before this but the fact is i'm rather stiff yet about the head and shoulders i feel it more than i thought i should here's a nice spot i like to sit down under a tree not too well covered with leaves like this ash i like to see the sunshine playing here and there upon the green grass shifting its spots as the leaves are rustled by the wind now let us lie down here and not care a fig for the world i am a philosopher do you know that i don't exactly know what it means a very clever good man is it not well not exactly a man may be a philosopher without being very good or without being very clever a philosopher is a man who never frets about anything cares about nothing is contented with a little and doesn't envy any one who appears better off than himself at least that is my school of philosophy you stare boy to hear a tinker talk in this way i perceive that but you must know that i am a tinker by choice and i have tried many other professions before all of which have disgusted me what other professions have you been i have been let me see i almost forget but i'll begin at the beginning my father was a gentleman and until i was fourteen years old i was a gentleman or the son of one then he died and that profession was over for he left nothing my mother married again and left me she left me at school and the master kept me there for a year in hopes of being paid but hearing nothing of my mother and not knowing what to do with me he at last for he was a kind man installed me as under usher of the school for you see my education had been good and i was well qualified for the situation as far as capability went it was rather a bathos though to sink from a gentleman's son to an under usher but i was not a philosopher at that time i handed the toast to the master and mistress the head ushers and parlour boarders but was not allowed any myself i taught latin and greek and english grammar to the little boys who made faces at me and put crooked pins on the bottom of my chair i walked at the head of the string when they went out for an airing and walked upstairs the last when it was time to go to bed i had all the drudgery and none of the comforts i was up first and held answerable for all deficiencies i had to examine all their nasty little trowsers and hold weekly conversation with the botcher as to the possibility of repairs to run out if a hen cackled that the boys should not get the egg to wipe the noses of my mistress's children and carry them if they roared to pay for all broken glass if i could not discover the culprit to account for all bad smells for all noise and for all ink spilled to make all the pens and to keep one hundred boys silent and attentive at church for all which with deductions i received pounds a year and found my own washing i stayed two years during which time i contrived to save about pounds and with that one fine morning i set off on my travels fully satisfied that come what would i could not change for the worse then you were about in the position that i'm in now said joey laughing yes thereabouts only a little older i should imagine i set off with good hopes but soon found that nobody wanted educated people they were a complete drug at last i obtained a situation as waiter at a posting house on the road where i ran along all day long to the tinkling of bells with hot brandy and water ever under my nose i answered all the bells but the head waiter took all the money however i made acquaintances there and at last obtained a situation as clerk to a corn chandler where i kept the books but he failed and then i was handed over to the miller and covered with flour for the whole time i was in his service i stayed there till i had an offer from a coal merchant that was going from white to black but however it was a better place then by mere chance i obtained the situation of clerk on board of a fourteen gun brig and cruised in the channel for six months but as i found that there was no chance of being a purser and as i hated the confinement and discipline of a man of war i cut and run as soon as i obtained my pay then i was shopman at a draper's which was abominable for if the customers would not buy the goods i got all the blame besides i had to clean my master's boots and my mistress's shoes and dine in the kitchen on scraps with a slipshod squinting girl who made love to me then i was a warehouseman but they soon tacked on to it the office of light porter and i had to carry weights enough to break my back at last i obtained a situation as foreman in a tinman and cutler's shop and by being constantly sent into the workshop i learnt something of the trade i had made up my mind not to remain much longer and i paid attention receiving now and then a lesson from the workmen till i found that i could do very well for you see it's a very simple sort of business after all but still a travelling tinker is not so respectable as being in any of the situations you were in before replied joey there i must beg your pardon my good lad i had often serious thoughts upon the subject and i argued as follows what is the best profession in this world of ours that of a gentleman for a gentleman does not work he has liberty to go where he pleases he is not controlled and is his own master many a man considers himself a gentleman who has not the indispensables that must complete the profession a clerk in the treasury or public offices considers himself a gentleman and so he is by birth but not by profession for he is not his own master but is as much tied down to his desk as the clerk in a banker's counting house or in a shop a gentleman by profession must be his own master and independent and how few there are in this world who can say so soldiers and sailors are obliged to obey orders and therefore i do not put them down as perfect gentlemen according to my ideas of what a gentleman should be i doubt whether the prime minister can be considered a gentleman until after he is turned out of office do you understand me boy o yes i understand what you mean by a gentleman i recollect reading a story of a negro who came to this country and who said that the pig was the only gentleman in the country for he was the only living being who did not work the negro was not far wrong resumed the tinker well after thinking a long while i came to the decision that as i could not be a perfect gentleman i would be the nearest thing to it that was possible and i considered that the most enviable situation was that of a travelling tinker i learned enough of the trade saved money to purchase a knife grinder's wheel and here i have been in this capacity for nearly ten years and do you hold to the opinion that you formed i do for look you work i must therefore the only question was to take up the work that was lightest and paid best i know no trade where you can gain so much with so little capital and so little labour then i am not controlled by any living being i have my liberty and independence i go where i please stop where i please work when i please and idle when i please and never know what it is to want a night's lodging show me any other profession which can say the same i might be better clothed i might be considered more respectable but i am a philosopher and despise all that i earn as much as i want and do very little work for it i can grind knives and scissors and mend kettles enough in one day to provide for a whole week for instance i can grind a knife in two minutes for which i receive twopence now allowing that i work twelve hours in the day at the rate of one penny per minute i should earn pounds per day which deducting sundays is pounds a year put that against pounds a year as a drudge to a school or confined to a desk in a shop or any other profession and you see how lucrative mine is in proportion then i am under no control not ordered here or there like a general or admiral not attacked in the house of commons or lords like a prime minister on the contrary half a day's work out of the seven is all i require and i therefore assert that my profession is nearer to that of a gentleman than any other that i know of it may be as you style it but you don't look much like one replied joey laughing that's prejudice my clothes keep me as warm as if they were of the best materials and quite new i enjoy my victuals quite as much as a well dressed gentleman does perhaps more i can indulge in my own thoughts i have leisure to read all my favourite authors and can afford to purchase new books besides as i must work a little it is pleasant to feel that i am always in request and respected by those who employ me respected on what account because i am always wanted and therefore always welcome it is the little things of this life which annoy not the great and a kettle that won't hold water or a knife that won't cut are always objects of execration and as people heap their anathemas upon the kettle and the knife so do they long for my return and when i come they are glad to see me glad to pay me and glad to find that their knives are sharp and their kettles thrown on one side are useful again at a trifling charge i add to people's comforts i become necessary to every poor person in the cottages and therefore they like me and respect me and indeed if it is only considered how many oaths and execrations are used when a person is hacking and sawing away with a knife which will not cut and how by my wheel i do away with the cause of crime i think that a travelling tinker may be considered as to his moral influence upon society more important than any parson in his pulpit you observe that i have not rendered the profession degrading by marriage as many do how do you mean i hold that whatever may be the means of a gentleman he must be considered to lose the most precious advantages appertaining to his profession when he marries for he loses his liberty and can no longer be said to be under no control it is very well for other professions to marry as the world must be peopled but a gentleman never should it is true he may contrive to leave his clog at home but then he pays dear for a useless and galling appendage but in my situation as a travelling tinker i could not have done so i must have dragged my clog after me through the mud and mire and have had a very different reception than what i have at present why so why a man may stroll about the country by himself find lodging and entertainment for himself but not so if he had a wife in rags and two or three dirty children at his heels a single man in every stage of society if he pays his own way more easily finds admission than a married one that is because the women regulate it and although they will receive him as a tinker they invariably object to his wife who is considered and stigmatised as the tinker's trull no that would not do a wife would detract from my respectability and add very much to my cares but have you no home then anywhere why yes i have like all single men on the pave as the french say just a sort of chambers' to keep my property in which will accumulate in spite of me where are they in dudstone to which place i am now going i have a room for six pounds a year and the woman in the house takes charge of everything during my absence and now my boy what is your name joey atherton replied our hero who had made up his mind to take the surname of his adopted sister nancy well joey do you agree with me that my profession is a good one and are you willing to learn it if so i will teach you i shall be very glad to learn it because it may one day be useful but i am not sure that i should like to follow it you will probably change your opinion at all events give it a fair trial in a month or so you will have the theory of it by heart and then we will come to the practice how do you mean it's of no use your attempting anything till you're well grounded in the theory of the art which you will gain by using your eyes all you have to do at first is to look on watch me when i grind a knife or a pair of scissors be attentive when you see me soldering a pot or putting a patch upon a kettle see how i turn my hand when i'm grinding how i beat out the iron when i mend and learn how to heat the tools when i solder in a month you will know how things are to be done in theory and after that we shall come to the practice one only thing in the way of practice must you enter upon at once and that is turning the wheel with your foot for you must learn to do it so mechanically that you are not aware that you are doing it otherwise you cannot devote your whole attention to the scissors or knife in your hand and do you really like your present life then wandering about from place to place to be sure i do i am my own master go where i like stop where i like pay no taxes or rates i still retain all the gentleman except the dress which i can resume when i please besides mine is a philanthropic profession i go about doing good and i've the means of resenting an affront like a despot as how why you see we travellers never interfere in each other's beats mine is a circuit of many miles of country and at the rate i travel it is somewhat about three months until i am at the same place again they must wait for me if they want their jobs done for they cannot get any one else in one village they played me a trick one saturday night when all the men were at the ale house and the consequence was i cut the village for a year and there never was such a village full of old kettles and blunt knives in consequence however they sent me a deputation hoping i would forget what had passed and i pardoned them what is your name inquired joey augustus spikeman my father was augustus spikeman esquire i was master augustus spikeman and now i'm spikeman the tinker so now we'll go on again i have nearly come to the end of my beat in two days we shall be at dudstone where i have my room and where we shall probably remain for some days before we start again in the afternoon they arrived at a small hamlet where they supped and slept spikeman was very busy till noon grinding and repairing they then continued their journey and on the second day having waited outside the town till it was dusk spikeman left his wheel in the charge of the landlord of a small ale house to whom he appeared well known then walked with joey to the house in which he had a room and led him upstairs to his apartments when our hero entered the chamber of spikeman he was very much surprised to find it was spacious light and airy and very clean a large bed was in one corner a sofa mahogany table chest of drawers and chairs composed the furniture there was a good sized looking glass over the chimney piece and several shelves of books round the room desiring joey to sit down and take a book spikeman rang for water shaved off his beard which had grown nearly half an inch long washed himself and then put on clean linen and a very neat suit of clothes when he was completely dressed joey could hardly believe that it was the same person upon joey expressing his astonishment spikeman replied you see my lad there is no one in this town who knows what my real profession is i always go out and return at dusk and the travelling tinker is not recognised not that i care for it so much only other people do and i respect their prejudices they know that i am in the ironmongery line and that is all so i always make it a rule to enjoy myself after my circuit and live like a gentleman till part of my money is gone and then i set out again i am acquainted with a good many highly respectable people in this town and that is the reason why i said i could be of service to you have you any better clothes yes much better then dress yourself in them and keep those you wear for our travels joey did as he was requested and spikeman then proposed that they should make a call at a friend's where he would introduce our hero as his nephew they set off and soon came to the front of a neat looking house at the door of which spikeman rapped the door was opened by one of the daughters of the house who on seeing him cried out dear me mr spikeman is this you why where have you been all this while about the country for orders miss amelia replied spikeman business must be attended to well come in mother will be glad to see you replied the girl at the same time opening the door of the sitting room for them to enter mr spikeman as i live exclaimed another girl jumping up and seizing his hand well mr spikeman it's an age since we have seen you said the mother so now sit down and tell us all the news and ophelia my love get tea ready and who is it you have with you mr spikeman my little nephew madam he is about to enter into the mysteries of the cutlery trade indeed well i suppose as you are looking out for a successor you soon intend to retire from business and take a wife mr spikeman why i suppose it will be my fate one of these days replied spikeman but that's an affair that requires some consideration very true mr spikeman it is a serious affair replied the old lady and i can assure you that neither my ophelia nor amelia should marry a man with my consent without i was convinced the gentleman considered it a very serious affair it makes or mars a man as the saying is well miss ophelia have you read all the books i lent you the last time i was here yes that they have both of them replied the old lady they are so fond of poetry but we've often wished that you were here to read to us replied miss amelia you do read so beautifully will you read to us after tea certainly with much pleasure miss ophelia now entered with the tea tray she and her sister then went into the kitchen to make some toast and to see to the kettle boiling while mr spikeman continued in conversation with the mother mrs james was the widow of a draper in the town who had at his death left her sufficient to live quietly and respectably with her daughters who were both very good amiable girls and it must be acknowledged neither of them unwilling to listen to the addresses of mr spikeman had he been so inclined but they began to think that mr spikeman was not a marrying man which as the reader must know by this time was the fact the evening passed very pleasantly mr spikeman took a volume of poetry and as miss ophelia had said he did read very beautifully so much so that joey was in admiration for he had never yet known the power produced by good reading at ten o'clock they took their leave and returned to spikeman's domicile as soon as they were upstairs and candles lighted spikeman sat down on the sofa you see joey said he that it is necessary not to mention the knife grinder's wheel as it would make a difference in my reception all gentlemen do not gain their livelihood as honestly as i do but still prejudices are not to be overcome you did me a kind act and i wished to return it i could not do so without letting you into this little secret but i have seen enough of you to think you can be trusted i should hope so replied joey i have learnt caution young as i am that i have perceived already and therefore i have said enough on the subject i have but one bed and you must sleep with me as you did on our travels the next morning the old woman of the house brought up their breakfast spikeman lived in a very comfortable way very different to what he did as a travelling tinker and he really appeared to joey to be with the exception of his conversation which was always superior a very different person from what he was when joey first fell in with him for many days they remained at dudstone visiting the different houses and were always well received you appear so well known and so well liked in this town observed joey i wonder you do not set up a business particularly as you say you have money in the bank if i did joey i should no longer be happy no longer be my own master and do as i please in fact i should no longer be the gentleman that is the gentleman by profession as near as i can be one the man who has his liberty and enjoys it no no boy i have tried almost everything and have come to my own conclusions have you been reading the book i gave you yes i have nearly finished it i am glad to see that you like reading nothing so much improves or enlarges the mind you must never let a day pass without reading two or three hours and when we travel again and are alone by the way side we will read together i will choose some books on purpose i should like very much to write to my sister mary said joey do so and tell her that you have employment but do not say exactly how there are pens and paper in the drawer stop i will find them for you spikeman went to the drawer and when taking out the pens and paper laid hold of some manuscript writing by the bye said he laughing i told you joey that i had been a captain's clerk on board the weasel a fourteen gun brig i wrote the captain's despatches for him and here are two of them of which i kept copies that i might laugh over them occasionally i wrote all his letters for he was no great penman in the first place and had a very great confusion of ideas in the second he certainly was indebted to me as you will acknowledge when you hear what i read and tell you i served under him cruising in the channel and i flatter myself that it was entirely through my writings that he got his promotion he is now captain alcibiades ajax boggs and all through me we were cruising off the coast of france close in to ushant where we perceived a fleet of small vessels called chasse marees coasting luggers laden with wine coming round and as we did not know of any batteries thereabouts we ran in to attempt a capture we cut off three of them but just as we had compelled them by firing broadsides into them to lower their sails a battery which our commander did not know anything of opened fire upon us and before we could get out of range which we did as soon as we could one shot came in on deck and cut the top sail halyard's fall at the very time that the men were hoisting the sail for we had been shaking another reef out and the rope being divided as the men were hauling upon it of course they all tumbled on the deck one over another the other shot struck our foremast and chipped off a large slice besides cutting away one of the shrouds and the signal halyards now you do not know enough about ships to understand that there was very little harm done or that the coasting vessels were very small with only three or four men on board of each of them it therefore required some little management to make a flaming despatch but i did it only listen now i have begun in the true nelson style to the secretary of the admiralty sir it has pleased the great disposer to grant a decided victory to his majesty's arms through the efforts of the vessel which i have the honour to command on the rd day of august last ushant then bearing south west three quarters west wind west distant from three to four leagues perceived an enemy's fleet of three masted vessels rounding the point with the hopes i presume of gaining the port of cherbourg convinced that i should have every support from the gallant officers and true british tars under my command i immediately bore down to the attack the movements of the enemy fully proved that they were astounded at the boldness of the manoeuvre and instead of keeping their line they soon separated and sheered off in different directions so as to receive the support of their batteries' you see joey i have said three masted vessels which implies ships although as in this case they were only small coasting luggers in half an hour we were sufficiently close to the main body to open our fire and broadside after broadside were poured in answered by the batteries on the coast with unerring aim notwithstanding the unequal contest i have the pleasure of informing you that in less than half an hour we succeeded in capturing three of the vessels named as per margin and finding nothing more could be done for the honour of his majesty's arms as soon we could take possession i considered it my duty to haul off from the incessant and galling fire of the batteries in this well fought and successful contest i trust that the british flag has not been tarnished what the enemy's loss may have been it is impossible to say they acknowledge themselves however that it has been severe' but did the enemy lose any men demanded joey not one but you observe i do not say loss of life although the admiralty may think i refer to it that's not my fault but i was perfectly correct in saying the enemy's loss was great for the poor devils who were in the chasse marees when they were brought on board wrung their hands and said that they had lost their all now what loss can be greater than all his majesty's vessel is much injured in her spars and rigging from the precision of the enemy's fire her lower rigging running rigging being cut away her foremast severely wounded and i regret to add severely injured in the hull but such was the activity of the officers and men that with the exception of the foremast which will require the services of the dockyard in twenty four hours we were ready to resume the contest i am happy to say that although we have many men hurt we have none killed and i trust that under the care of the surgeon they will most of them be soon able to resume their duty' but you had no men wounded interrupted joey none wounded i don't say wounded i only say hurt didn't a dozen of the men who were hoisting the main topsail when the fall was cut away all tumble backwards on the deck and do you think they were not hurt by the fall of course they were besides one man nearly had his finger jammed off and another burnt his hand by putting too much powder to the touch hole of his carronade so i continue it now becomes my duty to point out to their lordships the very meritorious conduct of mr john smith an old and deserving officer mr james hammond mr cross and mr byfleet indeed i may say that all the officers under my command vied in their exertions for the honour of the british flag' you see the commander had quarrelled with some of his officers at that time and would not mention them i tried all i could to persuade him but he was obstinate i have the honour to return a list of casualties and the names of the vessels taken and have the honour to be sir your obedient servant alcibiades ajax boggs report of killed and wounded on board of his majesty's brig weasel in the action of the rd of august killed none wounds and contusions john potts william smith thomas snaggs william walker and peter potter able seamen john hobbs timothy stout and walter pye marines return of vessels captured in the action of the rd of august by his majesty's brig weasel notre dame de misericorde de rochelle la vengeur de bourdeaux l'etoile du matin de charent signed alcibiades ajax boggs commander' well i'm sure if you had not told me otherwise i should have thought it had been a very hard fight that's what they did at the admiralty and just what we wanted but now i come to my other despatch which obtained the rank for my captain and upon which i plume myself not a little you must know that when cruising in the channel in a thick fog and not keeping a very sharp look out we ran foul of a french privateer it was about nine o'clock in the evening and we had very few hands on deck and those on deck were most of them if not all asleep we came bang against one another and carried away both spars and yards and the privateer who was by far the most alert after the accident happened cut away a good deal of our rigging and got clear of us before our men could be got up from below had they been on the look out they might have boarded us to a certainty for all was confusion and amazement but they cleared themselves and got off before our men could get up and run to their guns she was out of sight immediately from the thickness of the fog however we fired several broadsides in the direction we supposed she might be and there was an end to the matter altogether as you perceive it was not a very creditable affair why no replied joey i don't see how you could make much out of that well if you can't see now you shall hear to the secretary of the admiralty sir i have the honour to acquaint you that on the night of the th of november cruising in the channel with the wind from south east and foggy a large vessel hove in sight on our weather bow' you see i didn't say we perceived a vessel for that would not have been correct as she evidently did not perceive us we continued our course towards her the men were summoned to their quarters and in a very short time were ready to uphold the honour of the english flag the first collision between the two vessels was dreadful but she contrived to disengage herself and we were therefore prevented carrying her by boarding after repeated broadsides to which in her disabled and confused state she could make no return she gradually increased her distance still she had remained in our hands a proud trophy i say still she had been a proud trophy had not the unequal collision' it was a very unequal collision for she was a much smaller vessel than we were carried away our foreyard cat head fore top gallant mast jibboom and dolphin striker and rendered us from the state of our rigging a mere wreck favoured by the thick fog and darkness of the night i regret that after all our efforts she contrived to escape and the spoils of victory were wrested from us after all our strenuous exertions in our country's cause when all performed their duty in so exemplary a manner it would be unfair and indeed invidious to particularise still i cannot refrain from mentioning the good conduct of mr smith my first lieutenant mr bowles my second lieutenant mr chabb my worthy master mr jones and mr james master's mates messrs hall small ball and pall midshipmen and messrs sweet and sharp volunteers i also received every assistance from mr grulf the purser who offered his services and i cannot omit the conduct of mr spikeman clerk i am also highly indebted to the attention and care shown by mr thorn surgeon who is so well supported in his duties by mr green assistant surgeon of this ship the activity of mr bruce the boatswain was deserving of the highest encomiums and it would be an act of injustice not to notice the zeal of mr bile the carpenter and mr sponge gunner of the ship james anderson quarter master received a severe contusion but is now doing well i trust i shall not be considered presumptuous in recommending him to a boatswain's warrant i am happy to say that our casualties owing to the extreme panic of the enemy are very few i have the honour to be sir your very obedient and humble servant alcibiades ajax boggs wounded very severely james anderson quarter master contusions john peters able seaman james morrison marine thomas snowball captain's cook' there now that i consider a very capital letter no frenchman not even an american could have made out a better case the admiralty were satisfied that something very gallant had been done although the fog made it appear not quite so clear as it might have been and the consequence was that my commander received his promotion there now write your letter and tell your sister that she must answer it as soon as possible as you are going out with me for orders in three or four days and shall be absent for three months joey wrote a long letter to mary he stated the adventure with the two scoundrels who would have robbed him his afterwards falling in with a gentleman who dealt in cutlery and his being taken into his service and as spikeman had told him requested her to answer directly as he was about to set off on a circuit with his master which would occasion his absence for three months mary's reply came before joey's departure she stated that she was comfortable and happy that her mistress was very kind to her but that she felt that the work was rather too much however she would do her duty to her employers there was much good advice to joey much affectionate feeling occasional recurrence to past scenes and thankfulness that she was no longer a disgrace to her parents and her sex it was a humble grateful contrite and affectionate effusion which did honour to poor mary and proved that she was sincere in her assertions of continuing in the right path and dotingly attached to our hero joey read it over and over again and shed tears of pleasure as he recalled the scenes which had passed poor joey had lost his father and mother as he supposed for ever and it was soothing to the boy's feelings to know that there were some people in the world who loved him and he remained for hours thinking of mary mrs chopper and his good and kind friends the mcshanes two days after the receipt of mary's letter spikeman and joey went to the houses of their various acquaintances and bade them adieu announcing their intention to set off on the circuit spikeman paid up everything and put away many articles in his room which had been taken out for use joey and he then put on their travelling garments and waiting till it was dusk locked the chambers and set off to the little public house where the knife grinder's wheel had been deposited spikeman had taken the precaution to smudge and dirty his face and joey at his request had done the same when they entered the public house the landlord greeted spikeman warmly and asked him what he had been about spikeman replied that as usual he had been to see his old mother and now he must roll his grindstone a bit after drinking a pot of beer at the kitchen fire they retired to bed and the next morning at daylight they once more proceeded on their travels chapter twenty nine in which the tinker falls in love with a lady of high degree for many months spikeman and our hero travelled together during which time joey had learnt to grind a knife or a pair of scissors as well as spikeman himself and took most of the work off his hands they suited each other and passed their time most pleasantly indulging themselves every day with a few hours' repose and reading on the wayside one afternoon when it was very sultry they had stopped and ensconced themselves in a shady copse by the side of the road not far from an old mansion which stood on an eminence when spikeman said joey i think we are intruding here and if so may be forcibly expelled which will not be pleasant so roll the wheel in out of sight and then we may indulge in a siesta which during this heat will be very agreeable what's a siesta said joey a siesta is a nap in the middle of the day universally resorted to by the spaniards italians and indeed by all the inhabitants of hot climates with respectable people it is called a siesta but with a travelling tinker it must be i suppose called a snooze well then a snooze let it be said joey taking his seat on the turf by spikeman in a reclining position they had not yet composed themselves to sleep when they heard a female voice singing at a little distance the voice evidently proceeded from the pleasure grounds which were between them and the mansion hush said spikeman putting up his finger as he raised himself on his elbow the party evidently advanced nearer to them and carolled in very beautiful tones the song of ariel where the bee sucks there lurk i in the cowslip's bell i lie etcetera heigho exclaimed a soft voice after the song had been finished i wish i could creep into a cowslip bell miss araminta you are not coming down the walk yet it appears you are in no hurry so i'll begin my new book after this soliloquy there was silence spikeman made a sign to joey to remain still and then creeping on his hands and knees by degrees arrived as far as he could venture to the other side of the copse in a minute or two another footstep was heard coming down the gravel walk and soon afterwards another voice well melissa did you think i never would come i could not help it uncle would have me rub his foot a little ay there's the rub replied the first young lady well it was a sacrifice of friendship at the altar of humanity poor papa i wish i could rub his foot for him but i always do it to a quadrille tune and he always says i rub it too hard i only follow the music yes and so does he for you sometimes set him a dancing you giddy girl i am not fit for a nurse and that's the fact araminta i can feel for him but i cannot sit still a minute that you know poor mamma was a great loss and when she died i don't know what i should have done if it hadn't been for my dear cousin araminta nay you are very useful in your way for you play and sing to him and that soothes him yes i do it with pleasure for i can do but little else but araminta my singing is that of the caged bird i must sing where they hang my cage oh how i wish i had been a man i believe that there never was a woman yet who has not at one time of her life said the same thing however mild and quiet she may have been in disposition but as we cannot why why the next thing is to wish to be a man's wife araminta is it not it is natural i suppose to wish so replied araminta but i seldom think about it i must first see the man i can love before i think about marrying and now tell me araminta what kind of a man do you think you could fancy i should like him to be steady generous brave and handsome of unexceptionable family with plenty of money that's all oh that's all i admire your that's all' you are not very likely to meet with your match i'm afraid if he's steady he is not very likely to be very generous and if to those two qualifications you tack on birth wealth beauty and bravery i think your that's all' is very misplaced now i have other ideas pray let me have them melissa i do not want my husband to be very handsome but i wish him to be full of fire and energy a man that in fact a man that could keep me in tolerable order i do not care about his having money as i have plenty in my own possession to bestow on any man i love but he must be of good education very fond of reading romantic not a little and his extraction must be however poor respectable that is his parents must not have been tradespeople you know i prefer riding a spirited horse to a quiet one and if i were to marry i should like a husband who would give me some trouble to manage i think i would master him so have many thought before you melissa but they have been mistaken yes because they have attempted it by meekness and submission thinking to disarm by that method it never will do any more than getting into a passion when a man gives up his liberty he does make a great sacrifice that i'm sure of and a woman should prevent him feeling that he is chained to her and how would you manage that said araminta by being infinite in my variety always cheerful and instead of permitting him to stay at home pinned to my apron string order him out away from me join his amusements and always have people in the house that he liked so as to avoid being too much tete a tete the caged bird ever wants to escape open the doors and let him take a flight and he will come back of his own accord of course i am supposing my gentleman to be naturally good hearted and good tempered sooner than marry what you call a steady sober man i'd run away with a captain of a privateer and one thing more araminta i never would passionately distractedly fond as i might be acknowledge to my husband the extent of my devotion and affection for him i would always have him to suppose that i could still love him better than what i yet did in short that there was more to be gained for depend upon it when a man is assured that he has nothing more to gain his attentions are over you can't expect a man to chase nothing you know you are a wild girl melissa i only hope you will marry well i hope i shall but i can tell you this that if i do make a mistake at all events my husband will find that he has made a mistake also there's a little lurking devil in me which if roused up by bad treatment would i expect make me more than a match for him i'm almost sorry that i've so much money of my own for i suspect every man who says anything pretty to me and there are but few in this world who would scorn to marry for money i believe so melissa but your person would be quite sufficient without fortune thanks coz for a woman that's very handsome of you and so now we will begin our new book miss melissa now commenced reading and spikeman who had not yet seen the faces of the two young ladies crept softly nearer to the side of the copse so as to enable him to satisfy his curiosity in this position he remained nearly an hour when the book was closed and the young ladies returned to the house melissa again singing as she went joey said spikeman i did not think that there was such a woman in existence as that girl she is just the idea that i have formed of what a woman ought to be i must find out who she is i am in love with her and mean to make her a tinker's bride replied joey laughing joey i shall certainly knock you down if you apply that term to her come let us go to the village it is close at hand as soon as they arrived at the village spikeman went into the alehouse during the remainder of the day he was in a brown study and joey amused himself with a book at nine o'clock the company had all quitted the tap room and then spikeman entered into conversation with the hostess in the course of conversation she informed him that the mansion belonged to squire mathews who had formerly been a great manufacturer and who had purchased the place that the old gentleman had long suffered from the gout and saw no company which was very bad for the village that miss melissa was his daughter and he had a son who was with his regiment in india and it was said not on very good terms with his father that the old gentleman was violent and choleric because he was always in pain but that every one spoke well of miss melissa and miss araminta her cousin who were both very kind to the poor people having obtained these particulars spikeman went to bed he slept little that night as joey who was his bedfellow could vouch for for he allowed joey no sleep either turning and twisting round in the bed every two minutes the next morning they arose early and proceeded on their way joey said spikeman after an hour's silence i was thinking a great deal last night so i suppose for you certainly were not sleeping no i could not sleep the fact is joey i am determined to have that girl miss mathews if i can a bold attempt for a tinker you will say but not for a gentleman born as i was i thought i never should care for a woman but there is a current in the affairs of men i shall now drift with the current and if it leads to fortune so much the better if not he who dares greatly does greatly i feel convinced that i should make her a good husband and it shall not be my fault if i do not gain her do you mean to propose in form with your foot on your wheel no saucebox i don't but i mean to turn my knife grinder's wheel into a wheel of fortune and with your help i will do so you are sure of my help if you are serious replied joey but how you are to manage i cannot comprehend i have already made out a programme although the interweaving of the plot is not yet decided upon but i must get to the next town as fast as i can as i must make preparations on arrival they took up humble quarters as usual and then spikeman went to a stationer's and told them that he had got a commission to execute for a lady he bought sealing wax a glass seal with esperance as a motto gilt edged notepaper and several other requisites in the stationery line and ordered them to be packed up carefully that he might not soil them he then purchased scented soap a hair brush and other articles for the toilet and having obtained all these requisites he added to them one or two pair of common beaver gloves and then went to the barber's to get his hair cut i am all ready now joey said he when he returned to the alehouse and to morrow we retrace our steps what back to the village yes and where we shall remain some time perhaps on reaching the village next morning spikeman hired a bedroom and leaving joey to work the grindstone remained in his apartments when joey returned in the evening he found spikeman had been very busy with the soap and had restored his hands to something like their proper colour he had also shaved himself and washed his hair clean and brushed it well you see joey i have commenced operations already i shall soon be prepared to act the part of the gentleman who has turned tinker to gain the love of a fair lady of high degree i wish you success but what are your plans that you will find out to morrow morning now we must go to bed chapter thirty plotting reading and writing spikeman was up early the next morning when they had breakfasted he desired joey to go for the knife grinder's wheel and follow him as soon as they were clear of the village spikeman said it will not do to remain at the village there's a cottage half a mile down the road where they once gave me a lodging we must try if we can get it now when they arrived at the cottage spikeman made a very satisfactory bargain for board and lodging for a few days stating that they charged so much at the village alehouse that he could not afford to stay there and that he expected to have a good job at squire mathews's up at the mansion house as soon as this arrangement was completed they returned back to the copse near to the mansion house joey rolling the knife grinder's wheel you see joey said spikeman the first thing necessary will be to stimulate curiosity we may have to wait a day or two before the opportunity may occur but if necessary i will wait a month that miss mathews will very often be found on the seat by the copse either alone or with her cousin i take to be certain as all ladies have their favourite retreats i do not intend that they should see me yet i must make an impression first now leave the wheel on the outside and come with me do not speak as soon as they were in the copse spikeman reconnoitred very carefully to ascertain if either of the young ladies were on the bench and finding no one there he returned to joey they cannot come without our hearing their footsteps said spikeman so now we must wait here patiently spikeman threw himself down on the turf in front of the copse and joey followed his example come joey we may as well read a little to pass away the time i have brought two volumes of byron with me for half an hour they were thus occupied when they heard the voice of miss mathews singing as before as she came down the walk spikeman rose and peeped through the foliage she is alone said he which is just what i wished now joey i am going to read to you aloud spikeman then began to read in the masterly style which we have before referred to i loved and was beloved again they tell me sir you never knew those gentle frailties if 'tis true i shorten all my joys and pain to you 'twould seem absurd as vain but all now are not born to reign or o'er their passions or as you there o'er themselves and nations too i am or rather was a prince a chief of thousands and could lead them on when each would foremost bleed but would not o'er myself the like control but to resume i loved and was beloved again in sooth it is a happy doom but yet where happiness ends in pain' i am afraid that is but too true my dear boy said spikeman laying down the book shakespeare has most truly said the course of true love never did run smooth' nay he cannot be said to be original in that idea for horace and most of the greek and latin poets have said much the same thing before him however let us go on again we met in secret and the hour which led me to my lady's bower was fiery expectation's dower the days and nights were nothing all except the hour which doth recall in the long lapse from youth to age no other like itself' do you observe the extreme beauty of that passage said spikeman yes said joey it is very beautiful you would more feel the power of it my dear boy if you were in love but your time is not yet come but i am afraid we must leave off now for i expect letters of consequence by the post and it is useless i fear waiting here come put the book by and let us take up the wheel of my sad fortunes spikeman and joey rose on their feet joey went to the knife grinder's wheel and spikeman followed him without looking back he heard a rustling nevertheless among the bushes which announced to him that his manoeuvres had succeeded and as soon as he was about fifty yards from the road he took the wheel from joey desiring him to look back as if accidentally joey did so and saw miss mathews following them with her eyes that will do observed spikeman her curiosity is excited and that is all i wish what spikeman said was correct araminta joined miss mathews shortly after spikeman and joey had gone away my dear araminta said melissa such an adventure i can hardly credit my senses why what is the matter dear cousin do you see that man and boy with a knife grinder's wheel just in sight now yes to be sure i do but what of them have they been insolent insolent they never saw me they had no idea that i was here i heard voices as i came down the walk so i moved softly and when i gained the seat there was somebody reading poetry so beautifully i never heard any one read with such correct emphasis and clear pronunciation and then he stopped and talked to the boy about the greek and latin poets and quoted shakespeare there must be some mystery well but if there is what has that to do with the travelling tinkers what why it was the travelling tinker himself dearest but he cannot be a tinker for i heard him say that he expected letters of consequence and no travelling tinker could do that why no i doubt if most of them can read at all now i would give my little finger to know who that person is did you see his face no he never turned this way the boy did when they were some distance off it's very strange what was he reading i don't know it was very beautiful i wonder if he will ever come this way again if he does well melissa and if he does my scissors want grinding very badly they won't cut a bit why melissa you don't mean to fall in love with a tinker said araminta laughing he is no tinker i'm sure but why is he disguised i should like to know well but i came out to tell you that your father wants you come along the two young ladies then returned to the house but the mystery of the morning was broached more than once and canvassed in every possible way spikeman as soon as he had returned to the cottage took out his writing materials to concoct an epistle after some time in correcting he made out a fair copy which he read to joey i tremble lest at the first moment you cast your eyes over the page you throw it away without deigning to peruse it and yet there is nothing in it which could raise a blush on the cheek of a modest maiden if it be a crime to have seen you by chance to have watched you by stealth to consider hallowed every spot you visit nay more if it be a crime to worship at the shrine of beauty and of innocence or to speak more boldly to adore you then am i guilty you will ask why i resort to a clandestine step simply because when i discovered your name and birth i felt assured that an ancient feud between the two families to which nor you nor i were parties would bar an introduction to your father's house you would ask me who i am a gentleman i trust by birth and education a poor one i grant and you have made me poorer for you have robbed me of more than wealth my peace of mind and my happiness i feel that i am presumptuous and bold but forgive me your eyes tell me you are too kind too good to give unnecessary pain and if you knew how much i have already suffered you would not oppress further a man who was happy until he saw you pardon me therefore my boldness and excuse the means i have taken of placing this communication before you' that will do i think said spikeman and now joey we will go out and take a walk and i will give you your directions chapter thirty one in which the plot thickens the next day our hero having received the letter with his instructions went with the wheel down to the copse near to the mansion house here he remained quietly until he heard miss melissa coming down the gravel walk he waited till she had time to gain her seat and then leaving his wheel outside he walked round the copse until he came to her she raised her eyes from her book when she saw him if you please miss have you any scissors or knives for me to grind said joey bowing with his hat in his hand miss mathews looked earnestly at joey who are you said she at last are you the boy who was on this road with a knife grinder and his wheel yesterday afternoon yes madam we came this way replied joey bowing again very politely is he your father no madam he is my uncle he is not married your uncle well i have a pair of scissors to grind and i will go for them you may bring your wheel in here as i wish to see how you grind certainly miss with the greatest pleasure joey brought in his wheel and observing that miss mathews had left her book on the seat he opened it at the marked page and slipped the letter in and scarcely had done so when he perceived miss mathews and her cousin coming towards him here are the scissors mind you make them cut well i will do my best miss replied joey who immediately set to work have you been long at this trade said miss mathews no miss not very long and your uncle has he been long at it joey hesitated on purpose why i really don't know exactly how long why is your uncle not with you he was obliged to go to town miss that is to a town at some distance from here on business why what business can a tinker have inquired araminta i suppose he wanted some soft solder miss he requires a great deal can you read and write boy inquired melissa me miss how should i know how to write and read replied joey looking up have you been much about here yes miss a good deal uncle seems to like this part we never were so long before the scissors are done now miss and they will cut very well uncle was in hopes of getting some work at the mansion house when he came back can your uncle write and read i believe he can a little miss what do i owe you for the scissors nothing miss if you please i had rather not take anything from you and why not from me because i never worked for so pretty a lady before wish you good morning ladies said joey taking up his wheel and rolling it away well araminta what do you think now that's no knife grinder's boy he is as well bred and polite as any lad i ever saw i suspect that he is a little story teller saying that he could not write and read araminta replied and so do i what made him in such a hurry to go away i suppose he did not like our questions i wonder whether the uncle will come well melissa i must not quit your father just now so i must leave you with your book and so saying araminta took her way to the house miss mathews was in a reverie for some minutes joey's behaviour had puzzled her almost as much as what she had overheard the day before at last she opened the book and to her great astonishment beheld the letter she started looked at it it was addressed to her she demurred at first whether she should open it it must have been put there by the tinker's boy it was evidently no tinker's letter it must be a love letter and she ought not to read it there was something however so very charming in the whole romance of the affair if it should turn out as she suspected that the tinker should prove a gentleman who had fallen in love with her and had assumed the disguise melissa wanted an excuse to herself for opening the letter at last she said to herself who knows but what it may be a petition from some poor person or other who is in distress i ought to read it at all events had it proved to be a petition miss melissa would have been terribly disappointed it certainly is very respectful thought melissa after she had read it but i cannot reply to it that would never do there certainly is nothing i can take offence at it must be the tinker himself i am sure of that but still he does not say so well i don't know but i feel very anxious as to what this will come to o it can come to nothing for i cannot love a man i have never seen and i would not admit a stranger to an interview that's quite decided i must show the letter to araminta shall i i don't know she's so particular so steady and would be talking of propriety and prudence it would vex her so and put her quite in a fever she would be so unhappy no it would be cruel to say anything to her she would fret so about it i won't tell her until i think it absolutely necessary it is a very gentleman like hand and elegant language too but still i'm not going to carry on a secret correspondence with a tinker it must be the tinker what an odd thing altogether what can his name be an old family quarrel too why it's a romeo and juliet affair only romeo's a tinker well one mask is as good as another he acknowledges himself poor i like that of him there's something so honest in it well after all it will be a little amusement to a poor girl like me shut up from year's end to year's end with opodeldocs always in my nose so i will see what the end of it may be thought melissa rising from her seat to go into the house and putting the letter into her pocket joey went back to spikeman and reported progress that's all i wish joey said spikeman now you must not go there to morrow we must let it work a little if she is at all interested in the letter she will be impatient to know more spikeman was right melissa looked up and down the road very often during the next day and was rather silent during the evening the second day after joey having received his instructions set off with his knife grinder's wheel for the mansion house when he went round the copse where the bench was he found miss mathews there i beg your pardon miss but do you think there is any work at the house come here sir said melissa assuming a very dignified air yes miss said joey walking slowly to her now tell me the truth and i will reward you with half a crown yes miss did you not put this letter in my book the day before yesterday letter miss what letter don't you deny it for you know you did and if you don't tell me the truth my father is a magistrate and i'll have you punished i was told not to tell replied joey pretending to be frightened but you must tell yes and tell me immediately i hope you are not angry miss no not if you tell the truth i don't exactly know miss but a gentleman what gentleman a gentleman that came to uncle miss a gentleman that came to your uncle well go on i suppose he wrote the letter but i'm not sure and uncle gave me the letter to put it where you might see it oh then a gentleman you say gave your uncle this letter and your uncle gave it to you to bring to me is that it uncle gave me the letter but i dare say uncle will tell you all about it and who the gentleman was is your uncle come back he comes back to night madam you're sure your uncle did not write the letter la miss uncle write such a letter as that and to a lady like you that would be odd very odd indeed replied miss melissa who remained a minute or two in thought well my lad said she at last i must and will know who has had the boldness to write this letter to me and as your uncle knows you will bring him here to morrow that i may inquire about it and let him take care that he tells the truth yes miss i will tell him as soon as he comes home i hope you are not angry with me miss i did not think there was any harm in putting into the book such a nice clean letter as that no i am not angry with you your uncle is more to blame i shall expect him to morrow about this time you may go now chapter thirty two in which the tinker makes love joey made his obeisance and departed as if he was frightened miss melissa watched him at last she thought tinker or no tinker that is the question no tinker for a cool hundred as my father would say for no tinker's boy no tinker and that is no tinker's boy how clever of him to say that the letter was given him by a gentleman now i can send to him to interrogate him and have an interview without any offence to my feelings and if he is disguised as i feel confident that he is i shall soon discover it miss melissa mathews did not sleep that night and at the time appointed she was sitting on the bench with all the assumed dignity of a newly made magistrate spikeman and joey were not long before they made their appearance spikeman was particularly clean and neat although he took care to wear the outward appearance of a tinker his hands were by continual washing in hot water very white and he had paid every attention to his person except in wearing his rough and sullied clothes my boy tells me miss that you wish to speak to me said spikeman assuming the air of a vulgar man i did friend said melissa after looking at spikeman for a few minutes a letter has been brought here clandestinely and your boy confesses that he received it from you now i wish to know how you came by it boy go away to a distance said spikeman very angrily if you can't keep one secret at all events you shall not hear any more joey retreated as had been arranged between them well madam or miss i suppose miss said spikeman that letter was written by a gentleman that loves the very ground you tread upon and he requested it to be delivered to me he did miss and if you knew as i do how he loves you you would not be surprised at his taking so bold a step i am surprised at your taking so bold a step tinker as to send it by your boy it was a long while before i would venture miss but when he had told me what he did i really could not help doing so for i pitied him and so would you if you knew all and pray what did he tell you he told me miss said spikeman who had gradually assumed his own manner of speaking that he had ever rejected the thoughts of matrimony that he rose up every morning thanking heaven that he was free and independent that he had scorned the idea of ever being captivated with the charms of a woman but that one day he had by chance passed down this road and had heard you singing as you were coming down to repose on this bench captivated by your voice curiosity induced him to conceal himself in the copse behind us and from thence he had a view of your person nay miss he told me more that he had played the eaves dropper and heard all your conversation free and unconstrained as it was from the supposition that you were alone he heard you express your sentiments and opinions and finding that there was on this earth what in his scepticism he thought never to exist youth beauty talent principle and family all united in one person he had bowed at the shrine and had become a silent and unseen worshipper spikeman stopped speaking then it appears that this gentleman as you style him has been guilty of the ungentlemanly practice of listening to private conversation no very great recommendation such was not his intention at first he was seduced to it by you do not blame him for that now that i have seen you i cannot but miss he told me more he said that he felt that he was unworthy of you and had not a competence to offer you even if he could obtain your favour that he discovered that there was a cause which prevented his gaining an introduction to your family in fact that he was hopeless and despairing he had hovered near you for a long time for he could not leave the air you breathed and at last that he had resolved to set his life upon the die and stake the hazard could i refuse him miss he is of an old family but not wealthy he is a gentleman by birth and education and therefore i did not think i was doing so very wrong in giving him the chance trifling as it might be i beg your pardon madam if i have offended and any message you may have to deliver to him harsh as it may be nay even if it should be his death it shall be faithfully and truly delivered when shall you see him master tinker said melissa very gravely in a week he will be here he said not before considering he is so much in love he takes his time replied melissa well master tinker you may tell him from me that i've no answer to give him it is quite ridiculous as well as highly improper that i should receive a letter or answer one from a person whom i never saw i admit his letter to be respectful or i should have sent a much harsher message your commands shall be obeyed miss that is if you cannot be persuaded to see him for one minute most certainly not i see no gentleman who is not received at my father's house and properly presented to me it may be the custom among people in your station of life master tinker but not in mine and as for yourself i recommend you not to attempt to bring another letter i must request your pardon for my fault miss may i ask after i have seen the poor young gentleman am i to report to you what takes place yes if it is to assure me that i shall be no more troubled with his addresses you shall be obeyed miss continued spikeman then changing his tone and air he said i beg your pardon have you any knives or scissors to grind no replied melissa jumping up from her seat and walking towards the house to conceal her mirth shortly afterwards she turned round to look if spikeman was gone he had remained near the seat with his eyes following her footsteps i could love that man thought melissa as she walked on what an eye he has and what eloquence i shall run away with a tinker i do believe but it is my destiny why does he say a week a whole week but how easy to see through his disguise he had the stamp of a gentleman upon him dear me i wonder how this is to end i must not tell araminta yet she would be fidgeted out of her wits how foolish of me i quite forgot to ask the name of this gentleman i'll not forget it next time chapter thirty three well done tinker it is beyond my hopes joey said spikeman as they went back to the cottage she knows well enough that i was pleading for myself and not for another and she has said quite as much as my most sanguine wishes could desire in fact she has given me permission to come again and report the result of her message to the non existent gentleman which is equal to an assignation i have no doubt now i shall ultimately succeed and i must make my preparations i told her that i should not be able to deliver her message for a week and she did not like the delay that was clear it will all work in my favour a week's expectation will ripen the fruit more than daily meetings i must leave this to night but you may as well stay here for you can be of no use to me where are you going then first to dudstone to take my money out of the bank i have a good sum sufficient to carry me on for many months after her marriage if i do marry her i shall change my dress at dudstone of course and then start for london by mail and fit myself out with a most fashionable wardrobe and etceteras come down again to cobhurst the town we were in the other day with my portmanteau and from thence return here in my tinker's clothes to resume operations you must not go near her during my absence certainly not shall i go out at all no not with the wheel you might meet her on the road and she would be putting questions to you that evening spikeman set off and was absent for five days when he again made his appearance early in the morning joey had remained almost altogether indoors and had taken that opportunity of writing to mary he wrote on the day after spikeman's departure as it would give ample time for an answer before his return but joey received no reply to his letter i am all prepared now my boy said spikeman whose appearance was considerably improved by the various little personal arrangements which he had gone through during the time he was in london i have my money in my pockets my portmanteau at cobhurst and now it depends upon the rapidity of my success when the day is to come that i make the knife grinder's wheel over to you i will go down now but without you this time spikeman set off with his wheel and soon arrived at the usual place of meeting miss mathews from the window had perceived him coming down the road she waited a quarter of an hour before she made her appearance had not she had her eyes on the hands of the time piece and knew that it was only a quarter of an hour she could have sworn that it had been two hours at least poor girl she had during this week run over every circumstance connected with the meeting at least a thousand times every word that had been exchanged had been engraven on her memory and without her knowledge almost her heart had imperceptibly received the impression she walked down reading her book very attentively until she arrived at the bench any knives or scissors to grind ma'am asked spikeman respectfully coming forward you here again master tinker why i had quite forgot all about you heaven preserve us how innocent girls will sometimes tell fibs out of modesty it were well for others miss mathews if their memory were equally treacherous rejoined spikeman and why so pray i speak of the gentleman to whom you sent the message and what was his reply to you he acknowledged miss mathews the madness of his communication to you of the impossibility of your giving him an answer and of your admitting him to your presence he admired the prudence of your conduct but unfortunately his admiration only increased his love he requested me to say that he will write no more he has done wisely and i am satisfied i would i could say as much for him miss mathews for it is my opinion that his very existence is now so bound up with the possession of you that if he does not succeed he cannot exist that's not my fault replied melissa with her eyes cast down no it is not still miss mathews when it is considered that this man had abjured i may say had almost despised women it is no small triumph to you or homage from him that you have made him feel the power of your sex it is his just punishment for having despised us perhaps so yet if we were all punished for our misdeeds as shakespeare says who should escape whipping pray master tinker where did you learn to quote shakespeare where i learnt much more i was not always a travelling tinker so i presumed before this and pray how came you to be one miss mathews if the truth must be told it arose from an unfortunate attachment i have read in the olden poets that love would turn a god into a man but i never heard of its making him a tinker replied melissa smiling the immortal jove did not hesitate to conceal his thunderbolts when he deigned to love and cupid but too often has recourse to the aid of proteus to secure success we have therefore no mean warranty and who was the lady of thy love good master tinker she was miss mathews like you in everything she was as beautiful as intelligent as honest as proud and unfortunately she was like you as obdurate which reminds me of the unfortunate gentleman whose emissary i now am in his madness he requested me yes miss mathews me a poor tinker to woo you for him to say to you all that he would have said had he been admitted to your presence to plead for him to kneel for him at your feet and entreat you to have some compassion for one whose only misfortune was to love whose only fault was to be poor what could i say miss mathews what could i reply to a person in his state of desperation to reason with him to argue with him had been useless i could only soothe him by making such a promise provided that i was permitted to do it tell me miss mathews have i your permission to make the attempt first mr tinker i should wish to know the name of this gentleman i promised not to mention it miss mathews but i can evade the promise i have a book which belongs to him in my pocket on the inside of which are the arms of his family with his father's name underneath them spikeman presented the book melissa read the name and then laid it on the bench without saying a word and now miss mathews as i have shown you that the gentleman has no wish to conceal who he is may i venture to hope that you will permit me to plead occasionally when i may see you in his behalf i know not what to say master tinker i consider it a measure fraught with some danger both to the gentleman and to myself you have quoted shakespeare allow me now to do the same friendship is constant in all other things save in the affairs and offices of love therefore all hearts use your own tongues' you observe master tinker that there is the danger of your pleading for yourself and not for your client and there is also the danger of my being insensibly moved to listen to the addresses of a tinker now only reflect upon the awful consequences continued melissa smiling i pledge you my honour miss mathews that i will only plead for the person whose name you have read in the book and that you shall never be humiliated by the importunities of a mender of pots and pans you pledge the honour of a tinker what may that be worth a tinker that has the honour of conversing with miss mathews has an honour that cannot be too highly appreciated well that is very polite for a mender of old kettles but the schoolmaster is abroad which i presume accounts for such strange anomalies as our present conversation i must now wish you good morning when may i have the honour of again presenting myself in behalf of the poor gentleman i can really make no appointments with tinkers replied melissa if you personate that young man you must be content to wait for days or months to catch a glimpse of the hem of my garment to bay the moon and bless the stars and i do not know what else it is in short catch me when you can and now farewell good master tinker replied melissa leaving her own book and taking the one spikeman had put into her hand which she carried with her to the house it was all up with miss melissa mathews that was clear we shall pass over a fortnight during which spikeman at first every other day and subsequently every day or evening had a meeting with melissa in every one of which he pleaded his cause in the third person joey began to be very tired of this affair as he remained idle during the whole time when one morning spikeman told him that he must go down to the meeting place without the wheel and tell miss mathews his uncle the tinker was ill and not able to come that evening joey received his instructions and went down immediately miss mathews was not to be seen and joey to avoid observation hid himself in the copse awaiting her arrival at last she came accompanied by araminta her cousin as soon as they had taken their seats on the bench araminta commenced my dear melissa i could not speak to you in the house on account of your father but simpson has told me this morning that she thought it her duty to state to me that you have been seen not only in the day time but late in the evening walking and talking with a strange looking man i have thought it very odd that you should not have mentioned this mysterious person to me lately but i do think it most strange that you should have been so imprudent now tell me everything that has happened or i must really make it known to your father and have me locked up for months that's very kind of you araminta replied melissa but consider what you have been doing melissa who is this man a travelling tinker who brought me a letter from a gentleman who has been so silly as to fall in love with me and what steps have you taken cousin positively refused to receive a letter or to see the gentleman then why does the man come again to know if we have any knives or scissors to grind come come melissa this is ridiculous all the servants are talking about it and you know how servants talk why do you continue to see this fellow because he amuses me and it is so stupid of him if that is your only reason you can have no objection to see him no more now that scandal is abroad will you promise me that you will not recollect dear melissa how imprudent and how unmaidenly it is why you don't think that i am going to elope with a tinker do you cousin i should think not nevertheless a tinker is no companion for miss mathews dear cousin melissa you have been most imprudent how far you have told me the truth i know not but this i must tell you if you do not promise me to give up this disgraceful acquaintance i will immediately acquaint my uncle i will not be forced into any promise araminta replied melissa indignantly well then i will not hurry you into it i will give you forty eight hours to reply and if by that time your own good sense does not point out your indiscretion i certainly will make it known to your father that is decided so saying araminta rose from the bench and walked towards the house eight and forty hours said melissa thoughtfully it must be decided by that time joey who had wit enough to perceive how matters stood made up his mind not to deliver his message he knew that spikeman was well and presumed that his staying away was to make miss mathews more impatient to see him melissa remained on the bench in deep thought at last joey went up to her you here my boy what have you come for said melissa i was strolling this way madam come here i want you to tell me the truth indeed it is useless to attempt to deceive me is that person your uncle no miss he is not i knew that is he not the person who wrote the letter and a gentleman in disguise answer me that question and then i have a message to him which will make him happy he is a gentleman miss and his name is spikeman is it not yes miss it is will he be here this evening this is no time for trifling if you want him miss i am sure he will tell him to be sure and come and not in disguise said melissa bursting into tears that's no use my die is cast continued she talking to herself joey remained by her side until she removed her hands from her face why do you wait at what hour miss shall he come said joey as soon as it is dusk leave me boy and do not forget joey hastened to spikeman and narrated what he had seen and heard with the message of melissa my dear boy you have helped me to happiness said spikeman she shed tears did she poor thing i trust they will be the last she shall shed i must be off to cobhurst at once meet me at dark at the copse for i shall want to speak to you spikeman set off for the town as fast as he could with his bundle on his head when half way he went into a field and changed his clothes discarding his tinker's dress for ever throwing it into a ditch for the benefit of the finder he then went into the town to his rooms dressed himself in a fashionable suit arranged his portmanteau and ordered a chaise to be ready at the door at a certain time so as to arrive at the village before dusk after he had passed through the village he ordered the postboy to stop about fifty yards on the other side of the copse and getting out desired him to remain till he returned joey was already there and soon afterwards miss m made her appearance coming down the walk in a hurried manner in her shawl and bonnet as soon as she gained the bench spikeman was at her feet he told her he knew what had passed between her and her cousin that he could not would not part with her he now came without disguise to repeat what he had so often said to her that he loved and adored her and that his life should be devoted to make her happy melissa wept entreated refused and half consented spikeman led her away from the bench towards the road she still refusing yet still advancing until they came to the door of the chaise joey let down the steps melissa half fainting and half resisting was put in spikeman followed and the door was closed by joey stop a moment boy said spikeman here joey take this as spikeman put a packet into our hero's hand melissa clasped her hands and cried yes yes stop do stop and let me out i cannot go indeed i cannot there's lights coming down the gravel walk said joey they are running fast drive on boy as fast as you can said spikeman oh yes drive on cried melissa sinking into her lover's arms off went the chaise leaving joey on the road with the packet in his hand our hero turned round and perceived the lights close to him and not exactly wishing to be interrogated he set off as fast as he could and never checked his speed until he arrived at the cottage where he and spikeman had taken up their quarters chapter thirty four a very long chapter necessary to fetch up the remainder of the convoy as it was late that night joey did not open the packet delivered to him from spikeman until he arose the next morning which he did very early as he thought it very likely that he might be apprehended if he was not off in good time the packet contained a key pounds in money and a paper with the following letter my dear boy as we must now part at least for some time i have left you money sufficient to set you up for the present i have inclosed a memorandum by which i make over to you the knife grinder's wheel and all the furniture books etcetera that are in my rooms at dudstone the key of which is also inclosed i should recommend you going there and taking immediate possession and as soon as i have time i shall write to the woman of the house to inform her of the contents of the memorandum and i will also write to you and let you know how i get on of course you will now do as you please at all events i have taught you a profession and have given you the means of following it i only hope if you do that some day you may be able to retire from business as successfully as i have done you will of course write to me occasionally after you know where i am depend upon it there is no profession so near to that of a gentleman as that of a travelling tinker yours ever truly augustus spikeman nb there is some money in the old place to pay the bill at the cottage our hero considered that he could not do better than follow the advice of spikeman he first wrote a few lines to mary requesting that she would send her answer to dudstone and then having settled with the hostess he set off with his knife grinder's wheel on his return home to what were now his apartments as he was not anxious to make money he did not delay on his road and on the fifth day he found himself at the door of the alehouse near to dudstone where he had before left the wheel joey thought it advisable to do so now telling the landlord that spikeman had requested him so to do and as soon as it was dusk our hero proceeded to the town and knocked at the door of the house in which were spikeman's apartments he informed the landlady that spikeman would not in all probability return and had sent him to take possession showing her the key the dame was satisfied and joey went upstairs as soon as he had lighted the candle and fairly installed himself our hero threw himself down on the sofa and began to reflect it is pleasant to have property of our own and joey never had had any before it was satisfactory to look at the furniture bed and books and say all this is mine joey felt this as it is to be presumed everybody would in the same position and for some time he continued looking round and round at his property having satisfied himself with a review of it externally he next proceeded to open all the drawers the chests etcetera there were many articles in them which joey did not expect to find such as a store of sheets table linen and all spikeman's clothes which he had discarded when he went up to london some silver spoons and a variety of little odds and ends in short spikeman had left our hero everything as it stood joey put his money away and then went to bed and slept as serenely as the largest landed proprietor in the kingdom when he awoke next morning our hero began to reflect upon what he should do he was not of spikeman's opinion that a travelling tinker was the next thing to a gentleman nor did he much like the idea of rolling the wheel about all his life nevertheless he agreed with spikeman that it was a trade by which he could earn his livelihood and if he could do no better it would always be a resource as soon as he had taken his breakfast he sat down and wrote to mary acquainting her with all that had taken place and stating what his own feelings were upon his future prospects having finished his letter he dressed himself neatly and went out to call upon the widow james miss ophelia and miss amelia were both at home well master atherton how do you do and pray where is mr spikeman said both the girls in a breath he is a long way from this replied joey a long way from this why has he not come back with you no and i believe he will not come back any more i am come as his agent to take possession of his property why what has happened a very sad accident replied our hero shaking his head he fell fell exclaimed the two girls in a breath yes fell in love and is married well now exclaimed miss ophelia only to think miss amelia said nothing and so he is really married yes and he has given up business he did seem in a great hurry when he last came here observed amelia and what are you going to do i am not going to follow his example just yet replied joey i suppose not but what are you going to do replied ophelia i shall wait here for his orders i expect to hear from him whether i am to remain in this part of the country or sell off and join him or look out for some other business i hardly know i think myself i shall look out for something else i don't like the cutlery line and travelling for orders how is your mamma miss ophelia she is very well and has gone to market well i never did expect to hear of mr spikeman being married who is he married to joseph to a very beautiful young lady daughter of squire mathews with a large fortune yes men always look for money nowadays said amelia i must go now said joey getting up i have some calls and some inquiries to make good morning young ladies it must be acknowledged that the two misses james were not quite so cordial towards joey as they were formerly but unmarried girls do not like to hear of their old acquaintances marrying anybody save themselves there is not only a flirt the less but a chance the less in consequence and it should be remarked that there were very few beaux at dudstone our hero was some days at dudstone before he received a letter from spikeman who informed him that he had arrived safely at gretna indeed there was no male relation of the family to pursue him and the silken bands of hymen had been made more secure by the iron rivets of the blacksmith that three days after he had written a letter to his wife's father informing him that he had done him the honour of marrying his daughter that he could not exactly say when he could find time to come to the mansion and pay him a visit but that he would as soon as he conveniently could that he begged that the room prepared for them upon their arrival might have a large dressing room attached to it as he could not dispense with that convenience that he was not aware whether mr mathews was inclined to part with the mansion and property but as his wife had declared that she would prefer living there to anywhere else he had not any objection to purchase it of mr mathews if they could come to terms hoped his gout was better and was his very faithfully augustus spikeman melissa wrote a few lines to araminta begging her as a favour not to attempt to palliate her conduct but to rail against her incessantly as it would be the surest method of bringing affairs to an amicable settlement to her father she wrote only these few words my dear papa you will be glad to hear that i am married augustus says that if i behave well he will come and see you soon dear papa your dutiful child melissa spikeman that the letters of spikeman and melissa put the old gentleman in no small degree of rage may be conceived but nothing could be more judicious than the plan spikeman had acted upon it is useless to plead to a man who is irritated with constant gout he only becomes more despotic and more unyielding had araminta attempted to soften his indignation it would have been equally fruitless but the compliance with the request of her cousin of continually railing against her had the effect intended the vituperation of araminta left him nothing to say there was no opposition to direct his anathemas against there was no coaxing or wheedling on the part of the offenders for him to repulse and when araminta pressed the old gentleman to vow that melissa should never enter the doors again he accused her of being influenced by interested motives threw a basin at her head and wrote an epistle requesting melissa to come and take his blessing araminta refused to attend her uncle after this insult and the old gentleman became still more anxious for the return of his daughter as he was now left entirely to the caprice of his servants araminta gave melissa an account of what had passed and entreated her to come at once she did so and a general reconciliation took place mr mathews finding his new son in law very indifferent to pecuniary matters insisted upon making over to his wife an estate in herefordshire which with melissa's own fortune rendered them in most affluent circumstances spikeman requested joey to write to him now and then and that if he required assistance he would apply for it but still advised him to follow up the profession of travelling tinker as being the most independent our hero had hardly time to digest the contents of spikeman's letter when he received a large packet from mary accounting for her not having replied to him before in consequence of her absence from the hall she had three weeks before received a letter written for mrs chopper acquainting her that mrs chopper was so very ill that it was not thought possible that she could recover having an abscess in the liver which threatened to break internally and requesting mary to obtain leave to come to gravesend if she possibly could as mrs chopper wished to see her before she died great as was mary's repugnance to revisit gravesend she felt that the obligations she was under to mrs chopper were too great for her to hesitate and showing the letter to mrs austin and stating at the same time that she considered mrs chopper as more than a mother to her she obtained the leave which she requested and set off for gravesend it was with feelings of deep shame and humiliation that poor mary walked down the main street of the town casting her eyes up fearfully to the scenes of her former life she was very plainly attired and had a thick veil over her face so that nobody recognised her she arrived at the door of mrs chopper's abode ascended the stairs and was once more in the room out of which she had quitted gravesend to lead a new life and most conscientiously had she fulfilled her resolution as the reader must be aware mrs chopper was in bed and slumbering when mary softly opened the door the signs of approaching death were on her countenance her large round form had wasted away her fingers were now taper and bloodless mary would not have recognised her had she fallen in with her under other circumstances an old woman was in attendance she rose up when mary entered imagining that it was some kind lady come to visit the sick woman mary sat down by the side of the bed and motioned to the old woman that she might go out and then she raised her veil and waited till the sufferer roused mary had snuffed the candle twice that she might see sufficiently to read the prayer book which she had taken up when mrs chopper opened her eyes how very kind of you ma'am said mrs chopper and where is miss my eyes are dimmer every day it is me mary nancy that was and so it is o nancy now i shall die in peace i thought at first it was the kind lady who comes every day to read and to pray with me dear nancy how glad i am to see you and how do you do and how is poor peter quite well when i heard from him last my dear mrs chopper you don't know nancy what a comfort it is to me to see you looking as you do so good and so innocent and when i think it was by my humble means that you were put in the way of becoming so i feel as if i had done one good act and that perhaps my sins may be forgiven me god will reward you mrs chopper i said so at the time and i feel it now replied mary the tears rolling down her cheeks i trust by your means and with strength from above i shall continue in the same path so that one sinner may be saved bless you nancy you never were a bad girl in heart i always said so and where is peter now going about the country earning his bread poor but happy well nancy it will soon be over with me i may die in a second they tell me or i may live for three or four days but i sent for you that i might put my house in order there are only two people that i care for upon earth that is you and my poor peter and all i have i mean to leave between you i have signed a paper already in case you could not come but now that you are come i will tell you all i wish but give me some of that drink first mary having read the directions on the label poured out a wine glass of the mixture and gave it to mrs chopper who swallowed it and then proceeded taking a paper from under her pillow nancy this is the paper i told you of i have about pounds in the bank which is all that i have saved in twenty two years but it has been honestly made i have perhaps much more owing to me but i do not want it to be collected poor sailors have no money to spare and i release them all you will see me buried nancy and tell poor peter how i loved him and i have left my account books with my bad debts and good debts to him i am sure he would like to have them for he knows the history of every sum total and he will look over them and think of me you can sell this furniture but the wherry you must give to william he is not very honest but he has a large family to keep do what you like dearest about what is here perhaps my clothes would be useful to his wife they are not fit for you there's a good deal of money in the upper drawer it will pay for my funeral and the doctor i believe that is all now but do tell poor peter how i loved him poor fellow i have been cheated ever since he left but that's no matter now nancy dear read to me a little i have so longed to have you by my bedside to read to me and pray for me i want to hear you pray before i die it will make me happy to hear you pray and see that kind face looking up to heaven as it was always meant to do poor mary burst into tears after a few minutes she became more composed and dropping down on her knees by the side of the bed she opened the prayer book and complied with the request of mrs chopper and as she fervently poured forth her supplication occasionally her voice faltered and she would stop to brush away the tears which dimmed her sight she was still so occupied when the door of the room was gently opened and a lady with a girl about fourteen or fifteen years old quietly entered the room mary did not perceive them until they also had knelt down she finished the prayer rose and with a short curtsey retired from the side of the bed although not recognised herself by the lady mary immediately remembered mrs phillips and her daughter emma having as we have before observed been at one time in mrs phillips's service this is the young woman whom you so wished to see mrs chopper is it not said mrs phillips i am not surprised at your longing for her for she appears well suited for a companion in such an hour and alas how few there are sit down i request continued mrs phillips turning to mary how do you find yourself to day mrs chopper sinking fast dear madam but not unwilling to go since i have seen nancy and heard of my poor peter he wrote to nancy a short time ago nancy don't forget my love to peter emma phillips who had now grown tall and thin immediately went up to mary and said peter was the little boy who was with mrs chopper i met him on the road when he first came to gravesend did i not yes miss you did replied mary he used to come to our house sometimes and very often to meet me as i walked home from school i never could imagine what became of him for he disappeared all at once without saying good bye he was obliged to go away miss it was not his fault he was a very good boy and is so still then pray remember me to him and tell him that i often think of him i will miss phillips and he will be very happy to hear that you have said so how did you know that my name was phillips o i suppose poor mrs chopper told you before we came mrs phillips had now read some time to mrs chopper and this put an end to the conversation between mary and emma phillips it was not resumed as soon as the reading was over mrs phillips and her daughter took their leave mary made up a bed for herself by the side of mrs chopper's about the middle of the night she was roused by a gurgling kind of noise she hastened to the bedside and found that mrs chopper was suffocating mary called in the old woman to her aid but it was useless the abscess had burst and in a few seconds all was over and mary struggling with emotion closed the eyes of her old friend and offered up a prayer for her departed spirit the remainder of the night was passed in solemn meditation and a renewal of those vows which the poor girl had hitherto so scrupulously adhered to and which the death bed scene was so well fitted to encourage but mary felt that she had her duties towards others to discharge and did not give way to useless and unavailing sorrow it was her duty to return as soon as possible to her indulgent mistress and the next morning she was busy in making the necessary arrangements on the third day mary attended the funeral of her old friend the bills were all paid and having selected some articles which she wished to retain as a remembrance she resolved to make over to william the waterman not only the wherry but all the stock in hand furniture and clothes of mrs chopper this would enable him and his wife to set up in business themselves and provide for their family mary knew that she had no right to do so without joey's consent but of this she felt she was sure having so done she had nothing more to do but to see the lawyer who had drawn up the will and having gone through the necessary forms she received an order on the county bank nearest to the hall for the money which with what was left in the drawers after paying every demand amounted to more than pounds she thought it was her duty to call upon mrs phillips before she went away out of gratitude for her kindness to mrs chopper and as she had not been recognised she had no scruple in so doing she was kindly received and blushed at the praise bestowed upon her as she was going away emma phillips followed her out and putting into her hand a silver pencil case requested she would give it to peter as a remembrance of his little friend emma the next day mary arrived at the hall first communicated to mrs austin what had occurred and then having received our hero's two last epistles sat down to write the packet containing all the intelligence we have made known and ended by requesting joey to set off with his knife grinder's wheel and come to the village near to the hall that he might receive his share of mrs chopper's money the silver pencil case and the warm greeting of his adopted sister joey was not long in deciding he resolved that he would go to mary and having locked up his apartments he once more resumed his wheel and was soon on his way to hampshire chapter thirty five a retrospect that the parties may all start fair again we must now leave our hero on his way to the hall while we acquaint our readers with the movements of other parties connected with our history a correspondence had been kept up between o'donahue and mcshane o'donahue had succeeded in obtaining the pardon of the emperor and employment in the russian army in which he had rapidly risen to the rank of general five or six years had elapsed since he had married and both o'donahue and his wife were anxious to visit england a letter at last came announcing that he had obtained leave of absence from the emperor and would in all probability arrive in the ensuing spring during this period mcshane had continued at his old quarters mrs mcshane still carrying on the business which every year became more lucrative so much so indeed that her husband had for some time thought very seriously of retiring altogether as they had already amassed a large sum when mcshane received the letter from o'donahue announcing that in a few months he would arrive in england major mcshane who was very far from being satisfied with his negative position in society pressed the matter more earnestly to his wife who although she was perfectly content with her own position did not oppose his entreaties mcshane found that after disposing of the goodwill of the business and of the house they would have a clear pounds which he considered more than enough for their wants uncumbered as they were with children let it not be supposed that mcshane had ceased in his inquiries after our hero on the contrary he had resorted to all that his invention could suggest to trace him out but as the reader must be aware without success both mcshane and his wife mourned his loss as if they had been bereaved of their own child they still indulged the idea that some day he would reappear but when they could not surmise mcshane had not only searched for our hero but had traced his father with as little success and he had now made up his mind that he should see no more of joey if he ever did see him again until after the death of his father when there would no longer be any occasion for secrecy our hero and his fate were a continual source of conversation between mcshane and his wife but latterly after not having heard of him for more than five years the subject had not been so often renewed as soon as mcshane had wound up his affairs and taken his leave of the eating house he looked out for an estate in the country resolving to lay out two thirds of his money in land and leave the remainder in the funds after about three months' search he found a property which suited him and as it so happened about six miles from the domains held by mr austin he had taken possession and furnished it as a retired officer in the army he was well received and if mrs mcshane was sometimes laughed at for her housekeeper like appearance still her sweetness of temper and unassuming behaviour soon won her friends and mcshane found himself in a very short time comfortable and happy the o'donahues were expected to arrive very shortly and mcshane had now a domicile fit for the reception of his old friend who had promised to pay him a visit as soon as he arrived of the austins little more can be said that has not been said already austin was a miserable unhappy man his cup of bliss for he had every means of procuring all that this world considers as bliss being in possession of station wealth and respect was poisoned by the one heavy crime which passion had urged him to commit and which was now a source of hourly and unavailing repentance his son who should have inherited his wealth was lost to him and he dared not mention that he was in existence every day austin became more nervous and irritable more exclusive and averse to society he trembled at shadows and his strong constitution was rapidly giving way to the heavy weight on his conscience he could not sleep without opiates and he dreaded to sleep lest he should reveal everything of the past in his slumbers each year added to the irascibility of his temper and the harshness with which he treated his servants and his unhappy wife his chief amusement was hunting and he rode in so reckless a manner that people often thought that he was anxious to break his neck perhaps he was mrs austin was much to be pitied she knew how much her husband suffered how the worm gnawed within and having that knowledge she submitted to all his harshness pitying him instead of condemning him but her life was still more embittered by the loss of her child and many were the bitter tears which she would shed when alone for she dared not in her husband's presence as he would have taken them as a reproof to himself her whole soul yearned after our hero and that one feeling rendered her indifferent not only to all the worldly advantages by which she was surrounded but to the unkindness and hard heartedness of her husband mary who had entered her service as kitchen maid was very soon a favourite and had been advanced to the situation of mrs austin's own attendant mrs austin considered her a treasure and she daily became more partial to and more confidential with her such was the state of affairs when one morning as austin was riding to cover a gentleman of the neighbourhood said to him in the course of conversation by the bye austin have you heard that you have a new neighbour what on the frampton estate i suppose i heard that it had been sold yes i have seen him he is one of your profession a lively amusing sort of irish major gentlemanlike nevertheless the wife not very high bred but very fat and very good humoured and amusing from her downright simpleness of heart you will call upon them i presume oh of course replied austin what is his name did you say major mcshane formerly of the rd regiment i believe had a bullet passed through the heart of austin he could not have received a more sudden shock and the start which he made from his saddle attracted the notice of his companion what's the matter austin you look pale you are not well no replied austin recollecting himself i am not one of those twinges from an old wound in the breast came on i shall be better directly austin stopped his horse and put his hand to his heart his companion rode up and remained near him it is worse than usual i thought it was coming on last night i fear that i must go home shall i go with you o no i must not spoil your sport i am better now a great deal it is going off fast come let us proceed or we shall be too late at cover austin had resolved to conquer his feelings his friend had no suspicion it is true but when we are guilty we imagine that everybody suspects us they rode a few minutes in silence well i am glad that you did not go home observed his friend for you will meet your new neighbour he has subscribed to the pack and they say he is well mounted we shall see how he rides austin made no reply but after riding on a few yards farther he pulled up saying that the pain was coming on again and that he could not proceed his companion expressed his sorrow at austin's indisposition and they separated austin immediately returned home dismounted his horse and hastened to his private sitting room mrs austin who had seen him return and could not imagine the cause went in to her husband what is the matter my dear said mrs austin matter replied austin bitterly pacing up and down the room heaven and hell conspire against us dear austin don't talk in that way what has happened something which will compel me i expect to remain a prisoner in my own house or lead to something unpleasant we must not stay here austin then threw himself down on the sofa and was silent at last the persuasions and endearments of his wife overcame his humour he told her that mcshane was the major of his regiment when he was a private that he would inevitably recognise him and that if nothing else occurred from mcshane's knowledge of his former name at all events the general supposition of his having been an officer in the army would be contradicted and it would lower him in the estimation of the county gentlemen it is indeed a very annoying circumstance my dear austin but are you sure that he would after so long a period recognise the private soldier in the gentleman of fortune as sure as i sit here replied austin gloomily i wish i were dead don't say so dear austin it makes me miserable i never am otherwise replied austin clasping his hands god forgive me i have sinned but have i not been punished you have indeed and as repentance is availing my dear husband you will receive god's mercy the greatest boon the greatest mercy would be death replied the unhappy man i envy the pedlar mrs austin wept her husband irritated at tears which to him seemed to imply reproach sternly ordered her to leave the room that austin repented bitterly of the crime which he had committed is not to be doubted but it was not with the subdued soul of a christian his pride was continually struggling within him and was not yet conquered this it was that made him alternately self condemning and irascible and it was the continual warfare in his soul which was undermining his constitution austin sent for medical advice for his supposed complaint the country practitioner who could discover nothing pronounced it to be an affection of the heart he was not far wrong and mr austin's illness was generally promulgated cards and calls were the consequence and austin kept himself a close but impatient prisoner in his own house his hunters remained in the stables his dogs in the kennel and every one intimated that mr austin was labouring under a disease from which he would not recover at first this was extremely irksome to austin and he was very impatient but gradually he became reconciled and even preferred his sedentary and solitary existence books were his chief amusement but nothing could minister to a mind diseased or drive out the rooted memory of the brain austin became more morose and misanthropic every day and at last would permit no one to come near him but his valet and his wife such was the position of his parents when joey was proceeding to their abode chapter thirty six our hero falls in with an old acquaintance and is not very much delighted we left our hero rolling his knife grinder's wheel towards his father's house it must be confessed that he did it very unwillingly he was never very fond of it at any time but since he had taken possession of spikeman's property and had received from mary the intelligence that he was worth pounds more he had taken a positive aversion to it it retarded his movements and it was hard work when he had not to get his livelihood by it more than once he thought of rolling it into a horsepond and leaving it below low water mark but then he thought it a sort of protection against inquiry and against assault for it told of poverty and honest employment so joey rolled on but not with any feelings of regard towards his companion how many castles did our hero build as he went along the road the sum of money left to him appeared to be enormous he planned and planned again and like most people at the close of the day he was just as undetermined as at the commencement nevertheless he was very happy as people always are in anticipation unfortunately more so than when they grasp what they have been seeking time rolled on as well as the grindstone and at last joey found himself at the ale house where he and mary had put up previously to her obtaining a situation at the hall he immediately wrote a letter to her acquainting her with his arrival he would have taken the letter himself only he recollected the treatment he had received and found another messenger in the butcher's boy who was going up to the hall for orders the answer returned by the same party was that mary would come down and see him that evening when mary came down joey was astonished at the improvement in her appearance she looked much younger than she did when they had parted and her dress was so very different that our hero could with difficulty imagine that it was the same person who had been his companion from gravesend the careless air and manner had disappeared there was a retenue a dignity about her which astonished him and he felt a sort of respect mingled with his regard for her of which he could not divest himself but if she looked younger as may well be imagined from her change of life she also looked more sedate except when she smiled or when occasionally but very rarely her merry laughter reminded him of the careless good tempered nancy of former times that the greeting was warm need hardly be said it was the greeting of a sister and younger brother who loved each other dearly you are very much grown joey said mary dear boy how happy i am to see you and you mary you're younger in the face but older in your manners are you as happy in your situation as you have told me in your letters quite happy more happy than ever i deserve to be my dear boy and now tell me joey what do you think of doing you have now the means of establishing yourself yes i have been thinking of it but i don't know what to do well you must look out and do not be in too great a hurry recollect joey that if anything offers which you have any reason to believe will suit you you shall have my money as well as your own nay mary why should i take that because as it is of no use to me it must be idle besides you know if you succeed you will be able to pay me interest for it so i shall gain as well as you you must not refuse your sister my dear boy dear mary how i wish we could live in the same house that cannot be now joey you are above my situation at the hall even allowing that you would ever enter it that i never will if i can help it not that i feel angry now but i like to be independent of course you do and as for that grindstone i hate the sight of it it has made spikeman's fortune but it never shall make mine you don't agree then with your former companion rejoined mary that a tinker's is the nearest profession to that of a gentleman which you know of i certainly do not replied our hero and as soon as i can get rid of it i will i have rolled it here but i will not roll it much farther i only wish i knew where to go i have something in my pocket which puts me in mind of a piece of news which i received the other day since my return first let me give you what i have in my pocket and mary pulled out the pencil case sent to joey by emma phillips there you know already who that is from yes and i shall value it very much for she was a dear kind little creature and when i was very very miserable she comforted me well joey miss phillips requested me to write when i came back as she wished to hear that i had arrived safe at the hall it was very kind of her and i did so of course since that i have received a letter from her stating that her grandmother is dead and that her mother is going to quit gravesend for portsmouth to reside with her brother who is now a widower i will go to portsmouth replied our hero i was thinking that as her brother is a navy agent and mrs phillips is interested about you you could not do better if anything turns up then you will have good advice and your money is not so likely to be thrown away i think therefore you had better go to portsmouth and try your fortune i am very glad you have mentioned this mary for till now one place was as indifferent to me as another but now it is otherwise and to portsmouth i will certainly go our hero remained two or three days longer at the village during which time mary was with him every evening and once she obtained leave to go to the banker's about her money she then turned over to joey's account the sum due to him and arrangements were made with the bank so that joey could draw his capital out whenever he pleased after which our hero took leave of mary promising to correspond more freely than before and once more putting the strap of his knife grinder's wheel over his shoulders he set off on his journey to portsmouth joey had not gained two miles from the village when he asked himself the question what shall i do with my grindstone he did not like to leave it on the road he did not know to whom he could give it away he rolled it on for about six miles farther and then quite tired he resolved to follow the plan formerly adopted by spikeman and repose a little upon the turf on the road side the sun was very warm and after a time joey retreated to the other side of the hedge which was shaded and having taken his bundle from the side of the wheel where it hung he first made his dinner of the provender he had brought with him and then laying his head on the bundle was soon in a sound sleep from which he was awakened by hearing voices on the other side of the hedge he turned round and perceived two men on the side of the road close to his knife grinder's wheel they were in their shirts and trousers only and sitting down on the turf it would be a very good plan observed one of them we should then travel without suspicion yes if we could get off with it without being discovered where can the owner of it be well i dare say he is away upon some business or another and has left the wheel here till he comes back now suppose we were to take it how should we manage why we cannot go along this road with it we must get over the gates and hedges till we get across the country into another road and then by travelling all night we might be quite clear yes and then we should do well for even if our description as deserters was sent out from portsmouth we should be considered as travelling tinkers and there would be no suspicion well i'm ready for it if we can only get it off the road and conceal it till night we may then easily manage it but first let's see if the fellow it belongs to may not be somewhere about here as the man said this he rose up and turned his face towards the hedge and our hero immediately perceived that it was his old acquaintance furness the schoolmaster and marine what to do he hardly knew at last he perceived furness advancing towards the gate of the field which was close to where he was lying and as escape was impossible our hero covered his face with his arms and pretended to be fast asleep he soon heard a hush given as a signal to the other man and after a while footsteps close to him joey pretended to snore loudly and a whispering then took place at last he heard furness say do you watch by him while i wheel away the grindstone but if he wakes what shall i do brain him with that big stone if he does not wake up when i am past the second field follow me that our hero had no inclination to wake after this notice may be easily imagined he heard the gate opened and the wheel trundled away much to his delight as furness was the party who had it in charge and joey continued to snore hard until at last he heard the departing footsteps of furness's comrade who had watched him he thought it prudent to continue motionless for some time longer to give them time to be well away from him and then he gradually turned round and looked in the direction in which they had gone he could see nothing of them and it was not until he had risen up and climbed up on the gate that he perceived them two or three fields off running away at a rapid pace thanking heaven that he had escaped the danger that he was in and delighted with the loss of his property our hero recommenced his journey with his bundle over his shoulder and before night he was safe outside one of the stages which took him to a town from which there was another which would carry him to portsmouth at which sea port he arrived the next evening without further adventure as our hero sat on the outside of the coach and reflected upon his last adventure the more he felt he had reason to congratulate himself that furness had deserted from the marine barracks at portsmouth was evident and if he had not that he would have recognised joey some time or other was almost certain now he felt sure that he was safe at portsmouth as it would be the last place at which furness would make his appearance and he also felt that his knife grinder's wheel in supplying furness with the ostensible means of livelihood and thereby preventing his being taken up as a deserter had proved the best friend to him and could not have been disposed of better another piece of good fortune was his having secured his bundle and money for had he left it with the wheel it would have of course shared its fate besides thought joey if i should chance to fall in with furness again and he attempts to approach me i can threaten to have him taken as a deserter and this may deter him from so doing it was with a grateful heart that our hero laid his head upon his pillow in the humble inn at which he had taken up his quarters chapter thirty seven in which our hero returns to his former employment but on a grander scale of operation our hero had received from mary the name and address of mrs phillips's brother and on inquiry found that he was known by everybody joey dressed himself in his best suit and presented himself at the door about ten o'clock in the morning as joseph o'donahue the name which he had taken when he went to gravesend and by which name he had been known to mrs phillips and her daughter emma when he made occasional visits to their house he was admitted and found himself once more in company with his friend emma who was now fast growing up into womanhood after the first congratulations and inquiries he stated his intentions in coming down to portsmouth and their assistance was immediately promised they then requested a detail of his adventures since he quitted gravesend of which joey told everything that he safely could passing over his meeting with furness by simply stating that while he was asleep his knife grinder's wheel had been stolen by two men and that when he awoke he dared not offer an opposition mrs phillips and her daughter both knew that there was some mystery about our hero which had induced him to come to and also to leave gravesend but being assured by mary and himself that he was not to blame they did not press him to say more than he wished and as soon as he finished his history they proposed introducing him to mr small the brother of mrs phillips in whose house they were then residing and who was then in his office but perhaps mamma it will be better to wait till tomorrow and in the meantime you will be able to tell my uncle all about joey observed emma i think it will be better my dear replied mrs phillips but there is marianne's tap at the door for the second time she wants me downstairs so i must leave you for a little while but you need not go away o'donahue i will be back soon mrs phillips left the room and our hero found himself alone with emma you have grown very much joey said emma and so have i too they tell me yes you have indeed replied joey you are no longer the little girl who comforted me when i was so unhappy do you recollect that day yes indeed i do as if it were but yesterday but you have never told me why you lead so wandering a life you won't trust me i would trust you with anything but that which is not mine to trust as i told you four years ago it is not my secret as soon as i can i will tell you everything but i hope not to lead a wandering life any longer for i have come down here to settle if i can what made you think of coming down here asked emma because you were here mary told me so i have not yet thanked you for your present but i have not forgotten your kindness in thinking of a poor boy like me when he was far away here it is continued joey taking out the pencil case and i have loved it dearly added he kissing it ever since i have had it in my possession i very often have taken it out and thought of you now you are so rich a man you should give me something to keep for your sake replied emma and i will be very careful of it for old acquaintance' sake what can i offer to you you are a young lady i would give you all i had in the world if i dared but when i first saw you rejoined emma you were dressed as a young gentleman yes i was replied joey with a sigh and as the observation of emma recalled to his mind the kindness of the mcshanes he passed his hand across his eyes to brush away a tear or two that started i did not mean to make you unhappy said emma taking our hero's hand i am sure you did not replied joey smiling yes i was then as you say but recollect that lately i have been a knife grinder well you know your friend said that it was the nearest thing to a gentleman and now i hope you will be quite a gentleman again not a gentleman for i must turn to some business or another replied joey i did not mean an idle gentleman i meant a respectable profession said emma my uncle is a very odd man but very good hearted you must not mind his way towards you he is very fond of mamma and me and i have no doubt will interest himself about you and see that your money is not thrown away perhaps you would like to set up a bumboat on your own account added emma laughing no i thank you i had enough of that poor mrs chopper what a kind creature she was i'm sure i ought to be very grateful to her for thinking of me as she did i believe said emma that she was a very good woman and so does mamma recollect joey when you speak to my uncle you must not contradict him i am sure i shall not replied joey why should i contradict a person so far my superior in years and everything else certainly not and as he is fond of argument you had better give up to him at once and indeed continued emma laughing everybody else does in the end i hope you will find a nice situation and that we shall see a great deal of you i am sure i do replied joey for i have no friends that i may see except you how i wish that you did know everything a silence ensued between the young people which was not interrupted until by the appearance of mrs phillips who had seen mr small and had made an engagement for our hero to present himself at nine o'clock on the following morning after which communication our hero took his leave he amused himself during the remainder of that day in walking over the town which at that time presented a most bustling appearance as an expedition was fitting out the streets were crowded with officers of the army navy and marines in their uniforms soldiers and sailors more or less tipsy flaunting ribbons and gaudy colours and every variety of noise was to be heard that could be well imagined from the quacking of a duck with its head out of the basket in which it was confined to be taken on board to the martial music the rolling of the drums and the occasional salutes of artillery to let the world know that some great man had put his foot on board of a ship or had again deigned to tread upon terra firma all was bustle and excitement hurrying jostling cursing and swearing and joey found himself by the manner in which he was shoved about right and left to be in the way of everybody at the time appointed our hero made his appearance at the door and having given his name was asked into the counting house of the establishment where sat mr small and his factotum mr sleek it may be as well here to describe the persons and peculiarities of these two gentlemen mr small certainly did not accord with his name for he was a man full six feet high and stout in proportion he was in face extremely plain with a turned up nose but at the same time there was a lurking good humour in his countenance and a twinkle in his eye which immediately prepossessed you and in a few minutes you forgot that he was not well favoured mr small was very fond of an argument and a joke and he had such a forcible way of maintaining his argument when he happened to be near you that as emma had told our hero few people after a time ventured to contradict him this mode of argument was nothing more than digging the hard knuckles of his large hand into the ribs of his opponent we should rather say gradually gimleting as it were a hole in your side as he heated in his illustrations he was the last person in the world in his disposition to inflict pain even upon an insect and yet from this habit no one perhaps gave more or appeared to do so with more malice as his countenance was radiant with good humour at the very time when his knuckles were taking away your breath what made it worse was that he had a knack of seizing the coat lappet with the other hand so that escape was difficult and when he had exhausted all his reasoning he would follow it up with a pressure of his knuckles under the fifth rib saying now you feel the force of my argument don't you everybody did and no one would oppose him unless the table was between them it was much the same with his jokes he would utter them and then with a loud laugh and the insidious insertion of his knuckles say do you take that eh mr sleek had also his peculiarity and was not an agreeable person to argue with for he had learnt to argue from his many years' constant companionship with the head of the firm mr sleek was a spare man deeply pock marked in the face and with a very large mouth and when speaking he sputtered to such a degree that a quarter of an hour's conversation with him was as good as a shower bath at long range mr sleek could heat his superior out of the field but if mr small approached once to close quarters mr sleek gave in immediately the captains of the navy used to assert that this fibbing enforcement of his truths on the part of small was quite contrary to all the rules of modern warfare and never would stand it unless they required an advance of money and then by submitting to a certain quantity of digs in the ribs in proportion to the unreasonableness of their demand they usually obtained their object as they said he knuckled down in the end as for mr sleek although the best man in the world he was their abhorrence he was nothing but a watering pot and they were not plants which required his aid to add to their vigour mr sleek even in the largest company invariably found himself alone and could never imagine why still he was an important personage and when stock is to be got on board in a hurry officers in his majesty's service do not care about a little spray mr small was as we have observed a navy agent that is to say he was a general provider of the officers and captains of his majesty's service he obtained their agency on any captures which they might send in or he cashed their bills advanced them money supplied them with their wine and every variety of stock which might be required and in consequence was reported to be accumulating a fortune as is usually the case he kept open house for the captains who were his clients and occasionally invited the junior officers to the hospitalities of his table so that mrs phillips and emma were of great use to him and had quite sufficient to do in superintending such an establishment having thus made our readers better acquainted with our new characters we shall proceed well young man i've heard all about you from my sister so you wish to leave off vagabondising do you yes sir replied joey how old are you can you keep books i am seventeen and have kept books replied our hero in innocence for he considered mrs chopper's day books to come under that denomination and you have some money how much joey replied that he had so much of his own and that his sister had so much more seven hundred pounds eh youngster i began business with pounds less and here i am money breeds money do you understand that and here joey received a knuckle in his ribs which almost took his breath away but which he bore without flinching as he presumed it was a mark of good will what can we do with this lad sleek said mr small and what can we do with his money let him stay in the counting house here for a week replied mr sleek and we shall see what he can do and as for his money it will be as safe here as in a country bank until we know how to employ it and we can allow five per cent for it all this was said in a shower of spray which induced joey to wipe his face with his pocket handkerchief yes i think that will do for the present rejoined mr small but you observe sleek that this young lad has very powerful interest and we shall be expected to do something for him or we shall have the worst of it you understand that continued he giving joey a knuckle again the ladies no standing against them joey thought there was no standing such digs in the ribs but he said nothing i leave him to you sleek i must be off to call upon captain james see to the lad's food and lodging there's an order from the gun room of the hecate so saying mr small departed mr sleek asked our hero where he was stopping recommended him another lodging close to the house with directions how to proceed and what arrangements to make told him to haste as much as he could and then come back to the counting house in a couple of hours our hero was back again look on this list do you understand it said mr sleek to joey it is sea stock for the hecate which sails in a day or two if i send a porter with you to the people we deal with would you be able to get all these things which are marked with a cross the wine and the others we have here joey looked over it and was quite at home it was only bumboating on a large scale o yes and i know the prices of all these things replied he i have been used to the supplying of ships at gravesend why then said mr sleek you are the very person i want for i have no time to attend to out door work now the porter was sent for and our hero soon executed his task not only with a precision but with a rapidity that was highly satisfactory to mr sleek as soon as the articles were all collected joey asked whether he should take them on board i understand the work mr sleek and not even an egg shall be broke i promise you the second part of the commission was executed with the same precision by our hero who returned with a receipt of every article having been delivered safe and in good condition mr sleek was delighted with our hero and told mr small so when they met in the evening mr sleek's opinion was given in the presence of mrs phillips and emma who exchanged glances of satisfaction at joey's fortunate debut chapter thirty eight in which the wheel of fortune turns a spoke or two in favour of our hero if we were to analyse the feelings of our hero towards emma phillips we should hardly be warranted in saying that he was in love with her although at seventeen years young men are very apt to be or so to fancy themselves the difference in their positions was so great that although our hero would in his dreams often fancy himself on most intimate terms with his kind little patroness in his waking thoughts she was more an object of adoration and respect a being to whom he was most ardently and devotedly attached one whose friendship and kindness had so wrought upon his best feelings that he would have thought it no sacrifice to die for her but the idea of ever being closer allied to her than he now was had not yet entered into his imagination all he ever thought was that if ever he united himself to any female for life the party selected must be like emma phillips or if not he would remain single all his endeavours were to prove himself worthy of her patronage and to be rewarded by her smiles of encouragement when they met she was the lodestar which guided him on to his path of duty and stimulated by his wishes to find favour in her sight joey never relaxed in his exertions naturally active and methodical he was indefatigable and gave the greatest satisfaction to mr sleek who found more than half the labour taken off his hands and further that if joey once said a thing should be done it was not only well done but done to the very time that was stipulated for its completion joey cared not for meals or anything of that kind and often went without his dinner sleek said small one day that poor boy will be starved it's not my fault sir he won't go to his dinner if there is anything to do and as there is always something to do it's as clear as the day that he can get no dinner i wish he was living in the house altogether and came to his meals with us after the work was done it would be very advantageous and much time saved time is money sleek time saved is money saved and therefore he is worthy of his food it shall be so do you see to it thus in about two months after his arrival joey found himself installed in a nice little bedroom and living at the table of his patron not only constantly in company with the naval officers but what was of more value to him in the company of mrs phillips and emma we must pass over more than a year during which time our hero had become a person of some importance he was a great favourite with the naval captains as his punctuality and rapidity corresponded with their ideas of doing business and it was constantly said to mr sleek or to mr small let o'donahue and i settle the matter and all will go right mr small had already established him at a salary of pounds per annum besides his living in the house and our hero was comfortable and happy he was well known to all the officers from his being constantly on board of their ships and was a great favourite joey soon discovered that emma had a fancy for natural curiosities and as he boarded almost every man of war which came into the port he soon filled her room with a variety of shells and of birds which he procured her these were presents which he could make and which she could accept and not a week passed without our hero adding something to her museum of live and dead objects indeed emma was now grown up and was paid such attention to by the officers who frequented her uncle's house not only on account of her beauty but on account of the expectation that her uncle who was without children would give her a handsome fortune that some emotions of jealousy of which he was hardly conscious would occasionally give severe pain to our hero perhaps as his fortunes rose so did his hopes certain it is that sometimes he was very grave emma was too clear sighted not to perceive the cause and hastened by her little attentions to remove the feeling not that she had any definite ideas upon the subject any more than joey but she could not bear to see him look unhappy such was the state of things when one day mr small said to joey as he was busy copying an order into the books o'donahue i have been laying out some of your money for you indeed sir i'm very much obliged to you yes there was a large stock of claret sold at auction to day it was good and went cheap i have purchased to the amount of pounds on your account you may bottle and bin it here and sell it as you can if you don't like the bargain i'll take it off your hands i am very grateful to you sir replied joey who knew the kindness of the act which in two months more than doubled his capital and as he was permitted to continue the business on his own account he was very soon in a position amounting to independence the french wine business being ever afterwards considered as exclusively belonging to our hero one morning as joey happened to be in the counting house by himself which was rather an unusual occurrence a midshipman came in joey remembered him very well as he had been often there before good morning mr o'donahue said the midshipman is mr small within no he is not can i do anything for you yes if you can tell me how i am to persuade mr small to advance me a little money upon my pay you can do something for me i never heard of such an application before replied joey smiling no that i venture you did not and it requires all the impudence of a midshipman to make such a one but the fact is mr o'donahue i am a mate with pounds a year and upon that i have continued to assist my poor old mother up to the present she now requires pounds in consequence of illness and i have not a farthing i will repay it if i live that is certain but i have little hopes of obtaining it and nothing but my affection for the old lady would induce me to risk the mortification of a refusal it's true enough that he who goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing' i fear it is but i will so far assist you as to let you know what your only chance is state your case to mr small as you have to me to day and then stand close to him while he answers if he puts his knuckles into your ribs to enforce his arguments don't shrink and then wait the result without interrupting him well i'd do more than that for the old lady replied the poor midshipman as mr small made his appearance the midshipman told his story in very few words and mr small heard him without interruption when he had finished mr small commenced you see my man you ask me to do what no navy agent ever did before to lend upon a promise to pay and that promise to pay from a midshipman in the first place i have only the promise without the security that's one point do you observe a punch with the knuckles and then the promise to pay depends whether you are in the country or not again if you have the money you may not have the inclination to pay that's another point then came another sharp impression into the ribs of the middy then again it is not even personal security as you may be drowned shot blown up or taken out of the world before any pay is due to you and by your death you would be unable to pay if so inclined there's a third point and there was a third dig which the middy stood boldly up against insure your life you cannot for you have no money you therefore require me to lend my money upon no security whatever for even allowing that you would pay if you could yet your death might prevent it there's another point and the knuckles again penetrated into the midshipman's side who felt the torture increasing as hope was departing but continued mr small who was evidently much pleased with his own ratiocination there is another point not yet touched upon which is that as good christians we must sometimes lend money upon no security or even give it away for so are we commanded and therefore mr o'donahue you will tell mr sleek to let him have the money there's the last and best point of all eh wound up mr small with a thumping blow upon the ribs of the middy that almost took away his breath we give this as a specimen of mr small's style of practical and theoretical logic combined the admiral sir is coming down the street said sleek entering and i think he is coming here mr small who did not venture to chop logic with admirals but was excessively polite to such great people went out to receive the admiral hat in hand now mr small said the admiral the counting house for business if you please i have very unexpected orders to leave portsmouth i must save the next tide if possible the ships will be ready for you know what our navy can do when required but as you know i have not one atom of stock on board the flood tide has made almost an hour and we must sail at the first of the ebb as twelve hours' delay may be most serious now tell me here is the list of what is required boats will be ready and men in plenty to get it on board can you get it ready by that time by that time sir william replied small looking over the tremendous catalogue it is now eleven o'clock can it all be down by four o'clock that is the latest i can give you impossible sir william it is of the greatest importance that we sail at five o'clock the fact is i must and will but it's hard that i must starve for a whole cruise indeed sir william said mr small if it were possible but two cows so many sheep hay and everything to be got from the country we never could manage it to morrow morning perhaps well mr small i have appointed no prize agent yet had you obliged me our hero now stepped forward and ran over the list can you inform me sir said he to the flag captain whether the zenobia or orestes sail with the squadron no they do not was the reply i beg your pardon mr small said joey but i do think we can accomplish this with a little arrangement indeed cried sir william yes sir william if you would immediately make the signals for two boats to come on shore with steady crews to assist me i promise it shall be done well said o'donahue cried the captain we are all right now admiral if he says it shall be done it will be done may i depend upon you mr o'donahue yes sir william everything shall be as you wish well mr small if your young man keeps his word you shall be my prize agent good morning to you how could you promise cried small addressing our hero when the admiral and suite had left the counting house because i can perform sir replied joey i have the cows and sheep for the zenobia and orestes as well as the fodder all ready in the town we can get others for them to morrow and i know where to lay my hands on everything else well that's lucky but there is no time to be lost our hero with his usual promptitude and activity kept his promise and as mr small said it was lucky for the prize agency in a few months afterwards proved worth to him nearly pounds it is not to be supposed that joey neglected his correspondence either with mary or spikeman although with the latter it was not so frequent mary wrote to him every month she had not many subjects to enter upon chiefly replying to joey's communications and congratulating him upon his success indeed now that our hero had been nearly four years with mr small he might be said to be a very rising and independent person his capital which had increased very considerably had been thrown into the business and he was now a junior partner instead of a clerk and had long enjoyed the full confidence both of his superior and of mr sleek who now entrusted him with almost everything in short joey was in the fair way to competence and distinction chapter thirty nine chapter of infinite variety containing agony law love quarrelling and suicide it may be a subject of interest on the part of the reader to inquire what were the relative positions of emma phillips and our hero now that four years had passed during which time he had been continually in her company and gradually as he rose in importance removing the distance that was between them we have only to reply that the consequences natural to such a case did ensue every year their intimacy increased every year added to the hopes of our hero who now no longer looked upon an alliance with emma as impossible yet he still never felt sufficient confidence in himself or his fortunes to intimate such a thought to her indeed from a long habit of veneration and respect he was in the position of a subject before a queen who feels a partiality towards him he dared not give vent to his thoughts and it remained for her to have the unfeminine task of intimating to him that he might venture but although to outward appearance there was nothing but respect and feelings of gratitude on his part and condescension and amiability on hers there was a rapid adhesion going on within their interviews were more restrained their words more selected for both parties felt how strong were the feelings which they would repress they were both pensive silent and distant would talk unconnectedly running from one subject to another attempting to be lively and unconcerned when they were most inclined to be otherwise and not daring to scrutinise too minutely their own feelings when they found themselves alone but what they would fain conceal from themselves their very attempts to conceal made known to other people who were standing by both mrs phillips and mr small perceived how matters stood and had they any objections would have immediately no longer permitted them to be in contact but they had no objections for our hero had long won the hearts of both mother and uncle and they awaited quietly the time which should arrive when the young parties should no longer conceal their feelings for each other it was when affairs were between our hero and emma phillips as we have just stated that a circumstance took place which for a time embittered all our hero's happiness he was walking down high street when he perceived a file of marines marching towards him with two men between them handcuffed evidently deserters who had been taken up a feeling of alarm pervaded our hero he had a presentiment which induced him to go into a perfumer's shop and to remain there so as to have a view of the faces of the deserters as they passed along without their being able to see him his forebodings were correct one of them was his old enemy and persecutor furness the schoolmaster had a dagger been plunged into joey's bosom the sensation could not have been more painful than what he felt when he once more found himself so near to his dreaded denouncer for a short time he remained so transfixed that the woman who was attending in the shop asked whether she should bring him a glass of water this inquiry made him recollect himself and complaining of a sudden pain in the side he sat down and took the water when it was brought but he went home in despair quite forgetting the business which brought him out and retired to his own room that he might collect his thoughts what was he to do this man had been brought back to the barracks he would be tried and punished and afterwards be set at liberty how was it possible that he could always avoid him or escape being recognised and how little chance had he of escape from furness's searching eye could he bribe him yes he could now he was rich enough but if he did one bribe would only be followed up by a demand for another and a threat of denouncement if he refused flight appeared his only chance but to leave his present position to leave emma it was impossible our hero did not leave his room for the remainder of the day but retired early to bed that he might cogitate for sleep he could not after a night of misery the effects of which were too visibly marked in his countenance on the ensuing morning joey determined to make some inquiries relative to what the fate of furness might be and having made up his mind he accosted a sergeant of marines with whom he had a slight acquaintance and whom he fell in with in the streets he observed to him that he perceived they had deserters brought in yesterday and inquired from what ship they had deserted or from the barracks the sergeant replied that they had deserted from the niobe frigate and had committed theft previous to desertion that they would remain in confinement at the barracks till the niobe arrived and that then they would be tried by a court martial and without doubt for the double offence would go through the fleet joey wished the sergeant good morning and passed on in his way home his altered appearance had attracted the notice of not only his partners but of mrs phillips and had caused much distress to the latter our hero remained the whole day in the counting house apparently unconcerned but in reality thinking and rethinking over and over again his former thoughts at last he made up his mind that he would wait the issue of the court martial before he took any decided steps indeed what to do he knew not we leave the reader to guess the state of mind in which joey remained for a fortnight previous to the return of the niobe frigate from a channel cruise two days after her arrival the signal was made for a court martial the sentence was well known before night it was that the culprits were to go through the fleet on the ensuing day this was however no consolation to our hero he did not feel animosity against furness so much as he did dread of him he did not want his punishment but his absence and security against future annoyance it was about nine o'clock on the next morning when the punishment was to take place that joey came down from his own room he had been thinking all night and had decided that he had no other resource but to quit portsmouth emma and his fair prospects for ever he had resolved so to do to make this sacrifice it was a bitter conclusion to arrive at but it had been come to his haggard countenance when he made his appearance at the breakfast table shocked mrs phillips and emma but they made no remarks the breakfast was passed over in silence and soon afterwards our hero found himself alone with emma who immediately went to him and with tears in her eyes said what is the matter with you you look so ill you alarm us all and you make me quite miserable i am afraid miss phillips miss phillips replied emma i beg your pardon but emma i am afraid that i must leave you leave us yes leave you and portsmouth for ever perhaps why what has occurred i cannot dare not tell will you so far oblige me to say nothing at present but you recollect that i was obliged to leave gravesend on a sudden i recollect you did but why i know not only mary said that it was not your fault i trust it was not so but it was my misfortune emma i am almost distracted i have not slept for weeks but pray believe me when i say that i have done no wrong indeed we are interrupted said emma hurriedly there is somebody coming upstairs she had hardly time to remove a few feet from our hero when captain b of the niobe entered the room good morning miss phillips i hope you are well i just looked in for a moment before i go to the admiral's office we have had a catastrophe on board the niobe which i must report immediately indeed replied emma nothing very serious i hope why no only rid of a blackguard not worth hanging one of the marines who was to have gone round the fleet this morning when he went to the forepart of the ship under the sentry's charge leaped overboard and drowned himself what was his name captain b inquired joey seizing him by the arm his name why how can that interest you o'donahue well if you wish to know it was furness i am very sorry for him replied our hero i knew him once when he was in better circumstances that is all and joey no longer daring to trust himself with others quitted the room and went to his own apartment as soon as he was there he knelt down and returned thanks not for the death of furness but for the removal of the load which had so oppressed his mind in an hour his relief was so great that he felt himself sufficiently composed to go downstairs he went into the drawing room to find emma but she was not there he longed to have some explanation with her but it was not until the next day that he had an opportunity i hardly know what to say to you said our hero or how to explain my conduct of yesterday it certainly appeared very strange especially to captain b who told me that he thought you were mad i care little what he thinks but i care much what you think emma and i must now tell you what perhaps this man's death may permit me to do that he has been most strangely connected with my life is most true he it was who knew me and who would if he could have put me in a situation in which i must either have suffered myself to be thought guilty of a crime which i am incapable of or let it suffice to say have done to exculpate myself what i trust i never would have done or ever will do i can say no more than that without betraying a secret which i am bound to keep and the keeping of which may still prove my own destruction when you first saw me on the wayside emma it was this man who forced me from a happy home to wander about the world it was the reappearance of this man and his recognition of me that induced me to quit gravesend so suddenly i again met him and avoided him when he was deserting and i trusted that as he had deserted i could be certain of living safely in this town without meeting with him it was his reappearance here as a deserter taken up which put me in that state of agony which you have seen me in for these last three weeks and it was the knowledge that after his punishment he would be again free and likely to meet with me when walking about here which resolved me to quit portsmouth as i said to you yesterday morning can you therefore be surprised at my emotion when i heard that he was removed and that there was now no necessity for my quitting my kind patrons and you certainly after this explanation i cannot be surprised at your emotion but what does surprise me mr o'donahue is that you should have a secret of such importance that it cannot be revealed and which has made you tremble at the recognition of that man when at the same time you declare your innocence did innocence and mystery ever walk hand in hand your addressing me as mr o'donahue miss phillips has pointed out to me the impropriety i have been guilty of in making use of your christian name i thought that that confidence which you placed in me when as a mere boy i told you exactly what i now repeat that the secret was not my own would not have been now so cruelly withdrawn i have never varied in my tale and i can honestly say that i have never felt degraded when i have admitted that i have a mystery connected with me nay if it should please heaven that i have the option given me to suffer in my own person or reveal the secret in question i trust that i shall submit to my fate with constancy and be supported in my misfortune by the conviction of my innocence i feel that i was not wrong in the communication that i made to you yesterday morning that i must leave this place i came here because you were living here you to whom i felt so devoted for your kindness and sympathy when i was poor and friendless now that i am otherwise you are pleased to withdraw not only your good will but your confidence in me and as the spell is broken which has drawn me to this spot i repeat that as soon as i can with justice to my patrons i shall withdraw myself from your presence our hero's voice faltered before he had finished speaking and then turning away slowly without looking up he quitted the room chapter forty in which our hero tries change of air the reader will observe that there has been a little altercation at the end of the last chapter emma phillips was guilty of letting drop a received truism or rather a metaphor which offended our hero did innocence and mystery ever walk hand in hand if emma had put that question to us we from our knowledge of the world should have replied yes very often my dear miss phillips but emma was wrong not only in her metaphor but in the time of her making it why did she do so ah that is a puzzling question to answer we can only say at our imminent risk when this narrative shall be perused by the other sex that we have made the discovery that women are not perfect that the very best of the sex are full of contradiction and that emma was a woman that women very often are more endowed than the generality of men we are ready to admit and their cause has been taken up by lady morgan mrs jamieson and many others who can write much better than we can when we say their cause we mean the right of equality they would claim with our sex and not subjection to it reading my lady morgan the other day which next to conversing with her is one of the greatest treats we know of we began to speculate upon what were the causes which had subjected woman to man in other words how was it that man had got the upper hand and kept it that women's minds were not inferior to men's we were forced to admit that their aptitude for cultivation is often greater was not to be denied as to the assertion that man makes laws or that his frame is of more robust material it is no argument as a revolt on the part of the other sex would soon do away with such advantage and men brought up as nursery maids would soon succumb to women who were accustomed to athletic sports from their youth upwards after a great deal of cogitation we came to the conclusion that there is a great difference between the action in the minds of men and women the machinery of the latter being more complex than that of our own sex a man's mind is his despot it works but by one single action it has one ruling principle one propelling power to which all is subservient this power or passion disguised and dormant as it may be in feeble minds is the only one which propels him on this primum mobile as it may be termed is ambition or in other words self love everything is sacrificed to it now as in proportion as a machine is simple so is it strong in its action so in proportion that a machine is complex it becomes weak and if we analyse a woman's mind we shall find that her inferiority arises from the simple fact that there are so many wheels within wheels working in it so many compensating balances if we may use the term and we use it to her honour that although usually more right minded than man her strength of action is lost and has become feeble by the time that her decision has been made what will a man allow to stand in the way of his ambition love no friendship no he will sacrifice the best qualities and which is more difficult make the worst that are in his disposition subservient to it he moves only one great principle one propelling power and the action being single it is strong in proportion but will a woman's mind decide in this way will she sacrifice to ambition love or friendship or natural ties no in her mind the claims of each are generally speaking fairly balanced and the quotient after the calculation has been worked out although correct is small our argument after all only goes to prove that women abstractedly taken have more principle more conscience and better regulated minds than men which is true if if they could always go correct as timekeepers but the more complex the machine the more difficult it is to keep it in order the more likely it is to be out of repair and its movements to be disarranged by a trifling shock which would have no effect upon one of such simple and powerful construction as that in our own sex not only do they often go wrong but sometimes the serious shocks which they are liable to in this world will put them in a state which is past all repair we have no doubt that by this time the reader will say never mind women's minds but mind your own business we left emma in the drawing room rather astonished at our hero's long speech and still more by his for the first time during their acquaintance venturing to breathe a contrary opinion to her own sweet self emma phillips although she pouted a little and the colour had mounted to her temples nevertheless looked very lovely as she pensively reclined on the sofa rebuked by him who had always been so attentive so submissive her creature as it were she was mortified as every pretty woman is at any loss of power any symptoms of rebellion on the part of a liege vassal and then she taxed herself had she done wrong she had said innocence and mystery did not walk hand in hand was not that true she felt that it was true and her own opinion was corroborated by others for she had read it in some book either in burke or rochefoucault or some great author miss phillips bit the tip of her nail and thought again yes she saw how it was our hero had risen in the world was independent and was well received in society he was no longer the little joey of gravesend he was now a person of some consequence and he was a very ungrateful fellow but the world was full of ingratitude still she did think better of our hero she certainly did well at all events she could prove to him that what she did not exactly know thus ended cogitation the second after which came another series what had our hero said what had he accused her of that she no longer bestowed on him her confidence placed in him for many years this was true but were not the relative positions was not the case different should he now retain any secret from her there should be no secrets between them there again there was a full stop before the sentence was complete after a little more reflection her own generous mind pointed out to her that she had been in the wrong and that our hero had cause to be offended with her and she made up her mind to make reparation the first time that they should be alone having come to this resolution she dismissed the previous question and began to think about the secret itself and what it possibly could be and how she wished she knew what it was all of which was very natural in the meantime our hero had made up his mind to leave portsmouth for a time at all events this quarrel with emma if such it might be considered had made him very miserable and the anxiety he had lately suffered had seriously affected his health we believe that there never was anybody in this world who had grown to man's or woman's estate and had mixed with the world who could afterwards say that they were at any time perfectly happy or who having said so did not find that the reverse was the case a moment or two after the words were out of their mouth there is always something as a good lady said to us and so there always is and always will be the removal of furness was naturally a great relief to the mind of our hero he then felt as if all his difficulties were surmounted and that he had no longer any fear of the consequences which might ensue from his father's crime he would now he thought be able to walk boldly through the world without recognition and he had built castles enough to form a metropolis when his rupture with emma broke the magic mirror through which he had scanned futurity when most buoyant with hope he found the truth of the good lady's saying there is always something after remaining in his room for an hour joey went down to the counting house where he found mr small and mr sleek both at work for their labours had increased since joey had so much neglected business well my good friend how do you find yourself said mr small very far from well sir i feel that i cannot attend to business replied joey and i am quite ashamed of myself i was thinking that if you had no objection to allow me a couple of months' leave of absence change of air would be very serviceable to me i have something to do at dudstone which i have put off ever since i came to portsmouth i think change of air would be very serviceable to you my dear fellow replied mr small but what business you can have at dudstone i cannot imagine simply this i locked up my apartments leaving my furniture books and linen when i went away more than four years ago and have never found time to look after them well they must want dusting by this time o'donahue so look after them if you please but i think looking after your health is of more consequence so you have my full consent to take a holiday and remain away three months if necessary till you are perfectly re established and you have mine added mr sleek and i will do your work while you are away our hero thanked his senior partners for their kind compliance with his wishes and stated his intention of starting the next morning by the early coach and then left the counting house to make preparations for his journey joey joined the party which was numerous at dinner it was not until they were in the drawing room after dinner that mr small had an opportunity of communicating to mrs phillips what were our hero's intentions mrs phillips considered it a very advisable measure as joey had evidently suffered very much lately probably over exertion might have been the cause and relaxation would effect the cure emma who was sitting by her mother turned pale she had not imagined that our hero would have followed up his expressed intentions of the morning and she asked mr small if he knew when o'donahue would leave portsmouth the reply was that he had taken his place on the early coach of the next morning and emma fell back on the sofa and did not say anything more when the company had all left mrs phillips rose and lighted a chamber candlestick to go to bed and emma followed the motions of her mother mrs phillips shook hands with our hero wishing him a great deal of pleasure and that he would return quite restored in health emma who found that all chance of an interview with our hero was gone mustered up courage enough to extend her hand and say i hope your absence will be productive of health and happiness to you mr o'donahue and then followed her mother joey who was in no humour for conversation then bade farewell to mr small and mr sleek and before emma had risen from not a very refreshing night's rest he was two stages on his way from portsmouth chapter forty one in which our hero has his head turned the wrong way although it may be very proper when an offence has been offered us to show that we feel the injury it often happens that we act too much upon impulse and carry measures to extremities and this our hero felt as the coach wheeled him along every second increasing his distance from emma phillips twenty times he was inclined to take a postchaise and return but the inconsistency would have been so glaring that shame prevented him so he went on until he reached the metropolis and on arriving there having nothing better to do he went to bed the next day he booked himself for the following day's coach to manstone and having so done he thought he would reconnoitre the domicile of major and mrs mcshane and now that furness was no longer to be dreaded make his existence known to them he went to holborn accordingly and found the shop in the same place with the usual enticing odour sent forth from the grating which gave light and air to the kitchen but he perceived that there was no longer the name of mcshane on the private door and entering the coffee room and looking towards the spot where mrs mcshane usually stood carving the joint he discovered a person similarly employed whose face was unknown to him in fact it could not be mrs mcshane as it was a man our hero went up to him and inquired if the mcshanes still carried on the business and was told that they had sold it some time back his next inquiry as to what had become of them produced an i don't know with some symptoms of impatience at being interrupted under such circumstances our hero had nothing more to do but either to sit down and eat beef or to quit the premises he preferred the latter and was once more at the hotel where he dedicated the remainder of the day to thinking of his old friends as fate had debarred him from seeing them the next morning joey set off by the coach and arrived at manstone a little before dusk he remained at the principal inn of the village called the austin arms in honour of the property in the immediate vicinity and having looked at the various quarterings of arms that the signboard contained without the slightest idea that they appertained to himself he ordered supper and looking out of the window of the first floor discovered at no great distance down the one street which composed the village the small ale house where he had before met mary our hero no longer felt the pride of poverty he had resented the treatment he had received at the hall when friendless but now that he was otherwise he had overcome the feeling and had resolved to go up to the hall on the following day and ask for mary he was now well dressed and with all the appearance and manners of a gentleman and moreover he had been so accustomed to respect from servants that he had no idea of being treated otherwise the next morning therefore he walked up to the hall and knocking at the door as soon as it was opened he told the well powdered domestics that he wished to speak a few words to miss atherton if she still lived with mrs austin his appearance was considered by these gentlemen in waiting as sufficient to induce them to show him into a parlour and to send for mary who in a few minutes came down to him and embraced him tenderly i should hardly have known you my dear boy said she as the tears glistened in her eyes you have grown quite a man i cannot imagine as you now stand before me that you could have been the little joey that was living at mrs chopper's we are indebted to that good woman for our prosperity replied joey do you know mary that your money has multiplied so fast that i almost wish that you would take it away lest by some accident it should be lost i have brought you an account let me have an account of yourself my dear brother replied mary i have no want of money i am here well and happy so you must have been for you look as young and handsome as when i last saw you mary how is your mistress she is well and would i think be happy if it were not for the strange disease of mr austin who secludes himself entirely and will not even go outside of the park gates he has become more overbearing and haughty than ever and several of the servants have quitted within the last few months i have no wish to meet him dear mary after what passed when i was here before i will not put up with insolence from any man even in his own house replied our hero do not speak so loud his study is next to us and that door leads to it replied mary he would not say anything to you but he would find fault with me then you had better come to see me at the austin arms where i am stopping i will come this evening replied mary at this moment the door which led to the study was opened and a voice was heard mary i wish you would take your sweethearts to a more convenient distance joey heard the harsh hollow voice but recognised it not he would not turn round to look at mr austin but remained with his back to him and the door closed again with a bang well observed joey that is a pretty fair specimen of what he is at all events why did you not say i was your brother because it was better to say nothing replied mary he will not come in again well i shall leave you now said joey and wait till the evening you will be certain to come o yes i certainly shall replied mary hush i hear my mistress with mr austin i wish you could see her you would like her very much the outer door of the study was closed to and then the door of the room in which they were conversing was opened but it was shut again immediately who was that said our hero who had not turned round to ascertain mrs austin she just looked in and seeing i was engaged she only nodded to me to say that she wanted me i presume and then went away again replied mary you had better go now and i will be sure to come in the evening our hero quitted the hall he had evidently been in the presence of his father and mother without knowing it and all because he happened on both occasions to have his face turned in a wrong direction and he left the house as unconscious as he went in as soon as our hero had left the hall mary repaired to her mistress do you want me madam said mary as she went to her mistress no mary not particular but mr austin sent for me he was annoyed at your having a strange person in the house and desired me to send him away it was my brother madam replied mary your brother i am very sorry mary but you know how nervous mr austin is and there is no reasoning against nerves i should have liked to have seen your brother very much if i recollect rightly you told me he was doing well at portsmouth is he not yes madam he is now a partner in one of the first houses there why mary he will soon have you to keep his own house i presume and i shall lose you indeed your are more fit for such a situation than your present one so i must not regret it if you do he has no idea of taking a house madam replied mary nor have i any of quitting you your place is quite good enough for me i promised to go down and meet him this evening with your permission at the austin arms certainly replied mrs austin and then the conversation dropped our hero remained at the inn two days a portion of which mary passed with him and then he set off for dudstone he did not make mary a confident of his attachment to emma phillips although he imparted to her the death of furness and the relief it had afforded him promising to return to see her before he went back to portsmouth joey once more set off on his travels and without incident arrived at the good old town of dudstone where he put up at the commercial hotel his only object was to ascertain the condition of his lodgings for the first two years he had sent the rent of the room to the old woman to whom the house belonged but latterly no application had been made for it although his address had been given and occupied by other business more important our hero had quite forgotten the affair or if he did occasionally recall it to his memory it was soon dismissed again his key he had brought with him and he now proceeded to the house and knocked at the door surmising that the old woman was possibly dead and his property probably disposed of the first part of the surmise was disproved by the old woman coming to the door she did not recognise our hero and it was not until he produced the key of his room that she was convinced that he was the lawful owner of its contents she told him she could not write herself and that the party who had written to portsmouth for her was dead and that she felt sure he would come back at some time and settle with her and moreover she was afraid that the furniture would be much injured by having been shut up so long which was not only very likely but proved to be the case when the door was opened she also said that she could have made money for him had he allowed her to let the lodgings furnished as she had had several applications our hero walked into his apartment which certainly had a very mothy and mouldy appearance as soon as a fire had been lighted he collected all that he wanted to retain for himself the books plate and some other articles which he valued for spikeman's sake and as old reminiscences and putting them up in a chest requested that it might be sent to the inn and then upon reflection he thought he could do no better with the remainder than to make them a present to the old woman which he did after paying up her arrears of rent and by so doing made one person for the time superlatively happy which is something worth doing in this chequered world of ours joey as soon as he had returned to the inn sat down to write to spikeman and also to mr small at portsmouth and having posted his letters as he did not quit dudstone until the next morning he resolved to pay a visit to his former acquaintances miss amelia and miss ophelia his knock at the door was answered by miss amelia as usual but with only one arm unoccupied a baby being in the other and the squalling in the little parlour gave further evidence of matrimony our hero was obliged to introduce himself as he was stared at as an utter stranger he was then immediately welcomed and requested to walk into the parlour in a few minutes the whole of the family history was communicated the old lady had been dead three years and at her death the young ladies found themselves in possession of one thousand pounds each this thousand pounds proved to them that husbands were to be had even at dudstone and its vicinity miss amelia had been married more than two years to a master builder who had plenty of occupation not so much in building new houses at dudstone as in repairing the old ones and they were doing well and had two children her sister had married a young farmer and she could see her money every day in the shape of bullocks and sheep upon the farm they also were doing well joey remained an hour mrs potts was very anxious that he should remain longer and give her his opinion of her husband but this joey declined and desiring to be kindly remembered to her sister took his leave and the next morning was on his way to london chapter forty two very pleasant correspondence as soon as joey arrived at the metropolis he went to the correspondent of the house at portsmouth to inquire for letters he found one of the greatest interest from mr small who after some preliminaries relative to the business and certain commissions for him to transact in town proceeded as follows your health has been a source of great anxiety to us all not only in the counting house but in the drawing room the cause of your illness was ascribed to over exertion in your duties and it must be admitted that until you were ill there was no relaxation on your part but we have reason to suppose that there have been other causes which may have occasioned your rapid change from activity and cheerfulness to such a total prostration of body and mind you may feel grieved when i tell you that emma has been very unwell since you left and the cause of her illness is beyond the skill of mr taylor our medical man she has however confided so much to her mother as to let us know that you are the party who has been the chief occasion of it she has acknowledged that she has not behaved well to you and has not done you justice and i really believe that it is this conviction which is the chief ground of her altered state of health i certainly have been too much in the counting house to know what has been going on in the parlour but i think that you ought to know us better than to suppose that we should not in every point be most anxious for your happiness and your being constantly with us that emma blames herself is certain that she is very amiable is equally so your return would give us the greatest satisfaction i hardly need say i love my niece and am anxious for her happiness i love you my dear friend and am equally anxious for yours and i do trust that any trifling disagreement between you for surely you must be on intimate terms to quarrel and for her to feel the quarrel so severely will be speedily overcome from what her mother says i think that her affections are seriously engaged i treat you with the confidence i am sure you deserve and i am sure that there is no one upon whom i would so willingly bestow my niece or as i find by questioning no one to whom mrs phillips would so willingly entrust her daughter if then i am right in my supposition you will be received with open arms by all not even excepting emma she has no coquetry in her composition like all the rest of us she has her faults but if she has her faults she is not too proud to acknowledge them and that you will allow when you read the enclosed which she has requested me to send to you and at the same time desired me to read it first i trust this communication will accelerate your recovery and that we shall soon see you again at all events answer my letter and if i am in error let me know that i may undeceive others the enclosure from emma was then opened by our hero it was in few words my dear friend on reflection i consider that i have treated you unjustly i intended to tell you so if i had had an opportunity before you quitted us so hastily my fault has preyed upon my mind ever since and i cannot lose this first opportunity of requesting your forgiveness and hoping that when we meet we shall be on the same friendly terms that we always had been previous to my unfortunate ebullition of temper yours truly emma that this letter was a source of unqualified delight to our hero may be easily imagined he was at once told by the uncle and certainly emma did not leave him to suppose the contrary that he might aspire and obtain her hand our hero could not reply to it by return of post if distress had occasioned his illness joy now prostrated him still more and he was compelled to return to his bed but he was happy almost too happy and he slept at last and he dreamt such visions as only can be conjured up by those who have in anticipation every wish of their heart gratified the next day he replied to mr small's acknowledging with frankness his feelings towards his niece which a sense of his own humble origin and unworthiness had prevented him from venturing to disclose and requesting him to use his influence in his favour as he dared not speak himself until he had received such assurance of his unmerited good fortune as might encourage him so to do to emma his reply was in a few words he thanked her for her continued good opinion of him the idea of having lost which had made him very miserable assuring her that he was ashamed of the petulance which he had shown and that it was for him to have asked pardon and not one who had behaved so kindly and protected him for so long a period that he felt much better already and hoped to be able to shorten the time of absence which had been demanded by him and kindly granted by his patrons having concluded and despatched these epistles our hero determined that he would take a stroll about the metropolis chapter forty three a very long chapter with a very long story which could not well be cut in half a man may walk a long while in the city of london without having any definite object and yet be amused for there are few occupations more pleasant more instructive or more contemplative than looking into the shop windows you pay a shilling to see an exhibition whereas in this instance you have the advantage of seeing many without paying a farthing provided that you look after your pocket handkerchief thus was our hero amused at one shop he discovered that very gay shawls were to be purchased for one pound bandanas at shillings pence and soiled irish linen remarkably cheap at another he saw a row of watches from humble silver at pounds shillings to gold and enamelled at twelve or fourteen guineas all warranted to go well at another he discovered that furs were at half price because nobody wore them in the summer he proceeded further and came to where there was a quantity of oil paintings exposed for sale pointing out to the passer by that pictures of that description were those which he ought not to buy a print shop gave him an idea of the merits of composition and design shown by the various masters and as he could not transport himself to the vatican it was quite as well to see what the vatican contained his thoughts were on rome and her former glories a tobacconist's transported him to the state of virginia where many had been transported in former days a grocer's wafted him still farther to the west indies and the negroes and from these as if by magic to the spice islands and their aromatic groves but an old curiosity shop with bronzes china marqueterie point lace and armour embraced at once a few centuries and he thought of the feudal times the fifteenth century the belle of former days the amber headed cane and snuff box of the beaux who sought her smiles all gone all dust the workmanship of the time even portions of their dresses still existing everything less perishable than man our hero proceeded on his thoughts wandering as he wandered himself when his attention was attracted by one of those placards the breed of which appears to have been very much improved of late as they get larger and larger every day what they will end in there is no saying unless it be in placards without end this placard intimated that there was a masquerade at vauxhall on that evening besides tire works water works and anything but good works our hero had heard of vauxhall and his curiosity was excited and he resolved that he would pass away the evening in what was at that time a rather fashionable resort it was half past six and time to go so he directed his steps over westminster bridge and having only lost three minutes in peeping through the balustrades at the barges and wherries proceeding up and down the river after asking his way three times he found himself at the entrance and paying his admission walked in there was a goodly sprinkling of company but not many masks there was a man clad in brass armour who stood quite motionless for the armour was so heavy that he could hardly bear the weight of it he must have suffered a very great inconvenience on such a warm night but people stared at him as they passed by and he was more than repaid by the attention which he attracted so he stood and suffered on there were about twenty five clowns in their motley dresses seven or eight pantaloons three devils and perhaps forty or fifty dominoes joey soon found himself close to the orchestra which was a blaze of light and he listened very attentively to a lady in ostrich feathers who was pouring out a bravura which was quite unintelligible to the audience while the gentlemen behind her in their cocked hats accompanied her voice he was leaning against one of the trees and receiving without knowing it the drippings of a leaky lamp upon his coat when two men came up and stopped on the other side of the trunk of the tree and one said to the other i tell you joseph she is here and with the christian manasseh traced her by the driver of the coach she will never return to her father's house if we do not discover her this night what will she become a meshumed an apostate exclaimed the other i would see her in her grave first holy father the daughter of a rabbi to bring such disgrace upon her family truly our sins and the sins of our forefathers have brought this evil upon our house if i meet him here i will stab him to the heart leemaan hashem for the sake of the holy name my son think of what you say you must not be so rash alas alas but we are mixed with the heathens she must be concealed in one of the moabitish garments continued the elder of the two personages whom our hero had of course ascertained to be of the house of israel manasseh tells me that he has discovered from another quarter that the christian had procured a domino black with the sleeves slashed with white that will be a distinguishing mark and if we see that dress we must then follow and if a female is with it it must be thy sister miriam i will search now and meet you here in half an hour replied the younger of the two joseph my son we do not part i cannot trust you in your anger and you have weapons with you i know we must go together rooch hakodesh may the holy spirit guide us and the daughter of our house be restored for she is now my heart's bitterness and my soul's sorrow let me but discover the gaw the infidel replied the son following the father and our hero observed him put his hand into his breast and half unsheath a poniard joey easily comprehended how the matter stood a jewish maiden had met by assignation or had been run away with by some young man and the father and son were in pursuit to recover the daughter that is all very well thought our hero but although they may very properly wish to prevent the marriage i do not much like the cold steel which the young israelite had in his hand if i do meet with the party at all events i will give him warning and joey having made this resolution turned away from the orchestra and went down the covered way which led to what are usually termed the dark walks he had just arrived at the commencement of them when he perceived coming towards him two dominoes the shorter hanging on the arm of the taller so as to assure him that they were male and female when they came to within ten yards of the lighted walk they turned abruptly and then joey perceived that the taller had white slashed sleeves to his domino there they are thought our hero well it's not safe for them to walk here for a murder might be committed without much chance of the party being found out i will give them a hint at all events and joey followed the couple so as to overtake them by degrees as he walked softly and they were in earnest conversation his approach was not heeded until within a few feet of them when the taller domino turned impatiently round as if to inquire what the intruder meant you are watched and in danger sir if you are the party i think you are said joey going up to him and speaking in a low voice who are you replied the domino that gives this notice a perfect stranger to you even if your mask was removed sir but i happened to overhear a conversation relative to a person in a domino such as you wear i may be mistaken and if so there is no harm done and our hero turned away stop him dear henry said a soft female voice i fear that there is danger he can have told you but from kindness the person in the domino immediately followed joey and accosted him apologising for his apparent rudeness at receiving his communication which he ascribed to the suddenness with which it was given and requested as a favour that our hero would inform him why he had thought it necessary i will tell you certainly not that i interfere with other people's concerns but when i saw that one of them had a poniard a poniard exclaimed the female who had now joined them yes replied joey and appeared determined to use it in one word madam is your name miriam if so what i heard concerns you if not it does not and i need say no more sir it does concern her replied the domino and i will thank you to proceed our hero then stated briefly what he had overheard and that the parties were then in pursuit of them we are lost exclaimed the young woman we shall never escape from the gardens what must we do my brother in his wrath is as a lion's whelp i care little for myself replied the domino i could defend myself but if we meet i shall lose you your father would tear you away while i was engaged with your brother at all events sir i should recommend your not remaining in these dark walks replied our hero now that you are aware of what may take place and yet if we go into the lighted part of the gardens they will soon discover us now that they have as it appears gained a knowledge of my dress then put it off said joey but they know my person even better rejoined the domino your conduct sir has been so kind that perhaps you would be inclined to assist us our hero was in love himself and of course felt sympathy for others in the same predicament so he replied that if he could be of service they might command him then miriam dear what i propose is this will you put yourself under the protection of this stranger i think you risk nothing for he has proved that he is kind you may then without fear of detection pass through the gardens and be conducted by him to a place of safety i will remain here for half an hour should your father and brother meet me although they may recognise my dress yet not having you with me there will be no grounds for any attack being made and i will after a time return home and what is to become of me exclaimed the terrified girl you must send this gentleman to my address to morrow morning and he will acquaint me where you are i am giving you a great deal of trouble sir but at the same time i show my confidence i trust it will not interfere with your other engagements your confidence is i trust not misplaced sir replied our hero and i am just now an idle man i promise you if this young lady will venture to trust herself with a perfect stranger that i will do your request i have no mask on madam do you think you can trust me i think i can sir indeed i must do so or there will be shedding of blood but henry they are coming i know them see right up the walk joey turned round and perceived the two persons whose conversation he had overheard it is they sir said he to the gentleman in the domino leave us and walk back farther into the dark part i must take her away on my arm and pass them boldly come sir quick our hero immediately took the young jewess on his arm and walked towards the father and brother he felt her trembling like an aspen as they came close to them and was fearful that her legs would fail her as they passed the face of our hero was severely scrutinised by the dark eyes of the israelites joey returned their stare and proceeded on his way and after they had separated some paces from the father and brother he whispered to the maiden you are safe now joey conducted his charge through the gardens and when he arrived at the entrance he called a coach and put the lady in where shall we drive to inquired our hero i don't know say anywhere so that we are away from this joey ordered the man to drive to the hotel where he had taken up his abode for he knew not where else to go on his arrival he left the young lady in the coach while he went in to prepare the landlady for her appearance he stated that he had rescued her from a very perilous situation and that he would feel much obliged to his hostess if she would take charge of the young person until she could be restored to her friends on the ensuing morning people like to be consulted and to appear of importance the fat old lady who had bridled up at the very mention of the introduction of a lady in a domino as soon as she heard that the party was to be placed under her protection relaxed her compressed features and graciously consented our hero having consigned over his charge whose face he had not yet seen immediately retired to his own apartment the next morning about nine o'clock he sent to inquire after the health of his protegee and was answered by a request that he would pay her a visit when he entered the room he found her alone she was dressed somewhat in the oriental style and he was not a little surprised at her extreme beauty her stature was rather above the middle size she was exquisitely formed and her hands ankles and feet were models of perfection she was indeed one of the most exquisite specimens of the jewish nation and that is quite sufficient for her portrait she rose as he entered and coloured deeply as she saluted him our hero who perceived her confusion hastened to assure her that he was ready to obey any order she might be pleased to give him and trusted that she had not been too much annoyed with her very unpleasant position i am more obliged to you sir than i can well express replied she by your kind consideration in putting me into the charge of the landlady of the house that one act assured me that i was in the hands of a gentleman and man of honour all i have to request of you now is that you will call at number berkeley square and inform mr s of what you have kindly done for me you will probably hear from him the cause of the strange position in which you found us and relieved us from as our hero had nothing to reply he wrote down the address and took his leave immediately proceeding to the house of mr s but as he was walking up berkeley street he was encountered by two men whom he immediately recognised as the father and brother of the young israelite the brother fixed his keen eye upon our hero and appeared to recognise him at all events as our hero passed them they turned round and followed him and he heard the brother say he was with her or something to that purport our hero did not however consider that it was advisable to wait until they were away before he knocked at the door as he felt convinced they were on the watch and that any delay would not obtain the end he knocked and was immediately admitted he found mr s pacing the room up and down in great anxiety the breakfast remaining on the table untouched he warmly greeted the arrival of our hero joey as soon as he had informed him of what he had done and in whose hands he had placed the young lady stated the circumstance of the father and brother being outside on the watch and that he thought that they had recognised him that is nothing more than what i expected replied mr s but i trust easily to evade them they are not aware that the back of this house communicates with the stables belonging to it in the mews and we can go out by that way without their perceiving us i've so many thanks to offer you sir for your kind interference in our behalf that i hardly know how to express them to one thing you are most certainly entitled and i should prove but little my sincerity if i did not immediately give it you that is my confidence and a knowledge of the parties whom you have assisted and the circumstances attending this strange affair the young lady sir is as you know a jewess by birth and the daughter of a rabbi a man of great wealth and high ancestry for certainly jews can claim the latter higher than any other nation upon earth i am myself a man of fortune as it is usually termed at all events with sufficient to indulge any woman i should take as my wife with every luxury that can be reasonably demanded i mention this to corroborate my assertion that it was not her father's wealth which has been my inducement i made the acquaintance of the father and daughter when i was travelling on the continent he was on his way to england when his carriage broke down in a difficult pass on the mountains and they would have been left on the road for the night if i had not fortunately come up in time and being alone was able to convey them to the next town i have always had a great respect for the jewish nation i consider that every true christian should have but i will not enter upon that point now it was probably my showing such a feeling and my being well versed in their history which was the occasion of an intercourse of two days ripening into a regard for one another and we parted with sincere wishes that we might meet again in this country at the time i speak of which was about three years ago his daughter miriam was comparatively speaking a child and certainly not at that period or indeed for some time after our meeting again in england did it ever come into my ideas that i should ever feel anything for her but good will but circumstances and her father's confidence in me threw us much together she has no mother after a time i found myself growing attached to her and i taxed myself and reflected on the consequences i was aware how very severe the jewish laws were upon the subject of any of their family uniting themselves to a christian that it was not only considered that the party concerned was dishonoured before the nation but that the whole family became vile and were denied the usual burial rites perhaps you are aware that if a jew embraces christianity the same disgrace is heaped upon the relations with this knowledge i determined to conquer my feelings for miriam and of course i no longer went to her father's house it would have been cruel to put my friend for such he certainly was in such a position the more so as being a rabbi he would have to denounce himself and his own children my absence was however the cause of great annoyance to the father he sought me and i was so pressed by him to return that i had no choice unless i confessed my reasons which i did not like to do i therefore visited the house as before although not so frequently and continually found myself in company with miriam and her father being constantly summoned away to the duties of his office but too often alone i therefore resolved that i would once more set off on my travels as the only means by which i could act honourably and get rid of the feeling which was obtaining such a mastery over me i went to the house to state my intention and at the same time bid them farewell when ascending the stairs i slipped and sprained my ankle so severely that i could not put my foot to the ground this decided our fate and i was not only domiciled for a week in the house but as i lay on the sofa was continually attended by miriam her father would not hear of my removal but declared that my accident was a judgment against me for my rash intention that miriam showed her regard for me in every way that a modest maiden could do is certain i did however make one last struggle i did not deny my feelings towards her but i pointed out to her the consequences which would ensue which it was my duty as a friend and her duty as a daughter to prevent she heard me in silence and in tears and then quitted the room the next day she appeared to have recovered her composure and entered freely into general conversation and after a time referred to the rites of their church by degrees she brought up the subject of christianity she demanded the reasons and authority for our belief in short she induced me to enter warmly into the subject and to prove to the best of my ability that the true messiah had already come this conversation she took a pleasure in renewing during my stay in the house and as i considered that the subject was one that diverted our attention from the one i wished to avoid i was not sorry to enter upon it although i had not the least idea of converting her to our faith such was the state of affairs when i quitted the house and again seriously thought of removing myself from so much temptation when her brother joseph arrived from madrid where he had been staying with an uncle for some years and his return was the occasion of a jubilee at which i could not refuse to appear he is a fine young man very intelligent and well informed but of a very irascible disposition and his long residence in spain has probably given him those ideas of retaliation which are almost unknown in this country he conceived a very strong friendship for me and i certainly was equally pleased with him for he is full of talent although he is revengeful proud of his lineage and holding to the tenets of his faith with all the obstinacy of a pharisee indeed it is strange that he could ever become so partial to a christian respecting as he does the rabbinical doctrines held forth to the jewish people and which it must be admitted have been inculcated in consequence of the unwearied and unjustifiable persecution of the tribes for centuries by those who call themselves christians but whose practice has been at open variance with the precepts of the founder of their faith however so it was joseph conceived a great regard for me was continually at my house and compelled me but too often to visit at his father's at last i made up my mind that i would leave the country for a time and was actively preparing intending to go without saying a word to them when i found myself one morning alone with miriam she walked up to me as i was sitting on the couch i motioned to her to sit by me but she stood before me with a stately air fixing upon me her dark gazelle like eyes do you' said she in a slow and solemn tone of voice do you remember the conversation which we had upon our respective creeds do you recollect how you pointed out to me your authorities and your reasons for your faith and your sincere belief that the messiah had already come' i do miriam' replied i but not with any view to interfere with your non belief it was only to uphold by argument my own' i do not say nay to that i believe you' said miriam nevertheless i have that in my vest which if it was known to my father or brother would cause them to dash me to the earth and to curse me in the name of the great jehovah' and she pulled out of her vest a small copy of the new testament this is the book of your creed i have searched and compared it with our own i have found the authorities i have read the words of the jews who have narrated the history and the deeds of jesus of nazareth and i am a christian' it may appear strange but i assure you sir you cannot imagine the pain i felt when miriam thus acknowledged herself a convert to our faith to say to her that i was sorry for it would have argued little for my christian belief but when i reflected upon the pain and disgrace it would bring upon her family and that i should be the cause i was dreadfully shocked i could only reply miriam i wish that we had never met' i know what your feelings are but too well' replied she but we have met and what is done cannot be undone i too when i think of my relations am torn with anxiety and distress but what is now my duty if i am and i declare not only by the great jehovah but by the crucified messiah that i am a sincere believer in your creed must i shrink must i conceal it on account of my father and my brother does not he say leave all and follow me must i not add my feeble voice in acknowledgement of the truth if i am to consider myself a christian must not my avowal be public yes it must be and it shall be can you blame me' oh no i dare not blame you' replied i i only regret that religious differences should so mar the little happiness permitted to us in this world and that neither jew nor christian will admit what our saviour has distinctly declared that there is no difference between the jew and the greek or gentile i see much misery in this and i cannot help regretting deeply that i shall be considered as the cause of it and be upbraided with ingratitude' you did your duty' replied miriam i have been converted by your having so done now i have my duty to do i am aware of the pain it will occasion my father my relations and the whole of our tribe but if they suffer shall i not suffer more thrust out from my father's door loaded with curses and execration not one jew permitted to offer me an asylum not even to give me a morsel of bread or a drop of water a wanderer and an outcast such must be my fate' not so miriam if your tribe desert you ' stop one moment' interrupted miriam do you recollect the conversation you had with me before we entered into the subject of our relative creeds do you remember what you then said and was it true or was it merely as an excuse' it was as true miriam as i stand here i have loved you long and devotedly i have tried to conquer the passion on account of the misery your marriage with a christian would have occasioned your relations but if you persist in avowing your new faith the misery will be equally incurred and therefore i am doubly bound not only by my love but because i have by converting you put you in such a dreadful position to offer you not only an asylum but if you will accept them my heart and hand' miriam folded her arms across her breast and knelt down with her eyes fixed upon the floor i can only answer in the words of ruth' replied she in a low voice and with trembling lips i hardly need observe that after this interview the affair was decided the great difficulty was to get her out of the house for you must have been inside of one of the houses of a jew of rank to be aware of their arrangements it was impossible that miriam could be absent an hour without being missed and to go out by herself without being seen was equally difficult her cousin is married to a jew who keeps the masquerade paraphernalia and costumes in tavistock street and she sometimes accompanies her father and brother there and as usual goes up to her cousin in the women's apartment while her male relations remain below we therefore hit upon this plan that on the first masquerade night at vauxhall she should persuade her father and brother to go with her to her cousin's that i should be close by in a coach and after she had gone in i was to drive up as the other customers do and obtain two dominoes and then wait while she escaped from the women's apartment and came down stairs to the street door where i was to put her in the coach and drive off to vauxhall you may inquire why we went to vauxhall because as but few minutes would elapse before she would be missed it would have been almost impossible to have removed her without being discovered for i was well known to the people you recollect that manasseh who was in the shop informed them that my domino was slashed with white in my sleeves he knew me when i obtained the dominoes had i not been aware of the violence of the brother i should have cared little had he followed me to my house or any other place he might have traced me to but his temper is such that his sister would certainly have been sacrificed to his rage and fury as you may imagine from what you have seen and heard i considered therefore that if we once became mixed with the crowd of masks and dominoes at vauxhall i should elude them and all trace of us be lost i believe now that i have made you acquainted with every circumstance and trust that you will still afford me your valuable assistance most certainly replied our hero i am in duty bound i cannot help thinking that they have recognised me as the party conducting her out of the dark walk did you meet them afterwards no rejoined mr s i allowed them to walk about without coming up to me for some time and then when they were down at the farthest end i made all haste and took a coach home before they could possibly come up with me allowing that they did recognise me which i do not think they did until they perceived me hastening away at a distance what then are your present intentions inquired our hero i wish you to return with me to your hotel replied mr s i will then take a chaise and leave for scotland as fast as four horses can carry us and unite myself to miriam and as soon as i can i shall leave the country which will be the best step to allow their rage and indignation to cool i think your plan is good replied joey and i am at your service in a few minutes mr s and our hero went out by the back way into the mews and as soon as they came to a stand took a coach and drove to the hotel they had not however been in company with miriam more than five minutes when the waiter entered the room in great alarm stating that two gentlemen were forcing their way upstairs in spite of the landlord and others who were endeavouring to prevent them the fact was that our hero and mr s had been perceived by joseph and his father as they came out of the mews and they had immediately followed them taking a coach at the same stand and desiring the coachman to follow the one our hero and mr s had gone into the waiter had hardly time to make the communication before the door was forced open and the man was so terrified that he retreated behind our hero and mr s into whose arms miriam had thrown herself for protection the father and brother did not however enter without resistance on the part of the landlord and waiters who followed remonstrating and checking them but joseph broke from them with his dagger drawn it was wrenched from him by our hero who dashed forward the enraged israelite then caught up a heavy bronze clock which was on the sideboard and crying out this for the gaw and the meshumed the infidel and the apostate he hurled it at them with all his strength it missed the parties it was intended for but striking the waiter who had retreated behind them fractured his skull and he fell senseless upon the floor upon this outrage the landlord and his assistants rushed upon joseph and his father the police were sent for and after a desperate resistance the israelites were taken away to the police office leaving mr s and miriam at liberty our hero was however requested by the police to attend at the examination and of course could not refuse the whole party had been a quarter of an hour waiting until another case was disposed of before the magistrate could attend to them when the surgeon came in and acquainted them that the unfortunate waiter had expired the depositions were taken down and both father and son were committed and joey and some others bound over to appear as witnesses in about two hours our hero was enabled to return to the hotel where he found that mr s had left a note for him stating that he considered it advisable to start immediately lest they should require his attendance at the police court and he should be delayed which would give time to the relations of miriam to take up the question he had therefore set off and would write to him as soon as he possibly could this affair made some noise and appeared in all the newspapers and our hero therefore sat down and wrote a detailed account of the whole transaction as communicated to him by mr s which he despatched to portsmouth he made inquiries and found that the sessions would come on in a fortnight and that the grand jury would sit in a few days he therefore made up his mind that he would not think of returning to portsmouth until the trial was over and in his next letter he made known his intentions and then set off for richmond where he had been advised to remain for a short time as being more favourable to an invalid than the confined atmosphere of london our hero found amusement in rowing about in a wherry up and down the river and replying to the letters received from mary and from portsmouth he also received a letter from mr s informing him of his marriage and requesting that as soon as the trial was over he would write to him our hero's health also was nearly re established when he was informed that his attendance was required at the court to give his evidence in the case of manslaughter found by the grand jury against joseph the brother of miriam he arrived in town and attended the court on the following day when the trial was to take place a short time after the cause came on he was placed in the witness box at the time that he gave his depositions before the magistrate he had not thought about his name having been changed but now that he was sworn and had declared he would tell the truth and nothing but the truth when the counsel asked him if his name was not joseph o'donahue our hero replied that it was joseph rushbrook your deposition says joseph o'donahue how is this have you an alias like many others sir inquired the counsel my real name is rushbrook but i have been called o'donahue for some time replied our hero this reply was the occasion of the opposite counsel making some very severe remarks but the evidence of our hero was taken and was indeed considered very favourable to the prisoner as joey stated that he was convinced the blow was never intended for the unfortunate waiter but for mr s after about an hour's examination our hero was dismissed and in case that he might be recalled returned as directed to the room where the witnesses were assembled chapter forty four in which the tide of fortune turns against our hero as soon as joey had been dismissed from the witness box he returned to the room in which the other witnesses were assembled with melancholy forebodings that his real name having been given in open court would lead to some disaster he had not been there long before a peace officer came in and said to him step this way if you please sir i have something to say to you joey went with him outside the door when the peace officer looking at him full in the face said your name is joseph rushbrook you said so in the witness box yes replied joey that is my true name why did you change it demanded the officer i had reasons replied our hero yes and i'll tell you the reasons rejoined the other you were concerned in a murder some years ago a reward was offered for your apprehension and you absconded from justice i see that you are the person your face tells me so you are my prisoner now come away quietly sir it is of no use for you to resist and you will only be worse treated joey's heart had almost ceased to beat when the constable addressed him he felt that denial was useless and that the time was now come when either he or his father must suffer he therefore made no reply but quietly followed the peace officer who holding him by the arm called a coach into which he ordered joey to enter and following him directed the coachman to drive to the police office as soon as the magistrate had been acquainted by the officer who the party was whom he had taken into custody he first pointed out to our hero that he had better not say any thing which might criminate himself and then asked him if his name was joseph rushbrook joey replied that it was have you anything to say that might prevent my committing you on the charge of murder demanded the magistrate nothing except that i am not guilty replied joey i have had the warrant out against him these seven years or thereabouts but he escaped me observed the peace officer he was but a lad then he must have been a child to judge by his present appearance observed the magistrate who was making out the committal i now perfectly recollect the affair the officer received the committal and in half an hour our hero was locked up with felons of every description his blood ran cold when he found himself enclosed within the massive walls and as soon as the gaoler had left him alone he shuddered and covered his face with his hands our hero had however the greatest of all consolations to support him the consciousness of his innocence but when he called to mind how happy and prosperous he had lately been when he thought of emma and that now all his fair prospects and fondest anticipations were thrown to the ground it is not surprising that for a short time he wept in his solitude and silence to whom should he make known his situation alas it would too soon be known and would not every one even emma shrink from a supposed murderer no there was one who would not one on whose truth he could depend mary would not desert him even now he would write to her and acquaint her with his situation our hero having made up his mind so to do obtained paper and ink from the gaoler when he came into his cell which he did in about two hours after he had been locked up joey wrote to mary stating his position in few words and that the next morning he was to be taken down to exeter to await his trial and expressed a wish if possible that she would come there to see him and giving a guinea to the turnkey requested him to forward the letter it shall go safe enough young master replied the man now do you know yours is one of the strangest cases which ever came to my knowledge continued the man we've been talking about it among ourselves why the first warrant for your apprehension was out more than eight years ago and to look at you now you cannot be more than seventeen or eighteen yes i am replied joey i am twenty two then don't you tell anybody else that and i will forget it you see youth goes a great way in court and they will see that you must have been quite a child when the deed was done for i suppose by the evidence there is no doubt of that and it won't be a hanging matter that you may be certain of you'll cross the water that's all so keep up your spirits and look as young as you can mary received the letter on the following day and was in the deepest distress at its contents she was still weeping over it her work had been thrown down at her feet when mrs austin came into the dressing room where she was sitting what is the matter mary said mrs austin i have received a letter from my brother madam replied mary he is in the greatest distress and i must beg you to let me go to him immediately your brother mary what difficulty is he in asked mrs austin mary did not reply but wept more mary if your brother is in distress i certainly will not refuse your going to him but you should tell me what his distress is or how shall i be able to advise or help you is it very serious he is in prison madam in prison for debt i suppose no madam on a charge of murder which he is not guilty of murder exclaimed mrs austin and not guilty why when and where did this murder take place many years ago madam when he was quite a child how very strange thought mrs austin panting for breath and dropping into a chair but where mary down in devonshire madam at grassford mrs austin fell senseless from her chair mary very much surprised hastened to her assistance and after a time succeeded in restoring her and leading her to the sofa for some time mrs austin remained with her face buried in the cushions while mary stood over her at last mrs austin looked up and laying her head upon mary's arm said in a solemn tone mary do not deceive me you say that that boy is your brother tell me is not that false i am sure that it is answer me mary he is not my born brother madam but i love him as one replied mary again answer me truly mary if you have any regard for me you know his real name what is it joseph rushbrook madam replied mary weeping i was certain of it replied mrs austin bursting into tears i knew it the blow has come at last god have mercy on me what can be done and again mrs austin abandoned herself to bitter grief mary was in amazement how mrs austin should know any thing of joey's history and why she should be in such distress was to her a complete mystery she remained for some time at the side of her mistress who gradually became more composed mary at last said may i go to him madam yes replied mrs austin most certainly mary i must have no secrets now you must tell me everything you see that i am deeply interested about this young man as well as yourself it is quite sufficient for you at present to know that before i say anything more you must be candid with me and tell me how you became acquainted with him and all that you know relative to his life that i will assist you and him in every way in my power that neither money nor interest shall be spared you may be assured and i think mary that after this promise you will not conceal anything from me indeed i will not madam replied mary for i love him as much as i can love mary then commenced by stating that she was living at gravesend when she first met with joey there was a little hesitation at the commencement of her narrative which mrs austin pretended not to observe she then continued winding up with the information which she had obtained from furness the marine their escape and her admission into mrs austin's family and it was joseph rushbrook that came with you to this house yes madam replied mary but one of the men was quite rude to me and joey took it up mr austin hearing a noise sent down to inquire the cause the servants threw all the blame upon joey and he was ordered out of the house immediately he refused even to come back to the hall after the treatment he had received for a long while but it was he who was in the parlour when you opened the door if you recollect a few weeks ago mrs austin clasped her hands and then pressed them to her forehead after a while she said and what has he been doing since he came here mary then informed her mistress of all she knew of joey's subsequent career well mary said mrs austin you must go to him directly you will want money but mary promise me that you will not say a word to him about what has passed between us that is for the present by and bye i may trust you more you may trust me madam replied mary looking her mistress in the face but it is too late for me to go this afternoon i will if you please now wait till to morrow morning do so mary i am glad that you do not go to night for i wish you to stay with me i have many questions to ask of you at present i wish to be alone my good girl tell mr austin that i am very unwell and do not dine below shall i bring your dinner up here madam asked mary yes you may bring it mary replied mrs austin with a faint smile never did two people leave one another both so much wishing to be alone as mary and mrs austin the former quitted the room and having first executed her commission returned to her own apartment that she might reflect without being disturbed what could be the reason of mrs austin's behaviour what could she know of joey rushbrook and why so interested and moved she had heard among the servants that mr and mrs austin were formerly in a humbler sphere of life that he was a half pay officer but there was still no clue to such interest about joey rushbrook mary thought and thought over and over again revolved all that had passed in her mind but could make nothing of it and she was still trying to solve the mystery when the housemaid came into the room and informed her that mrs austin's bell had rung twice mrs austin on her part was still more bewildered she could not regain sufficient calmness to enable her to decide how to act her son in prison to be tried for his life for a crime he had not committed would he divulge the truth and sacrifice the father she thought not if he did not would he not be condemned and if he were could she remain away from him or ought she not to divulge what the boy would conceal and if he did confess the truth would they find out that mr austin and joseph rushbrook were one and the same person would there be any chance of his escape would he not sooner or later be recognised how dreadful was her situation then again should she acquaint her husband with the position of his son if so would he come forward yes most certainly he would never let joey suffer for his crime ought she to tell her husband and then mary who knew so much already who had witnessed her distress and anguish who was so fond of her son could she trust her could she do without trusting her such were the various and conflicting ideas which passed in the mind of mrs austin at last she resolved that she would say nothing to her husband that she would send mary to her son and that she would that evening have more conversation with the girl and decide after she had talked with her whether she would make her a confidant or not having made up her mind so far she rang the bell for mary are you better madam asked mary who had entered the room very quietly yes i thank you mary take your work and sit down i wish to have some more conversation with you about this young person joseph rushbrook you must have seen that i am much interested about him yes madam there were some portions of your story mary which i do not quite understand you have now lived with me for five years and i have had every reason to be satisfied with your behaviour you have conducted yourself as a well behaved modest and attentive young woman i am much obliged to you madam for your good opinion and i hope that you will admit that i have not been a hard mistress to you mary but on the contrary have shown you that i have been pleased with your conduct certainly madam you have and i trust i am grateful i believe so replied mrs austin now mary i wish you to confide in me altogether what i wish to know is how did you in so short a time become acquainted with this furness so as to obtain this secret from him i may say whom did you live with and how did you live when at gravesend for you have not mentioned that to me it seems so odd to me that this man should have told to a person whom he had seen but for a few hours a secret of such moment mary's tears fell fast but she made no reply cannot you answer me mary i can madam said she at last but if i tell the truth and i cannot tell a lie now you will despise me and perhaps order me to leave the house immediately and if you do what will become of me mary if you think i intend to take advantage of a confession extorted from you you do me wrong i ask the question because it is necessary that i should know the truth because i cannot confide in you without you first confide in me tell me mary and do not be afraid madam i will but pray do not forget that i have been under your roof for five years and that i have been during that time an honest and modest girl i was not so once i confess it and mary's cheeks were red with shame and she hung down her head we are all sinful creatures mary replied mrs austin and who is there that has not fallen into error the scriptures say let him who is without sin cast the first stone' nay more mary there is more joy over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine who need no repentance' shall i then be harsh to you my poor girl no no by trusting me you have made me your friend you must be mine mary for i want a friend now poor mary fell on her knees before mrs austin and wept over her hand as she kissed it repeatedly mrs austin was much affected and as the contrite girl recovered herself mrs austin leaned on her elbow and putting her arm round mary's neck drew her head towards her and gently kissed her on the brow you are indeed a kind friend madam said mary after a pause and may the almighty reward you you are unhappy i know not why but i would die to serve you i only wish that you would let me prove it first mary tell me as much of your own history as you choose to tell i wish to know it mary then entered into the details of her marriage her husband's conduct her subsequent career and her determination to lead a new life which she had so sincerely proved by her late conduct mary having concluded her narrative mrs austin addressed her thus mary if you imagine that you have fallen in my good opinion after what you have confessed to me you are much mistaken you have on the contrary been raised there have been few very few that have had the courage and fortitude that you have shown or who could have succeeded as you have done i was afraid to trust you before but now i am not i will not ask you not to betray me for i am sure you will not on two points only my lips are sealed and the reason why they are sealed is that the secret is not mine alone and i have not permission to divulge it that i am deeply interested in that boy is certain nay that he is a near and very dear connection is also the case but what his exact relationship is towards me i must not at present say you have asserted your belief of his innocence and i tell you that you are right he did not do the deed i know who did but i dare not reveal the name that is exactly what joey said to me madam observed mary and moreover that he never would reveal it even if he were on his trial i do not think that he ever will mary rejoined mrs austin bursting into tears poor boy it is horrible that he should suffer for an offence that he has not committed surely madam if he is found guilty they will not hang him he was such a child i scarcely know it's very odd that his father and mother have disappeared in the manner they did i think it is very suspicious observed mary you must of course have your own ideas from what you have already heard replied mrs austin in a calm tone but as i have already said my lips on that subject are sealed what i wish you to do mary is not at first to let him know that i am interested about him or even that i know anything about him make all the inquiries you can as to what is likely to be the issue of the affair and when you have seen him you must then come back and tell me all that he says and all that has taken place i will madam you had better go away early tomorrow one of the grooms shall drive you over to meet the coach which runs to exeter while i think of it take my purse and do not spare it mary for money must not be thought of now i am very unwell and must go to bed i had better bring up the tray madam a mouthful and a glass of wine will be of service to you do so dear mary i feel very faint as soon as mrs austin had taken some refreshment she entered again into conversation with mary asking her a hundred questions about her son mary who had now nothing to conceal answered freely and when mary wished her good night mrs austin was more than ever convinced that her boy's rectitude of principle would have made him an ornament to society then came the bitter feeling that he was about to sacrifice himself that he would be condemned as a felon disgraced and perhaps executed and as she turned on her restless pillow she exclaimed thank god that he is innocent his poor father suffers more chapter forty five in which mary makes a discovery of what has been long known to the reader it was hardly ten o'clock on the second morning when mary arrived at exeter and proceeded to the gaol her eyes were directed to the outside of the massive building and her cheeks blanched when she viewed the chains and fetters over the entrance so truly designating the purport of the structure there were several people at the steps and in the passage making inquiries and demanding permission of the turnkey to visit the prisoners and mary had to wait some minutes before she could make her request her appearance was so different to the usual class of applicants that the turnkey looked at her with some surprise whom do you wish to see inquired the man for mary's voice had faltered joseph rushbrook my brother repeated mary at this moment the head gaoler came to the wicket she wishes to see her brother young rushbrook said the turnkey yes certainly replied the gaoler walk in and sit down in the parlour for a little while till i can send a man with you there was a gentleness and kindness of manner shown by both the men towards mary for they were moved with her beauty and evident distress mary took a seat in the gaoler's room the gaoler's wife was there and she was more than kind the turnkey came to show her to the cell and when mary rose the gaoler's wife said to her after you have seen your brother my dear child you had better come back again and sit down here a little while and then perhaps i can be of some use to you in letting you know what can be done and what is not allowed mary could not speak but she looked at the gaoler's wife her eyes brimming over with tears the kind woman understood her go now said she and mind you come back to me the turnkey without speaking led her to the cell fitted the key to the ponderous lock pushed back the door and remained outside mary entered and in a second was in the arms of our hero kissing him and bedewing his cheeks with her tears i was sure that you would come mary said joey now sit down and i will tell you how this has happened while you compose yourself you will be better able to talk to me after a while they sat down on the stretchers upon which the bed had been laid during the night their hands still clasped and as joey entered into a narrative of all that had passed mary's sobs gradually diminished and she was restored to something like composure and what do you intend to do when you are brought to trial my dear boy said mary at last i shall say nothing except not guilty' which is the truth mary i shall make no defence whatever but why will you not confess the truth replied mary i have often thought of this and have long made up my mind joey that no one could act as you do if a parent's life were not concerned you or anybody else would be mad to sacrifice himself in this way unless it were to save a father joey's eyes were cast down on the stone pavement he made no reply why then if i am right in my supposition continued mary i do not ask you to say yes or no on that point why should you not tell the truth furness told me that your father and mother had left the village and that he had attempted to trace them but could not and he expressed himself sure that they were gone to america why then supposing i am right should you sacrifice yourself for nothing supposing you are right mary replied joey with his eyes still cast down what proof is there that my parents have left the country it was only the supposition of furness and it is my conviction that they have not where they may be i know not but i feel positive that my mother would not leave the country without having first found out where i was and have taken me with her no mary my father and mother if alive are still in this country recollect again my dear boy that your father may be dead and if so my mother would have by this time found me out she would have advertised for me done everything i feel that she would have she would have returned to grassford and and what joey i must not say what mary replied our hero i have thought a great deal since i have been shut up here and i have taken my resolution which is not to be changed so let us say no more upon the subject dear mary tell me all about yourself mary remained another hour with joey and then bade him farewell she was anxious to return to mrs austin and acquaint her with the result of her interview with a heavy heart she walked away from the cell and went down into the parlour of the gaoler would you like to take anything said the gaoler's wife after mary had sat down a little water replied mary and how is your brother he is innocent replied mary he is indeed but he won't tell anything and they will condemn him well well but do not be afraid he must have been very young at the time innocent or guilty and he won't suffer that i know but he will be sent out of the country then i will go with him replied mary perhaps he will be pardoned dear keep your spirits up and if you have money get a good lawyer can you tell me who would be a good lawyer to apply to yes mr trevor he is a very clever man and comes the western circuit if any one can save him he can i will take his name down if you please said mary the gaoler's wife gave mary a piece of paper and pen and ink mary wrote down the name and address of mr trevor and then with many thanks took her leave on her return to the hall mary communicated to mrs austin what had passed mrs austin perceived that joey would not swerve from his resolution and that all that could be done was to procure the best legal assistance mary my poor girl said mrs austin here is money which you will find necessary for your adopted brother's assistance you say that you have obtained the name of the best legal person to be employed in his behalf to morrow you must go to london and call upon that gentleman it may be as well not to mention my name as his sister you of course seek the best legal advice you must manage all this as if from yourself i will madam and mary if you think it advisable you can remain in town for two or three days but pray write to me every day i will madam let me know your address as i may wish to say something to you when i know what has been done i will madam and now you had better go to bed mary for you must be tired indeed you look very fatigued my poor girl i need not caution you not to say anything to any of the servants good night mary threw herself on the bed she was indeed worn out with anxiety and grief at last she slept the next morning she was on her way to town having in reply to the curiosity of the servants stated that the cause of her journey was the dangerous illness of her brother as soon as she arrived in london mary drove to the chambers of the lawyer whose direction she had obtained from the exeter gaoler's wife he was at home and after waiting a short time she was ushered by the clerk into his presence what can i do for you young lady inquired mr trevor with some surprise it is not often that the den of a lawyer has such a bright vision to cheer it do me the favour to take a chair i am not a young lady sir replied mary i have come to you to request that you will be so kind as to defend my brother who is about to be tried your brother what is he charged with murder replied mary but indeed sir he is not guilty she continued as she burst into tears mr trevor was not only a clever but also a kind and considerate man he remained silent for some minutes to allow mary time to recover herself when she was more composed he said what is your brother's name joseph rushbrook rushbrook rushbrook i well remember that name remarked mr trevor strange the christian name also the same it is singular certainly the last time i was concerned for a person of that name i was the means of his coming into a large landed property now i am requested to defend one of the same name accused of murder mary was astonished at this observation of mr trevor's but made no reply have you the indictment where did the murder take place in devonshire sir many years ago and he is now in exeter gaol come tell me all the particulars mary told all that she knew in a very clear and concise manner now my good girl said mr trevor i must see your brother in two days i shall be down at exeter if you write to him or see him before i do you must tell him he must trust in his lawyer and have no reservation or i shall not be able to do him so much service allow me to ask you have you any relations in yorkshire no sir none and yet the name and christian name are exactly the same it's an odd coincidence they however changed their name when they came into the property changed the name of rushbrook sir said mary who now thought that she had a clue to joey's parents yes changed it to austin they live now in dorsetshire i mention it because if interest is required for your brother and he could prove any relationship it might be valuable but bless me what is the matter smithers cried mr trevor as he ran and supported mary some water quick the girl has fainted it was surprise at this astounding intelligence her regard for mrs austin and the light now thrown upon the interest she had shown for our hero and the conviction of what must be her suffering which had overcome the poor girl in a short time she recovered i thank you sir but i have suffered so much anxiety about my poor brother said mary faltering and almost gasping for breath he cannot be a very bad boy since you are so fond of him said mr trevor no indeed i wish i was half as good murmured mary i will do all i possibly can and that immediately indeed as soon as i have the documents and have perused them i will go to your brother a day sooner than i intended do you feel yourself well enough to go now if you do my clerk shall procure you a coach do you stay in london if so you must leave your address mary replied that she intended to set off to exeter that evening by the mail and would meet him there mr trevor handed her out put her into the coach and she ordered the man to drive to the inn where she was stopping mary's senses were quite bewildered it was late and the mail was to start in an hour or two she secured her place and during her long journey she hardly knew how time passed away on her arrival in the morning she hastened to the prison she was received kindly as before by the gaoler and his wife and then attended the turnkey into joey's cell as soon as the door was closed she threw herself down on the bedstead and wept bitterly quite heedless of our hero's remonstrance or attempts to soothe her oh it is horrible too horrible cried the almost fainting girl what can what must be done either way misery disgrace lord forgive me but my head is turned that you should be here that you should be in this strait why was it not me i i have deserved all and more prison death everything is not too bad for me but you my dear dear boy mary what is the reason of this i cannot understand are matters worse than they were before said joey and why should you talk in such a way about yourself if you ever did wrong you were driven to it by the conduct of others but your reformation is all your own ah joey replied mary i should think little of my repentance if i held myself absolved by a few years' good conduct no no a whole life of repentance is not sufficient for me i must live on ever repenting and must die full of penitence and imploring for pardon but why do i talk of myself what has made you thus mary joey i cannot keep it a secret from you it is useless to attempt it i have discovered your father and mother where are they and do they know anything of my position yes your mother does but not your father tell me all mary and tell me quickly your father and mother are mr and mrs austin joey's utterance failed him from astonishment he stared at mary but he could not utter a word mary again wept and joey for some minutes remained by her side in silence come mary said joey at last you can now tell me everything joey sat down by her side and mary then communicated what had passed between herself and mrs austin her acknowledgement that he was her relation the interest she took in him the money she had lavished her sufferings which she had witnessed and then she wound up with the conversation between her and mr trevor you see my dear boy there is no doubt of the fact i believe i did promise mrs austin to say nothing to you about it but i forgot my promise all just this minute now joey what is to be done tell me something about my father mary said joey i wish to know how he is estimated and how he behaves in his new position mary told him all she knew which was not a great deal he was respected but he was a strange man kept himself very much aloof from others and preferred seclusion mary said joey you know what were my intentions before they are now still more fixed i will take my chance but i never will say one word you already know and have guessed more than i could wish i will not say that you are right for it is not my secret i thought as much replied mary and i feel how much my arguments must be weakened by the disclosures i have made before i only felt for you now i feel for all oh joey why are you so innocent to be punished this way and i so guilty to be spared it is the will of god that i should be in this strait mary and now let us not renew the subject but joey mr trevor is coming here to morrow and he told me to tell you that you must have no reservation with your lawyer if you wish him to be of service to you you have given your message mary and now you must leave me to deal with him my heart is breaking said mary solemnly i wish i were in my grave if that wish is not wicked mary recollect one thing recollect it supports me and let it support you i am innocent you are i'm sure would to heaven that i could say the same for another but tell me joey what shall i do when i meet your mother i loved her before but oh how much i love her now what shall i do shall i tell her that i have discovered all i do not know how i can keep it from her mary i see no objection to your telling her but tell her also that i will not see her till after my trial whatever my fate may be i should like to see her after that is decided i will take your message the day after to morrow replied mary now i must go and look out for lodgings and then write to your mother bless you mary quitted the cell she had suffered so much that she could hardly gain the gaoler's parlour where she sat down to recover herself she inquired of the gaoler's wife if she could procure apartments near the prison and the woman requested one of the turnkeys to take her to a lodging which would be suitable as soon as mary was located she wrote a letter to mrs austin informing her of her having seen the lawyer and that his services were secured and then worn out with the anxiety and excitement of the three last days she retired to bed and in her sleep forgot her sufferings chapter forty six in which our hero makes up his mind to be hanged our hero was not sorry to be left alone for the first time he felt the absence of mary a relief he was almost as much bewildered as poor mary with the strange discovery his father a great landed proprietor one of the first men in the county universally respected in the first society his mother as he knew by mary's letters written long ago courted and sought after loved and admired if he had made a resolution a promise he might say when a mere child that he would take the onus of the deed upon his own shoulders to protect his father then a poacher and in humble life how much more was it his duty now that his father would so feel any degradation now that being raised so high his fall would be so bitter his disgrace so deeply felt and the stigma so doubly severe no no thought joey were i to impeach my father now to accuse him of a deed which would bring him to the scaffold i should not only be considered his murderer but it would be said i had done it to inherit his possessions i should be considered one who had sacrificed his father to obtain his property i should be scouted shunned and deservedly despised the disgrace of my father having been hanged would be a trifle compared with the reproach of a son having condemned a parent to the gallows now i am doubly bound to keep to my resolution and come what may the secret shall die with me and joey slept soundly that night the next morning mr trevor came into his cell i have seen your sister rushbrook said he and at her request have come to assist you if it is in my power she has been here since i have been informed and if so i have no doubt that she has told you that you must have no secrets with your lawyer your legal friend and adviser in this case is your true friend he is bound in honour to secrecy and were you to declare now that you were guilty of this murder the very confidence would only make me more earnest in your defence i have here all the evidence at the coroner's inquest and the verdict against you tell me honestly what did take place and then i shall know better how to convince the jury that it did not you are very kind sir but i can say nothing even to you except that on my honour i am not guilty but tell me then how did it happen i have nothing more to say and with my thanks to you sir i will say nothing more this is very strange the evidence was strong against you was the evidence correct the parties were correct in their evidence as it appeared to them and yet you are not guilty i am not i shall plead not guilty and leave my fate to the jury are you mad your sister is a sweet young woman and has interested me greatly but if innocent you are throwing away your life i am doing my duty sir whatever you may think of my conduct the secret dies with me and for whom do you sacrifice yourself in this way if as you say and as your sister declares you are not guilty joey made no reply but sat down on the bedstead if the deed was not done by you by whom was it done urged mr trevor if you make no reply to that i must throw up my brief you said just now returned joey that if i declared myself guilty of the murder you would still defend me now because i say i am not and will not say who is you must throw up your brief surely you are inconsistent i must have your confidence my good lad you never will have more than you have now i have not requested you to defend me i care nothing about defence then you wish to be hanged no i do not but rather than say anything i will take my chance of it this is very strange said mr trevor after a pause he continued i observe that you are supposed to have killed this man byres when nobody else was present you were known to go out with your father's gun and the keeper's evidence proved that you poached now as there is no evidence of intentional murder on your part it is not impossible that the gun went off by accident and that mere boy as you must have been at that age you were so frightened at what had taken place that you absconded from fear it appears to me that that should be our line of defence i never fired at the man at all said joey who fired the gun then asked mr trevor joey made no reply rushbrook said mr trevor i am afraid i can be of little use to you indeed were it not that your sister's tears have interested me i would not take up your cause i cannot understand your conduct which appears to me to be absurd your motives are inexplicable and all i can believe is that you have committed the crime and will not divulge the secret to any one not even to those who would befriend you think of me what you please sir rejoined our hero see me condemned and if it should be so executed and after all that has taken place believe me when i assert to you as i hope for salvation i am not guilty i thank you sir thank you sincerely for the interest you have shown for me i feel grateful excessively grateful and the more so for what you have said of mary but if you were to remain here for a month you could gain no more from me than you have already after such an avowal it is useless my stopping here said mr trevor i must make what defence i can for your sister's sake many many thanks sir for your kindness i am really grateful to you replied joey mr trevor remained for a minute scanning the countenance or our hero there was something in it so clear and bright so unflinching so proclaiming innocence and high feeling that he sighed deeply as he left the cell his subsequent interview with mary was short he explained to her the difficulties arising from the obstinacy of her brother but at the same time expressed his determination to do his best to save him mary as soon as she had seen mr trevor set off on her return to the hall as soon as she went to mrs austin mary apprised her of mr trevor's having consented to act as counsel for our hero and also of joey's resolute determination not to divulge the secret madam said mary after some hesitation it is my duty to have no secret from you and i hope you will not be angry when i tell you that i have discovered that which you would have concealed what have you discovered mary asked mrs austin looking at her with alarm that joseph rushbrook is your own son said mary kneeling down and kissing the hand of her mistress the secret is safe with me depend upon it she continued and how have you made the discovery mary for i will not attempt to deny it mary then entered into a detail of her conversation with mr trevor he asked me said she as the sister of joey if we had any relatives and i replied no' so that he has no suspicion of the fact i beg your pardon madam but i could not keep it from joey i quite forgot my promise to you at the time and what did my poor child say that he would not see you until after his trial but when his fate was decided he should like to see you once more oh madam what a painful sacrifice and yet now i do not blame him for it is his duty my dread is not for my son mary he is innocent and that to me is everything but if my husband was to hear of his being about to be tried i know not what would be the consequence if it can only be kept from his knowledge god knows that he has suffered enough but what am i saying i was talking nonsense oh madam i know the whole i cannot be blinded either by joey or you i beg your pardon madam but although joey would not reply i told him that his father did the deed but do not answer me madam be silent as your son has been and believe me when i say that my suspicion could not be wrenched from me even by torture i do trust you mary and perhaps the knowledge that you have obtained is advantageous when does the trial come on the assizes commence to morrow forenoon madam they say oh how i long to have him in these arms exclaimed mrs austin it is indeed a sad trial to a mother madam replied mary but still it must not be until after he is yes until he is condemned god have mercy on me mary you had better return to exeter but write to me every day stay by him and comfort him and may the god of comfort listen to the prayers of an unhappy and distracted mother leave me now god bless you my dear girl you have indeed proved a comfort leave me now chapter forty seven in which our hero proves game to the very last mary returned to exeter the trial of our hero was expected to come on on the following day she preferred being with joey to witnessing the agony and distress of mrs austin to whom she could offer no comfort indeed her own state of suspense was so wearing that she almost felt relief when the day of trial came on mr trevor had once more attempted to reason with joey but our hero continued firm in his resolution and mr trevor when he made his appearance in the court wore upon his countenance the marks of sorrow and discontent he did not nevertheless fail in his duty joey was brought to the bar and his appearance was so different from that which was to be expected in one charged with the crime of murder that strong interest was immediately excited the spectators anticipated a low bred ruffian and they beheld a fair handsome young man with an open brow and intelligent countenance whose eye quailed not when it met their own and whose demeanour was bold without being offensive true that there were traces of sorrow on his countenance and that his cheeks were pale but no one who had any knowledge of human nature or any feeling of charity in his disposition could say that there was the least appearance of guilt the jury were empannelled the counts of the indictment read over and the trial commenced and as the indictment was preferred the judge caught the date of the supposed offence what is the date said the judge the year i mean upon the reply of the clerk his lordship observed eight years ago and then looking at the prisoner added why he must have been a child as is too often the case replied the prosecuting counsel a child in years but not in guilt as we shall soon bring evidence to substantiate as the evidence brought forward was the same as we have already mentioned as given on the inquest over the body we shall pass it over that of furness as he was not to be found was read to the court as the trial proceeded and as each fact came forth more condemning people began to look with less compassion on the prisoner they shook their heads and compressed their lips as soon as the evidence for the crown was closed mr trevor rose in our hero's defence he commenced by ridiculing the idea of trying a mere child upon so grave a charge for a child the prisoner must have been at the time the offence was committed look at him now gentlemen of the jury eight years ago the murder of the pedlar byres took place why you may judge for yourselves whether he is now more than seventeen years of age he could scarcely have held a gun at the time referred to the prisoner's age does not appear in the indictment observed the judge may we ask his age my lord demanded one of the jury the prisoner may answer the question if he pleases replied the judge not otherwise perhaps he may not yet be seventeen years of age do you wish to state your age to the jury prisoner i have no objection my lord replied joey not regarding the shakes of the head of his counsel i was twenty two last month mr trevor bit his lips at this unfortunate regard for truth in our hero and after a time proceeded observing that the very candour of the prisoner in not taking advantage of his youthful appearance to deceive the jury ought to be a strong argument in his favour mr trevor then continued to address the jury upon the vagueness of the evidence and as he proceeded observed now gentlemen of the jury if this case had been offered to me to give an opinion upon i should without any previous knowledge of the prisoner have just come to the following conclusion i should have said and your intelligence and good sense will i have no doubt bear me out in this supposition that allowing that the pedlar byres did receive his death by the prisoner's hand i say gentlemen that allowing such to have been the case for i deny that it is borne out by the evidence that it must have been that at the sudden meeting with the pedlar when the lad's conscience told him that what he was doing was wrong that the gun of the prisoner was discharged unintentionally and the consequence was fatal i should then surmise further that the prisoner frightened at the deed which he had unintentionally committed had absconded upon the first impulse that gentlemen i believe to be the real state of the case and what was more natural than that a child under such circumstances should have been frightened and have attempted to evade the inquiry which must have eventually ensued you state such to be your opinion mr trevor do you wish me to infer that the prisoner pleads such as his defence asked the judge my lord replied mr trevor in a hesitating way the prisoner has pleaded not guilty to the crime imputed to him that i am aware of but i wish to know whether you mean to say that the prisoner's defence is not having anything to do with the death of the pedlar or upon the plea of his gun going off by accident my lord it is my duty to my client to make no admission whatever i should think that you would be safe enough all circumstances considered if you took the latter course observed the judge humanely mr trevor was now in a dilemma he knew not how to move he was fearful if he stated positively that our hero's gun went off by accident that joey would deny it and yet if he was permitted to assert this to be the case he saw from the bearing of the judge that the result of the trial would be satisfactory it hardly need be observed that both judge prosecuting counsel jury and everybody in court were much astonished at this hesitation on the part of the prisoner's counsel do you mean to assert that the gun went off by accident mr trevor asked the judge i never fired the gun my lord replied joey in a calm steady voice the prisoner has answered for me replied mr trevor recovering himself we are perfectly aware that by making a statement of accidental murder we could safely have left the prisoner in the hands of an intelligent jury but the fact is my lord that the prisoner never fired the gun and therefore could not be guilty of the murder imputed to him mr trevor had felt upon our hero's assertion that his case was hopeless he roused up however to make a strong appeal to the jury unfortunately it was declamation only not disproof of the charges and the reply of the prosecuting counsel completely established the guilt of our hero upon what is called presumptive evidence the jury retired for a few minutes after the summing up of the judge and then returned a verdict against our hero of guilty but recommended him to mercy although the time to which we refer was one in which leniency was seldom extended still there was the youth of our hero and so much mystery in the transaction that when the judge passed the sentence he distinctly stated that the royal mercy would be so far extended that the sentence would be commuted to transportation our hero made no reply he bowed and was led back to his place of confinement and in a few minutes afterwards the arms of the weeping mary were encircled round his neck you don't blame me mary said joey no no sobbed mary all that the world can do is nothing when we are innocent i shall soon be far from here mary said joey sitting down on the bedstead but thank heaven it is over the form of emma phillips rose up in our hero's imagination and he covered up his face with his hands had it not been for her thought he what must she think of me a convicted felon this is the hardest of all to bear up against joey said mary who had watched him in silence and tears i must go now you will see her now will you not she never will see me she despises me already replied joey your mother despise her noble boy oh never how can you think so i was thinking of somebody else mary replied joey yes i wish to see my mother then i will go now recollect what her anxiety and impatience must be i will travel post to night and be there by to morrow morning go dear mary go and god bless you hasten to my poor mother and tell her that i am quite yes quite happy and resigned go now quickly mary left the cell and joey whose heart was breaking at the moment that he said he was happy and resigned for he was thinking of his eternal separation from emma as soon as he was alone threw himself on the bed and gave full vent to those feelings of bitter anguish which he could no longer repress chapter forty eight in which everybody appears to be on the move except our hero mary set off with post horses and arrived at the hall before daylight she remained in her own room until the post came in when her first object was to secure the newspapers before the butler had opened them stating that her mistress was awake and requested to see them she took the same precaution when the other papers came in late in the day so that mr austin should not read the account of the trial this was the more easy to accomplish as he seldom looked at a newspaper as soon as the usual hour had arrived mary presented herself to her mistress and communicated the melancholy result of the trial mrs austin desired mary to say to the servants that she was going to remain with a lady a friend of hers some miles off who was dangerously ill and should in all probability not return that night or even the next if her friend was not better and her preparations for the journey being completed she set off with mary a little before dark on her way to exeter but if mr austin did not look at the newspapers others did and amongst the latter was major mcshane who having returned from his tour was sitting with o'donahue and the two ladies in the library of his own house when the post came in the major had hardly looked at the newspapers when the name of rushbrook caught his eye he turned to it read a portion and gave a loud whistle of surprise what's the matter my dear asked mrs mcshane murder's the matter my jewel returned the major but don't interrupt me just now for i'm breathless with confusion mcshane read the whole account of the trial and the verdict and then without saying a word put it into the bands of o'donahue as soon as o'donahue had finished it mcshane beckoned him out of the room i didn't like to let mrs mcshane know it as she would take it sorely to heart said mcshane but what's to be done now o'donahue you see the boy has not peached upon his father and has convicted himself it would be poor comfort to mrs mcshane who loves the memory of that boy better than she would a dozen little mcshanes if it pleased heaven to grant them to her to know that the boy is found when he is only found to be sent away over the water so it is better that nothing should be said about it just now but what is to be done well it appears to me that we had better be off to exeter directly replied o'donahue yes and see him rejoined the major before i saw him mcshane i would call upon the lawyer who defended him and tell him what you know about the father and what our suspicions i may say convictions are he would then tell us how to proceed so as to procure his pardon perhaps that's good advice and now what excuse are we to make for running away as for my wife replied o'donahue i may as well tell her the truth she will keep it secret and as for yours she will believe anything you please to tell her and so she will the good creature and that's why i never can bear to deceive her about anything but in this instance it is all for her own sake and therefore suppose your wife says that you must go to town immediately and that i had better accompany you as it is upon a serious affair be it so replied o'donahue do you order the horses to be put to while i settle the affair with the females this was soon done and in half an hour the two gentlemen were on their way to exeter and as soon as they arrived which was late in the evening they established themselves at the principal hotel in the mean time mrs austin and mary had also arrived and had taken up their quarters at another hotel where mrs austin would be less exposed it was however too late to visit our hero when they arrived and the next morning they proceeded to the gaol much about the same hour that mcshane and o'donahue paid their visit to mr trevor perhaps it will be better to leave to the imagination of our readers the scene which occurred between our hero and his mother as we have had too many painful ones already in this latter portion of our narrative the joy and grief of both at meeting again only to part for ever the strong conflict between duty and love the lacerated feelings of the doting mother the true and affectionate son and the devoted servant and friend may be better imagined than expressed but their grief was raised to its climax when our hero pressed in his mother's arms as he narrated his adventures confessed that another pang was added to his sufferings in parting with the object of his earliest affections my poor poor boy this is indeed a bitter cup to drink exclaimed mrs austin may god in his mercy look down upon you and console you he will mother and when far away not before not until you can safely do so promise me to go to emma and tell her that i was not guilty i can bear anything but that she should despise me i will my child i will and i will love her dearly for your sake now go on with your history my dear boy we must leave our hero and his mother in conversation and return to mcshane and o'donahue who as soon as they had breakfasted repaired to the lodgings of mr trevor mcshane who was spokesman soon entered upon the business which brought them there mr trevor stated to him the pertinacity of our hero and the impossibility of saving him from condemnation remarking at the same time that there was a mystery which he could not fathom mcshane took upon himself to explain that mystery having as we have before observed already been sufficiently clear sighted to fathom it and referred to o'donahue to corroborate his opinion of the elder rushbrook's character and this father of his is totally lost sight of you say observed mr trevor altogether i have never been able to trace him replied mcshane i was observing to his sister said mr trevor he has no sister interrupted mcshane still there is a young woman and a very sweet young woman too who came to me in london to engage me for his defence who represented herself as his sister that is strange rejoined mcshane musing but however continued mr trevor as i was about to say i was observing to this young woman how strange it was that the first time i was legally employed for the name of rushbrook it should be a case which in the opinion of the world should produce the highest gratification and that in the second in one which has ended in misery how do you mean inquired mcshane i put a person of the name of rushbrook in possession of a large fortune i asked our young friend's sister whether he could be any relation but she said no young rushbrook had no sister i am sure interrupted mcshane i now recollect continued mr trevor that this person who came into the fortune stated that he had formerly held a commission in the army then depend on it it's rushbrook himself who has given himself brevet rank replied mcshane where is he now down in dorsetshire said mr trevor he succeeded to the austin estates and has taken the name 'tis he 'tis he i'll swear to it cried mcshane phillaloo murder and irish the murder's out now no wonder this gentleman wouldn't return my visit and keeps himself entirely at home i beg your pardon mr trevor but what sort of a looking personage may he be for as i have said i have never seen this mr austin a fine tall soldierly man i should say rough but still not vulgar dark hair and eyes aquiline nose if i recollect right 'tis the man exclaimed o'donahue and his wife did you see her asked mcshane no i did not replied mr trevor well i have seen her very often rejoined mcshane and a very nice creature she appears to be i have never been in their house in my life i called and left my card that's all but i have met her several times however as you have not seen her that proves nothing and now mr trevor what do you think we should do i really am not prepared to advise it is a case of great difficulty i think however it would be advisable for you to call upon young rushbrook and see what you can obtain from him after that if you come here to morrow morning i will be better prepared to give you an answer i will do as you wish sir i will call upon my friend first and my name's not mcshane if i don't call upon his father afterwards do nothing rashly i beg replied mr trevor recollect you have come to me for advice and i think you are bound at least to hear what i have to propose before you act that's the truth mr trevor so now with many thanks we will take our leave and call upon you to morrow mcshane and o'donahue then proceeded to the gaol and demanded permission to see our hero there are two ladies with him just now said the gaoler they have been there these three hours so i suppose they will not be much longer we will wait then replied o'donahue in about a quarter of an hour mrs austin and mary made their appearance the former was closely veiled when she entered the gaoler's parlour in which o'donahue and mcshane were waiting it had not been the intention of mrs austin to have gone into the parlour but her agitation and distress had so overcome her that she could scarcely walk and mary had persuaded her as she came down to go in and take glass of water the gentlemen rose when she came in she immediately recognised mcshane and the sudden rush into her memory of what might be the issue of the meeting was so overwhelming that she dropped into a chair and fainted mary ran for some water and while she did so mcshane and o'donahue went to the assistance of mrs austin the veil was removed and of course she was immediately recognised by mcshane who was now fully convinced that austin and rushbrook were one and the same person upon the first signs of returning animation mcshane had the delicacy to withdraw and making a sign to the gaoler he and o'donahue repaired to the cell of our hero the greeting was warm on both sides mcshane was eager to enter upon the subject he pointed out to joey that he knew who committed the murder indeed plainly told him that it was the deed of his father but joey as before would admit nothing he was satisfied with their belief in his innocence but having made up his mind to suffer could not be persuaded to reveal the truth and mcshane and o'donahue quitted the cell perceiving that unless most decided steps were taken without the knowledge of our hero there was no chance of his being extricated from his melancholy fate struck with admiration at his courage and self devotion towards an unworthy parent they bade him farewell simply promising to use all their endeavours in his behalf chapter forty nine the interview according to their arrangement on the following morning mcshane and o'donahue called upon mr trevor and after half an hour's consultation it was at last decided that they should make an attempt to see austin and bide the issue of the interview when they would again communicate with the lawyer who was to return to town on the following day they then set off as fast as four horses could convey them and drove direct to the hall where they arrived about six o'clock in the evening it had so happened that austin had the evening before inquired for his wife the servant reported to him what mary had told them and austin who was in a fidgety humour had sent for the coachman who had driven the carriage to inquire whether mrs austin's friend was very ill the coachman stated that he had not driven over to the place in question but to the nearest post town where mrs austin had taken a postchaise this mystery and concealment on the part of his wife was not very agreeable to a man of mr austin's temper he was by turns indignant and alarmed and after having passed a sleepless night had been all the day anxiously waiting mrs austin's return when the sound of wheels was heard and the carriage of mcshane drove up to the door on inquiry if mr austin was at home the servants replied that they would ascertain and austin who imagined that this unusual visit might be connected with his wife's mysterious absence desired the butler to show in the visitors austin started at the announcement of the names but recovering himself he remained standing near the table drawn up to his full height mr austin said o'donahue we have ventured to call upon you upon an affair of some importance as mr austin we have not the pleasure of your acquaintance but we were formerly if i mistake not serving his majesty in the same regiment i do not pretend to deny gentlemen that you once knew me under different circumstances replied austin haughtily will you please to be seated and then probably you will favour me with the cause of this visit may i inquire of you mr austin said mcshane if you may have happened to look over the newspapers within these few days no and now i recollect which is unusual the papers have not been brought to me regularly they were probably withheld from you in consequence of the intelligence they would have conveyed to you may i ask what that intelligence may be inquired austin surprised the trial conviction and sentence to transportation for life of one joseph rushbrook for the murder of a man of the name of byres replied mcshane mr austin you are of course aware that he is your son you have of course seen the party and he has made that statement to you replied mr austin we have seen the party but he has not made that statement replied o'donahue but do you pretend to deny it i am not aware upon what grounds you have thought proper to come here to interrogate me replied austin supposing that i had a son and that son has as you say been guilty of the deed it certainly is no concern of yours first with your leave mr austin said mcshane let me prove that he is your son you were living at grassford where the murder was committed your son ran away in consequence and fell into the hands of captain now general o'donahue from him your son was made over to me and i adopted him but having been recognised when at school by furness the schoolmaster of the village he absconded to avoid being apprehended and i have never seen him from that time till yesterday morning when i called upon him and had an interview as soon as his mother mrs austin had quitted the cell in exeter gaol where he is at present confined austin started here was the cause of mrs austin's absence explained neither could he any longer refuse to admit that joey was his son after a silence of a minute he replied i have to thank you much for your kindness to my poor boy major mcshane and truly sorry am i that he is in such a dilemma now that i am acquainted with it i shall do all in my power there are other rushbrooks gentlemen and you cannot be surprised at my not immediately admitting that such a disgrace had occurred to my own family of mrs austin's having been with him i assure you i had not any idea her having gone there puts it beyond a doubt although it has been carefully concealed from me till this moment it must not be supposed that because austin replied so calmly to major mcshane he was calm within on the contrary from the very first of the interview he had been in a state of extreme excitement and the struggle to command his feelings was terrible indeed it was now so painfully expressed in his countenance that o'donahue said perhaps mr austin you will allow me to ring for a little water no sir thank you replied austin gasping for breath since you have admitted that joseph rushbrook is your son mr austin continued mcshane your own flesh and blood may i inquire of you what you intend to do in his behalf do you intend to allow the law to take its course and your son to be banished for life what can i do gentlemen he has been tried and condemned of course if any exertion on my part can avail but i fear that there is no chance of that mr austin if he were guilty i should not have interfered but in my opinion he is innocent do you not think so i do not believe sir that he ever would have done such a deed but that avails nothing he is condemned i grant it unless the real murderer of the pedlar could be brought forward y e s replied austin trembling shall i denounce him mr austin do you know him replied austin starting on his feet yes rushbrook replied mcshane in a voice of thunder i do know him 'tis yourself austin could bear up no longer he fell down on the floor as if he had been shot o'donahue and mcshane went to his assistance they raised him up but he was insensible they then rang the bell for assistance the servant came in medical advice was sent for and mcshane and o'donahue perceiving there was no chance of prosecuting their intentions in mr austin's present state quitted the hall just as the chaise with mrs austin and mary drove up to the door chapter fifty in which it is to be hoped that the story winds up to the satisfaction of the reader it was not for some time after the arrival of the medical men that mr austin could be recovered from his state of insensibility and when he was at last restored to life it was not to reason he raved wildly and it was pronounced that his attack was a brain fever as in his incoherent exclamations the name of byres was frequently repeated as soon as the medical assistants had withdrawn mrs austin desired all the servants with the exception of mary to quit the room they did so with reluctance for their curiosity was excited and there was shrugging of the shoulders and whispering and surmising and repeating of the words which had escaped from their unconscious master's lips and hints that all was not right passed from one to another in the servants' hall in the mean time mrs austin and mary remained with him and well it was that the servants had been sent away if they were not to know what had taken place so long ago for now austin played the whole scene over again denounced himself as a murderer spoke of his son and of his remorse and then he would imagine himself in conflict with byres he clenched his fists and he laughed and chuckled and then would change again to bitter lamentations for the deed which he had done oh mary how is this to end exclaimed mrs austin after one of the paroxysms had subsided as guilt always must end madam replied mary bursting into tears and clasping her hands in misery my dear mary do not distress yourself in that manner you are no longer guilty nor is my master then madam for i am sure that he has repented yes indeed he has repented most sincerely one hasty deed has embittered his whole life he never has been happy since and never will be until he is in heaven oh what a happy relief it would be to him replied mary musing i wish that i was if such wish is not sinful mary you must not add to my distress by talking in that manner i want your support and consolation now you have a right to demand everything of me madam replied mary and i will do my best i will indeed i have often felt this before and i thank god for it it will make me more humble the fever continued for many days during which time mr austin was attended solely by his wife and mary the latter had written to our hero stating the cause of her absence from him in so trying a period and she had received an answer stating that he had received from very good authority the information that he was not likely to leave the country for some weeks and requesting that mary would remain with his mother until his father's dangerous illness was decided one way or the other he stated that he should be perfectly satisfied if he only saw her once before his departure to arrange with her relative to her affairs and to give her legal authority to act for him previously to his removal from the country he told her that he had perceived an advertisement in the london papers evidently put in by his friends at portsmouth offering a handsome reward to any one who could give any account of him and that he was fearful that some of those who were at the trial would read it and make known his position he begged mary to write to him every day if possible if it were only a few lines and sent his devoted love to his mother mary complied with all our hero's requests and every day a few lines were despatched and it was now ascertained by the other domestics and by them made generally known that a daily correspondence was kept up with a prisoner in exeter gaol which added still more mystery and interest to the state of mr austin many were the calls and cards left at the hall and if we were to inquire whether curiosity or condolence was the motive of those who went there we are afraid that the cause would in most cases have proved to have been the former among others o'donahue and mcshane did not fail to send every day waiting for the time when they could persuade austin to do justice to his own child the crisis as predicted by the medical attendants at last arrived and mr austin recovered his reason but at the same time all hopes of his again rising from his bed were given over this intelligence was communicated to his wife who wept and wished but dared not utter what she wished mary however took an opportunity when mrs austin had quitted the room to tell mr austin who was in such a feeble state that he could hardly speak that the time would soon come when he would be summoned before a higher tribunal and conjured him by the hopes he had of forgiveness now that the world was fading away before his eyes to put away all pride and to do that justice to his son which our hero's noble conduct towards him demanded to make a confession either in writing or in presence of witnesses before he died which would prove the innocence of his only child the heir to the property and the name there was a straggle and a long one in the proud heart of mr austin before he could consent to this act of justice mary had pointed out the propriety of it early in the morning and it was not until late in the evening after having remained in silence and with his eyes closed for the whole day that austin made a sign to his wife to bend down to him and desired her in a half whisper to send for a magistrate his request was immediately attended to and in an hour the summons was answered by one with whom austin had been on good terms austin made his deposition in few words and was supported by mary while he signed the paper it was done and when she would have removed the pen from his fingers she found that it was still held fast and that his head had fallen back the conflict between his pride and this act of duty had been too overpowering for him in his weak condition and mr austin was dead before the ink of his signature had time to dry the gentleman who had been summoned in his capacity of magistrate thought it advisable to remove from the scene of distress without attempting to communicate with mrs austin in her present sorrow he had been in conversation with o'donahue and mcshane at the time that he was summoned and mr austin's illness and the various reports abroad had been there canvassed o'donahue and mcshane had reserved the secret but when their friend was sent for anticipating some such result would take place they requested him to return to them from the hall he did so and acquainted them with what had passed there's no time to lose then said mcshane i will if you please take a copy of this deposition o'donahue entered into a brief narrative of the circumstances and the behaviour of our hero and as soon as the copy of the deposition had been attested by the magistrate he and mcshane ordered horses and set off for london they knocked up mr trevor at his private house in the middle of the night and put the document into his hands well major mcshane i would gladly have risen from a sick bed to have had this paper put into my hands we must call upon the secretary of state to morrow and i have no doubt but that the poor lad will be speedily released take possession of his property and be an honour to the county an honour to old england replied mcshane but i shall now wish you good night mcshane before he went to bed immediately wrote a letter to mrs austin acquainting her with what he had done and the intentions of mr trevor sending it by express he simply stated the facts without any comments but we must now return to portsmouth the advertisement of mr small did not escape the keen eye of the police constable who had arrested our hero as the reader must recollect the arrest was made so quietly that no one was aware of the circumstance and as the reward of pounds would be a very handsome addition to the pounds which he had already received the man immediately set off for portsmouth on the outside of the coach and went to mr small where he found him in the counting house with mr sleek he soon introduced himself and his business with them and such was mr small's impatience that he immediately signed a cheque for the amount and handed it to the police officer who then bluntly told him that our hero had been tried for murder and sentenced to transportation his real name being rushbrook and not o'donahue this was a heavy blow to mr small having obtained all the particulars from the police constable he dismissed him and was for some time in consultation with mr sleek and as it would be impossible long to withhold the facts it was thought advisable that mrs phillips and emma should become acquainted with them immediately the more so as emma had acknowledged that there was a mystery about our hero a portion of which she was acquainted with mrs phillips was the first party to whom the intelligence was communicated and she was greatly distressed it was some time before she could decide upon whether emma in her weak state should be made acquainted with the melancholy tidings but as she had suffered so much from suspense it was at last considered advisable that the communication should be made it was done as cautiously as possible emma was not so shocked as they supposed she would have been at the intelligence i have been prepared for this or something like this replied she weeping in her mother's arms but i cannot believe that he has done the deed he told me that he did not when he was a child he has asserted it since mother i must i will go and see him see him my child he is confined in gaol do not refuse me mother you know not what i feel you know not i never knew myself till now how much i loved him see him i must and will dearest mother if you value my life if you would not drive reason from its seat do not refuse me mrs phillips found that it was in vain to argue and consulted with mr small who at length after having in vain remonstrated with emma decided that her request should be granted and that very day he accompanied his niece travelling all night until they arrived at exeter in the mean time mrs austin had remained in a state of great distress her husband lay dead she believed that he had confessed his guilt but to what extent she did not know for neither she nor mary had heard what passed between him and the magistrate she had no one but mary to confide in or to console no one to advise with or to consult she thought of sending for the magistrate but it would appear indecorous and she was all anxiety and doubt the letter from mcshane which arrived the next afternoon relieved her at once she felt that her boy was safe mary dear read this he is safe exclaimed she god of heaven accept a mother's grateful tears cannot you spare me madam replied mary returning the letter spare you oh yes quick mary lose not a moment go to him and take this letter with you my dear dear child mary did not wait a second command she sent for post horses and in half an hour was on her way to exeter travelling with as much speed as emma and her uncle she arrived there but a few hours after them our hero had been anxiously awaiting for mary's daily communication the post time had passed and it had not arrived pale and haggard from long confinement and distress of mind he was pacing up and down when the bolts were turned and emma supported by her uncle entered the cell at the sight of her our hero uttered a cry and staggered against the wall he appeared to have lost his usual self control oh said he this might have been spared me i have not deserved this punishment emma hear me as i hope for future happiness i am innocent i am i am indeed and he fell senseless on the pavement mr small raised him up and put him on the bed after a time he revived and remained where he had been laid sobbing convulsively as soon as he became more composed emma who had been sitting by him the tears coursing each other down her pale cheeks addressed him in a calm voice i feel i am sure that you are innocent or i should not have been here bless you for that emma bless you those few words of yours have given me more consolation than you can imagine is it nothing to be treated as a felon to be disgraced to be banished to a distant country and that at the very time that i was full of happiness prosperous and anticipating but i cannot dwell upon that is it not hard to bear emma and what could support me but the consciousness of my own innocence and the assurance that she whom i love so and whom i now lose for ever still believes me so yes it is a balm a consolation and i will now submit to the will of heaven emma burst into tears leaning her face on our hero's shoulder after a time she replied and am i not to be pitied is it nothing to love tenderly devotedly madly to have given my heart my whole thoughts my existence to one object why should i conceal it now to have been dwelling upon visions of futurity so pleasing so delightful all passing away as a dream and leaving a sad reality like this make me one promise you will not refuse emma who knelt by your side when you first met her she who is kneeling before you now i dare not emma for my heart tells me that you would propose a step which must not be you must leave me now and for ever for ever for ever cried emma springing on her feet no no uncle he says i am to leave him for ever who is that continued the frantic girl mary yes 'tis mary he says i must leave him for ever it was mary who had just come into the cell must i mary no no replied mary not so he is saved and his innocence is established he is yours for ever we shall not attempt to describe the scene we could not do justice to we must allow the day to pass away during which emma and our hero mcshane and mary were sitting together tears of misery wiped away tears of joy still flowing and glistening with the radiance of intermingled smiles the next morning mcshane and o'donahue arrived the secretary of state had given immediate orders for our hero's release and they had brought the document with them the following day they were all en route emma and her uncle to portsmouth where they anxiously awaited the arrival of our hero as soon as he had performed his duty to his parents we must allow the reader to suppose the joy of mrs austin in once more holding her child in her embrace and the smiles and happiness of mary at his triumphant acquittal the wondering of the domestics the scandal and rumour of the neighbourhood three days sufficed to make all known and by that time joey was looked upon as the hero of a novel on the fourth day he accompanied the remains of his father as chief mourner the funeral was quiet without being mean there was no attendance no carriages of the neighbouring gentry followed our hero was quite alone and unsupported but when the ceremony was over the want of respect shown to the memory of his father was more than atoned for by the kindness and consideration shown towards the son who was warmly yet delicately welcomed as the future proprietor of the hall three months passed away and there was a great crowd before the house of mr small navy agent at portsmouth there was a large company assembled the o'donahues the mcshanes the spikemans and many others mrs austin was there looking ten years younger and mary was attending her at the toilet both of them half smiles half tears for it was the morning of our hero's wedding day mr small strutted about in white smalls and mr sleek spluttered over everybody the procession went to the church and soon after the ceremony one couple of the party set off for the hall where the others went is of no consequence we have now wound up the history of little joey rushbrook the poacher we have only to add that the character of our hero was not the worse as he grew older and was the father of a family the hall was celebrated for hospitality for the amiability of its possessors and the art which they possessed of making other people happy mary remained with them more as a confidante than as a servant indeed she had so much money that she received several offers of marriage which she invariably refused observing with the true humbleness of a contrite heart that she was undeserving of any honest good man everybody else even those who knew her history thought otherwise but mary continued firm in her resolution as for all the rest of the personages introduced into these pages they passed through life with an average portion of happiness which is all that can be expected in conclusion we have only one remark to make in this story we have shown how a young lad who commenced his career with poaching ultimately became a gentleman of pounds a year but we must remind our youthful readers that it does not follow that every one who commences with poaching is to have the same good fortune we advise them therefore not to attempt it as they may find that instead of pounds a year they may stand a chance of going to where our hero very narrowly escaped from being sent that is to a certain portion of her majesty's dominions beyond the seas latterly termed australia but more generally known by the appellation of botany bay chapter fifty one a rencontre a short story one evening i was sitting alone in the salle a manger of the couronne d'or at boulogne when colonel g an old acquaintance came in after the first greeting he took a chair and was soon as busily occupied as i was with a cigar which was occasionally removed from our lips as we asked and replied to questions as to what had been our pursuits subsequently to our last rencontre after about half an hour's chit chat he observed as he lighted a fresh cigar when i was last in this room i was in company with a very strange personage male or female inquired i female replied colonel g altogether it's a story worth telling and as it will pass away the time i will relate it to you unless you wish to retire as i satisfied him that i was not anxious to go to bed and very anxious to hear his story he narrated it as nearly as i can recollect in the following words i had taken my place in the diligence from paris and when i arrived at notre dame des victoires it was all ready for a start the luggage piled up as high as an english haystack had been covered over and buckled down and the conducteur was calling out for the passengers i took my last hasty whiff of my cigar and unwillingly threw away more than half of a really good havannah for i perceived that in the interieur for which i had booked myself there was one female already seated and women and cigars are such great luxuries in their respective ways that they are not to be indulged in at one and the same time the world would be too happy and happiness we are told is not for us here below not that i agree with that moral although it comes from very high authority there is a great deal of happiness in this world if you knew how to extract it or rather i should say of pleasure there is a pleasure in doing good there is a pleasure unfortunately in doing wrong there is a pleasure in looking forward ay and in looking backward also there is pleasure in loving and being loved in eating and drinking and though last not least in smoking i do not mean to say that there are not the drawbacks of pain regret and even remorse but there is a sort of pleasure even in them it is pleasant to repent because you know that you are doing your duty and if there is no great pleasure in pain it precedes an excess when it has left you i say again that if you know how to extract it there is a great deal of pleasure and of happiness in this world especially if you have as i have a very bad memory allons messieurs' said the conducteur and when i got in i found myself the sixth person and opposite to the lady for all the other passengers were of my own sex having fixed our hats up to the roof wriggled and twisted a little so as to get rid of coat tails etcetera all of which was effected previously to our having cleared rue notre dame des victoires we began to scrutinise each other our female companion's veil was down and doubled so that i could not well make her out my other four companions were young men all frenchmen apparently good tempered and inclined to be agreeable a few seconds were sufficient for my reconnoitre of the gentlemen and then my eyes were naturally turned towards the lady she was muffled up in a winter cloak so that her figure was not to be made out and the veil still fell down before her face so that only one cheek and a portion of her chin could be deciphered that fragment of her physiognomy was very pretty and i watched in silence for the removal of the veil i have omitted to state that before i got into the diligence i saw her take a very tender adieu of a very handsome woman but as her back was turned to me at the time i did not see her face she had now fallen back in her seat and seemed disposed to commune with her own thoughts that did not suit my views which were to have a view of her face real politeness would have induced me to leave her to herself but pretended politeness was resorted to that i might gratify my curiosity so i inquired if she wished the window up the answer was in the negative and in a very sweet voice and then there was a pause of course so i tried again you are melancholy at parting with your handsome sister' observed i leaning forward with as much appearance of interest as i could put into my beautiful phiz how could you have presumed that she was my sister' replied she from the strong family likeness' replied i i felt certain of it' but she is only my sister in law sir my brother's wife' then i presume he chose a wife as like his sister as he could find nothing more natural i should have done the same' sir you are very polite' replied the lady who lowered down the window adding i like fresh air' perhaps you will find yourself less incommoded if you take off your veil' i will not ascribe that proposition to curiosity on your part sir' replied the lady as you have already seen my face' you cannot then be surprised at my wishing to see it once more' you are very polite sir' although her voice was soft there was a certain quickness and decision in her manner and language which were very remarkable the other passengers now addressed her and the conversation became general the veiled lady took her share in it and showed a great deal of smartness and repartee in an hour more we were all very intimate as we changed horses i took down my hat to put into it my cigar case which i had left in my pocket upon which the lady observed you smoke i perceive and so i dare say do all the rest of the gentlemen now do not mind me i am fond of the smell of tobacco i am used to it' we hesitated nay more i smoke myself and will take a cigar with you' this was decisive i offered my cigar case another gentleman struck a light lifting up her veil so as to show a very pretty mouth with teeth as white as snow she put the cigar in her mouth and set us the example in a minute both windows were down every one had a cigar in his mouth where did you learn to smoke madam' was a question put to the incognita by the passenger who sat next to her where in the camp africa everywhere i did belong to the army that is my husband was the captain of the th he was killed poor man in the last successful expedition to constantine c'etait un brave homme' indeed were you at constantine' yes i was i followed the army during the whole campaign' the diligence stopped for supper or dinner whichever it might be considered and the conducteur threw open the doors now' thought i we shall see her face' and so i believe thought the other passengers but we were mistaken the lady went upstairs and had a basin of soup taken to her when all was ready we found her in the diligence with her veil down as before this was very provoking for she was so lively and witty in conversation and the features of her face which had been disclosed were so perfect that i was really quite on a fret that she would leave me without satisfying my curiosity they talk of woman's curiosity but we men have as much after all it became dark the lady evidently avoided further conversation and we all composed ourselves as well as we could it may be as well to state in few words that the next morning she was as cautious and reserved as ever the diligence arrived at this hotel the passengers separated and i found that the lady and i were the only two who took up our quarters there at all events the frenchmen who travelled with us went away just as wise as they came you remain here' inquired i as soon as we had got out of the diligence yes' replied she and you ' i remain here certainly but i hope you do not intend to remain always veiled it is too cruel of you' i must go to my room now and make myself a little more comfortable after that monsieur l'anglais i will speak to you you are going over in the packet i presume' i am by to morrow's packet' i shall put myself under your protection for i am also going to london' i shall be most delighted' au revoir' about an hour afterwards a message was brought to me by the garcon that the lady would be happy to receive me at number i ascended to the second floor knocked and was told to come in she was now without a veil and what do you think was her reason for the concealment of her person by the beard of mokhanna how can i tell well then she had two of the most beautiful eyes in the world her eyebrows were finely arched her forehead was splendid her mouth was tempting in short she was as pretty as you could wish a woman to be only she had broken her nose a thousand pities for it must once have been a very handsome one well to continue i made my bow you perceive now sir' said she why i wore my veil down' no indeed' replied i you are very polite or very blind' rejoined she the latter i believe not to be the fact i did not choose to submit to the impertinence of my own countrymen in the diligence they would have asked me a hundred questions upon my accident but you are an englishman and have respect for a female who has been unfortunate' i trust i deserve your good opinion madam and if i can be in any way useful to you ' you can i shall be a stranger in england i know that in london there is a great man one monsieur lis tong who is very clever' very true madam if your nose instead of having been slightly injured as it is had been left behind you in africa mr liston would have found you another' if he will only repair the old one i ask no more you give me hopes but the bones are crushed completely as you must see' that is of no consequence mr liston has put a new eye in to my knowledge the party was short sighted and saw better with the one put in by mr liston than with the one which had been left him' est il possible mais quel homme extraordinaire perhaps you will do me the favour to sit with me monsieur and if i mistake not you have a request to make of me n'est ce pas' i felt such interest about you madam that i acknowledge if it would not be too painful to you i should like to ask a question' which is how did i break my nose of course you want to know and as it is the only return i can make for past or future obligations to you you shall most certainly be gratified i will not detain you now i shall expect you to supper adieu monsieur' i did not of course fail in my appointment and after supper she commenced the question to be answered' said she is how did you break your nose is it not well then at least i shall answer it after my own fashion so to begin at the beginning i am now exactly twenty two years old my father was tambour majeur in the garde imperiale i was born in the camp brought up in the camp and finally i was married in the camp to a lieutenant of infantry at the time so that you observe i am altogether militaire as a child i was wakened up with the drum and fife and went to sleep with the bugles as a girl i became quite conversant with every military manoeuvre and now that i am a woman grown i believe that i am more fit for the baton than one half of those marshals who have gained it i have studied little else but tactics and have as my poor husband said quite a genius for them but of that hereafter i was married at sixteen and have ever since followed my husband i followed him at last to his grave he quitted my bed for the bed of honour where he sleeps in peace we'll drink to his memory' we emptied our glasses when she continued my husband's regiment was not ordered to africa until after the first disastrous attempt upon constantine it fell to our lot to assist in retrieving the honour of our army in the more successful expedition which took place as you of course are aware about three months ago i will not detain you with our embarkation or voyage we landed from a steamer at bona and soon afterwards my husband's company was ordered to escort a convoy of provisions to the army which was collecting at mzez ammar well we arrived safely at our various camps of drean nech meya and amman berda we made a little detour to visit ghelma i had curiosity to see it as formerly it was an important city i must say that a more tenable position i never beheld but i tire you with these details' on the contrary i am delighted' you are very good i ought to have said something about the travelling in those wild countries which is anything but pleasant the soil is a species of clay hard as a flint when the weather is dry but running into a slippery paste as soon as moistened it is therefore very fatiguing especially in wet weather when the soldiers slip about in a very laughable manner to look at but very distressing to themselves i travelled either on horseback or in one of the waggons as it happened i was too well known and i hope i may add too well liked not to be as well provided for as possible it is remarkable how soon a frenchman will make himself comfortable wherever he may chance to be the camp of mzez ammar was as busy and as lively as if it was pitched in the heart of france the followers had built up little cabins out of the branches of trees with their leaves on interwoven together all in straight lines forming streets very commodious and perfectly impervious to the withering sun there were restaurants cafes debis de vin et d'eau de vie sausage sellers butchers grocers in fact there was every trade almost and everything you required not very cheap certainly but you must recollect that this little town had sprung up as if by magic in the heart of the desert it was in the month of september that damremont ordered a reconnoissance in the direction of constantine and a battalion of my husband's regiment the th was ordered to form a part of it i have said nothing about my husband he was a good little man and a brave officer full of honour but very obstinate he never would take advice and it was nothing but tais toi coralie all day long but no one is perfect he wished me to remain in the camp but i made it a rule never to be left behind we set off and i rode in one of the little carriages called cacolets which had been provided for the wounded it was terrible travelling i was jolted to atoms in the ascent of the steep mountain called the rass el akba but we gained the summit without a shot being fired when we arrived there and looked down beneath us the sight was very picturesque there were about four or five thousand of the arab cavalry awaiting our descent their white bournous as they term the long dresses in which they enfold themselves waving in the wind as they galloped at speed in every direction while the glitter of their steel arms flashed like lightning upon our eyes we closed our ranks and descended the arabs in parties of forty or fifty charging upon our flanks every minute not coming to close conflict but stopping at pistol shot distance discharging their guns and then wheeling off again to a distance mere child's play sir nevertheless there were some of our men wounded and the little waggon upon which i was riding was ordered up in the advance to take them in unfortunately to keep clear of the troops the driver kept too much on one side of the narrow defile through which we passed the consequence was that the waggon upset and i was thrown out a considerable distance down the precipice' and broke your nose' interrupted i no indeed sir i did not i escaped with only a few contusions about the region of the hip which certainly lamed me for some time and made the jolting more disagreeable than ever well the reconnoissance succeeded damremont was however wrong altogether i told him so when i met him but he was an obstinate old fool and his answer was not as polite as it might have been considering that at that time i was a very pretty woman we returned to the camp at mzez ammar a few days afterwards we were attacked by the arabs who showed great spirit and determination in their desultory mode of warfare which however can make no impression on such troops as the french the attack was continued for three days when they decamped as suddenly as they had come but this cannot be very interesting to you monsieur' on the contrary do not i beg leave out a single remark or incident' you are very good i presume you know how we militaires like to fight our battles over again well sir we remained in camp until the arrival of the duc de nemours a handsome fair lad who smiled upon me very graciously on the st of october we set off on our expedition to constantine that is to say the advanced guard did of which my husband's company formed a portion the weather which had been very fine now changed and it rained hard all the day the whole road was one mass of mud and there was no end to delays and accidents however the weather became fine again and on the th we arrived within two leagues of constantine when the arabs attacked us and i was very nearly taken prisoner' indeed' yes my husband who as i before observed to you was very obstinate would have me ride on a caisson in the rear whereas i wished to be in the advance where my advice might have been useful the charge of the arabs was very sudden the three men who were with the caisson were sabred and i was in the arms of a chieftain who was wheeling round his horse to make off with me when a ball took him in the neck and he fell with me i disengaged myself seized the horse by the bridle and prevented its escape and i also took possession of the arab's pistols and scymitar' indeed' my husband sold the horse the next day to one of our generals who forgot to pay for it after my husband was killed as for the scymitar and pistols they were stolen from me that night but what can you expect our army is brave but a little demoralised the next day we arrived before constantine and we had to defile before the enemy's guns at one portion of the road men and horses were tumbled over by their fire the caisson that i was riding upon was upset by a ball and thrown down the ravine dragging the horses after it i lay among the horses' legs they kicking furiously it was a miracle that my life was preserved as it was ' you broke your nose' interrupted i no sir indeed i did not i only received a kick on the arm which obliged me to carry it in a sling for some days the weather became very bad we had few tents and they were not able to resist the storms of rain and wind we wrapped ourselves up how we could and sat in deep pools of water and the arabs attacked us before we could open the fire of our batteries we were in such a pickle that had the bad weather lasted we must have retreated and happy would those have been who could have once more found themselves safe in the camp of mzez ammar i don't think that i ever suffered so much as i did at that time the weather had even overcome the natural gallantry of our nation and so far from receiving any attention the general remark to me was what the devil do you do here this to be said to a pretty woman it was not till the th that we could manage to open the fire of our batteries it was mud mud and mud again the men and horses were covered with mud up to their necks the feathers of the staff were covered with mud every ball which was fired by the enemy sent up showers of mud even the face of the duc de nemours was disfigured with it i must say that our batteries were well situated all except the great mortar battery this i pointed out to damremont when he passed me and he was very savage great men don't like to be told of their faults however he lost his life three days afterwards from not taking my advice he was going down the hill with rhullieres when i said to him mon general you expose yourself too much that which is duty in a subaltern is a fault in a general he very politely told me to go to where he may chance to be himself now for a cannonball struck him a few seconds afterwards and he was killed on the spot general perregaux was severely wounded almost at the same time for four days the fighting was awful battery answered to battery night and day while from every quarter of the compass we were exposed to the fierce attacks of the arab cavalry the commander of our army sent a flag of truce to their town commanding them to surrender and what do you think was the reply if you want powder we'll supply you if you are without bread we will send it to you but as long as there is one good mussulman left alive you do not enter the town was not that grand the very reply when made known to the troops filled them with admiration of their enemy and they swore by their colours that if ever they overpowered them they would give them no quarter in two days general vallee to whom the command fell upon the death of damremont considered the breach sufficiently wide for the assault and we every hour expected that the order would be given it came at last my poor husband was in the second column which mounted strange to say he was very melancholy on that morning and appeared to have a presentiment of what was to take place coralie said he to me as he was scraping the mud off his trousers with his pocket knife if i fall you will do well i leave you as a legacy to general vallee he will appreciate you do not forget to let him know my testamentary dispositions i promised i would not the drums beat he kissed me on both cheeks go my philippe said i go to glory he did for a mine was sprung and he with many others was blown to atoms i had watched the advance of the column and was able to distinguish the form of my dear philippe when the explosion with the vast column of smoke took place when it cleared away i could see the wounded in every direction hastening back but my husband was not among them in the mean time the other columns entered the breach the firing was awful and the carnage dreadful it was more than an hour after the assault commenced before the french tricolor waved upon the minarets of constantine it was not until the next day that i could make up my mind to search for my husband's body but it was my duty i climbed up the breach strewed with the corpses of our brave soldiers intermingled with those of the arabs but i could not find my husband at last a head which had been blown off attracted my attention i examined it it was my philippe's blackened and burnt and terribly disfigured but who can disguise the fragment of a husband from the keen eyes of the wife of his bosom i leaned over it my poor philippe exclaimed i and the tears were bedewing my cheeks when i perceived the duc de nemours close to me with all his staff attending him what have we here said he with surprise to those about him a wife looking for her husband's body mon prince replied i i cannot find it but here is his head he said something very complimentary and kind and then walked on i continued my search without success and determined to take up my quarters in the town as i clambered along i gained a battered wall and putting my foot on it it gave way with me and i fell down several feet stunned with the blow i remained for some time insensible when i came to i found ' that you had broken your nose' no indeed i had sprained my ankle and hurt the cap of my knee but my nose was quite perfect you must have a little patience yet what fragments of my husband were found were buried in a large grave which held the bodies and the mutilated portions of the killed and having obtained possession of an apartment in constantine i remained there several days lamenting his fate at last it occurred to me that his testamentary dispositions should be attended to and i wrote to general vallee informing him of the last wishes of my husband his reply was very short it was that he was excessively flattered but press of business would not permit him to administer to the will it was not polite on the th i quitted constantine with a convoy of wounded men the dysentery and the cholera made fearful ravages and i very soon had a caisson all to myself the rain again came on in torrents and it was a dreadful funeral procession every minute wretches jolted to death were thrown down into pits by the road side and the cries of those who survived were dreadful many died of cold and hunger and after three days we arrived at the camp of mzez ammar with the loss of more than one half of our sufferers i took possession of one of the huts built of the boughs of the trees which i formerly described and had leisure to think over my future plans and prospects i was young and pretty and hope did not desert me i had recovered my baggage which i had left at the camp and was now able to attend to my toilet the young officers who were in the camp paid me great attention and were constantly passing and repassing to have a peep at the handsome widow as they were pleased to call me and now comes the history of my misfortune the cabin built of boughs which i occupied was double one portion was fenced off from the other with a wattling of branches which ran up about seven feet but not so high as the roof in one apartment i was located the other was occupied by a young officer who paid me attention but who was not to my liking i had been walking out in the cool of the evening and had returned when i heard voices in the other apartment i entered softly and they did not perceive my approach they were talking about me and i must say that the expressions were very complimentary at last one of the party observed well she is a splendid woman and a good soldier's wife i hope to be a general by and bye and she would not disgrace a marshal's baton i think i shall propose to her before we leave the camp now sir i did not recognise the speaker by his voice and flattered by the remark i was anxious to know who it could be who was thus prepossessed in my favour i thought that if i could climb up on the back of the only chair which was in my apartment i should be able to see over the partition and satisfy my curiosity i did so and without noise and i was just putting my head over to take a survey of the tenants of the other apartment when the chair tilted and down i came on the floor and on my face unfortunately i hit my nose upon the edge of the frying pan with which my poor philippe and i used to cook our meat and now sir you know how it was that i broke my nose' what a pity' observed i yes a great pity i had gone through the whole campaign without any serious accident and but after all it was very natural the two besetting evils of women are vanity and curiosity and if you were to ascertain the truth you would find that it is upon these two stumbling blocks that most women are upset and break their noses' very true madam' replied i i thank you for your narrative and shall be most happy to be of any use to you but i will detain you from your rest no longer so wish you a very good night' well colonel said i as he made a sudden stop what occurred after that i took great care of her until we arrived in london saw her safe to the hotel in leicester square and then took my leave whether liston replaced her nose and she is now flanee ing about paris as beautiful as before her accident or whether his skill was useless to her and she is among the soeurs de charite or in a convent i cannot say i have never seen or heard of her since well i know liston and i'll not forget to ask him about her the very first time that i meet him will you have another cigar no i thank you i've finished my cigar my bottle and my story and so now good night the end

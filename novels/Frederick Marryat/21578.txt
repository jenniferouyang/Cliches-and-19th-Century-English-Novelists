rattlin the reefer by edward howard and edited by captain marryat captain frederick marryat was born july and died august he retired from the british navy in in order to devote himself to writing in the following years he wrote books many of which are among the very best of english literature and some of which are still in print marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories he says somewhere that when he sat down for the days work he never knew what he was going to write he certainly was a literary genius rattlin the reefer was published in the twelfth book to flow from marryats pen it had been written by edward howard but needed a good deal of polishing before it could be published which marryat did there is distinctly more flowery language than was normal with marryat and there are many long and unusual words that are not found elsewhere in marryats work there is also a great use of latin phrases to describe the action most of which fortunately are little more than doglatin ie the meaning can easily be decried this etext was transcribed in by nick hodson and was reformatted in and again in rattlin the reefer by edward howard and edited by captain frederick marryat chapter one i begin a life without a similitude with a similestart off with four horsesand finally i make my first appearance on any stage under the protection of the crown in the volume i am going to write it is my intention to adhere rigidly to the truththis will be bona fide an autobiographyand as the public like novelty an autobiography without an iota of fiction in the whole of it will be the greatest novelty yet offered to its fastidiousness as many of the events which will be my province to record are singular and even startling i may be permitted to sport a little moral philosophy drawn from the kennel in lower thames street which may teach my readers to hesitate ere they condemn as invention mere matters of absolute though uncommon fact let us stand with that old gentleman under the porch of saint magnuss church for the rain is thrashing the streets till they actually look white and the kennel before us is swelled into a formidable and hardly fordable brook that kennel is the stream of lifeand a dirty and a weary one it is if we may judge by the old gentlemans looks all is hurried into that common sewer the grave what bubbles float down it everything that is fairly in the middle of the stream seems to sail with it steadily and triumphantlyand many a filthy fragment enters the sewer with a pomp and dignity not unlike the funeral obsequies of a great lord but my business is with that little chip by some means it has been thrust out of the principal current and now that it is out see what pranks it is playing how erratic are its motionsinto what strange holes and corners it is thrust the same phenomenon will happen in life once start a being out of the usual course of existence and many and strange will be his adventures ere he once more be allowed to regain the common stream and be permitted to float down in silent tranquillity to the grave common to all about seven oclock in the evening of the th of february a postchaise with four horses drove with fiery haste up to the door of the crown inn at reading the evening had closed in bitterly a continuous storm of mingled sleet and rain had driven every being who had a home to the shelter it afforded as the vehicle stopped with a most consequential jerk and the steps were flung down with that clatter postboys will make when they can get four horses before their leathern boxes the solitary inmate seemed to shrink further into its dark corner instead of coming forward eagerly to exchange the comforts of the blazing hearth for the damp confinement of a hired chaise thrice had the obsequious landlord bowed his wellpowdered head and at each inclination wiped off with the palm of his hand the raindrops that had settled on the central baldness of his occiput ere the traveller seemed to be aware that such a man existed as the landlord of the crown or that that landlord was standing at the chaisedoor at length a female closely veiled and buried in shawls like a sultana tremblingly took the proffered arm and tottered into the hotel shortly after mine host returned attended by porter waiter and stableboyand giving by the ladys orders a handsome gratuity to each of the postboys asked for the travellers luggage there was none at this announcement the landlord as he afterwards expressed himself was struck all of a heap though what he meant by it was never clearly comprehended as any alteration in his curiously squat figure must have been an improvement while he remained in perplexity and in the rain the latter of which might easily have been avoided another message arrived from the lady ordering fresh horses to be procured and those with the chaise to be kept in readiness to start at a moments warning more mystery and more perplexity in fact if these combined causes had been allowed to remain much longer in operation the worthy landlord instead of carrying on his business profitably would have been carried off peremptorily by a catarrh his wifes nursing and a doctor but fortunately it struck one of the postboys that rain was not necessary to a conversation and sleet but a bad solvent of a mystery so the posse adjourned into the tap in order that the subject might be discussed more at the ease of the gentlemen who fancied themselves concerned in it and you have not seen her face said mine host of the crown shouldnt know her from adams grandmother said the postboy who had ridden the wheelhorses howsomedever i yeerd her sob and moan like a wheel as vants grease you may say that said the other postboy a little shrivelled old man a good deal past sixty we lads see strange soights i couldnt abear to see her siffer in that ere manneri did feel for her almost as much as if shed been an oss the landlord gave the two charioteers force de complimens for the tenderness of their feelings the intensity of which he fully comprehended as he changed for each his guinea the bounty of the lady when he found them in proper cue that is to say in the middle of their second glass of brandyandwater he proceeded in his crossexamination and he learned from them that they had been engaged to wait at a certain spot on an extensive heath some twelve miles distant that they had hardly waited there an hour when a private carriage containing the lady in question and a gentleman arrived that the lady closely veiled had been transferred from the one conveyance to the other and that the postboys had been ordered to drive with the utmost speed to the destination where they now found themselves this account seemed to satisfy the scruples of the landlord which of course were by no means pecuniary but merely moral when in bounced the fieryvisaged landlady he was forced to stand the smallshot of his wife poor man he had only powder to reply to it and that just now was woefully damp you lazy loitering dolittle muchhindering prateapace sot heres the lady taken alarmingly ill the physician has been sent for and his carriage will be at the door before you blow that illlooking nose of yours that my blessed ten commandments are itching to score downyou paltry ah with a very little voice and a very great submission mine host squeaked out have you seen the ladys face face is it face you want and ladies faces toohavent i got face enough for youyou apology you what the good woman said was indubitably true she had face enough for any two moderatelyvisaged wives and enough over and above to have supplied anyone who might have lost a portion of theirs however i will be more polite than the landlady and acquaint the reader that no one yet of the establishment had seen the ladys face nor was it intended that anyone should as this squabble was growing into a quarrel the physician arrived he had not been long alone with the unknown before he sent for a surgeon and the surgeon for a nurse there was so much bustle alarm and secrecy abovestairs that the landlord began to consider which of the two undertakers his friends he should favour with the anticipated job and rubbed his hands as he dwelt on the idea of a coroners inquest and the attendant dinner the landlady was nearly raving mad at being excluded from what she supposed was the bed of death hot flannels and warm water were now eagerly called forand these demands were looked upon as a sure sign that dissolution approached the stairs approaching the ladys chamber were lined with master mistress manservant and maidservants all eagerly listening to the awful bustle within at length there is a dead silence of some minutes the listeners shuddered it is all over with her ejaculates one tenderhearted manoeuvrer of the warmingpan with her apron in the corner her eye poor lady it is all over with her it was exactly two in the morning of the st that a shrill cry was heard shortly after the door was flung open by the nurse and a new edition of an embryo reefer appeared in her arms and very manfully did the play of his lungs make everyone present aware that somebody had made his appearance the supposed bed of death turned out to be a bed of life and another being was born to wail to sin and to die as myriads have wailed and sinned and died before him chapter two i am decidedly an incumbrancebegin life with half a dozen fruitless journeysfind a home and a foster fatherand talk learnedly of triangles and archbishops what is to be done with the child it is a fearful question and has been often asked under every degree of suffering of all possible articles a child is the most difficult to dispose of a wife may be dispensed with without much heartbreakingeven a friend and rubbish may be shot out of the way and the bosom remain tranquil but a helpless newborn infanto there is a pleading eloquence in its feeble wail that goes to the heart and ear of the strangerand must act like living fire in the bowels of the mother the whole household were immediately sent in quest of a wetnurse at length one was found in the very pretty wife of a reprobate sawyer of the name of brandon he had seen many vicissitudes of lifehad been a soldier a gentlemans servant had been to sea and was a shrewd vicious and hard man with a most unquenchable passion for strong beer and a steady addiction to skittles his wife was a little gentle being of an extremely compact and prepossessing figure her face was ruddy with health and as said before extremely pretty for had it not been for an air of what fear must call vulgarity for want of a more gentle term she would have merited the term of beautiful brandon was a topsawyer but as three out of the six working days of the week he was to be found with a pot of porter by his side pipe in mouth and the skittleball in his hand it is not surprising that there was much misery in his home which he often heightened by his brutality yet was he a very pleasant fellow when he had money to spend and actually a witty as well as a jovial dog when spending it his wife had not long given birth to a fine girl and the mothers bosom bled over the destitution with which her husbands recklessness had now made her so long familiar all this time your humble servant was squalling and none were found who under all the strange circumstances would take upon them the charge of an infant about to be immediately forsaken by its mother at length one of the maidservants at the inn remembered to have heard mrs brandon say that rather than live on among all her squalidness and penury she would endeavour to suckle another child besides her own and as she was then in redundant health and had two fine breasts of milkfor a fine breast of milk would not have served my turn or rather mary and i must have taken it by turnsshe was accordingly sent for yet when she understood that i was to be placed that moment under her care that no references could be given and no address left in the case of accident all her wishes to better herself and babe were not sufficiently strong to make her run the risk a guineaandahalf a week was offered and the first quarter tendered in advance but in vain at length an additional tenpound note gave her sufficient courage and flannel being in request i was thus launched to struggle with the world the frantic kiss of the distracted mother was impressed on my lips the agonised blessing was called down upon me from the god that she then thought not of interceding with for herself and the solemn objurgation given to my fostermother to have a religious and motherly care of me by the love she bore her own child and then lest the distress of this scene should become fatal to her who bore me i and my nurse were hurried away before the day of my birth had fully dawned this day happened to be one in which the topsawyer had been graciously pleased to toss his arms up and down over the pitnot of destruction but of preservation he had started early and whilst he was setting the teeth on edge of all within hearing by setting an edge to his saw some very officious friend ran to him to tell him that his wife was increasing his family without even his permission having been asked instead therefore of making a dust in his own pit he flung down his file took up his lanthorn and hurried along to kick up a dust at home the brute may he have to sharpen saws with bad files for half an eternity he sworehow awfully the fellow sworethat i should be turned from his inhospitable roof immediatelyand my gentle nurse adding her tears to my squalls through that dismal sleety morning which was then breaking mistily upon so much wretchedness was compelled to carry me back to my mother the most impassioned entreaties and an additional five pounds at length prevailed on mrs brandon to nestle me again in her bosom and try to excite the sympathy of her husband she returned to him but the fellow had now taken to himself two counsellors a drunken mate who served under him in the pit and his own avarice i am stating mere facts i may not be believedi cannot help itbut three times was i carried backwards and forwards every transit producing to the sawyer five extra pounds when at length my little head found a restingplace all these events i have had over and over again from my nurse and they are most faithfully recorded before noon on that memorable morning the chaiseandfour were again at the door and the veiled and shawlenveloped lady was lifted in and the vehicle dashed rapidly through the streets of reading in a northerly direction i pretend not to relate facts of which i have never had an assured knowledge i cannot state to where that chaise and its desolate occupant proceeded nor can i give a moving description of feelings that i did not witness when i afterwards knew that that lady was my mother i never dared question her upon these points but from the strength the intensity of every good and affectionate feeling that marked her character i can only conceive that if that journey was made in the stupor of weakness and exhaustion or even in the wanderings of delirium it must have been to her a dispensation of infinite mercy she deserted her newborn infantshe flung forth her child from the warmth of her own bosom to the cold hireling kindness of the stranger i think i hear some puritanical worldobserving starched piece of female rigidity exclaim and therein she did a great wickedness the fact i admit but the wickedness i deny utterly that there were misery and much suffering inflicted i do not deny but of all guilt even of all blame i eagerly acquit one whose principles of action were as pure and the whole tenor of whose life was as upright as even virtue herself could have dictated let the guilt and the misery attendant upon this desertion of myself be attached to the real sinners i have before said that brandon was a top sawyer we must now call him mr brandonhe has purchased a pair of top boots a swell top coat and though now frequently top heavy thinks himself altogether a topping gentleman he is now to be seen more frequently in the skittleground clasping a halfgallon instead of a quart of beer he decides authoritatively upon foul and fair play and his voice is potential on almost all matters in debate at the two jolly sawyers near lambeth walk just at the top of cutthroat lane all this is now altered we look in vain for the two jolly sawyers we may ask where are they and not echo but the archbishop of canterbury must answer wherefor he has most sacerdotally put down all the jollity there by pulling down the house and has built up a large wharf where once stood a very pretty treebesprinkled walk leading to the said jolly sawyers cutthroat lane is no more yet though it bore a villainous name it was very pretty to walk through and its many turnstiles were as so many godsends to the little boys as they enjoyed on them gratis some blithe rides that they would have had to pay for at any fair in the kingdom we can very well understand why the turnstiles were so offensive to the dignitary in fact all this building and leasing of houses and improvement of property and destroying of poor peoples pleasant walks is nothing more than an improved reading of the words benefit of clergy chapter three my fosterfather forsakes the right line of conduct chalked out for himi grow illfind potluck and baptismgo to bath and take my first lessons in the arts of persuasion when i was placed with the brandons it was stipulated that they should remove immediately from reading and whilst i was in their family they should return there no more for this purpose the necessary expenses were forwarded to them by an unknown hand to lambeth they therefore removed because it abounded in sawpits but this advantage was more than destroyed by its abundance of skittlegrounds mr joseph brandon had satisfied his conscience by coming into the neighbourhood of the said sawpits it showed a direction towards the paths of industry but whilst he had through his wife for nursing me pounds shillings per annum he always preferred knocking down or seeing knocked down the nine pins to the being placed upon a narrow plank toeing a chalked line this was not a line of conduct that he actually chalked out for himself only it so happened that when he was settled at lambeth on the third day he went out to look after work and going down stangate street he turned up cutthroat lane and after passing all the turnstiles he arrived at the two jolly sawyers himself making a third in his search for employment he found it impossible for the space of a whole month to get any further but he was not long permitted to be the ascendant spirit among the top and bottom men whether it be that mrs brandon overrated her powers of affording sustenance or that i had suffered through the inclemency of the weather in my three journeys on my natal day or whether that i was naturally delicate or perhaps all these causes contributing to it i fell into a very sickly state and before a third month had elapsed i was forced to another migration though no one appeared both myself and mrs brandon were continually watched and a very superior sort of surgeon in the neighbourhood of lambeth from the second day of my arrival there found some pretence or another to get introduced to my nurse and took a violent liking to the little puny wailing piece of mortality myself i was about this time so exceedingly small that though at the risk of being puerile i cannot help recording that joseph brandon immersed me all excepting my head in a quart pot no one but a joe brandon or a top sawyer could have had so filthy an idea i have never been told whether the pot contained any drainings but i must attribute to this illadvised act a most plebeian fondness that i have for strong beer and which seems to be even in these days of french manners and french wines unconquerable my health now became so precarious that a letter arrived signed simply er ordering that i should be immediately baptised and five pounds were enclosed for the expenses the letter stated that two decent persons should be found by mrs brandon to be my sponsors and that a female would appear on such a day at such an hour at lambeth church to act as my godmother that i was to be christened ralph rattlin and if i survived i was to pass for their own child till further orders and ralph rattlin brandon were to be my usual appellations two decent persons being required joe brandon not having done any work for a couple of months thought by virtue of idleness he might surely call himself one to say nothing of his topboots the other godfather was a decayed fishmonger of the name of ford a pensioner in the fishmongers company in whose almshouses at newington he afterwards died a sad reprobate was old fordhe was wicked from nature drunken from habit and full of repentance from methodism thus his time was very equally divided between sin drink and contrition his sleep was all sin for he would keep the house awake all night blaspheming in his unhealthy slumbers as i was taken to church in a hackneycoach my very honoured godfather ford remarked that it would be a very pleasant thing to get me into hell before him as he was sure that i was born to sin a child of wrath and an inheritor of the kingdom of the devil this bitter remark roused the passions even of my gentle nurse and she actually scored down both sides of his face with her nails in such a manner as to leave deep scars in his ugliness that nine years after he carried to his grave all this happened in the coach on our way to church ford had already prepared himself for the performance of his sponsorial duties by getting half drunk upon his favourite beverage gin and it was now necessary to make him wholly intoxicated to induce him to go through the ceremony as yet my nurse had never properly seen my mothers face at the interview on my birth the agitation of both parties and the darkened room though there was no attempt at concealment prevented mrs brandon from noticing her sufficiently to know her again when therefore as our party alighted at the gate of the churchyard and a lady deeply veiled got out of a carriage at some distance mrs brandon knew not if she had ever seen her before i have been unfortunate in religious ceremonies old ford was a horrid spectacle his face streaming with blood violently drunk and led by brandon who certainly was on that occasion both decent in appearance and behaviour the strange lady hurried up to the font before us when the clergyman saw the state in which ford was he refused to proceed in the ceremony the sexton then answered for him whilst the drunkard was led out of the church the office went on and the lady seemed studiously to avoid looking upon her intended godson i was christened simply ralph rattlin the lady wrote her name in the book the last and it was instantly removed by the clerk she thrust a guinea into his hand and then for the first time bent her veiled face over me i must have been a miserablelooking object for no sooner had she seen me than she gave a bitter shriek and laying hold of the woodwork of the pews she slowly assisted herself out of the church two or three persons who happened to be present as well as mr and mrs brandon stepped forward to support her but the clergyman who seemed to have had a previous conversation with her signed them to desist it was altogether a most melancholy affair old ford when we left the church was helped into the coach again joe brandon being either justly irritated at his conduct or angry that he could not see my unknown godmothers face when we were all fairly on our way home gave the old sot such a tremendous beating that mrs brandon nearly went into fits with alarm and ford himself was confined to his bed for a week after when i reflect upon the manner in which i was christened though i cannot exactly call it a maimed rite i have a great mind to have it done over again only i am deterred by the expense all now was bustle in removing from felix street lambeth to bath where it was ordered that i should be dipped every morning in some spring that at that time had much celebrity old ford was left behind at bath i remained three years joe brandon doing no work and persuading himself now that he actually was a gentleman in my third year my fostersister little robust ruddy mary died and the weakly stunted and drooping sapling lived on this death endeared me more and more to my nurse and joe himself was by selfinterest taught an affection for me he knew that if i went to the grave he must go to work and he now used himself to perform the office of drynurse to me taking me to the spring and allowing no one to dip me but himself when i grew older he had many stories to tell me about my pantings and my implorings and my offers of unnumbered kisses and of all my playthings if he would not put me in that cold wateronly this one one morning and about a certain dr buck who had taken a wonderful liking to me after the manner of the lambeth surgeon and had prescribed for me and sent me physic and port wine all out of pure philanthropy and how much i hated this same dr buck and his horrible give him tother dip brandon but all these are as things that had long died from my own recollection chapter four my proximity to the clergy impels me to preachi advocate the vulgar and prove that neither the humble nor the low are necessarily the debasedconsequently this chapter need not be read what with dipping port wine bark and dr buck at the age of four years my limbs began to expand properly and my countenance to assume the hue of health i have recorded the death of my fostersister mary but about this time the topsawyer wishing to perpetuate the dynasty of the brandons began to enact pater familias in a most reckless manner he was wrong but this must be said in extenuation of his impiously acting upon the divine command to increase and multiply that at that time mr malthus had not corrected the mistake of the omniscient nor had miss harriet martineau begun her pilgrimage after the preventive check there was no longer any pretence for my remaining at bath or for my worthy fosterfather abstaining from work so we again removed with a small family in our search after sawpits and happiness to one of the best houses in felix street somewhere near lambeth marsh this place after the experience of some time proving not to be sufficiently blissful we removed to paradise row some furlongs nearer to the father in god his grace the archbishop of canterbury i have a laudable pride in showing that i had a respectablei beg pardon the word is inapplicablei mean a grand neighbour i am not the rose said the flower in the persian poem but i have lived near the rose i did not bloom in the archbishops garden but i flourished under the wall though on the outside the wall is now down and rows of houses up in its place in our location in paradise row the house being larger than we required for our accommodation we again received old ford the only paradise i am rather afraid that will ever own him as an inmate an awful man was old ford my godfather his mingled prayers and blasphemies hymns and horrid songs defiance and remorse groans and laughter made everyone hate and avoid him hellfire as he continually asserted was ever roaring before his eyes and as there is a text in the new testament that says there is no salvation for him who curses the holy ghost he would in the frenzy of his despair swear at that mysterious portion of the trinity by the hour and then employ the next in beating his breast in the agony of repentance many may think all this sheer madness but he was not more mad than most of the hotheaded methodists whose preachers at that time held uncontrolled sway over the great mass of people that toiled in the humbler walks of life two nights in the week we used to have prayermeetings at our house and though i could not have been five years old at the time vividly do i remember that our front room used on those occasions to be filled to overflow with kneeling fanatics old ford in the centre of the room and a couple of lankhaired hypocrites one on each side of the reprobate praying till the perspiration streamed down their foreheads to pray the devil out of him the ohs and the groanings of the audience were terrible and the whole scene though very edifying to the elect was disgraceful to any sect who lived within the pale of civilisation i must now draw upon my own memory i must describe my own sensations if i reckon by the toil and turmoil of the mind i am already an old man i have lived for ages i am far very far on my voyage let me cast my eyes back on the vast sea that i have traversed there is a mist settled over it almost as impenetrable as that which glooms before me let me pause methinks that i see it gradually break and partial sunbeams struggle through it now the distant waves rise and wanton and play pure and lucid tis the dayspring of innocency how near to the sanctified heavens do those remote waves appear they meet and are as one with the far horizon those sparkling waves were the hours of my childhoodthe blissful feelings of my infancy as the sea of life rolls on the waves swell and are turbid and as i recede from the horizon of my early recollections so heaven recedes from me the thundercloud is high above my head the treacherous waters roar beneath me before me is the darkness and the night of an unknown futurity where can i now turn my eyes for solace but over the vast space that i have passed whilst my bark glides heedlessly forward i will not anticipate dangers that i cannot see or tremble at rocks that are benevolently hidden from my view it is sufficient for me to know that i must be wrecked at last that my mortal frame must be like a shattered bark upon the beach ere the purer elements that it contains can be wafted through the immensity of immortality i will commune with my boyish daysi will live in the past only memory shall perform the medean process shall renovate me to youth i will again return to marbles and an untroubled breastto hoop and high spiritsat least in imagination i shall henceforward trust to my own recollections should this part of my story seem more like a chronicle of sensations than a series of events the reader must bear in mind that these sensations are in early youth real events the parents of actions and the directors of destiny the circle in which in boyhood one may be compelled to move may be esteemed low the accidents all round him may be homely the persons with whom he may be obliged to come in contact may be mean in apparel and sordid in nature but his mind if it remain to him pure as he received it from his maker is an unsullied gem of inestimable price too seldom found and too little appreciated when found among the great or the fortuitously rich nothing that is abstractedly mental is low the mind that well describes low scenery is not low nor is the description itself necessarily so pride and contempt for our fellowcreatures evince a low tone of moral feeling and is the innate vulgarity of the soul it is this which but too often makes those who rustle in silks and roll in carriages lower than the lowest i have said this much because the early very early part of my life was passed among what are reproachfully termed low people if i describe them faithfully they must still appear low to those who arrogate to themselves the epithet of high for myself i hold that there is nothing low under the sun except meanness where there is utility there ought to be honour the utility of the humble artisan has never been denied though too often despised and too rarely honoured but i have found among the vulgar a horror of meanness a selfdevotion an unshrinking patience under privation and the moral courage that constitute the hero of high life i can also tell the admirers of the great that the evil passions of the vulgar are as gigantic their wickedness upon as grand a scale and their notions of vice as refined and as extensive as those of any fashionable roue that is courted among the first circles or even as those of the crowned despot then as to the strength of vulgar intellect true that intellect is rarely cultivated by the learning which consists of words the view it takes of science is but a partial glancethat intellect is contracted but it is strong it is a dwarf with the muscle and sinews of a giant and its grasp whenever it can lay hold of anything within its circumscribed reach is tremendous the general who has conquered armies and subjugated countriesthe minister who has ruined them and the jurist who has justified both never at the crisis of their labours have displayed a tithe of the ingenuity and the resources of mind that many an artisan is forced to exert to provide daily bread for himself and family or many a shopkeeper to keep his connection together and himself out of the workhouse why should the exertions of intellect be termed low in the case of the mechanic and vast profound and glorious in that of the minister it is the same precious gift of a beneficent power to all his creatures as well may the sun be voted as excessively vulgar because it like intellect assists all equally to perform their functions i repeat that nothing that has mind is of necessity low and nothing is vulgar but meanness chapter five i receive my first lessons in pugnacityand imbibe the evil spirit learn to read by intuition and to fight by practicego to school to a soldieram a good boy and get whipped at six years of age my health had become firmly established but this establishment caused dismay in that of joe brandon as i was no longer the sickly infant that called for incessant attention and the most careful nurture it was intimated to my fosterparents that a considerable reduction would be made in the quarterly allowance paid on my account the indignation of brandon was excessive he looked upon himself as one grievously wronged no sinecurist with his pension recently reduced could have been more vehement on the subject of the sanctity of vested rights but his ire was not to be vented in idle declamation only he was not a man to rest content with mere words he declaimed for a full hour upon his wifes folly in procuring him the means of wellfed idleness so long threatened to take the bratmeaning no less a personage than myselfto the workhouse and then wound up affairs indoors by beating his wife and himself out of doors by getting royally drunk this was the first scene that made a deep impression on me young as i was i comprehended that i was the cause of the illtreatment of my nurse whom i fondly loved i interferedi placed my little body between her and her brutal oppressor i scratched i kicked i screamedi grew mad with passion at that hour the spirit of evil and of hate blew the dark coal in my heart into a flame and the demon of violent anger has ever since found it too easy to erect there his altar of which the fire though at the time allconsuming is never durable from that moment i commenced my intellectual existence i looked on the sobbing mother and knew what it was to love and my love found its expression in an agony of tears i looked on the tyrant i felt what it was to hate and endeavoured to relieve the burning desire to punish with frantic actions and wild outcries old ford who had been present and enjoyed the fracas immediately took me into his especial favour he declared that i was after his own heart for i had the devil in me said that i had the right spirit to bring me to the gallows and he hoped old as he was to live to see it he then entreated of the lord that my precious soul might be saved as a burning brand out of the firetook me by the hand and led me to the next ginshopmade me taste the nauseating poisontold me i was a little man and it was glorious to fightdoubled up for me my puny fists and asserted that cowards only suffered a blow without returning it a lesson like this never can be forgotten i ground my teeth whilst i was receiving iti clenched my hands and looked wildly round for something to destroy i was in training to become a little tiger from what i then experienced i can easily conceive the feelings that actuate and can half forgive the crowned monsters who have revelled in blood and relished the inflicting of torture as pandering to their worst passions in infancy resolves them into a terrible instrument of cruelty the control of which rests not with themselves but this lesson in tiger ferocity had its emollient though not its antidote in the tenderness of the love which i bore to my nurse when on my return i flung myself into her arms ever since that day i have been subject to terrific fits of passion but very happily for me they have long ceased to be but of very rare occurrence the next morning master joseph came home ill and if not humbled at least almost helpless he had now three children of his own and the necessity of eschewing skittles and presiding over the sawpit became urgent with all his vices and his roughness he was surprisingly fond of me he too applauded my spirit in attacking himself he now rejoiced to take me to the sawpit to allow me to play about the timberyards and share with him his alfresco midday meal and pot of porter i always passed for his eldest son my name being told to the neighbours as ralph rattlin brandon i knew no otherwise and my fosterparents kept the secret religiously at seven i began to fight with dirty little urchins in the street who felt much scandalised at the goodness of my clothes it is hard work fighting uphill at seven years of age old ford would wipe the blood from my nose and clap the vinegar and brown paper on my bruises with words of sweet encouragement though he always ended by predicting that his hopeful godson would be hung and that he should live to see it i have certainly not been drowned yet though i have had my escapes and old ford has been dead these thirty years as one part of the prophecy will certainly never be fulfilled i have some faint hopes of avoiding the exaltation hinted at in the other about this time i began to notice that a lady at long intervals came to see me she seemed exceedingly happy in my caresses though she showed no weakness she passed for my godmother and so she certainly was she was minute in her examination in ascertaining that i was perfectly clean and always brought me a number of delicacies which were invariably devoured immediately after her departure by me and those little cormorants my loving fosterbrothers and sister moreover my nurse always received a present which she very carefully and dutifully concealed from her liege lord of the pits however i cannot call to my mind more than four of these angelic visits altogether angelic visits indeed they might be termed if the transcendent beauty of the visitor be regarded at that time her form and her countenance furnished me with the idea i had of the blessed inhabitants of heaven before man was created and i have never been able to replace it since by anything more beautiful the reader shall soon know how at that very early age i became so well acquainted with angelic lore when eight years old i was sent to school i could read before i went there how i picked up this knowledge i never could discover both my fosterparents were grossly illiterate perhaps old ford taught mebut this is one of the mysteries i could never solve and it is strange that i should have so totally forgotten all about an affair so important as not to remember a single lesson and yet to hold so clear a recollection of many minor events but so it is to school i went my master was a cadaverous woodenlegged man a disbanded soldier and a disciplinarian as well as an abcdarian i well remember old isaacs and his tall handsome cranenecked daughter the hussy was as straight as an arrow yet for the sake of coquetry or singularity she would sit in the methodist chapel with her dimpled chin resting upon an iron hoop and her finely formed shoulders braced back with straps so tightly as to thrust out in a remarkable manner her swanlike chest and her almost too exuberant bust this instrument for the distorted with its bright crimson leather thus pressed into the service of the beautiful had a most singular and exciting effect upon the beholder i have often thought of this girl in my maturer years and confess that no dress that i ever beheld gave a more piquant interest to the wearer than those straps and irons the jade never wore them at home perhaps the fancy was her fathers he being an old soldier and his motto eyes right dress whosever fancy it was his daughter rejoiced in it eyes right dress is as good a motto for the ladies as for the armyand well do they act up to it the most important facts that my mind has preserved concerning this scholastic establishment arethat one evening for a task i learned perfectly by heart the two first chapters of the gospel according to saint john that there was an unbaked gooseberry pie put prominently on the shelf in the schoolroom a fortnight before the vacation at midsummer to be partaken of on the happy day of breakingup each boy paying fourpence for his share of the mighty feast there were between forty and fifty of us i had almost forgotten to mention that i was to be duly punished whenever i deserved it but the master was on no account to hurt me or make me cry i deserved it regularly three or four times a day and was as regularly horsed once oh those floggings how deceptive they were and how much i regretted them when i came to understand the thing fundamentally old isaacs could not have performed the operation more delicately if he were only brushing a fly off the down of a ladys cheek he never made me cry chapter six this chapter showeth in a methodical manner how to find a faith and lose a religion also to procure a call for persons of all manner of callings i had as i have related been encouraged in fits of passion and had been taught to be pugnacious my mind was now to be opened to loftier speculations and religious dread with all the phantoms of superstition in its train came like a band of bravoes and first chaining down my soul in the awe of stupefaction ultimately loosened its bonds and sent it to wander in all its childish wildness in the direful realms of horrible dreams and of waking visions hardly less so i was fashioning for a poet my nurse was always a little devotional she went to the nearest chapel or church and satisfied that she heard the word of god without troubling herself with the niceties of any peculiar dogma which she could not have understood if she had and finding herself on the threshold of divine grace she knelt down in all humility prayed and was comforted old ford was a furious methodist he owned that he never could reform and as he daily drained the cup of sin to the very dregs he tried as an antidote long prayer and superabounding faith the unction with which he struck his breast and exclaimed miserable sinner that i am could only be exceeded by the veracity of the assertion mrs brandon only joined in the prayermeetings that he held at our house when ford himself was perfectly soberthus she did not often attendbrandon never whilst he wore the topboots he was an optimist and perfectly epicurean in his philosophyi use the term in the modern sense when he had eighty pounds odd a year with no family of his own no man was more jovial or happy he had the most perfect reliance on providence he boasted that he belonged to the established church because it was so respectableand he loved the organ however he never went in the forenoon because he was never shaved in time in the afternoon he never went because he could not dispense with his nap after dinner and in the evening none but the serving classes were to be seen there he ridiculed the humble piety of his wife and the fanatical fervour of his lodger he was a high churchman and satisfied but when he was obliged with an increasing family and a decreased income to work from morning till night he grew morose and very unsettled in his faith the french revolution was then at its wildest excess equality was universally advocated in religious as well as political establishments the excitement of the times reached even to the sawpit brandon got tipsy one saturday night with a parcel of demagogues and when he awoke early next sunday morningit was a beautiful summer dayhe made the sudden discovery that he had still his faith to seek for then began his dominical pilgrimages with his son ralph in his hand he roved from one congregation to another over the vast metropolis and through its extensive environs i do not think that we left a single place dedicated to devotion unvisited i well remember that he was much struck with the roman catholic worship we repeated our visits three or four times to the catholic chapel a deference we paid to no other the result of this may be easily imagined when an excited mind searches for food it will be satisfied with the veriest trash provided only that it intoxicates we at length stumbled upon a small set of mad methodists more dismal and more excluding than even fords sect the congregation were all of the very lowest class with about twelve or thirteen exceptions and those were decidedly mad the pastor was an arch rogue that fattened upon the delusion of his communicants they held the doctrine of visible election which election was made by having a call that is a direct visitation of the holy ghost which was testified by falling down in a fitthe testification being the more authentic if it happened in full congregation the elected could never again fall the sins that were afterwards committed in their persons were not theirsit was the evil spirit within them that they could cast out when they would and be equally as pure as before all the rest of the world who had not had their call were in a state of reprobation and on the highroad to damnation all this of course i did not understand till long afterwards but i too unhappily understood or at least fancied i did the dreadful images of eternal torments and the certainty that they would soon be mine first of all either from inattention or from want of comprehension these denunciations made but a faint impression upon me but the frightful descriptions took gradually a more visible and sterner shape till they produced effects that proved all but fatal the doctrines of these caterians just suited the intellect and the strong passions of brandon the sect was called caterians after the reverend mr cate their minister my fosterfather went home after the second sunday and put his house in order as far as regarded the household the regulations would have pleased sir andrew agnew the hot joint was dismissedthe country walk discontinuedat meeting four times a day even ford did not like it brandon was labouring hard for his call he strove vehemently for the privilege of sinning with impunity he was told by mr cate that he was in a desperate way brandon did all he could but the call would not come for the calling mrs brandon got it very soon though she strenuously denied the honour my good nurse was in the familyway and mr cate had frightened her into fits with a vivid delineation of the agonies of a newborn infant under the torture of eternal fire because it had died unelected however brandon began a little to weary of waiting and long prayer and perhaps of the now too frequent visits of mr cate he commenced to have his fits of alternate intemperate recklessness and religious despondency one sunday morningwell do i recollect ithe called me up early before seven and i supposed as usual that we were going to early meeting we walked towards the large room that was used as a chapel we had nearly reached it when the halfopen door of an adjacent alehouse let out its vile compound of disgusting odours upon the balmy sabbath air my conductor hesitatedhe moved towards the meetinghouse but his head was turned the other wayhe stopped ralph said he did you not see mr ford go into the publichouse no father said i dont think hes up at all bounds we had better go and see for i must not allow him to shame a decent house by tippling on a sunday morning in a dramshop we entered he found there some of his mates pint after pint of purl was called for at length a gallon of strong ale was placed upon the table a quart of gin was dashed into it and the whole warmed with a redhot poker i was instructed to lie i promised to tell mother that we had gone into a strange chapel but i made my conditions that mother should not be any more beaten it was almost churchtime when the landlord put us all out by the back way the drunken fellows sneaked homewhilst brandon taking me by the hand made violent and nearly successful efforts to appear sober after a hasty breakfast we went to meeting my fosterfather looked excessively wild mr cate was raving in the midst of an extempore prayer when a heavy fall was heard in the chapel the minister descended from his desk and came and prayed over the prostrate victim of intoxication and perhaps of epilepsy and he pronounced that brother brandon had got his call and was now indisputably one of the elect he did not revive so soon as was expectedhis groans were looked upon as indications of the workings of the spirit and when at length he was so far recovered as to be led home by two of the congregation the conversion of the sawyer was dwelt upon by the preacher from a text preached upon the chapter that relates to the conversion of saul and the cases were cited as parallel let the opponents of the established church rail at it as they will scenes of such wickedness and impiety could never have happened within its timehonoured walls when we returned to dinner we found that brandon had so far recovered as to become very hungry very proud and very pharisaically pious mr cate dined with us he was full of holy congratulations on the miraculous event the sawyer received all this with a humble selfconsequence as the infallible dicta of truth and apparently with the utter oblivion of any such things existing as purl and redhot pokers was he a deep hypocrite or only a selfdeceiver who can know the heart of man however this call had the effect of making the called one a finished sinner and of filling up the measure of wretchedness to his wife chapter seven i too have my callto deaths doora great rise in lifebrandon allows neither slugs nor sluggards in his sawpitis ruined and beats the reverend mr cate all this was preparatory to an event to me of the utmost importance which is perhaps at this very moment influencing imperceptibly my mind and directing my character brandons call in our humble circle made a great deal of noise he had taken care that i should know what drunkenness meant i thought he ought to have been drunk on the afternoon of his election yet he so well disguised his intoxication that he appeared not to be so i listened attentively to the sermon of the preacher that followed i no longer doubted i could not believe that a grave man in a pulpit could speak anything but truth when he spoke so loudly and spoke for two hours my mind was a chaos of confusion i began to be very miserable the next or one or two sundays after produced the crisis my dress was always much superior to what could have been expected in the son of a mere operative i was at that time a fair and mildfeatured child and altogether remarkable among the set who frequented the meetinghouse mr cate had been very powerful indeed in his description of the infernal regionsof the abiding agoniesthe level lake that burneththe tossing of the waves that glow and when he had thrown two or three old women into hysterics and two or three young ones into faintingfits amidst the torrent of his oratory and the groaning and the lord have mercy upon mes of his audience he made a sudden pause there was a dead silence for half a minute then suddenly lifting his voice he pointed to me and exclaimed behold that beautiful childobserve the pure blood mantling in his delicate countenancebut what is he after all but a mouthful for the devil all those torments all those tortures that i have told you of will be his there look at him he will burn and writhe in pain and consume for ever and ever and ever and never be destroyed unless the original sin be washed out from him by the call unless he be made hereafter one of the elect at this direct address to myself i neither fainted shuddered nor criedi felt at the time a little stupefied and it was some hours after the hideous mans words all the time ringing in my ears before i fully comprehend my hopeless state of perdition i looked at the fire as i sat by it and trembled i went to bed but not to sleep no child ever haunted by a ghoststory was more terrified than myself as i lay panting on my tearsteeped pillow at length imagination began its dreadful charmsthe room enlarged itself in its gloom to vast spacei began to hear cries from under my bed some dark bodies first of all flitted across the gloaming my bed began to rock i tried to sing a hymn i thought that the words came out of my mouth in flames of bright fire i then called to mind the offerings from the altars of cain and abel i watched to see if my hymns turned into fire and ascended up to heaven i felt a cold horror when i discovered them scattered from my mouth exactly in the same manner that i had seen the flames in the engraving in our large bible on the altar of cain then there came a huge block of wood and stationed itself in the air above me about six inches from my eyes i remember no morei was in a raging fever i was ill for some weeks and a helpless invalid for many more when again i enjoyed perception of the things around me i found myself in a new house in red cross street near saint lukes my fosterparents had opened a shopit had the appearance of a most respectable fruiterers mr brandon had become a small timbermerchant had sawpits in the premises behind the house and men of his own actually sawing in them but the most surprising change of all was that the reverend mr cate was domesticated with us brandon as a master worked harder than ever he did as a man my nurse became anxious and careworn and never seemed happyfor my part i was so debilitated that i then took but little notice of anything however the beautiful lady never called i used to spend my time thinking upon angels and cherubs and in learning hymns by heart i suppose that i like my fosterfather had had my call but i am sure that after it i was as much weaker in mind as i was in body when i became strong enough to be again able to run about i was once more sent to a dayschool and all that i remember about the matter was that every day about eleven oclock i was told to run home and get a wigful of potatoes from brandons the venerable pedagogue coolly taking off his wig and exchanging it for a red nightcap until my return with the provender things now wore a dismal aspect at home at length one day the broker sent his men into the shop who threw all the greengrocery about like peelings of onions they carted away mr brandons deals and planks and timber and not content with all this they also took away the best of the household furniture my nurse called mr cate a devil in a white sheether husband acted as he always would do when he was offended and found himself strong enough he gave the reverend gentleman most irreverently a tremendous beating the sheep sadly gored the shepherd afterwards when he had nearly killed his pastor he seceded from his flock and gave him under his own hand a solemn abjuration of the caterian tenets how brandon came to launch out into this expensive and illadvised undertaking of greengroceries and sawpits how he afterwards became involved and how much the preacher had been guilty in deceiving him i never clearly understood however my nurse never for a long time after spoke of the reverend gentleman without applying the corner of her apron to her eyes or her husband without a hearty malediction we removed to our old neighbourhood but instead of taking a respectable house we were forced to burrow in mean lodgings chapter eight another migrationfrom the ruralities of cutthroat lane to the groves of academusi am forced into good clothes and the paths of learning in spite of my teeth though i use them spitefully misfortunes never come single i dont know why they should they are but scarecrow leanvisaged miserable associates and so they arrive in a body to keep each other in countenance i had been but a few weeks in our present miserable abode and had fully recovered my health though i think that i was a little crazed with the prints and the subjects of them over which i daily pored in the large bible when the greatest misfortune of all came upon the poor brandonsand that was to add to their other losses the loss of my invaluable self the misery was unexpectedit was suddenit was overwhelming brandon was toeing a chalked line on a heavy log of mahogany unconscious of the mischief that was working at home he afterwards told me and i believe him that he would have opposed the proceeding by force if force had been requisite a plain private or hired carriage drove up to the door and after ascertaining that the brandons lived at the house a businesslike looking elderly gentleman stepped out paid every demand immediately and ordered my best clothes on when i was thus equipped my nurse was told that she was perfectly welcome to the remainder of my effects and that i must get into the carriage the good woman was thunderstruck there was a scene she raved and i cried and the four little brandons at least three of them joined in the chorus of lamentation because the naughty man was going to take brother ralph away i had been too well taught by old ford not to visit my indignation upon the shins and hands of the carrier away of captives in wellapplied kicks and almost rabid bites there was a great disturbance the neighbours thought it very odd that the mother should allow her eldest son to be carried off by force by a stranger before her eyes in the middle of the day but then it was suggested that nothing could be well termed odd that concerned little ralph brandon for hadnt he been bit last year by a mad dog and when so and so had all died raving he had never nothing at all happen to him when the stranger heard this story of the mad dog which bytheby was fact and i have the scars to this day he shook me off pale with consternation and was no doubt extremely happy to find that my little teeth had not penetrated the skin i believe that he heartily repented him of his office at length he lost all patience woman said he send these people out of the room when they had departed marvelling he resumed i cannot lose my time in altercation i am commissioned to tell you that if you keep the boy in one sense youll have to keep him in all you may be sure that i would not trouble myself about such a little illbred wretch for a moment if i did not act with authority and by orders give up the child directly i was now sobbing in her arms take your last look at him for you will never see him again come hand the young gentleman into the carriage i wont go i screamed out we shall soon see that master rattlin said he dragging me along resisting i bawled out my names not master rattlinyoure a liar and when father comes from the pit hell wop you this threat seemed to have an effect the very reverse of what i had intended perhaps he thought that he had already enough to contend with without the addition of the brawny arm of the sawyer i was forcibly lifted up placed in the coach and as it drove rapidly away i heard amidst the rattling of the wheels the cries of her whom i loved as a mother exclaiming my ralphmy dear ralph behold me then hot with the fray and weeping from the fight confined in a locomotive prison with my sullen captor i blubbered in one corner of the coach and he surveyed me with stern indifference from the other i had now fairly commenced my journey through life but this beginning was anything but auspicious at length the carriage stopped at a place i have since ascertained to be near hatton garden on holborn hill we alighted and walked into a house between two motionless pages excessively well dressed at first they startled me but i soon discovered they were immense waxen dolls it was a readymade clothes warehouse into which we had entered we went upstairs and i was soon equipped with three excellent suits my grief had now settled down into a sullen resentment agreeably relieved at due intervals by breathcatching sobs the violence of the storm had passed but its gloom still remained seeing the little gladness that the possession of clothes the finest i had yet had communicated to me my director could not avoid giving himself the pleasurable relief of saying sulky little brute a trunk being sent for and my wardrobe placed in it we then drove to three or four other shops not forgetting a hatters and in a very short space of time i had a very tolerable fitout during all this time not a word did my silent companion address to me at length the coach no longer rattled over the stones it now proceeded on more smoothly and here and there the cheerful green foliage relieved the long lines of houses after about a halfhours ride we stopped at a large and very oldfashioned house built in strict conformity with the elizabethan style of architecture over the portals of which upon a deep blue board in very very bright gold letters flashed forth that word so awful to little boys so big with associations of long tasks and widespreading birch the greekderived polysyllable academy ignorant as i was i understood it all in a moment i was struck cold as the dewdamp gravestone i almost grew sick with terror i was kidnapped entrapped betrayed i had before hated school my horror now was intense of academy i looked piteously into the face of my persecutor but i found there no sympathy i want to go home i roared out and then burst into a fresh torrent of tears home what solace is there in its very sound oh how that blessed asylum for the wounded spirit encloses within its sacred circle all that is comforting and sweet and holy tis there that the soul coils itself up and nestles like the dove in its own downiness conscious that everything around breathes of peace security and love home henceforward i was to have none until through many many years of toil and misery i should create one for myself henceforth the word must bring to me only the bitterness of regrethenceforth i was to associate with hundreds who had that temple in which to consecrate their household affectionsbut was myself doomed to be unowned unloved and homeless i want to go home i blubbered forth with the pertinacity of anguish as i was constrained into the parlour of the truculent rodbearing ferulawielding mr root i must have been a strange figure i was taken from my nurses in a hurry and though my clothes were quite new my face entitled me to rank among the much vituperated unwashed when a little boy has very dirty hands with which he rubs his dirty tearful face it must be confessed that grief does not in his person appear under a very lovely form the first impression that i made on him who was to hold almost everything that could constitute my happiness in his power was the very reverse of favourable my continued iteration of i want to go home was anything but pleasing to the pedagogue the sentence itself is not music to a man keeping a boardingschool with the intuitive perception of childhood through my tears my heart acknowledged an enemy what my conductor said to him did not tend to soften his feelings towards me i did not understand the details of his communication but i knew that i was as a captive bound hand and foot and delivered over to a foreign bondage the interview between the contracting parties was short and when over my conductor departed without deigning to bestow the smallest notice upon the most important personage of this history i was then rather twitched by the hand than led by mr root into the middle of his capacious schoolroom and in the midst of more than two hundred and fifty boys my name was merely mentioned to one of the junior ushers and the master left me well might i then apply that blundering examinerbepraised line of keats to myself for like ruth i stood all tears among the alien corn a few boys came and stared at me but i attracted the kindness of none there can be no doubt but that i was somewhat vulgar in my manners and my carriage was certainly quite unlike that of my companions some of them even jeered me but i regarded them not a real grief is armourproof against ridicule in a short time it being six oclock the supper was served out consisting of a round of bread all the moisture of which had been allowed to evaporate and an oblong diaphanous yellow substance one inch and a half by three that i afterwards learned might be known among the initiated as single gloucester there was also a pewter mug for each threeparts filled with small beer it certainly gave me it was so small a very desponding idea of the extent to which littleness might be carried and it would have been too vapid for the toleration of any palate had it not been so sour as i sat regardless before this repast in abstracted grief i underwent the first of the thousand practical jokes that were hereafter to familiarise me with manual jocularity my righthand neighbour jerking me by the elbow exclaimed hollo you sir theres jenkins on the other side of you cribbing your bread i turned towards the supposed culprit and discovered that my informant had fibbed but the informed against told me to look round and see where my cheese was i did it was between the mandibles of my kind neighbour on my right and when i turned again to the left for an explanation the rogue there had stripped my round of bread of all the crust i cared not then for this double robbery but having put the liquid before me incautiously to my lips sorrowful as i was i cared for that joe brandon never served me so i drank that evening as little as i ate chapter nine i prove to be not one in a thousand but one in a quarter of that number to whom no quarter was shownin spite of my entreaties i am evil entreated and am not only placed on the lowest form but made excessively uncomfortable on my seat of honour heroes statesmen philosophers must bend to circumstances and so must little boys at boardingschool i went to bed with the rest and like the rest had my bedfellow miserable and weary was that night to my infant heart when i found i could do so unobserved i buried my face in the pillow and wept with a perfect passion of wretchedness i had a hard a cruel life at that school when i lived with my nurse the boys in the street used to beat me because i was too much of the gentleman and now the young gentlemen thrashed me for not coming up to their standard of gentility i saw a tyrant in every urchin that was stronger than myself and a derider in him that was weaker the next morning after my arrival a fellow a little bigger than myself came up and standing before me gave me very deliberately as hard a slap in the face as his strength would permit half crying with the pain and yet not wishing to be thought quarrelsome i asked with goodnatured humility whether that was done in jest or in earnest the little insolent replied in his schoolboy wit betwixt and between i couldnt stand that my passion and my fist rose together and hitting my oppressor midway between the eyes theres my betwixt and between said i his nose began to bleed and when i went down into the schoolroom the new boy had his hands well warmed with the ruler for fighting alas the first year of my academic life was one of unqualified wretchedness for the two or three initiatory months uncouth in speech and vulgar in mien with no gilded toy rich plumcake or mintnew shilling to conciliate i was despised and ridiculed and when it was ascertained by my own confession that i was the son of a daylabourer i was shunned by the aristocratic progeny of butchers linendrapers and hatters it took at least a halfdozen floggings to cure me of the belief that joseph brandon and his wife were my parents it was the shortest road to conviction and mr root prided himself upon short cuts in imparting knowledge i assure my readers they were severe ones mr root the pedagogue of this immense school which was situated in the vicinity of islington was a very stout and very handsome man of about thirty he had formerly been a subordinate where he now commanded and his good looks had gained him the hand of the widow of his predecessor he was very florid with a cold dark eye but his face was the most physical that i ever beheld from the white low forehead to the wellformed chin there was nothing on which the gazer could rest that spoke of intellectuality there was speculation in his eye but it was the calculation of farthings there was a pure ruddiness in his cheek but it was the glow of matter not that of mind his mouth was well formed yet pursed up with an expression of mingled vanity and severity he was very robust and his arm exceedingly powerful with all these personal advantages he had a shrill girlish voice that made him in the execution of his cruelties actually hideous i believe and i make the assertion in all honesty that he received a sensual enjoyment by the act of inflicting punishment he attended to no department of the school but the flagellative he walked in about twelve oclock had all on the list placed on a form his manservant was called in the lads horsed and he in general found ample amusement till one he used to make it his boast that he never allowed any of his ushers to punish the hypocrite the epicure he reserved all that luxury for himself add to this that he was very ignorant out of the tutors assistant and that he wrote a most abominably good hand that usual sign of a poor and trifleoccupied mind and now you have a very fair picture of mr root i have said that he was a most cruel tyrant yet nero himself ought not to be blackened and i must say this for my masters humanity that i had been at school two days before i was flogged and then it was for the enormity of not knowing my own name rattlin said the pedagogue no reply master rattlin in a shriller tone answer there was none master ralph rattlin many started but ralph brandon thought it concerned not him but it did indeed i believe that i had been told my new name but i had forgotten it in my grief and now in grief and in pain i was again taught it when for the first time in reality i tasted that acid and bitter fruit of the tree of knowledge old isaacs my soldier schoolmaster mock brushings were remembered with heartfelt regret at that time the road to learning was strewed neither with flowers nor palmleaves but with the instigating birch the schoolmaster had not yet gone abroad but he flogged most diligently at home and verily i partook amply of that diligence i was flogged full and i was flogged fasting when i deserved it and when i did not i was flogged for speaking too loudly and for not speaking loud enough and for holding my tongue moreover one morning i rode the horse without the saddle because my face was dirty and the next because i pestered the maidservant to wash it clean i was flogged because my shoes were dirty and again because i attempted to wipe them clean with my pockethandkerchief i was flogged for playing and for staying in the schoolroom and not going out to play the bigger boys used to beat me and i was then flogged for fighting it is hard to say for what i was not flogged things the most contradictory all tended to one end and that was my own at length he flogged me into serious illhealth and then he stayed his hand and i found relief on a bed of sickness even now i look back to those days of persecution with horror those were the times of large schools rods steeped in brine actual fact intestine insurrections the bumping of obnoxious ushers and the barring out of tyrannical masters a school of this description was a complete place of torment for the orphan the unfriended and the deserted lads then stayed at school till they were eighteen and even twenty and fagging flourished in all its atrocious oppression chapter ten i grow egotistical and being pleased with myself give good advicea visit and a strange jumble of tirades tears tutors tenderness and a teakettle let me now describe the child of nine years and a half old that was forced to undergo this terrible ordeal we will suppose that by the aid of the dancingmaster and the drillsergeant i have been cured of my vulgar gait and that my cockney accent has disappeared children of the age abovementioned soon assimilate their tone and conversation with those around them i was tall for my years with a very light and active frame and a countenance the complexion of which was of the most unstained fairness my hair light glossy and naturally but not universally curling to make it appear in ringlets all over my head would have been the effect of art yet without art it was wavy and at the temples forehead and the back of the head always in full circlets my face presented a perfect oval and my features were classically regular i had a good natural colour the intensity of which ebbed and flowed with every passing emotion i was one of those dangerous subjects whom anger always makes pale my eyes were decidedly blue everything else that may be said to the contrary notwithstanding the whole expression of my countenance was very feminine but not soft it was always the seat of some sentiment or passion and in its womanly refinement gave to me an appearance of constitutional delicacy and effeminacy that i certainly did not possess i was decidedly a very beautiful child and a child that seemed formed to kindle and return a mothers love yet the maternal caress never blessed me but i was abandoned to the tender mercies of a number of hebeings by many of whom my vivacity was checked my spirit humbled and my flesh cruelly lacerated i dwell thus particularly on my schoolday life in order in the first place to prepare the reader for the singular events that follow and in the second and which forms by far the most important consideration as i trust i am believed and if truth deserves credence believed i am to caution parents from trusting to the specious representations of any schoolmaster to induce them to examine carefully and patiently into every detail of the establishment or they may become a party to a series of cruelties that may break the spirit and perhaps shorten the life of their children unfortunately the most promising minds are those that soonest yield to the effect of harsh discipline the phlegmatic the dull and the commonplace vegetate easily through this state of probation the blight that will destroy the rose passes ever harmlessly over the tough and earthembracing weed i stayed at mr roots school for very nearly three years and i shall divide that memorable period into three distinct epochsthe desponding the devotional and the mendacious after i had been flogged into uncertain health i was confined for at least six weeks to my room and when i was convalescent it was hinted by the surgeon in not unintelligible terms to mr root that if i did not experience the gentlest treatment i might lose my life which would have been very immaterial to mr root had it not been a mathematical certainty that he would lose a good scholar at the same time bytheby the meaning that a schoolmaster attaches to the words good scholar is one for whom he is paid well thus i was emphatically a good scholar no doubt his very best i was taught everythingat least his bill said so he provided everything for me and i stayed with him during the holidays he therefore ceased to confer upon me his cruel attentions and abandoned me to a neglect hardly less cruel the boys were strictly enjoined to leave me alone and they obeyed i found a solitude in the midst of society a loneliness came over my young spirit i was aweary and i drooped like the tired bird that alights on the ship far far at sea as that poor bird folds its wings and sinks into peaceful oblivion i could have folded my arms and have lain down to die with pleasure my heart exhausted itself with an intense longing for a companion to love it wasted away all its substance in flinging out fibres to catch hold of that with which it might beat in unison as turn the tendrils of the vine hither and thither to clasp something to adorn and to repay support by beauty so i wore out my young energies in a fruitless search for sympathy i had nothing to love me though i would have loved many if i had dared there were many sweet faces among my schoolfellows to which i turned with a longing look and a tearful eye how menial i have been to procure a notice a glance of kindness i had nothing to give wherewith to bribe affection but services and labour and those were either refused or perhaps accepted with scorn i was the only pariah among two hundred and fifty there was a mystery and an obloquy attached to me and the master had by his interdiction completely put me without the pale of society i now said my lessons to the ushers with indifferenceif i acquitted myself ill i was unpunishedif well unnoticed my spirits began to give way fast and i was beginning to feel the pernicious patronage of the servants they would call me off the playground on which i moped send me on some message or employ me in some light service all this was winked at by the master and as for the mistress she never let me know that it occurred to her that i was in existence it was evident that mr root had no objection to all this for in consideration of the money paid to him for my education he was graciously pleased to permit me to fill the office of his kitchenboy but before i became utterly degraded into the menial of the menials a fortunate occurrence happened that put an end to my culinary servitude to the utter surprise of mr and mrs root who expected nothing of the kind a lady came to see me what passed between the parties before i was ushered into the parlour appropriated to visitors i know not it was some time before i was brought in as preparatory ablutions were made and my clothes changed when i entered i found that it was the lady i remember that she was very superbly dressed and i thought too the most beautiful apparition that i had ever beheld the scene that took place was a little singular and i shall relate it at full as i have rigidly adhered to truth i have been compelled to state what i have to say in a form almost entirely narrative and have not imitated those great historians who put long speeches into the mouths of their kings and generals very much suited to the occasions undoubtedly and deficient only in one pointthat is accuracy i have told only of facts and impressions and not given speeches that it would have been impossible for me to have remembered yet in this interview there was something so striking to my young imagination that my memory preserved many sentences and all the substance of what took place there was wine and cake upon the table and the lady looked a little flustered mr root was trying with a forty chesterfieldean power to look amiable mrs root was very fidgety as i appeared at the door timorously the lady said to me without rising but extending her delicate white hand come here to me ralph do you not know me i could get no further than the middle of the room where i stood still and burst out into a passion of tears those sweet tones of tenderness the first i had heard for nine months thrilled like fire through my whole frame it was a feeling so intense that had it not been agony it would have been bliss good god said she deeply agitated my poor boy why do you cry becausebecause you are so kind said i rushing forward to her extended arms and falling on my knees at her feet i buried my face in her lap and felt all happiness amidst my sobbings she bent over me and her tears trickled upon my neck this did not last long she placed me upon my feet and drawing me to her side kissed my cheeks and my eyes and my forehead her countenance soon became serene and turning to my master she said quietly this sir is very singular yes maam master rattlin is very singular all clever boys are he knows already his five declensions and the four conjugations active and passive come master rattlin decline for the lady the adjective felixcome begin nominative hic et haec et hoc felix i dont know anything about it said i doggedly i told you he was a singular child resumed the pedagogue with a most awkward attempt at a smile the singularity to which i allude said the lady is his finding kindness so singular kind bless you my dear madam said they both together you cant conceive how much we love the little dear it was but yesterday said mrs root that i was telling the lady of mr alderman jenkinswe have the five jenkinses maamthat master rattlin was the sweetest genteelist and beautifullest boy in the whole school it was but yesterday said mr root that i was saying to doctor duncan our respected rector madam that master rattlin had evinced such an uncommon talent that we might byandby expect the greatest things from him not yet ten months with me madam already in phaedrusthe rule of threeand his french master gives the best account of him he certainly has not begun to speak it yet though he has made a vast progress in the french language but it is monsieur le gross system to make his pupils thoroughly master of the language before they attempt to converse in it and his dancing my dear madam oh it would do your heart good to see him dance such grace such elasticity and such happiness in his manner a pauseand then they exclaimed together with a longdrawn sentimental sigh and we both love him so i am glad to hear so good an account of him said the lady i hope ralph that you love mr and mrs root for they seem very kind to you no i dont mr and mrs root lifted their hands imploringly to heaven not love me they both exclaimed together with a tone of heartfelt surprise and wounded sensibility that would have gone far to have made the fortune of a sentimental actor come here sir directly said mr root look me full in the face sir you are a singular boy yet i did think you loved me dont be frightened ralph i would not give you pain on any account and you know i never did now tell me my dear boy gradually softening from the terrible to the tender tell me my dear boy why you fancy you do not love me you see madam that i encourage sincerityand like at all times the truth to be spoken out why dont you love me ralph dear pinching my ear with a spiteful violence that was meant for gracious playfulness in the eyes of the lady and an intelligible hint for myself i was silent come ralph speak your mind freely no one will do you any harm for it i am sure why dont you love mr root said the lady i was ashamed to speak of my floggings and i looked upon his late abandonment and negligence as kindness i knew not what to say yet i knew i hated him most cordially i stammered and at last i brought out this unfortunate sentence because he has got such an ugly nasty voice mr and mrs root burst out into a long and for the time apparently uncontrollable laughter when it had somewhat subsided the schoolmaster exclaimed there madam didnt i tell you he was a singular lad come here you little wag i must give you a kiss for your drollery and the monster hauled me to him and when his face was close to mine i saw a wolfish glare in his eyes that made me fear that he was going to bite my nose off the lady did not at all participate in the joviality and as it is difficult to keep up mirth entirely upon ones own resources we were beginning to be a gloomy party what i had unconsciously said regarding my masters voice was wormwood to him he had long been the butt of all his acquaintance respecting it and what followed was the making that unbearable which was before too bitter many questions were put by the visitor and the answers appeared to grow more and more unsatisfactory as they were elicited the lady was beginning to look unhappy when a sudden brightness came over her lovely countenance and with the most polished and kindly tone she asked to see mr roots own children mr root looked silly and mrs root distressed the vapid and wornout joke that their family was so large that it boasted of the number of two hundred and fifty fell spiritless to the ground and disappointment and even a slight shade of despondence came over the ladys features where were you ralph when i came said she i waited for you long i was being washed and putting on my second best but why washed at this time of dayand why put on your second best because i had dirtied my hands and my other clothes carrying up the teakettle to mr matthewss room mr and mrs root again held up their hands in astonishment and who is mr matthews continued the lady second latin master and ill abed in the garret from whence did you take the teakettle from the kitchen and who gave it you molly one of the maids at this disclosure mr root fell into the greatest of all possible rages and as we like a figure of speech called a climax we must say that mrs root fell into a much greater they would turn the hussey out of the house that instant they would do that they would do this and they would do the other at length the lady with calm severity requested them to do nothing at all there has been said she some mistake here there is nothing very wrong or disgraceful in ralph attending to the wants of his sick master though he does lie in the garret i would rather see in his disposition a sympathy for suffering encouraged god knows there is in this world too much of the latter and too little of the former yet i certainly think that there could have been a less degrading method pointed out to him of showing attention but we will let this pass as i know it will never happen again you see mr and mrs root that this poor child is rather delicate in appearance he is much grown certainly much more than i expected or wishedbut he seems both shy and dejected i was in hopes that you had been yourselves blessed with a family a mother can trust to a mother though you are not parents you have known a parents love i have no doubt that you are fond of childrenvery both in a breathfrom the profession you have chosen i am the godmother of this boy alas i am afraid no nearer relation will ever appear to claim him he has no mother mrs root without you will be to him as one and i conjure you sir to let the fatherless find in the preceptor a father let him only meet for a year or two with kindness and i will cheerfully trust to providence for the rest though i detest the quackery of getting up a scene i wish to be as impressive as i can as i am sorry to say more than a year will unavoidably pass before i can see this poor youth again let me at that time i conjure you see him in health and cheerfulness will you permit me now to say farewell as i wish to say a few words of adieu to my godson and should i cry over him for his mothers sake you know that a lady does not like to be seen with red eyes the delicacy of this sickly attempt at pleasantry was quite lost upon the scholastic pair they understood her literally and mrs root began my eyewater however leave was taken and i was left with the lady she took me on her lap and a hearty hug we had together she then rang for molly she spoke to the girl kindly asked no questions of her that might lead her to betray her employers but giving her half a guinea not to lose sight of me in the multitude and to prove her gratitude never to suffer me again to enter the kitchen she promised to double the gratuity when she again saw me if she attended to her request the girl evidently affected as much by her manner as her gift curtseyed and withdrew while she remained at the school she complied with my godmothers request most punctually chapter eleven containeth a lecture on love from a personification of lovelinessand showeth that superstition has its sweets as well as its horrorsand also how to avoid the infection of the evil eye when we were alone she examined me carefully to ascertain if i were perfectly clean it would have perhaps been for me a happy circumstance if mr root had flogged me this day or even a fortnight previously the marks that he left were not very ephemeral i dont know whether a flogging a month old would not equally well have served my purpose he certainly wrote a strong bold hand in red ink not easily obliterated however as he had not noticed me since my illness i had no marks to show when she had readjusted my dress she lugged me to her side and we looked for a long while in each others eyes in silence ralph said she at length forgetting that the fault was mutual do you know that it is very rude to look so hard into peoples faces why do you do it my boy because you are so very very very pretty and your voice is so soft and because i do love you so but you must not love me too much my sweet child because i cant be with you to return your love o dear im so sorry becausebecauseif you dont love me nobody will master dont love me nor the ushers nor the boys and they keep calling me the hush ralph hush my poor boy said she colouring to her very forehead never tell me what they call you little boys who call names are wicked boys and are very false boys too hear me ralph you are nearly ten years old you must be a man and not love anyone too muchnot even mefor it makes people very unhappy to love too much do you understand me ralph you must be kind to all and all will be kind to you but it is best not to love anything violently excepting ralph him who will love you when all hate youwho will care for you when all desert youyour god i dont know too much about that was my answer mr root tells us once every week to trust in god and that god will protect the innocent and all that and then flogs me for nothing at all though i trust all i can and im sure that im innocent my good godmother was a little shocked at this and endeavoured to convince me that such expressions were impious by assuring me that everything was suffered for the best and that if mr foot flogged me unjustly and wickedly i should be rewarded and my master punished for it hereafter which assurance did not much mend my moral feelings as i silently resolved to put myself in the way of a few extra unjust chastisements in order that my master might receive the full benefit of them in a future state moral duties should be inculcated in the earliest youth but the mysteries of religion should be left to a riper age after many endearments and much good advice that i thought most beautiful from the tenderness of tone in which it was given i requested the lady with all my powers of entreaty and amidst a shower of kisses to take me home to my mother alas my dear boy was the reply mrs brandon is not your mother well i couldnt believe that beforenever mindi love her just as well but who is my mother if you were not so pretty and so fine i would ask you to be my mother all the other boys have got a mother and a father too the lady caught me to her bosom and kissing me amidst her tears said ralph i will be your mother though you must only look upon me as your godmamma oh im so glad of that and what shall i call you mamma my dear child well mamma wont you take me home i dont mean now but at the holidays when all the others go to their mammas ill be so good wont you mamma come here ralph i was wrong you must not call me mamma i cant bear it i was never a mother to you my poor boy i cannot have you home byandby perhaps do not think about me too much and do not think that you are not loved oh you are loved very much indeed but now you must make your schoolfellows love you i have told mr root to allow you sixpence a week and there are eight shillings for you and a box of playthings in the hall and a large cake in the box lend the playthings and share the cake now my dear boy i must leave you do not think that i am your mother but your very good friend now may god bless you and watch over you keep up your spirits and remember that you are cared for and lovedo how fondly loved with a fervent blessing and an equally fervent embrace she parted from me and when i looked round and found that she had gone from the room i actually experienced the sensation as if the light of the sun had been suddenly with drawn and that i walked forth in twilight when i went up melancholy to my bed and crept sorrowfully under the clothes i felt a protection round me in that haunted chamber in the very fact of having again seen her this house that had now been converted into a large school had formerly been one of the suburban palaces of queen elizabeth it was very spacious and rambling some of the rooms had been modernised and some remained as they had been for centuries the room in which i slept was one of the smallest and contained only two beds one of which was occupied by the housekeeper a very respectable old lady and the other by myself sometimes i had a bedfellow and sometimes not this room had probably been a vestibule or the antechamber to some larger apartment and it now formed an abutment to the edifice all on one side of it being ancient and the other modern it was lighted by one narrow high gothic window the panes of which were very small lozenged and many of them still stained the roof was groined and concave and still gay with tarnished gold the mouldings and traceries sprang up from the four corners and all terminated in the centre in which grinned a medusas head with her circling snakes in high preservation and of great and ghastly beauty there were other grotesque visages sprinkled here and there over that elaborate roof but look at that medusa from what point you might the painted wooden eyes were cast with a stolid sternness upon you when i had a bedfellow it was always some castaway like myselfsome poor wretch who could not go home and complain that he was put to sleep in the haunted chamber the boys told strange tales of that room and they all believed that the floor was stained with blood i often examined it both by day and by candlelight it was very old and of oak dark and much discoloured but even my excited fancy could discover nothing like bloodspots upon it after all when i was alone in that bedchamber for the housekeeper seldom entered before midnight and the flickering and feeble oillamp that always burned upon her table threw its uncertain rays upwards and made the central face quiver as it were into life i would shrink horrorstricken under the clothes and silently pray for the morning it was certainly a fearful room for a visionary child like myself with whom the existence of ghosts made an article of faith and who had been once before frightened even unto the death by supernatural terrors but of all this i never complained i have not merit enough to boast that i am proud for pride has always something ennobling about it but i was vain and vanity enabled me to put on the appearance of courage when questioned by the few schoolfellows who would speak to me i acknowledged no ghosts and would own to no fear all this in the sequel was remembered to my honour besides i had found a singular antidote against the look of the evil eye in the ceiling what i am going to relate may be startling and for a child ten years old appear incredible but it is the bare unembellished truth this was my antidote alluded to in the church where we went there was a strongly painted altarpiece the virgin mother bent with ineffable sweetness over the sleeping jesus the pew in which i sat was distant enough to give the full force of illusion to the power of the artist and the glory round the madonna much assisted my imagination i certainly attended to that face and to that beneficent attitude more than to be service when the terrors of my desolate situation used to begin to creep over me in my lonely bed i could without much effort of imagination bring that sweet motherly face before me and view it visibly in the gloom of the room and thus defy the dread glance of the visage above me i used to whisper to myself these wordslady with the glory come an sit by me and i could then close my eyes and fancy nay almost feel assured of her presence and sleep in peace but in the night that i had seen my godmother when i crept under my clothes disconsolately i no longer whispered for the lady with the glory it was for my sweet mamma and she too came and blessed my gentle slumbers surely that beautiful creature must have been my mother for long did she come and play the seraphs part over her child and watched by his pillow till he sank in the repose of innocence lately at the age of forty i visited that church i looked earnestly at the altarpiece i was astonished hurt disgusted it was a coarse daub the freshness of the painting had been long changed by the dark tarnish of years and the blighting of damp atmosphere there were some remains of beauty in the expression and elegance in the attitude but as a piece of art it was but a secondrate performance age dispels many illusions and suffers for it truly youth and enthusiasm are the best painters chapter twelve ralph lectureth on divinity and little boys nether garmentsdespondeth exceedinglyand being the weakest goeth to the wall and there findeth consolationan old friend with an old face and excellent provent the next morning i arose the possessor of eight shillings a box of playthings a plumcake and a heavy heart it is most true that which wordsworth hath said or sung the boys the father of the man when i mingled with my schoolmates and the unexpected possession of my various wealth had transpired i found many of them very kind and fatherly indeed for they borrowed my money ate my cake broke my playthings and my heart they left just in the same state as it as before but i will no longer dwell upon the portraiture of that saddest of all created things the despised of many i was taught the hard lesson of looking upon cruelty as my daily bread tears as my daily drink and scorn as my natural portion had not my heart hardened it must have broken but before i leave what i call the desponding epoch of my schoolboy days i must not omit to mention a species of impious barbarity that had wellnigh alienated my heart for ever from religion and which made me for the time detest the very name of church christianity is most eminently a religion of kindness and through the paths of holy love only should the young heart be conducted to the throne of grace for we have it from the highest authority that the worship of little children is an acceptable offering and may well mingle with the sweetest symphonies that ascend from the lips of seraphs to the footstool of the everlasting our god is not a god of terrors and when he is so represented or is made so by any flinthearted pedagogue to the infant pupil that man has to answer for the almost unpardonable sin of perilling a soul let parents and guardians look to it let them mark well the unwilling files that are paraded by boardingschool keepers into the adjacent church or chapel bringing a mercenary puff up to the very horns of the altar and let them inquire how many are then flogged or beaten or otherwise evilentreated because they have flagged in an attention impossible in the days of childhood and have not remembered a text perhaps indistinctly or inaudibly givenlet those parents or guardians i say inquire and if but one poor youth has so suffered let them be fully assured that that master whatever may be his diligence whatever may be his attainments however high his worldly character may stand is not fit to be the modeller of the youthful mind and only wants the opportunity to betray that bigotry which would gladly burn his dissenting neighbour at the stake or lash a faith with exquisite tortures into the children of those whom in his saintly pride he may call heretical at church we occupied at least onethird of the whole of one side of the gallery two hundred and fifty boys and young men with their attending masters and ushers could not but fill a large space and of course would form no unimportant feature in the audience mr root and the little boys were always placed in the lower and front seats there we sat poor dear little puppets with our eyes strained on the prayerbooks always in the wrong place during the offertory and after the sermon had begun repeating the text over and over again whilst the preaching continued lest we should forget it whilst all this time the bigger boys in the rear were studying novels or playing at oddandeven for nuts marbles or halfpence i well know that the mathematical master used invariably to solve his hard problems on flyleaves in his prayerbook during service for i have repeatedly seen there his laborious calculations in minutely small figures and he never opened his prayerbook but at churchas perhaps he thought with the old woman of smollett that it was a species of impiety to study such works anywhere else whilst all this was going on in the back rows mr root in the fullblown glory of his sunday paraphernalia and well powdered attended exclusively to the holiness and devout comportment of his little chapter of innocents tablet in hand every wandering look was noted down and alas the consequences to me were dreadfully painful the absolution absolved me not the te deum laudamus was to me more a source of tears than of praise and the o be joyful in the lord has often made me intensely sorrowful in the schoolroom in all honesty i dont think that for a whole halfyear i once escaped my sunday flogging it came as regularly as the baked ricepuddings i began to look upon the thing as a matter of course and if any person should doubt the credibility of this or any other account of these my schoolboy days happily there are several now living who can vouch for its veracity and if i am dared to the proof by anyone by whose conviction i should feel honoured that proof will i most certainly give i have stated all this from what i believe to be a true reverence for worship to make the offices of religion a balm and a blessing to prove that there is a cherishing warmth in the glory of light that surrounds the throne of exhaustless benevolence and that the deity cannot be worthily called upon by young hearts stricken by degrading fears and fainting under a molochinspired dread notwithstanding my eccentric life i have ever been the ardent the unpretending though the unworthy adorer of the great being whose highest attribute is the good i have had reason to be so the man who has acknowledged his creator amidst his most stupendous works who has recognised his voice in the ocean storm who has confessed his providence amidst the slaughter of battle and witnessed the awful universality of that adoration that is wafted to him from all nations under all forms from the simple smiting of the breast of the penitent solitary one to the sublime pealings of the choral hymn buoyed upon the resounding notes of the thundertongued organ in the high and dim cathedralthe man who has witnessed and acutely felt all this and has no feelings of piety or deference to religion must be endued with a heart hardened beyond the flintiness as the scriptures beautifully express it of the nether millstone but my forte is not the serious i am intent and quiet and thoughtful only under the influence of great enjoyment when i have most cause to deem myself blessed or to call myself triumphant it is then that i am stricken with a feeling of undesert that i am grave with humility or sad with the thought of human instability but on the eve of battle on the yardarm in the tempest or amidst the dying in the pesthouse say o ye companions of my youth whose jest was the most constant whose laugh the loudest yet the one feeling was not real despondence nor the other real courage in the first place it is no more than the soul looking beyond this world for the real in the second she is trifling in this world with the ideal however as in these pages i intend to attempt to be tolerably gay it may be fairly presumed that i am very considerably unhappy and dull perhaps as the perusal of these memoirs may make my readers as such great pains were taken at least by me in my religious education it is not to be wondered at that i should not feel at all sedentary on the sunday afternoons after churchtime in fact i affected any position rather than the sitting one but all the sundays were not joyless to me one in particular though the former part of it had been passed in sickening fear and the middle in torturing pain its termination was marked with a heartfelt joyousness the cause of which i must record as a tribute of gratitude due to one of the not unwashed but muddyminded multitude i was stealing along mournfully under the playground wall with no hasty or striding step not particularly wishing any rough or close contact of certain parts of my dress with my person my passing schoolmates looking upon me in the manner that shakespeare so beautifully describes the untouched deer regard the stricken hart my soul was very heavy and full of dark wonder the sun was setting and to all living it is either a time of solemn peace or of instinctive melancholy when looked upon by the solitary one of a sudden i was roused from my gloom by the wellknown yet long missed shout of ralph ralph and looking up i discovered the hardfeatured grinning physiognomy of joe brandon actually beaming with pleasure on the top of the wall how glad he was how glad i was he had found me instead of seeking the lord in his various conventicles on the sunday he had employed that day invariably after i had been taken from his house in reconnoitring the different boardingschools in the vicinity and at some distance from the metropolis to this no doubt he was greatly instigated by the affection of my nurse but i give his own heart the credit of its being a labour of love the wall being too high to permit us to shake hands at my earnest entreaty he went round to the front but after having made known his desireliterally a pampered menial drove him from the door well the wall if not open to him was still before and above him and he again mounted it our words were few as the boys began to cluster around me he let drop to me fourpencehalfpenny folded in a piece of brown paper and disappeared oh how i prize that pilgrim visit forget it i never can that meeting was to me a one bright light on my dark and dreary path it enabled me to go forward there was not much gloom between me and happier daysperhaps the light of joy that that occurrence shed enabled me to pass over the trial it might have been that at that period i could have borne no more and should have sunk under my accumulated persecutions i will not say that so it was for there is an elasticity in early youth that recovers itself against muchyet i was at that time heavy indeed with exceeding hopelessness all i can say to the sneerer is i wish that at the next conclave of personages who may be assembled to discuss the destinies of nations there may be as much of the milk of human kindness and right feelings among them as there was between me and the labouring sawyer joe brandon the one being at the top and the other at the bottom of the wall the next sunday brandon was again on the wall with a prodigious plumcake a regular cutandcomeagain affair it fell to the ground with a heaviness of sound that beat the falling of corporal trims hat all to ribbons to be sure the corporals fell as if there had been a quantity of clay kneaded in the crown of it whilst mine was kneaded with excellent dough the sunday after there was the same appearance varied with gingerbread and thenfor years i neither saw nor heard of him poor joseph was threatened with the constable and was put to no more expense for cakes for his fosterson chapter thirteen pray remember the fifth of novemberrumours of warspreceded by scholastic elocution and succeeded by a cold dinner darkness and determination i shall now draw the dolorous recital of what i have termed my epoch of despondency to a close the fifth of november was approaching i had been at school nearly two years and had learned little but the hard lesson to bear and that i had well studied i had as yet made no friends boys are very tyrannical and very generous by fits they will bully and oppress the outcast of a school because it is the fashion to bully and oppress himbut they will equally magnify their hero and are sensitively alive to admiration of feats of daring and wild exploit with them bravery is the first virtue generosity the second they crouch under the strong for protection and they court the lavish from selfinterest in all this they differ from men in nothing but that they act more undisguisedly well the fifth of november was fast approaching on which i was to commence the enthusiastic epoch of my schoolboy existence i was now twelve years of age almost insensible to bodily pain by frequent magisterial and social thrashings tall strong of my age reckless and fearless the scene of my first exploit was to be amidst the excitement of a barring out but of such a barring out that the memory of it remains in the vicinity in which it took place to this day i have before said that the school contained never less than two hundred and fifty pupilssometimes it amounted to nearly three hundred at the time of which i am about to speak it was very full containing among others many young men the times are no more when persons of nineteen and twenty suffered themselves to be horsed and took their one and two dozen with edification and humility at this age we now cultivate moustaches talk of our joe mantons send a friend to demand an explanation and all that sort of thing oh times are much improved however at that period the birch was no visionary terror infliction or expulsion was the alternative and as the form of government was a despotismlike all despotismsit was subject at intervals to great convulsions i am going to describe the greatest under the reign of root the first mr root was capricious sometimes he wore his own handsome head well powdered at others curled without powder at others straight without powder or curls he was churchwarden and then when his head was full of his office it was also full of flour and full of ideas of his own consequence and infallibility on a concert night and in the ballroom it was curled and then it was full of amatory conquests and as he was captain in the cavalry volunteers on field days his hair was straight and lankmartial ardour gave him no time to attend to the fripperies of the coxcomb these are but small particulars but such are very important in the character of a great man with his hair curled he was jocular even playful with it lank he was a great disciplinarianhad military subordination strong in respectand the birch gyrated freely but when he was full blown in powder he was unbearablethere was then combined all the severity of the soldier and the dogmatism of the pedagogue with the selfsufficiency and domineering nature of the coxcomb and churchwarden on the memorable fifth of november mr root appeared in the schoolroom with his hair elaborately powdered the little boys trembled lads by fifteens and twenties wanted to go out under various pretences the big boys looked very serious and very resolved it was twelve oclock and some thirty or fortymyself always includedwere duly flogged it being his custom at the hour of noon when the periodical operation was over at which there was much spargefication of powder from his whitened head he commanded silence even the flagellated boys contrived to hush up their sobs the shuffling of feet ceased those who had colds refrained from blowing their noses and after one boy was flogged for coughing he thus delivered himself young gentlemen it has been customarycustomary it has been i say for you to have permission to make a bonfire in the lower field and display your fireworks on this anniversary of the fifth of november little boys take your dictionaries and look out for the word anniversary a bustle for the books while mr root plumes himself and struts up and down two boys fight for the same dictionary one of them gets a plunge on the nose which makes him cry outhe is immediately horsed and flogged for speaking and rod in hand mr root continues young gentlemen you know my methodmy method is well known to you i sayto join amusement with instruction now young gentlemen the great conflagrationtenth ninth and eighth forms look out the word conflagrationthe great conflagration i say made by this pyrotechnic displayseventh sixth and fifth forms turn up the word pyrotechnic mr reynolds the head classical master you will particularly oblige me by not taking snuff in that violent way whilst i am speaking the sniffling is abominable turn up the word sniffling cries a voice from the lower end of the school a great confusionthe culprit remains undiscovered and some forty at two suspected desks are fined threehalfpence apiece mr root continues with a good deal of indignationi shant allow the bonfire no moreno not at all nor the fireworks neitherno nothing of no kind of the sort all this in his natural voice then swelling in dignity and in diction but for the accumulated pile of combustibles i sayfor the combustible pile that you have accumulated that you may not be deprived of the merit of doing a good action the materials of which it is composed that is to say the logs of wood and the bavins of furze with the pole and tarbarrel shall be sold and the money put in the poorbox next sunday which i as one of the churchwardens shall hold at the churchporch for a charity sermon will on that day be preached by the reverend father in god the lord bishop of bristol it is our duty as christians to give eleemosynary aid to the poorlet all classes but the first and second look out the word eleemosynary i say to the poor eleemosynary aid should be given you will also give up all the fireworks that you may have in your playboxes for the same laudable purpose the servant will go round and collect them after dinner i say by the servant after dinner they shall all be collected moreover young gentlemen i have to tell you that the churchwardens and the authorities in the town are determined to put down guy faux and he shall be put down accordingly so now young gentlemen youd better take your amusements before dinner for you will have no holiday in the afternoon and i shall not suffer anyone to go out after tea for fear of mischief having thus spoken he dismissed the school and strode forth majestically oh reader can you conceive the dismay the indignation and the rage that the court of aldermen would display if when sitting down hungrily to a civic feast they were informed that all the eatables and potatories were carried off by a party headed by mr scales can you conceive the fury that would burn in the countenances of a whole family of lordly sinecurists at being informed upon official authority that henceforth their salaries would be equal to their services no all this you cannot conceive nor turtledesiring aldermen nor catefed sinecurists could under these their supposed tribulations have approached in fury and hate the meekestspirited boys of mr roots school when they became fully aware of the extent of the tyrannous robbery about to be perpetrated had they not been led on by hope had they not trustingly eschewed banburycakessidled by longingly the pastrycooksand piously withstood the temptation of hardbake in order that they might save up their pocketmoney for this one grand occasion and even after this their hopes and their exertions to end in smoke would that it were even that but it was decided that there should be neither fire nor smoke infatuated pedagogue unhappy decision the boys did not make use of the permission to go out to play they gathered together unanimously in earnest knotsrebellion stalked on tiptoe from party to party the little boys looked big and the big boys looked bigger and the young men looked magnificent the halfboarders whispered their fears to the ushers the ushers spoke under their breaths to the undermasters the undermasters had cautious conversation with the head latin french and mathematical tutors and these poured their misgivings into the ears of the awful dominus himself but he only shook his powdered head in derision and disdain on that cold foggy fifth of november we all sat down to a dinner as cold as the day and with looks as dark as the atmosphere amidst the clatter of knives and forks the rumour already ran from table to table that a horse and cart was just going to remove the enormous pile of combustibles collected for the bonfire we had good spirits amongst us there was an air of calm defiance on a great many the reason was soon explained for before we rose from our repast huge volumes of red flame rose from the fieldthe pile had been fired in twenty places at once and at this sight a simultaneous and irrepressible shout shook the walls of the schoolroom the maidservants who were attending the table shrieking each in her peculiar musical note hurried out in confusion and fear and there was a rush towards the door by the scholars and some few got downstairs however the masters soon closed the door and those who had escaped were brought back the shutters of the windows that looked out upon the fire were closed and thus in the middle of the day we were reduced to a state almost of twilight every moment expecting actual collision with their pupils the masters and ushers about sixteen in number congregated at the lower end of the room near the door for the double purpose of supporting each other and of making a timely escape the halfsuppressed hubbub among three hundred boys confined in partial darkness grew stronger each moment it was like the rumbling beneath the earth that precedes the earthquake no one spoke as yet louder than the otherthe mastervoice had not yet risen that dulled noise seemed like a faroff humming and had it not been so intense and so very human it might have been compared to the wrath of a myriad of bees confined in the darkness of their hives with the queen lying dead amongst them chapter fourteen hard words the precursors of hard blowsa turnup to be apprehended but not merely of polysyllablesralph commences ravingroot resistingthe latter gets the whiphand of us whilst this commotion was going on in the schoolroom mr root was active in the field endeavouring with the aid of the menservants to pluck as much fuel from the burning pile as possible the attempt was nearly vain he singed his clothes and burnt his hands lost his hat in the excitement and turmoil and sadly discomposed his powdered ringlets advices were brought to him we must now use the phrase military of the demonstration made by the young gentlemen in the schoolroom he hurried with the pitchfork in his hand which he had been using and appeared at the entrance of his pandemonium almost considering his demoniac look in character he made a speech enforced by thumping the handle of the fork against the floor which speech though but little attended to was marked by one singularity he did not tell the lads to turn up any of his hard words however he hoped that the young gentlemen had yet sense of propriety enough left to permit the servants to clear the tables of the plates knives forks and other dinner appurtenances this was acceded to by shouts of let them inlet them in the girls and the two school menservants came in one of the latter being the obnoxious hoister and they were permitted to perform their office in a dead silence it speaks well for our sense of honour and respect for the implied conditions of the treaty when it is remembered that this abhorred tom the living instrument of our tortures and on whose back we had most of us so often writhed was permitted to go into the darkest corners of the room unmolested and even uninsulted when the tables were cleared then rung out exultingly the shout of bar him outbar him out i never yet roared out mr root was barred out of my own premises and i never will be he was determined to resist manfully and if he fell to fall like caesar in the capitol decorously so as togae are not worn in our unclassical days he retired to prepare himself for the contention by getting his head newly powdered telling his assistants to keep the position they still held at all hazards near the door before i narrate the ensuing strugglea struggle that will be ever remembered in the town in which it took place and which will serve anyone that was engaged in it as long as he lives to talk of with honest enthusiasm even if he has been happy enough to have been engaged in real warfare it is necessary to describe exactly the battlefield the school was a parallelogram bowed at one end and about the dimensions of a moderatelysized chapel it was very lofty and at the bowed end which looked into the fields there were three large windows built very high and arched after the ecclesiastical fashion one of the sides had windows similar to those at the end the schoolroom was entered from the house by a lobby up into which lobby terminated a wide staircase from the playground the schoolroom was therefore entered from the lobby by only one large folding door but over this end there was a capacious orchestra supported by six columns which orchestra contained a very superb organ the orchestra might also be entered from the house but from a floor and a lobby above that which opened into the schoolroom consequently at the doorend of the schoolroom there was a space formed of about twelve or fourteen feet with a ceiling much lower than the rest of the building and which space was bounded by the six pillars that supported the gallery above this low space was occupied by the masters and assistantscertainly a strong position as it commanded the only outlet the whole edifice was built upon rows of stone columns that permitted the boys a sheltered playground beneath the schoolroom in inclement or rainy weather the windows being high from the floor within doors and very high indeed from the ground without they were but sorry and dangerous means of communication through which either to make an escape or bring in succours or munitions should the siege be turned to a blockade it was altogether a vast and when properly fitted up a superb apartment and was used for the monthly concerts and the occasional balls time elapsed it seemed that we were the party barred in instead of the master being the party barred out the mass of rebellion was as considerable as any radical could have wished and as yet as disorganised as any tory commanderinchief of the forces could have desired however mr root did not appear and it having become completely dark the boys themselves lighted the various lamps about six or seven oclock there was a stir among the learned guard at the door when at length mr reynolds the head classical master having wrapped the silver top of his great horn snuffbox in a speech mingled very appropriately with latin and greek quotations wished to know what it was precisely that the young gentlemen desired and he was answered by fifty voices at once leave to go into the fields and let off the fireworks after a pause a message was brought that this could not be granted but upon the rest of the school going quietly to bed permission would be given to all the young gentlemen above fifteen years of age to go down to the town until eleven oclock the proposal was refused with outcries of indignation we now had many leaders and the shouts force the door became really dreadful gradually the lesser boys gave back and the young men formed a dense front line facing the sixteen masters whose position was fortified by the pillars supporting the orchestra and whose rear was strengthened by the servants of the household as yet the scholars stood with nothing offensive in their hands and with their arms folded in desperate quietude at last there was a voice a good way in the rear which accounts for the bravery of the owner that shouted why dont you rally and force the door here monsieur moineau a french emigre and our gallic tutor cried out lustily you shall force that door neverjamais jamaismy pretty garcons mes chers pupils be good be quietgo you couch yourselvesles feux dartifice bah they worth noding at allyou go to bed ah ah demainall have congeone two halfholidaybut you force this doorpar ma foi ejamaisyou go out one two three fourgo over dis corps of antoine auguste moineau we gave the brave fellow a hearty cheer for his loyalty and i have no doubt had he he been allowed to remain he would have been trampled to death on his post he had lost his rank his fortune everything but his selfrespect in the quarrel of his king who had just fallen on the scaffold he had a great respect for constituted authority and was sadly grieved at being obliged to honour heroism in spite of himself when arrayed against it let us pause over these proceedings and return to myself as the rebellion increased i seemed to be receiving the elements of a new life my limbs trembled but it was with a fierce joy i ran hither and thither exultinglyi pushed aside boys three or four years older than myselfi gnashed my teeth i stamped i clenched my handsi wished to harangue but i could not find utterance for the very excess of thoughts at that moment i would not be put down i grinned defiance in the face of my late scorners i was drunk with the exciting draught of contention the timid gave me their fireworks the brave applauded my resolution and as i went from one party to another exhorting more by gesture than by speech i was at length rewarded by hearing the approving shout of go it ralph rattlin i am not fearful of dwelling too much upon the affair it must be interesting to those amiabilities called the rising generation the more especially as a barring out is now become matter of history alas we shall never go back to the good old times in that respect notwithstanding we are again snugly grumbling under a whig government let us place at least one barring out upon record in order to let the radicals see and seeing hope when they find how nearly extremes meetwhat a slight step there is from absolute despotism to absolute disorganisation things were in this state the boys encouraging each other when to our astonishment mr root newlypowdered and attended by two friends his neighbours made his appearance in the orchestra and incontinently began a speech i was then too excited to attend to it indeed it was scarcely heard for revilings and shoutings however i could contain myself no longer and i even i though far from being in the first rank shouted forth let us out or we will set fire to the schoolroom and if we are burnt you will be hung for murder yes i said those wordsi who now actually start at my own shadowi who when i see a stalwart whiskered and moustached fellow coming forward to meet me modestly pop over on the other sidei who was in a fit of the trembles the whole year of the comet god bless me said mr root it is that vagabond rattlin i flogged the little incorrigible but eight hours ago and now he talks about burning my house down theres gratitude for you but ill put a stop to this at onceyoung gentlemen ill put a stop to this at once im coming down among you to seize the ringleaders and that goodfornothing rattlin ah the monitors and the heads of all the classes shall be flogged the rest shall be forgiven if they will go quietly to bed and give up all their fireworks having so said he descended from above with his friends and in about a quarter of an hour afterwards armed with a tremendous whip he appeared among his satellites below chapter fifteen much excellent and consequently useless diplomacy displayeda truce and many heads brokenthe battle rages and at length the pueriles achieve the victory the reader must not suppose that while masters and scholars were ranged against each other as antagonists they were quiet as statues there was much said on both sides reasonings entreaties expostulations and even jocularity passed between the adverse but yet quiescent ranks in this wordy warfare the boys had the best of it and im sure the ushers had no stomach for the frayif they fought they must fight in some measure with their hands tied for their own judgment told them that they could not be justified in inflicting upon their opponents any desperate wounds in fact considering all the circumstances though they asseverated that the boys were terribly in the wrong they could not say that mr root was conspicuously in the right when mr root got among his myrmidons he resolutely cried gentlemen assistants advance and seize master atkinson master brewster master davenant and especially master rattlin the said master rattlin having very officiously wriggled himself into the first rank such is the sanctity of established authority that we actually gave back with serried files however as our opponents advanced all had now been lost even our honour had it not been for the gallant conduct of young henry saint albans a natural son of the duke of y who was destined for the army and at that time studying fortification and to some purposefor immediately behind our front ranks and while mr root was haranguing and advancing saint albans had arranged the desks quite across the room in two tiers one above the other the upper tier with their legs in the air no bad substitute for chevauxdefrise in fact this manoeuvre was an anticipation of the barricades of paris when the boys came to the obstacle they made no difficulty of creeping under or jumping over it but for the magisterial mr root fully powdered or the classical master full of greek or the mathematical master conscious of much algebra to creep under these desks would have been infra dig and for them to have leapt over was impossible the younger assistants might certainly have performed the feat but they would have been but scurvily treated for their trouble on the wrong side of the barricade when two antagonist bodies cannot fight it is no bad pastime to parley saint albans was simultaneously and unanimously voted leader though we had many older than he for he was but eighteen a glorious youth was that saint albans accomplished generous brave handsome as are all his race and of the most bland and sunny manners that ever won womans love or softened mans asperity he died youngwhere where should he have died since this world was deemed by providence not deserving of him but amidst the enemies of his country her banners waving victoriously above and her enemies flying before his bleeding body henry now stood forward as our leader and spokesman eloquently did he descant upon all our grievances not forgetting mouldy bread caggy mutton and hebdomadal meat pies he represented to mr root the little honour that he would gain in the contest and the certain lossthe damage to his property and to his reputationthe loss of scholars and of profit and he begged him to remember that every playbox in the schoolroom was filled with fireworks and that they were all determinedand sorry he was in this case to be obliged to uphold such a determinationthey were one and all resolved if permission were not given to let off the fireworks out of doors they would inthe consequences be on mr roots head his speech was concluded amidst continued bravos and shouts of now now old reynolds our classic quietly stood by and taking snuff by handfuls requested nay entreated mr root to pass it all off as a joke and let the boys with due restrictions have their will mr root with a queer attempt at looking pleasant then said he began to enter into the spirit of the thingit was well got upthere could be really nothing disrespectful meant since mr henry saint albans was a party to it be it known that henry was an especial favourite and that he was inclined to humour them and look upon the school in the light of a fortress about to capitulate he therefore would receive a flag of truce and listen to proposals the boys began to be delighted the following conditions were drawn up and a lad with a white handkerchief tied to a skyrocket stick was hoisted over the benches into the besieging quarters the paper after reciting as is usual with all rebels in arms against their lawful sovereign their unshaken loyalty firm obedience and unqualified devotion went on thusbut we shall to save time put to each proposition the answer returned the young gentlemen shall be permitted as in times past to discharge their fireworks round what remains of the bonfire between the hours of nine and eleven oclock ans granted with this limitation that all young gentlemen under the age of nine shall surrender their fireworks to the elder boys and stand to see the display without the fence that any damage or injury caused by the said display to mr roots premises fences etcetera shall be made good by a subscription of the school ans granted it being now nearly eight oclock the young gentlemen shall have their usual suppers ans granted that a general amnesty shall be proclaimed and that no person or persons shall suffer in any manner whatever for the part that he or they may have taken in this thoughtless resistance ans granted with the exception of masters atkinson brewster davenant and rattlin upon the last article issue was joined the flag of truce still flying during the debate the very pith of the thing was the act of amnesty and oblivion yet so eager were now the majority of the boys for their amusement that had it not been for the noble firmness of saint albans the leaders with poor pilgarlick would have been certainly sacrificed to their lust of pleasure but the affair was soon brought to a crisis all this acting the military pleased me most mightily and the better to enjoy it i crouched under one of the desks that formed the barricade and with my head and shoulders thrust into the enemys quarters sat grinning forth my satisfaction the last clause was still canvassing when unheardof treachery mr root seeing his victim so near seized me by the ears and attempted to lug me away captive my schoolfellows attempted to draw me back saint albans protestedeven some of the masters said shame when mr root finding he could not succeed gave me a most swinging slap of the face as a parting benediction and relinquished his grasp no sooner did i fairly find myself on the right side of the barricade than all my terrors overcome by pain i seized an inkstand and discharged it point blank at the fleecy curls of the ferulafer with an unlucky fatality of aim mr roots armorial bearings were now at least on his crest blanche chequered noir on my lads on exclaimed the gallant saint albans the barricades were scaled in an instant and we were at fisticuffs with our foes rulers flew obliquely perpendicularly and horizontallyinkstands made inkspouts in the air with their dark gyrationsbooks that the authors had done their best to fasten on their shelves peacefully for ever for once became lively and made an impression i must do mr root the justice to say that he bore him gallantly in the melee his white and black head popped hither and thither and the smack of his whip resounded horribly among the shins of his foes old reynolds not even in battle being able to resist the inveteracy of habit had the contents of his large snuffmull forced into his eyes ere twenty strokes were struck he ran roaring and prophecying like blind tiresias among both parties and as a prophet we respected him the french master being very obese was soon borne down and there he lay sprawling and calling upon glory and la belle france whilst both sides passed over him by turns giving him only an occasional kick when they found him in their way it is said of mr simpson the mathematical masterbut i will not vouch for the truth of the account for it seems too homericthat being hard pressed he seized and lifted up the celestial globe wherewith to beat down his opponents but being a very absent man and the ruling passion being always dreadfully strong upon him he began instead of striking down his adversaries to solve a problem upon it but before he had found the value of a single tangent the orb was beaten to pieces about his skull and he then saw more stars in his eyes than ever twinkled in the milky way in less than two minutes mr root to his crest added guleshis nose spouted blood his eyes were blackened and those beautiful teeth of which he was so proud were alarmingly loosened for myself i did not do muchi could noti could not for very rapture i danced and shouted in all the madness of exhilaration i tasted then for the first time the fierce and delirious poison of contention had the battlecry been a rattlin instead of a saint albans i could not have been more elated the joy of battle to the young heart is like water to the sands of the desertwhich cannot be satiated in much less than three minutes the position under the gallery was carried root and the masters made good their retreat through the door and barricaded it strongly on the outsideso that if we could boast of having barred him out he could boast equally of having barred us in we made three prisoners mr reynolds mr moineau and a lanky sneaking turnipcomplexioned underusher who used to write execrable verses to the sickly housemaid and borrow halfcrowns of the simple wench wherewith to buy pomatum to plaster his thin lank hair he was a known sneak and a suspected telltale the booby fell acrying in a dark corner and we took him with his handkerchief to his eyes out of the respect that we bore our french and latin masters we gave them their liberty the door being set ajar for that purpose but we reserved the usher that like the american indians we might make sport with him chapter sixteen an affecting appeal that effects nothingthe rebels commence their rejoicingsthey are suddenly dampedthe firemen defeat the fireboys by means of waterthe victors are vanquished who shortly find themselves covered with disgrace and the bedclothes when we informed the captive usher that he was destined for the high honour of being our guy faux and that he should be the centre of our fireworks promising him to burn him as little as we could help and as could reasonably be expected his terror was extreme and he begged like one in the agonies of death that we would rather bump him we granted his request for we determined to be magnanimous and he really bore it like a stoic scarcely had we finished with the usher than mrs root like niobe all in tears appeared with outstretched arms in the gallery her outstretched arms her pathetic appeals her sugared promises had no avail the simple lady wanted us to go to bed and mr root to use her own expression should let us all off tomorrow we were determined to stay up and let all our fireworks off tonight but we granted to her intercession that all the little boys should be given up to her it now became a very difficult thing to ascertain who was a little boy many a diminutive urchin of eight with a stout soul declared that he was a big fellow and several lanky lads with sops of bread for hearts called themselves little boys there was as i said before no communication from the schoolroom with the orchestra we were therefore obliged to pile the desks as a platform and hand up the chickenhearted to take protection under the wing of the old hen our captive usher respectfully begged to observe that though he could not say that he was exactly a little boy yet if it pleased us he would much rather go to bed as he had lately taken physic the plea was granted but not the platform that was withdrawn and he was forced to climb up one of the pillars and as we were charitably inclined we lent him all the impetus we could by sundry appliances of switches and rulers in order to excite a rapid circulation in those parts that would most expedite his up ward propulsion upon the same principles that cause us to fire one extremity of a gun in order to propel the ball from the other he having been gathered with the rest round mrs root she actually made us a curtsey in the midst of her tears and smiled as she curtseyed bidding us all a goodnight to be good boys to do no mischief and above all to take care of the fire then having obtained from us a promise that we would neither injure the organ nor attempt to get into the orchestra she again curtseyed and left us masters of the field now the debate was frequent and full we had rebelled and won the field of rebellion in order to be enabled to discharge our fireworks the thought of descending by means of the windows was soon abandoned we should have been taken in the detail even if we escaped breaking our bones we were compelled to use the schoolroom for the sparkling display and all under the directions of saint albans we began to prepare accordingly would that i had been the hero of that night though i did not perform the deeds i felt all the glow of one and unexpected honour i was actually addressed by henry saint albans himself as honest ralph rattlin the brave boy who slept in the haunted room there was a distinction for you of course i cannot tell how an old gentleman rising sixtyfive feels when his sovereign places the blue riband over his stooping shoulders but if he enjoys half the rapture i then did he must be a very very happy old man revenons a nos moutonswhich phrase i use on account of its originality and its applicability to fireworks nails were driven into the walls and catherinewheels fixed on them roman candles placed upon the tables instead of muttondips and the upper parts of the school windows let down for the free egress of our flights of skyrockets the first volley of the lastmentioned beautiful firework went through the windows amidst our huzzas at an angle of about sixtyfive degrees and did their duty nobly whenwhenof course the reader will think that the room was on fire alas it was quite the reverse a noble catherinewheel had just begun to fizz in all the glories of its manycoloured fires when horror dismay confusion half a dozen firemen with their hateful badges upon their arms made their appearance in the orchestra and the long leathern tube being adjusted the brazen spout began playing upon us and the catherinewheel amidst the laughter of the men in which even we participated whilst we heard the clank clank clank of the infernal machine working in the playground mr root was not simple enough to permit his house to be burned down with impunity and since he found he could do no better he resolved to throw cold water upon our proceedings the schoolroom door was now thrown open to permit us to go out if we pleased but we chose to remain where we were for the simple reason that we did not know whom we might meet on the stairs we had agreed under the directions of saint albans to let off our fireworks with some order but now instead of playthings for amusement they were turned into engines of offence showers of squibs crackers and every species of combustible were hurled at our opponents above us it was the struggle of fire with water but that cold and powerful stream played continuously wherever it met us it took away our breath and forced us to the ground yet we bore up gallantly and the rockets that we directed into the orchestra very often drove our enemies back and would have severely injured the organ had they not covered it with blankets we advanced our desks near the gallery to use them as scalingladders to storm but it would not do they were not sufficiently high and the stream dashed the strongest of us back however we plied our fiery missiles as long as they lasted but the water never failedits antagonist element did too soon whilst it lasted considering there was no slaughter it was a very glorious onslaught in one short halfhour we were reduced drowned burnt blackened looking very foolish and fearing very considerably we now approached the door it was still openno attempt to capture anyoneno opposition was offered to us but the worst of it was we were obliged to sneak through files of deriding neighbours and servants and we each crept to bed like a dog that had stolen a pudding anything but satisfied with our exploits or the termination of them saint albans would not forgive himself he heaped immeasurable shame upon his own head because he had not secured the orchestra he declared he had no military genius he would bind himself an apprentice to a country carpenter and make pigstieshe would turn usher and the boys should bump him for an asshe would run away he did the latter leaving the firemen to see all safe mr root to deplore his defaced schoolroom and his destroyed property mrs root to prepare for an immensity of cases of cold and burnt faces and handsi shall here conclude the history of the famous barring out of the fifth of november of the year of grace if it had not all the pleasures of a real siege and battle except actual slaughter i dont know what pleasure is and the reader byandby will find out that i had afterwards opportunities enough of judging upon this sort of kingly pastimes in which the cutting of throats was not omitted chapter seventeen is full of moral and religious disquisitions therefore it behoveth the general reader to look at and pass it by with that inattention that readers generally have for morality and religion when the boys came downstairs there was as comfortless a scene displayed before them as the most retributive justice could have wished to visit on the rebellious the morning raw and cold the floor saturated with water and covered with cases of exploded fireworks the schoolroom in horrible confusion scarcely a pane of glass unshatteredthe walls blackened the books tornand then the masters and ushers stole in looking both suspicious and discomfited well we went to prayers and very lugubriously did we sing the hymn awake my soul and with the sun thy daily course of duty run now that morning no one could tell whether the sun had waked or not at least he kept his bedcurtains of fog closely drawn and about twentyfive of the scholars gave a new reading to thy daily course of duty run as immediately after they had paid their doleful orisons they took the course of running their duty by running away there were no classes that day mr root did not make his appearanceand we had a constrained holiday on the th to use a nautical expression we had repaired damages and we began to fall into the usual routine of scholastic business but it was full a week before our master made his appearance in the schoolroom and he did so then with a green shade over his eyes to conceal the green shades under them he came in at the usual hour of noonthe black list was handed up to himand i expected in the usual order of things an assiduous flogging but in this world we are the martyrs of disappointment the awful man folded up the paper very melancholily and thrust it into his waistcoat pocket and thus saved me the expense of some very excellent magnanimity which i had determined to display had he proceeded to flagellation it was my intention very intrepidly to have told him that if he punished me i also would run away on the veracity of a schoolboy i was disappointed at not receiving my three or four dozen i had now fairly commenced my enthusiastic epoch i was somebody i still slept in the haunted room i had struck the first blow in the barring outsaint albans had openly commended me for my braveryi could no longer despise myself and the natural consequence was that others dared not i formed friendships evanescent certainly but very sweet and very sincere several of the young gentlemen promised to prevail upon their parents to invite me to their homes during the approaching holidays but either their memories were weak or their fathers obdurate well the winter holidays came at last and i was left sole inhabitant of that vast and lonely schoolroom with one fire for my solace and one tenpenny dip for my enlightenment how awful and supernatural seemed every passing sound that beat upon my anxious ears everything round me seemed magnifiedthe massive shadows were as the wombs teeming with unearthly phantomsthe whistle of the wintry blasts against the windows voiced the halfunseen beings that my fears acknowledged in the deep darknesses of the vast chamber and then that lonely orchestra often did i think that i heard low music from the organ as if touched by ghostly fingershow gladly i would have sunk down from my solitude to the vulgarity of the servants hallbut that was now carefully interdicted the consequences of all this seclusion to a highly imaginative and totally unregulated mind must have been much worse than putting me to sleep in the haunted room for in that i had my counterspelland long use had almost endeared me to it and its grotesque carvingsbut this dismally large schoolroom generally so instinct with life so superabounding in animation was painfully fearful even from the contrast twenty times in the evening when the cold blast came creeping along the floor and wound round my ankles did i imagine it was the chill hand of some corpse thrust up from beneath that was seizing me in order to drag me downwardsand a hundred times as the long flame from the candle flared up tremulously and shook the deep shadows that encompassed me around did i fancy that there were very hideous faces indeed mouthing at me amidst the gloomand my own gigantic shadowit was a vast horror of itself personified it was a cruel thing even in mr root to leave me alone so many hours in that stupendous gloom but his wifefie upon her considering how my imagination had been before worked upon even from my earliest childhood and the great nervous excitability of my temperament it is a wonder that my mind did not reel if not succumb but i now began to combat the approaches of one sort of insanity with the actual presence of anotheri wrote verses that was tempering the wind to the shorn lamb as sterne would have expressed it after the prettiest fashion imaginable had i not the reader so completely at my mercydid i not think him or her not only the gentlest but also the most deserving of all the progeny of japhetdid i not think that it would be the very acme of ingratitude to impose upon him or her i would certainly transcribe a centaine or so of these juvenile poems it is true they are very badbut then that is a proof that they are undeniably genuine i really have in some things a greatness of soul i will refrainbut in order that these effusions may not be lost to the world i offer them to the annuals for not so much for the sake of pecuniary compensation but in order to improve the reading of some of that very unreadable class of books well during these dismal holidays i wrote verses and began to take or to make my madness methodical the boys came back and having left me a very bobadil they found me a juvenile bavius i now began to approach my thirteenth year and what with my rhyming and my fistical prowessmy character for bravery and the peculiarity of my situation as it regarded its mysteryi became that absurd thing that the french call une tete montee root had ceased to flog me i could discover that he even began to fear meand just in proportion as he seemed to avoid all occasion to punish me i became towards him mild observant and respectful the consequence was that as i was no longer frightened out of my wits at church from very weariness and for the sake of variety i began to attend to the sermons what a lesson ought not this to be to instructors one sunday i returned from church in a state of almost spiritual intoxication the rector was a pale attenuated man with a hollow yet flashing eyea man who seemed to have done with everything in this world excepting to urge on his brethren to that better one to which himself was fast hastening and on this memorable day that i fancied myself a convert he had been descanting on the life of the young samuel of course he very appropriately often turned to the juvenile part of his congregation and as i was seated in the front row i felt as if i were alone in the churchas if every word were individually addressed to myself his imploring yet impassioned glances seemed to irradiate my breast with a sweet glory i felt at once that since the goodness of the creator was inexhaustible the fault must rest with man if there were no more samuels so i determined to be oneto devote myself entirely to divine abstraction to heavenly glory and to incessant worshipand stupendous as the assertion may seem for six weeks i did so this resolution became a passiona madness i was as one walking in a sweet trancei revelled in secret bliss as if i had found a glorious and inexhaustible treasure i spoke to none of my new state of mind absorbed as i was i yet dreaded ridiculebut i wrote hymns i composed sermons if i found my attention moving from heavenly matters i grew angry with myself and i renovated my flagging attention with inward ejaculation i had all the madness of the anchorite upon me in the midst of youthful society yet without his asceticism and certainly without his vanity my studies of course were nearly totally neglected under this complete alienation of spirit and mr root lenient as he had lately become towards me began to flog again andshall i be believed when i say iti have been examining my memory most severely and i am sure it has delivered up its record faithfully but yet i hardly dare give it to the worldbut despite of ridicule i find myself compelled to say that these floggings i scarcely felt i looked upon them as something received for the sake of an inscrutable and unfathomable love and i courted themthey were pleasurable i now can well understand the enthusiasm and the raptures of that ridiculous class of exploded visionaries called flagellants i certainly was in a state of complete oblivion to everything but a dreamy fanaticism and yet that term is too harsh and it would be impiety to call it holiness seeing that it was in a state of inutilityand yet many wellmeaning persons will think no doubt that my infant and almost sinless hand had hold of a blessed link of that chain of ineffable love which terminates in the breast of that awful being who sits at the righthand of the throne of the eternal i give myself no opinion i only state facts but i cannot help hazarding a conjecture of what i might have been had i then possessed a friend in any one of my instructors who could have pointed out to me what were the precincts of true piety what those of incipient insanity at that time i had the courage to achieve anything let the coldhearted and the old say what they will youth is the time for moral bravery the withered and the aged mistake their failing forces for calmness and resignation and an apathy the drear anticipator of death for presence of mind however this state of exalted feeling had a very ludicrous termination i ceased fighting i was humble seeking whom i might serve reproving no one but striving hard to love all giving assisting and actually panting for an opportunity of receiving a slap on one side of the face that i might offer the other for the same infliction the reader may be sure that i had the bible almost constantly before me when not employed in what i conceived some more active office of what i thought sanctification but though the spirit may be strong at times the body will be weak i believe i dozed for a few minutes over the sacred book when a wag stole it away and substituted for it the renowned and veracious history of the seven champions of christendom there was the frontispiece the gallant saint george in gold and green armour thrusting his spear into the throat of the dragon in green and gold scales what a temptation i ogled the book coyly at first i asked for my bible read that ralph said the purloiner oh recreant that i was i read it i was cured in three hours of being a saint of despising flogging and of aping samuel chapter eighteen ralph receives an infusion of patriotismis himself drilled and drills a touch holehe turns out a monstrous big liarsomebody comes to see him whom nobody can see and the mystery ends in another migration it is the nature of men and boys to run into extremes i have carried the reader with me through my desponding and enthusiastic epochs i now come to the most miserable of all my mendacious one an avowed poet is entitled de jure to a good latitude of fiction but i abused this privilege most woefully i became a confirmed and intrepid liarand this too was the natural course of my education or the want of it i began to read all manner of romances there was a military and chivalrous spirit strong in the schoolthe mania for volunteering was general and our numerous school were almost all trained to arms the government itself supplied us with a halfdozen drill sergeants to complete us in our manual and platoon exercises we had a very pretty uniform and our equipments as infantry were complete in all things save and excepting that all the muskets of the junior boys had no touchholes mine was delivered to me in this innocent state oh that was a great mortification on fielddays when we were allowed to incorporate with the and volunteers whilst all the big lads actually fired off real powder in line with real men to be obliged to snap a wooden flint against a sparkless hammer a mortification i could not would not endure there was a regular contention between mr root my musket and myself and at last by giving my sergeant a shilling i conquered every day that our muskets were examined on parade mine would be found with a touchhole drilled in it as certainly as it was found so certainly was i hoisted in that fever of patriotism i of all the school though denied powder and shot was the only one that bled for my country however i at length had the supreme felicity of blowing powder in the face of vacancy in high defiance of buonaparte and his assembled legions on the coast of boulogne thus i had military ardour added to my other ardencies moreover i had learned to swim in the new river and altogether began to fancy myself a hero i began now to appreciate and to avail myself of the mystery of my birth i did not read romances and novels for nothing so i began my mendacious career oh the improbable and the impossible lies that i told and that were retold and all believed i was a prince incognito my father had coined moneyand i gave my deluded listeners glimpses at pocketpieces as proof if i was doubted i fought the elder boys shook their heads and could make nothing of it the ushers made what inquiries they dared and found nothing which they could contradict positively but much upon which to found conjecture still notwithstanding my success my life began to grow burthensome the lies became too manifold too palpable and to me too onerous they had been extremely inconsistentridicule began to raise her hissing head shame became my constant companionyet i lied on i think i may safely say that i would at the time that i was giving myself out as a future king have scorned the least violation of the truth to have saved myself from the most bitter punishment or to injure in the least my worst enemy my lies were only those of a most inordinate vanity begun in order to make a grand impression of myself and persevered in through obstinacy and pride but i was crushed beneath the stupendous magnificence of my own creations i had been so circumstantialdescribed palaces reviews battles my own charges and nowoh how sick all these fabrications made me it was time i left the school or that life left me for it had become intolerable and yet this state of misery the misery of the convicted yet obstinately persevering liar lasted nearly a year let me hurry over it but at the same time let me hold it up as a picture to youth upon the same principle as the spartans showed drunken slaves to their children could the young but conceive a tithe of the misery i endured they would never after swerve from the truth i have not time to expatiate on several droll mishaps that occurred to mr root how he was once bumped in all the glowing panoply of equine war how when one night with his head well powdered he crept upon allfours as was his wont into one of the boys bedrooms to listen to their nightly conversations and how such visit being expected as his head lay on the side of the bedstead it was there immovably fixed by the application of a halfpound of warm cobblers wax and release could only be obtained by the jasonlike operation of shearing the fleecy locks we must rapidly pass on i was eager to get away from this school and my desire was accomplished in the following very singular manner one fine sunshiny sunday morning as we were all arranged in goodly fashion two by two round the playground preparatory to issuing through the house to go to church the unusual cry was heard of master rattlin wanted which was always understood to be the joyful signal that some parent or friend had arrived as a visitor i was immediately hurried into the house a whispering took place between mr and mrs root and the consequence was that i was bustled up into the bedroom and my secondbest clothes which i then had on were changed for the best and with a supererogatory dab with a wet towel over my face i was brought down and my little heart playing like a pair of castanets against my ribs i was delivered into the tender keeping of the pedagogue having taken me by the hand whilst he was practising all the amenities with his countenance he opened the parlourdoor where the supposititious visitor was expected to be found and lo the room was empty mrs root and the servants were summoned and they all positively declared and were willing to swear to the fact that a gentleman had gone into the room who had never gone out it was a front parlour on the groundfloor and from the window he could not have emerged as the area intervened between that and the foot pavement and to see a gentleman scrambling through by that orifice into the principal street of and from one of the principal houses of the town whilst all the people were going to church was a little too preposterous even for mr roots matteroffact imagination however they all peeped up the chimney one after the other as if an elderly militarylooking gentleman encumbered with a surtout for thus he was described would have been so generous as to save my schoolmaster a shilling by bustling up his chimney and bringing down the soot the person was not to be found root began to grow alarmeda constable was sent for and the house was searched from the attics to the cellar the dwelling was not however robbed nor any of its inmates murdered notwithstanding the absconder could not be found now mr root was a wise man in his own generation yet was he notwithstanding a great fool he was one of that class who can sometimes overreach a neighbour yet in doing so inevitably loses his own balance and tumbles into the mire a sagacious ninny who had an i told you so for every possible event after it had happened instead of taking the commonsense view of the affair of the missed gentleman and supposing that the footman had been bribed to let him quietly out at the streetdoor who perhaps had found his feelings too little under his control to go through the interview with me that he sought root set about making a miracle of the matter it was astoundingnay superhuman it boded some misfortune to him and so it really did by the manner in which he treated it i verily believe that had the servants or mrs root who had seen the gentleman averred to a cloven foot as peeping out from his military surtout he would have given the assertion not only unlimited credence but unlimited circulation also however as it was he made himself most egregiously busy there was his brother churchwardens and the curates summoned to assist him in a court of inquiry evidence was taken in form and a sort of proces verbal drawn out and duly attested mr root was a miraclemonger and gloried in being able to make himself the hero of his own miracles well after he had solaced himself by going about to all his neighbours with this surprising paper in hand for about the space of a fortnight he thought to put the climax to his policy and his vainglory by taking it and himself up to the bankers in town where he always got the full amount of his bills for my board and education paid without either examination or hesitation the worthy moneychanger looked grimly polite at the long and wonderful account of the schoolmaster received a copy of the account of the mysterious visitor with most emphatic silence and then bowed the communicant out of his private room with all imaginable etiquette mr root came home on excellent terms with himself he imposed silence upon his good lady his attentive masters and ushers and then wiping the perspiration from his brow proceeded to tell his admiring audience of his great his very great exertions and how manfully through the whole awful business he had done his duty alas he soon found to his cost that he had done something more in cockney language he had done himself out of a good pupil a fortnight after i was again wanted there was a glass coach at the door a very reserved sort of gentleman alighted paid all demands up to the end of the ensuing halfyear answered no questions but merely producing a document handed me and all my worldly wealth into his vehicle and off we drove to the best of my recollection all the conversation that i heard from this taciturn person was that sentence so much the more remarkable for verity than originality ask no questions and i shall tell you no stories having nothing else to do in this my enforced teteatete i began to conjecture what next was to become of me at first i built no castles in the air i had got quite sick of doing that aloud with my late schoolfellows and passing them all off as facts still it must be confessed that my feelings were altogether pleasurable it was a soulcheering relief to have escaped from out of that vast labyrinth of lies that i had planted around me and no longer to dread the rodbearing root even novelty under whatever form it may present itself is always grateful to the young in the midst of these agitations i again found myself in town and i began to hope that i should once more see my fosterparents i began to rally up my little latin and less greek in order to surprise the worthy sawyer and his wife and i had fully determined to work out for him what the amount of his daily wages came to in a week first by simple arithmetic secondly by fractions thirdly by decimals and fourthly by duodecimals and then to prove the whole correct by an algebraical equation but all these triumphs of learning were not destined for me i found at length that the glass coach drove up the innyard of some large coachmaster but few words were said and i was consigned to the coachman of one of the country stages with as little remorse and as little ceremony as if i had been an ugly bleareyed pug forwarded in a basket labelled this side uppermost to an old maiden aunt or a superannuated grandmother this was certainly unhandsome treatment to one who had been lately seriously telling his companions that he was a disguised prince of the blood forced for state reasons to keep a strict incognito it is true that i travelled with four horses and was attended by a guard nay that a flourish of music preceded my arrival at various points of my journey but all these little less than royal honours i shared with a plebeian butcher a wheezing and attenuated plumber and glazier and other of his lieges all very useful but hardly deemed ornamental members of the body politic chapter nineteen a chapter of disappointments which ralph hopes the reader will not sharesome comparisons which he hopes will not be found odious and some reflections which he thinks cannot be resented my friends will perceive that at the time of which i am speaking the stagecoach contained if not actually a bad character i a person on the very verge of being onethat i was that graceless yet tolerated being a scamp was very certainyet my gentle demeanour my smooth bright countenance and neverceasing placid smile would have given a very different impression of my qualities i have been thus liberal in my confessions in order that parents may see that their duties do not terminate where those of the schoolmaster begin that the schoolmaster himself must be taken to task and the watcher watched i had been placed in one of the first boardingschools near town a most liberal stipend had been paid with me i had every description of master yet after all this outlay of money which is not drossand waste of time which is beyond price precious what was i at leaving this academy let the good folks withinside of the stickenham stage testify by one trick or another i had contrived to make them all tolerably uncomfortable before the journey was half over but where am i going caesar and his fortunes are embarked in a stagecoach an hour and a half had elapsed when i perceived that the horses were dragging the vehicle slowly up a steep hill the fullleaved trees are arching for us overhead a verdant canopy the air becomes more bracing and elastic and even i feel its invigorating influence and cease to drop slily the gravelly dirt i had collected from my shoes down the neck and back of a very pretty girl who sat blushing furiously on my left now the summit is gained and in another moment the coach thunders down the other side of the hill but what a beautiful view is spread before my fascinated eyes and then rose up in my young heart the long sleeping emotions of love and kindred affection into whose arms was i to be received whose were to be the beautiful lips that were now longing to kiss me with parental perhaps fraternal rapture had i a sister could i doubt it at that ecstatic moment how i would love her the fatted calf was not only killed but cooked to welcome the long lost nor latin nor french nor greek nor mathematics should embitter the passing moments this young summer that breathed such aromatic joy around me had put on its best smile to welcome me to my paternal abode no doubt said i to myselfno doubt but that some one of the strange stories that i told of myself at roots is going to be realised in the midst of these rapturous anticipations each later one becoming more wild and more glorious than the previous one that begot it it wanting still an hour of sundown all at once the coach stopped before a house upon a gentle elevationstopped with a jerk too as if it were going to usher in some glorious event i looked out and behold in hated gold letters upon the hated blue board the bitterly hated word academy met my agonised sight i burst into tears i needed no voice to tell me that i was the person to alight i knew my doom farewell to all my glorious visions i could have hurled back into the face of the laughing sun my hate and called him deceiver and traitor for had he not with other causes conspired to smile me five minutes ago into a fools paradise master rattlin wont you please to alight said one of those undertoned gerundsinging voices that my instinct told me to be an ushers no thankee sir said i amidst my sobbings i want to go home but you are to get down here however said my evilomened inviter your boxes are all off the coach and the coachman wants to go forward so do i its excessively droll thishi hi hi as sure as my names saltseller it is excessively droll so you want to get forward master rattlin why come to school then thats the waydroll isnt it why youve been riding backwards all the way tootime to changedroll thathi hi its no change said i getting out sulkily from one school to anotherand do you call this a school i continued looking round contemptuously for i found about twenty little boys playing upon a green knoll before the house and over which we were compelled to walk to reach it as the road did not come near the habitation do you call this a school well if you catch me being flogged here im a sop thats alla school and i suppose youre the usheri dont think those little boys bumped you last halfyear i dont think they did said mr saltseller which was actually the wretchs name and with whom i fell desperately in hate at first sight bump me he exclaimed soliloquisingand with that air of astonishment as if he had heard the most monstrous impossibility spoken of imaginable bump me droll isnt itexcessively where have you been brought up master rattlin where they bar out tyrannical masters and bump sneaking ushers said i thats where i was brought up then thats what i call very bad bringing up not so bad as being brought down here anyhow his next excessively droll isnt it brought us to the door of the academy but in passing over the playground i could see at once that i was with quite another class of beings than those who composed my late schoolfellows they were evidently more delicately nurtured they had not the air of schoolboy daring to which i had been so much accustomed and they called each other master everything too seemed to be upon a miniature scale the house was much smaller yet there was an air of comfort and of health around that at first i did not appreciate though i could not help remarking it no sooner was i conducted into the passage than i heard a voice which i thought i remembered exclaim show master rattlin in here and shut the door i entered and the next moment i was in the arms of the mysterious and very beautiful lady that had called to see me the few times that i have recorded and who i conceived was intimately connected with my existence i think that i have before said that she never avowed herself either to my nurse or to myself as more than my godmother she evinced a brief but violent emotion and then controlled her features to a very staid and matronly expression for myself i wept most bitterly from many mingled emotions but to the shame of human nature and of my own wounded pride was the most intolerable pang that i felt in all my daydreams i had made this lady the presiding genius i gave her in my inmost heart all the reverence and the filial affection of a son but it was the implied understanding between my love and my vanity that in joining herself to me as a mother she was to bestow upon me a duchess at least though i should not have thought myself overwell used had it been a princess and here were all these glorious anticipations merged sunk destroyed in the person of a boardingschool mistress of about twenty boys myself the biggest it was no use that i said to myself over and over again she is not less lovelyher voice less musical her manner less endearing or her apparel less rich the startling truth was ever in my earshe keeps a school and consequently she cannot be my mother she could not know what was passing in my mind but it was evident that my grief was of that intensity that nearly approached to misery she took me by the hand showed me my nice little bed the large garden the river that ran at the bottom of it and placed before me fruit and cakes i would not be consoled what business had she to be a schoolmistress i had a thousand times rather have had mrs brandon for a mother againshe had never deceived me but i was soon aware that this lady whom i now for the first time heard named as mrs cherfeuil was as little disposed to grant me the honour of calling her mother as i was to bestow it i was introduced to her husband as the son of a female friend of hers of early life that she had stood godmother to me that my parentage was respectable and as she before had sufficient references to satisfy him from the agent who had called a week before my arrival the good man thought there was nothing singular in the affair but let us describe this good man my new pedagogue in all things he was the antithesis of mr root the latter was large florid and decidedly handsomemr cherfeuil was little sallow and more than decidedly ugly mr root was worldly wise and very ignorant mr cherfeuil a fool in the world and very learned the mind of mr root was so empty that he found no trouble in arranging his one idea and a half mr cherfeuils was so full that there was no room for any arrangement at all mr root would have thought himself a fool if he condescended to write poetry but he supposed he could for he never tried mr cherfeuil would have thought any man a fool that did not perceive at once that he cherfeuil was born a great poet shall i carry after the manner of plutarch the comparison any further no let us bring it to an abrupt conclusion by saying in a few words that mr root was english mr cherfeuil french that the one had a large school and the other a little one and that both were immeasurably great men in their own estimationthough not universally so in that of others mr cherfeuil was ambitious to be thought five feet high his attitude therefore was always erect and to give himself an air of consequence he bridled and strutted like a fullbreasted pigeon with his head thrown back and was continually in the act of wriggling his long chin into his ample neckerchief he could not ask you how do you do or say in answer to that question i thank you sare very well without stamping prettily with his foot as if cracking a snail and tossing his chin into the air as if he were going to balance a ladder upon it then though his features were compressed into a small monkeyfied compass they were themselves individually upon a magnificent scale it was as if there had been crowded half a dozen gigantic specimens of human ugliness into my ladys china closet all of which were elbowing each other for room the eyes would have been called large had it not been for the vast proportions of the nose and the nose would have been thought preposterous had it not been for the horrible dimensions of the mouth yet the expression of all these anomalies though very grotesque was not unpleasing you smiled with satisfaction when you saw how great the improvement was that baboonery had made toward manhood you might call him in a word a queer little uglylooking box of yellow mortality that contained some amiable qualities and a great many valuable attainments of good sense or of common sense he was never known to show during the whole period of his life but one instance and that was a most important onea complete deference in all things to his stately and beautiful wife her dominion was undivided complete and unremitting how she came to marry him was one of those human riddles that will never be satisfactorily resolved he had been a french emigre had had a most superior education played on several instruments without taste understood everything connected with the classics but their beauty and was deeply versed in mathematics without comprehending their utility at this school my progress was rapid all the care and attention that the most maternal of hearts could bestow upon me were mine yet there was no approach to anything like familiarity on the part of mrs cherfeuil there lay a large wild common before the house there was a noble collection of deep water in the vicinity in which i perfected my natatory studies affected phraseology is the fashion and my body strengthened my mind improved and i began to taste of real happiness it would be amusing work to write a biography of some of the most remarkable ushers they seem to be the bats of the social scale gentlemen will not own them and the classes beneath reject them they are generally selfsufficient the dependency of their situation makes them mean and the exercise of delegated power tyrannical if they have either spirit or talent they lift themselves above their situation but when they cannot do this they are in my estimation the most abject of all classesgipsies and beggars not excepted mr cherfeuil was in himself a mine of learning but he delivered it out from the dark cavities of his mind encumbered with so much ore and in such misshaped masses that it required another person to arrange for use what he was so lavish in producing a good usher or assistant was therefore necessary but i do not recollect more than one out of the thirty or forty that came and went during the three years i was at the school this class of people are alas fatally susceptible of the tender impulses they always find the rosy cheeks of the housemaid or the en bon point of the cook irresistible and they have themselves such delicate soft hands so white and so ashy on sundays too their linen is generally clean so altogether the maidservants find them killing mr saltseller who found everything droll and who used to paint his cheeks lost his situation just at the precise moment that the housemaid lost her character two losses together were not of very great moment then we had another and another and another and more characters were losttill at last there did come a man take him for all in all i neer shall look upon his like again he was very tall stout of a pompous carriage un homme magnifique he wore a green coat false hair a black patch over his left eye and was fifty or rather fiftyfive his face was large round and the least in the world bloated this adonis of matured ushers after schoolhours would hang a guitar from his broad neck by means of a pale pink riband and walk up and down on the green before the house thrum thrum thrumming the admiration of all the little boys and the coveted of all the old tabbies in the village oh he was the beauideal of a vieux garcon we recommend all schoolassistants to learn the guitar and grow fatif they can and then perhaps they may prosper like mr sigismund pontifex he contrived to elope with a maiden lady of good property just ten years older than himself the sweet innocent indiscreet ones went off by stealth one morning before daylight in a chaiseandfour and returned a week after mr and mrs pontifex the gentleman hung up his guitar and for ever and every fine day he was found pipe in mouth and tankard in hand presiding at the bowlinggreen of the black lion the acknowledged and revered umpire cherished by mine host and referred to by the players i write this life for instruction gentlemen ushers look to itbe ambitiouslearn the guitar and make your mouths water with ideas of prospective tankards of ale and odoriferous pipes chapter twenty ralph groweth egregiously modest and boasteth immoderately until he is beaten by one with one foot in the grave with something touching the feats of the man without feet i find myself in a dilemma my modesty is at variance with my love of verity oh the inconvenience of that little pronoun i would that i had in the first instance imitated the wily conduct of the baldpated invader of britain how complacently might i not then have vaunted in the beginning have caracoled through the middle and glorified myself at the conclusion of this my autobiography what a monstrous piece of braggadocio would not caesars commentaries have been had he used the first instead of the third person singular how intolerable would have been the presumption of his thrasonical i thrashed the helvetiansi subjugated the germansi utterly routed the gaulsi defeated the painted britons and on the contraryfor i like to place heroes side by sidehow decorously and ingeniously might i not have written ralph rattlin blackened master simpkins left eyeralph rattlin led on the attack upon farmer russels orchard and ralph rattlin fought three rounds with no considerable disadvantage with the longlegged pieman alas i cannot even shelter myself under the mistiness of the peremptory we i have made a great mistake but i have this consolation in common with other great men that for our mistake the public will assuredly suffer more than ourselves many a choice adventure of which i was the hero must be suppressed i should blush myself black in the face to say what he would relate with a very quiet smile of selfsatisfaction however as regrets are quite unavailing unless like the undertakers they are paid for i shall exclaim with the french soldier who found his long military queue in the hands of a pursuing english sailor chivalry of the world toujours en avant i now began to commit the sin of much verse and consequently acquired in the neighbouring village much notice no chastising blow or even word of reproof fell upon me my mind was fed upon praise and my heart nourished with caresses in the school i had no equal and my vanity whispered that such was the case without however this vanity i did not show for i was humble from excessive pride there are two animals that are almost certain to be spoileda very handsome young man and the cock of the school being certainly in the latter predicament i was only saved from becoming an utter and egregious ass by the advent of one the cleverest most impudent rascally agreeable scoundrel that ever swindled man or deceived woman in the shape of a woodenlegged usher he succeeded my worthy friend of the guitar mr sigismund pontifex his name was riprapton and he only wanted the slight requisite of common honesty to have made himself the first man of any society in which fate might happen to cast himand fate had been pleased to cast him into a great many he was a short compactlymade symmetricallyformed man with a countenance deeply indented with the smallpox and in every hole there was visibly ensconced a little imp of audaciousness his eyes were such intrepid and quenchless lights of impudence that they could look even irish sang froid out of countenance and then that inimitable wooden leg it was a perfect grace as he managed it it was irresistible he did not progress with a miserable vulgar dotandgoone kind of gait he neither hopped nor halted nor limped and though he was wood from the middle of his right thigh downwards his walk might almost have been called the poetry of motion he never stumped but he stole along with a glissade that was the envy and admiration not exactly of surrounding nations but of the dancingmaster it was a beautiful study to see him walk and i made myself master of it the left leg was inimitably formed the calf was perhaps a little too round and hiberniana fault gracious in the eyes of the fair sex his ankle and foot were exquisitely small and delicately turned of course he always wore shorts with immaculate white cotton or silk stockings i shall not distinguish the two legs by the terms the living and the dead oneit would be as great an injustice to the carved as to the calfed onefor the former had a graceful life sui generis of its own i shall call them the pulsating and the gyrating leg and now proceed to describe how they bare along in a manner so fascinating the living tabernacle of mr riprapton the pulsator with pointed toe and gently turned calf would make a progress in a direct line but as the sole touched the ground the heel would slightly rise and then fall and whilst you were admiring the undulating grace of the pulsator unobserved and silently you would find the gyrator had stolen a march upon you and actually taken the pas of its fivetoed brother one leg marched and the other swam in the prettiest semicircle imaginable when he stopped the flourish of the gyrator was ineffable the drumstick in the hand of the big black drummer of the first regiment of footguards was nothing to it whenever riprapton bowedand he was always bowingthis flourish preluded and concluded the salutary bend it was making a leg indeed many a time both by ladies and gentlemen he has been offered a cork legbut he knew better had he accepted the treacherous gift he would have appeared but as a lame man with two legs now he was a perfect adonis with one i do believe in my conscience that cupid often made use of this wooden appendage when he wished to befriend him instead of one of his own arrows for he was really a marvellous favourite with the ladies well no sooner had my friend with the peg made himself a fixture in the school than he took me down not a peg or two but a good halfdozen he ridiculed my poetryhe undervalued my drawinghe hit me through my most approved guards at my fencinghe beat me hollow at hopping though it must be confessed that i had the advantage with two legs but he was again my master at allfours he outtalked me immeasurably he outbragged me most heroically and outlied me most inconceivably knowing nothing either of latin or greek they were beneath a gentlemans notice fit only for parsons and pedants and he was too patriotic to cast a thought away upon french as he was engaged for the arithmetical and mathematical departments it would have been perhaps as well if he had known a little of algebra and euclid but as from the first day he honoured me with a strict though patronising friendship he made me soon understand that we were to share this department of knowledge in common it was quite enough if one of the two knew anything about the matter besides he thought that it improved me so much to look over the problems and algebraical calculations of my schoolfellows with this man i was continually measuring my strength and as i conceived that i found myself woefully wanting he proved an excellent moral sedative to my else too rampant vanity few indeed were the persons who could feel themselves at ease under the withering sarcasms of his intolerable insolence much more to their astonishment than to their instruction he would very coolly and the more especially when ladies were present correct the divinity of the parson the pharmacy of the doctor and the law of the attorney and with that placid air of infallibility that carried conviction to all but his opponents once at a very large evening party i heard him arguing strenuously and very triumphantly against a veteran captain of a merchantship who had circumnavigated the world with cook that the degrees of longitude were equal in length all over the world be they more or lessfor he never descended to detailsand that the further south you sailed the hotter it grew though the worthy old seaman pointed to what remained of his nose the end of which had been nipped off by cold and consequent mortification in the antiarctic regions as riprapton flourished his wooden index in the midst of his brilliant peroration he told the honest seaman that he had not a leg to stand upon and all the ladies and some of the gentlemen too cried out with one accord o fie captain headman now dont be so obstinatesurely you are quite mistaken and the archmaster of impudence looked round with modest suavity and in an audible whisper assured the gentleman that sat next to him that captain headmans argument of the demolished proboscis went for nothing for that there were other causes equally efficacious as cold and frost for destroying gentlemens noses in the sequel this very learned tutor had to instruct me in navigation nothing was too high or too low for him had any persons wished to have taken lessons in judicial astrology mr riprapton would not have refused the pupil plausible ignorance will always beat awkward knowledge when the ignorant which is generally the case make up the mass of the audience chapter twenty one treateth of the amativeness of wooden members and the folly of virgin frightsralph putteth his threat of versifying into actual execution for which he may be thought worthy of being executed notwithstanding the superciliousness of my friendly assistant i still wrote verse which was handed about the village as something wonderful as riprapton doubted or rather denied my rhyming prowess at length i was determined to try it upon himself and he shortly gave me an excellent opportunity for so doing writers who pride themselves on going deeply into the mysteries of causes and effects will tell you that in cold weather people are apt to congregate about the fire our usher and a circle of admiring pupils were one day establishing the truth of this profound theory the timbered man was standing in the apex of the semicircle his back to the fireplace and his coattails tucked up under his arms he was enjoying himself and we were enjoying him he was the hero of the tale he was telling usindeed he never had any other hero than himselfand this tale was wonderful in the energy of delivery now the leg of wood would start up with an egotistical flourish and describe with the leg of flesh a rightangled triangle and then down would go the peg and up the leg with the toe well pointed whilst he greeted the buckle on his foot with an admiring glance whilst this was proceeding in the schoolroom in the backkitchen or rather breakfastparlour immediately below in a very brown study there sate a very fair lady pondering deeply over the virtues of brimstone and treacle and the most efficacious antidote to chilblains she was the second in command over the domestic economy of the school unmarried of course and ever and anon as she plied the industrious needle over the heel of the too fragmental stocking the low melody would burst unconsciously forth of is there nobody coming to marry me nobody coming to woooooo lady not in vain was the burden of that votive song there was somebody coming let us walk upstairsmr rip is in the midst of his narrativespeaking thusand young gentlemen as i hate presumption and can never tolerate a coxcomb perceiving that his lordship was going to be insolent up went thus my foot to chastise him and down a crash a cry of alarm and behold the chastiser of insolence or at least that part of him that was built of wood through the floor monsieur cherfeuil opening the door at this moment and hearing a great noise and not perceiving him who ought to have repressed it for the boys standing round what remained of him with us it was concealed from the worthy pedagogue who exclaimed vat a noise be here vere ist mr reepraaptong just stepped down below to miss brocade in the breakfastparlour i replied ah bah cest un veritable chevalier aux dames said monsieur cherfeuil and slamming to the door he hurried downstairs to reclaim his too gallant representative we allowed mr riprapton to inhabit for some time two floors at once for he was in his position perfectly helpless that admired living leg of his stretched out at its length upon the floor we soon however recovered him but so much i cannot

of dust and when the mist clears away there pointed down from above an inexplicable index her senses were bewildered and being quite at a loss to comprehend the miracle she had nothing else to do but faint away when monsieur cherfeuil entered the simple and goodnatured gaul found his beloved manageress apparently lifeless at his feet covered with the debris of his ceiling and the wooden leg of his usher slightly tremulous above him the fright of course was succeeded by a laugh and the fracture by repairs and the whole by the following schoolboy attempt at a copy of verses upon the nevertobe forgotten occasion ambitious usher there are few beyond you that can go in double character to woo the lovely nymph below at once both god and man you ape to expedite your flame and yet you find in either shape the failure just the same jove fell in fair danaes lap in showers of glittering gold by jove his joveship was no sap how could you be so bold to hope to have a like success most sapient ciphering master and think a ladys lap to bless with showrs of lath and plaster that you should fail when you essayd to act the god of thunder in striving to enchant the maid was really no great wonder but when as man you wooing go pray let me ask you whether you had no better leg to show than one of wood and leather these verses are exactly as i wrote them and i trust the reader will not think that i could now be guilty of such a line as to expedite your flame or of the pedantic schoolboyism of calling a housekeeper nymph in fact it is by the merest accident that i am now enabled to give them in their genuine shape an old schoolfellow whom i have not seen since the days of syntax and whose name i had utterly forgotten enclosed them to me very lately however such as they are they were thought in a secluded village as something extraordinary the usher himself affected to enjoy them extremely they added greatly to my reputation and what was of more consequence to me my invitations to dinner and to tea truly my halfholidays were no longer my own i had become an object of curiosity and i hope and believe in many instances of affection i was quite cured of my mendacious propensities by the pain the horror and the disgust that they had inflicted upon me at my last school i invented no more mysteries and improbabilities for myself but my goodnatured friends did it amply for me mrs cherfeuil asserted she knew scarcely anything about meindeed before i came to her school she had hardly seen me four times during the whole space of my existence she only knew that i was the child of a lady that accident had thrown in her way a lady whom she knew but shortly but for whom she acquired a friendship as strong as it proved short that from mere sympathy she had been induced to stand godmother to me that she had never felt authorised nor did she inquire into the particulars of my birth of course there was a mystery attached to it but to which she had no clue however she knew that at least on one side i came of good nay very distinguished parentage but this her departed friend assured her and that most solemnly that whoever should stigmatise me as illegitimate would do me a grievous wrong here was a subject to be canvassed in a gossiping village conjecture was at its busy work i was quite satisfied with the place that the imaginations of my hospitable patrons had given me in the social scale nor in the country only did i experience this friendly feeling most of my vacations were spent in town at the houses of the parents of some of my schoolfellows i was now made acquainted with the scenic glories of the stage i fought my way through crowds of fools to see a child perform the heroic coriolanus the philosophical hamlet and the venerable and magnificent lear master betty was at the height of his reputation and the dignified and classical kemble had for a time to veil his majestic countenance from the playgoing eye deeply

the welldirected munificence of a family a parallel to which can only be found in our soila superior nowhere by the heads of this family i was honoured with particular notice perhaps they never gave a thought about my poetical talent or the wonderful progress that my master said that i had made in my classics and my woodenlegged tutor in my mathematics their kind patronage sprang from higher motivesfrom benevolence they had heard that i had been forsakentheir own hearts told them that the sunshine of kindness must be doubly grateful to the neglected and indeed to me they were very kind perhaps it may be thought that i had a quick eye to the failings and the ridiculous points of those with whom chance threw me in contact i am sure that i was equally susceptible to the elevation of character that was offered to me in the person of mr the respected father of the family of which i have just made mention as the noble class to which he belonged and of which he was the first ornament are fast degenerating i will endeavour to make a feeble portrait of a man that at present finds but too few imitators and that could never have found a superior he was one of those few merchant princes who are really in all things princely whilst his comprehensive mind directed the commerce of half a navy and sustained in competence and happiness hundreds at home and thousands abroad the circle immediately around him felt all the fostering influence of his welldirected liberality as if all the energies of his powerful genius had been concentrated in the object of making those only about him prosperous he was born for the good of the many as much as for the elevation of the individual society had need of him and it confessed it when its interests were invaded by a shortsighted policy it called upon his name to advocate its violated rights and splendidly did he obey the call he understood englands power and greatness for he had assisted in increasing it he knew in what consisted her strength and in that strength he was strong and in his own as a senator he was heard in the assembled councils of his nation and those who presided over her mighty resources and influenced her destinies that involved those of the world listened to his warning counsel were convinced that his words were the dictates of wisdom and obeyed this is neither fiction nor fulsome panegyric the facts that i narrate have become part of our history and i would narrate them more explicitly did i not fear to wound the susceptibilities of his still existing and distinguished family how well he knew his own station and preserved with the blandest manners the true dignity of it though renowned in parliament for his eloquence at the palace for his patriotic loyalty and in the city for his immense wealth in the blessed circle that he truly made social there was a pleasing simplicity and joyousness of manner that told at once the fascinated guest that though he might earn honours and distinction abroad it was at home that he looked for happinessand uncommon as such things are in this repining worldthere i verily believe he found it his was a happy lot he possessed a lady in his wife who at once shared his virtues and adorned them the glory he won was reflected sweetly upon her and she wore with dignity and enhanced those honours that his probity his talents and his eloquence had acquired at the time of which i am speaking he was blessed with daughters that even in their childhood had made themselves conspicuous by their accomplishments amiability of disposition and gracefulness of manners and plagued with sons who were full of wildness waggishness and worth it is too seldom the case that the person accords with the high qualification of the mind mr was a singular and felicitous exception to this mortifying rule his deportment was truly dignified his frame wellknit and robust and his features were almost classically regular his complexion was florid and the expression of his countenance serene yet highly intelligent no doubt but that his features were capable of a vast range of expression but as i never saw them otherwise than beaming with benevolence or sparkling with wit i must refer to master james or master frank for the description of the austerity of his frown or the awfulness of his rebuke this gentlemans two elder sons at the time to which i allude had already made their first step in the world james was making a tour of the west indies the continent being closed against him and frank had already begun his harvest of laurels in the navy under a distinguished officer the younger sons my juniors were my schoolfellows master frank was two or three years my senior and before he went to sea not going to the same school as myself we got together only during the vacations when notwithstanding my prowess he would fag me desperately at cricket outswim me on the lake and outcap me at making latin verses however i consoled myself by saying as i grow older all this superiority will cease but when he returned after his first cruise glittering in his graceful uniform my hopes and my ambition sank below zero he was already a man and an officeri a schoolboy and nothing else of course he had me home to spend the day with himand a day we had of it it was in the middle of summer and grapes were ripe only in such wellregulated hothouses as were mr s we did not enact the wellknown fable as it is writtenthe grapes were not too sournor did we repeat the foxs illnatured and sarcastic observation that they were only fit for blackguards we found them very good for gentlementhough i fear mr s dessert some time after owed more to pomona than to bacchus for its embellishments and the fine mulberrytree on the lawnwe were told that it must be shaken and we shook it if it still exist ill answer for it it has never been so shaken since the next day we went fishing though our bodies were not yet fully grown we were persons of enlarged ideas and to suppose that we two mercurial spirits could sit like a couple of noodles each with a long stick in our hands waiting for the fish to pay us a visit was the height of absurdity no we were rather too polite for that and as it was we and not the gentlemen of the finny tribe that sought acquaintance we felt it our duty as gentlemen to visit them we carried our politeness still further and showed our good breeding in endeavouring to accommodate ourselves to the tastes and habits of those we were about to visit do at rome as the romans do is the essence of all politeness as our friends were accustomed to be in naturalibusvulgice stark naked we adopted their adamite fashion and undressing in we plunged our success was greater with the finny than was that of any exquisite with the fair tribe we captivated and captured pailfuls we drove our entertainers into the narrow creeks in shoals and then with a net extended between us we had the happiness of introducing them into the upper air the sport was so good that we were induced to continue it for some hours but whilst we were preparing for a multitudinous fry the sun was actually all the while enjoying a most extensive broil our backs and mine especially became one continuous blister whilst in the water and in the pursuit i did not regard itindeed we were able to carry home the trophies of our successand theni hastened to bed my back was fairly peeled and repeeled i performed involuntarily mr saint johns curative process to a miracle no wonder that ive been ever since free from all even the slightest symptoms of pulmonary indisposition however my excruciating torments gained me two thingsexperience and a new skin when i had fresh skinned myselfand it took me more than a week to do iti found that my fellowlabourer had flown i heard that he had suffered almost as severely as myself but as he looked upon himself as no vulgar hero he was too manly to complain and next sunday he actually went to church whilst i lay in bed smarting with painyet i strongly suspect that a new sword that he had that day to hang by his side made him regardless to the misery of his back that sunday fortnight i dined with mr and of course he did me the honour to converse upon our fishing exploit and its painful consequences so master rattlin said the worthy gentleman you think that you and frank proved yourselves excellent sportsmen yes sir said i i will answer for the sports if you will only be pleased to answer for the men well said my little man said mrs to me smiling kindly you see sir with all submission ive gained the verdict of the lady and thats a great deal but i think you lost your hide was your back very sore said my host encouragingly o dearvery sore indeed sir mrs cherfeuil said that it looked quite like a newlycut steak o it did did it but franks was not much better said the senator turning to his lady indeed it was not said she compassionately very well said mr very quietly ill tell you this master rattlin sportsmen as you think yourselves you and frank after all whatever you both were when you went into the lake you turned out two johnny raws why master rattlin said the lady mr uses you worse than the sunthat did but scorchbut he roasts you no wonder madam as he considers me raw replied i chapter twenty three reminiscencesa friend found and a line lostralph makes a new acquaintance and a hearty supper both of which do him much good openly admired abroad and secretly cherished by a love the more intense because concealed at home the course of my days was as happy as the improvement in the various branches of my education was rapid nor was i wholly unnoticed by men who have since stood forward honoured characters in the van of those who have so nobly upheld the fame of england the bard who began his career in the brightest fields of hope and whose afterfame has so well responded to his auspicious commencement read many portions of my boyish attempts and pronounced them full of promise and the author possessed of nous it was the term he himself used and that is the only reason why i have recorded it indeed this deservedly great man was in some sense my schoolfellow for he came in the evening to learn french of monsieur cherfeuil he was then engaged to translate an epic written by one of the buonapartes into english verse i believe that engagement never was carried into effect notwithstanding the erudite pains mr took to qualify himself to perform it successfully no man could have laboured more to make himself master of the niceties of the gallic idiom and the right use of its very doubtful subjunctive at the time to which i allude the inspired author wore a wignot that his then age required one perhaps the fervid state of his brain like a hidden volcano burnt up the herbage aboveperhaps his hair was falling off from the friction of his laurelsperhaps growing prematurely grey from the workings of his spirit but without venturing upon any more conjectures we may safely come to the conclusion that the hair that god gave him did not please him so well as that which he bought of the perruquiers since we cannot be satisfied with the causes we must be satisfied with the facthe wore a wig and in the distraction of mental perplexity when monsieur cherfeuil was essaying to get the poet out of the absent into the conditional mood the man of verse staring abstractedly upon the man of tense would thrust his hand under his peruke and rub rub rub his polished scalp which all the while effused a divine ichorpoets never perspireand when he was gently reminded that his wig was a little awry towards the left side he would pluck it resentfully equally as much awry on the right and then to punish the offending and displacing hand he would commence gnawing off the nails of his fingers rich with the moisture from above we have recorded this little personal trait because it may be valuable to the gentlemans future biographers and also because it is a convincing proof to the illiterate and the leveller that headwork is not such easy sofaenjoyed labour as is commonly supposed and finally that the great writers habit vivos ungues rodere proves him to be tooth and nail homo ad unguem factus i feel also that there are many other persons to whom i ought to pay a passing tribute of gratitude for much kindness shown to me but as my first duty is to my readers i must not run the risk of wearying them even by the performance of a virtue but there was one to omit the mention of whom would be on my part the height of ingratitude and as concerns the public something very like approaching to a fraud for by the implied contract between it and me i am in this my autobiography bound to supply them with the very best materials served up to them in my very best manner the gentleman whom i am going to introduce to the notice of my readers was the purest personation of benevolence that perhaps ever existed his countenance was a glowing index of peace with himself goodwill to man and confidence in the love of god there was within him that divine sympathy for all around him that brings man in what man can alone emulate the angels so near to his creator but with all this goodness of soul there was nothing approaching to weakness or even misjudging softness he had seen had known and had struggled with the world he left the sordid strife triumphantly and bore away with him if not a large fortune a competence and what also was of infinitely more value that peace of mind which passeth all understanding mr r was in his person stout tall florid in his countenance and for a man past fifty the handsomest that i have ever beheld i do not mean to say that his features possessed a classical regularity but that soul of benevolence transpired through and was bound up with them that had a marble bust fitly representing them been handed down to posterity from some masterhand of antiquity we should have reverenced it with awe as something beyond human nature and gazed on it at the same time with love as being so dearly and sweetly human these are not the words of enthusiasm but a mere narrative of fact he wore his own white and thin hair that was indeed so thin that the top of his head was quite bald a snuffcoloured coat cut in the olden fashion kneebreeches white lambswool stockings and shoes of rather high quarters gave a little of the primitive to his highly respectable appearance i first saw him as he was pretending to angle in the river that runs through the village immediately i had gazed upon his benignant countenance i went and sat down by him i could not help it at once i understood the urbanity and the gentlemanliness that must have existed in the patriarchal times there was no need of forms between us he made room for me as a son and i looked up to him as to a father he smiled upon me so encouragingly and so confidently that i found myself resting my arm upon his knee with all the loving familiarity of longtried affection from that first moment of meeting until his heart lay cold in the graveand cold the grave alone could make ita singular unswerving and on my part an absorbing love was between us we remained for a space in this caressing position in silence my eyes now drinking in the rich hues of the evening now the mental expression of the good old man oh it is very beautiful said i thinking as much of his mild face as of the gorgeousness of the sky above me and do you feel it said he yes i see you do by your glistening eyes and heightened colour i feel very happy i replied and have just now two very very strange wishes and i dont know which i wish for most what are they my little friend o you will laugh at me so if i tell you no i will not indeed i never laugh at anybody ah i was almost sure of that well i was wishing when i looked up into the sky that i could fly through and through those beautiful clouds like an eagle and when i looked at you i wished that i were just such a goodnatured old gentleman come come there is more flattery than good sense in your wishes your first is unreasonable and your second will come upon you but too soon i did not mean to flatter you i replied looking proudly for i would neither be an eagle nor an old man longer than those beautiful clouds last and the warm sunset makes your face look soso never mindyou shall save your fine speeches for the young ladies but ive got some for the gentlemen too and theres one running in my head just now i should like to hear it should you well this fine evening put me in mind of it it is mrs barbaulds ode and then putting myself into due attitude i mouthed it through much to my own and still more to mr rs satisfaction that was a curious a simple and yet a cheering scene my listener was swaying to and fro with the cadences of the poetry i with passionate fervour ranting before him and in the meantime his rod and line unnoticed by either were navigating peacefully yet rapidly down the river when i had concluded his tackle was just turning an eddy far down below us and the next moment was out of sight without troubling ourselves much about the loss shortly after we were seen hand in hand walking down the village in earnest conversation i went home with himi shared with him and his amiable daughters a light and early supper of fruit and pastry and such was the simultaneous affection that sprang up between usso confiding was it in its nature and so little worldly that i had gained the threshold and was about taking my leave ere it occurred to him to ask or myself to say who i was and where i resided from that evening excepting when employed in my studies we were almost inseparable i told him my strange story and he seemed to love me for it a hundredfold more he laid all the nobility and even the princes of the blood under contribution to procure me a father he came to the conclusion firmly and at once that mrs cherfeuil was my mother oh this mystery made him superlatively happy and when he came to the knowledge of my poetical talents he was really in an ecstasy of delight he rhymed himself he gave me subjectshe gave me advicehe gave me emendations and interpolations he reyouthed himself in many a sequestered nook in the beautiful vicinity of the village we have sat each with his pencil and paper in his handnow ranting now conversingand in his converse the instruction i received was invaluable he has confirmed me in the doctrine of the innate goodness of human nature since the period to which i am alluding i have seen much of villainy i have been the victim as well as the witness of treachery i have been oftentimes forced to associate with vice in every shape and yet when in misery when oppressed when writhing under tyranny i have been sometimes tempted to curse my race the thought of the kind the good old man has come over me like a visitation from heaven and my malediction has been changed into a prayer if not into a blessing chapter twenty four a disaster by water is the first cause of all ralphs future disasters upon ithe gets with his tutor out of his depth in latitude and longitude and finds himself rivalled by the man with the peg of course mr r sought and soon gained the friendship of mrs cherfeuil and then he commenced operations systematically now he would endeavour to take her by surprisenow to overcome by entreatyand then to entrap by the most complex cross questions he would be by turns tender gallant pathetic insinuating but all was of no availher secret whatever it was was firmly secured in her own bosom with wellacted simplicity she gave my worthy friend the same barren account about me that was at the service of all interrogators what poems did not mr r and myself write togetherhow he prophesied my future greatness and how fervently he set about to convince anyone of the mistake who could not see in me the future glory of the age the good man his amiable selfdeception was to him the source of the purest happiness and never was happiness more deserved even at that early age i often could not help smiling at his simplicity that all the while he was doing his best to make me one of the vainest and most egregious coxcombs by his unfeigned wonder at some puny effort of my puny muse and by his injudicious praises he would lecture me parentally by the hour upon the excellence of humility and the absolute necessity of modesty as a principal ingredient to make a great character however i had my correction at home in my woodenlegged preceptor if i returned from rs in my own imagination like poor gil blas the eighth wonder of the world he would soon in his own refined phraseology convince me that i was no great shakes being now nearly sixteen i began to make conjectures upon my future destiny and a sorrowful accident at once determined in what line i should make my ineffectual attempts upon fame i have mentioned a noble piece of water that lay adjacent to the school it was during the holidays when the rest of the young gentlemen were at their respective homes that i accompanied by some young acquaintances who resided in the village repaired to the water to swim it was a fine summer afternoon and both mr and mrs cherfeuil were in town there was a little boy named fountain also staying with me at school during the vacation and he too stole after us unperceived and when i and my companions had swam to middle of the lake the imprudent little fellow also stripped and went into the water there were some idle stragglers looking on and when i was far very far from the sport the fearful shout came along the level surface of help help he is drowning and with dreadful distinctness as if the voice had been shrieked into my very ears i heard the poor lads bubbling and smothered cry of ralph rattlin poor fellow he thought there was safety wherever i was for i had often borne him over the lake out of his depth as i taught him to swim at which art he was still too imperfect i immediately turned to the place and strove and buffeted and panted but the distance was great and though a rapid and most expert swimmer when i arrived at the spot that the lookerson indicated not a circle not a ruffle appeared to show where a human soul was struggling beneath to free itself from its mortal clay four or five times i dived and stayed below the water with desperate pertinacity and ploughed up the muddy bottom but they had pointed out to me the wrong spot finding my efforts useless naked as i was with the fleetness of a greyhound i started into the village and gave the alarm and immediately that i saw the people running to the lake i was there before them and again diving mrs the lady of the mp whom i have before mentioned who was always the foremost in every work of humanity was soon on the banks accompanied by many of the most respectable inhabitants in the vicinity mrs who never lost her presence of mind immediately suggested that a boat that lay on the neighbouring river and which belonged to the landlord of the principal inn should be conveyed on mens shoulders across the space of land that divided one water from the other the landlord refusedyes actually refused but mrs who from her station and her many virtues possessed a merited and commanding influence in the place ordered the boat to be taken by force and she was promptly and cheerfully obeyed whilst this was going forward i was astonishing everybody by the length of time i stayed underneath the water and a last effort almost proved fatal to me for when i arose the blood gushed from my mouth and nose and when i got on shore i felt so weak that i was obliged to be assisted in dressing my self the boat now began to sweep the bottom with ropes but this proved as ineffectual to recover the body as were my own exertions it was the next day before it was found and then it was brought up by a newfoundland dog very far from the spot in which we had searched for it had the frightened spectators who stood on the shore shown me correctly where the lad had disappeared i have no doubt but that i should have brought the body in time for resuscitation to persons who have not seen what can be done by those who make water in a manner their own element my boyish exertions seemed almost miraculous my good old friend was present betraying a curious mixture of fear and admiration big as i then was he almost carried me in his arms home that is to the schoolhouse and there we found all in confusion mrs cherfeuil had just arrived and hearing that one of the boys was drowned had given one painful shriek and fainted when we came into the room she was still in a state of insensibility and as we stood around she slowly opened her eyes but the moment that they became conscious of my presence she leaped up with frantic joy and strained me in her arms and then laying her head upon my shoulder burst into a passion of tears mr r cast upon me a most triumphant smile and as he led me away from the agitated lady she took a silent farewell of me with a look of intense fondness and a depth of ineffable felicity which i hope will be present to me in my dying hour for assuredly it will make light the parting pang this affair changed the whole current of mr rs ideas and altered his plans for me i was no longer to be the future poetlaureate i was no more enticed to sing great deeds but to do them the sword was to displace the pen the hero the poet verse was too effeminate and rhyme was severely interdicted and to be forgiven only when it was produced by accident he was some time before he brought mrs cherfeuil over to his opinions it was in vain that she protested the direction of my fate was in other hands he would not listen to it for a moment he was obstinate and i suppose by what occurred he was in the right he declared that the navy was the only profession that deserved my spirit and my abilities this declaration perhaps was not unacceptable at headquarters wherever they might have been for myself i was nothing loath and the gallant bearing and the graceful uniform of my gallant young friend frank who had already seen some hard fighting added fresh stimulants to my desires my friend riprapton had now the enviable task to impart to me the science of navigation and with his peculiar notions of longitude and latitude there can be no question as to the merits of the tuition that i received from that very erudite person shortly after i had commenced navigation under his auspicesor more properly speaking that he was forced to attend to it a little under minethe harmony of our friendship was broken by a quarrel yes a heartembroiling quarreland strange to say about a lady i concede to this paragon of ushers that he was a general favourite with the sex i was never envious of him all the world knows that i ever did sufficient honour to his attractionsi acknowledged always the graces that appertained to his wooden progressionbut still he was not omnipotent wilkes that epitome of all manner of ugliness often boasted that he was only an hour behind the handsomest man that ever existed so far as regarded his position with the fair rip was but twentyfive minutes and a fraction in ten minutes he would talk the generality of women into a good opinion of themselvesan easy matter some may think for the ladies have one ready made but it is a different thing from having it and daring to own it in ten minutes he would make his listener by some act or word avow her opinion of her own excellence in ten more he would bring her to the same opinion as regarded himself and the remaining five he used to occupy with his declaration of love for he was very rapid in his executionand the thing was done for if he had not made a conquest he chronicled oneand that was the same thing he looked more for the glory than the fruition of his passions in one respect he followed chesterfields advice with wonderful accuracy he hazarded a declaration of love to every woman between sixteen and sixty a little under and over also for with his lordship he came to the very pertinent conclusion that if the act were not taken as a sincerity it would be as a compliment this readymade adorer for every newcomer was as jealous as he was universal in his attachments let the imaginative think and running over with their minds eye all the beautiful sculptures of antiquity endeavour to picture to themselves a personation of that commanding goddess that the ancients venerated under the title of juno the figure must be tall in proportion faultless in majesty unrivalled in grace enchanting all the outlines of the form must be full yet not swelling and as far removed from the modern notions of en bon point as possible let us add to these the bust of venus ere she weaned her firstborn the winged boygod and then we may have an adequate idea of the figure of mrs causand her face was of that style of beauty that those women who think themselves delicate are pleased to slander under the name of bolda style of beauty however that all men admire and most men like thirtyfive years had only written in a stronger hand those attractions which must have undergone every phase of loveliness and which now without appearing matronly seemed stamped with the signs of a longenduring maturity the admiration she excited was general as she passed men paused to look upon her and women whispered to each other behind her back never till this paragon had made her appearance had i heard of ladies wearing supposititious portions of the human framenow i found that envy or the figuremaker had improved almost every member of mrs causands body it was voted by all the female scandal of the village that such perfection could not be natural but since if all were true that was said upon the subject the object of their criticism must have been as artificial as mr ripraptons left leg and she must have been nothing more than an animated layfigure i began to disbelieve these assertions the more especially as the lady herself was as easy under them as she was in every gesture and motion whenever she made her appearance so did my old friend mr r he entertained a platonic attachment for her and that the more strongly as each visit enabled him to entertain every one who would listen to him with a long story about the king of prussia and every lady expects attention and politeness as a matter of course equally as a matter of course did she expect the assiduities and some manifestation even stronger than gallantry and treated it merely as a matter of course really without an hyperbole she was a woman to whom an appearance of devotion might be excusable and looked upon more as a tribute to the abstract spirit of beauty and its divine creator than as a sensual testimony to the individual her first appearance even silenced the hitherto dauntless loquacity of ripfor half a minute but he made fearful amends for this involuntary display of modesty afterwards secundum artem he opened all the batteries of his fascination upon her he rolled his eyes at her with a violence approaching to agony he bowed he displayed in every possible and captivating attitude his one living legbut his surpassing strength was in the adulation of his serpent tongueand she bore it all so stoically she would smile upon him when he made a good hit as upon an actor on the boardsshe would at times even condescend to improve some of his compliments upon herself and when her easy manners had perchance overset him at the very debut of one of his finest speeches she would begin it again for him taking up the dropped sentence and then settle herself into a complacent attitude for listening chapter twenty five evidences of good taste in favour of master ralphjealousy ushers in revenge revenge retaliation which he is compelled to chronicle on the ushers face and what punishment thereupon ensued when mrs causand came to stickenham she made universal jubilee the orderly routine of scholastic life had no longer place she almost ruined riprapton in clean linen perfumes and windsor soap cards and music enlivened every evening and the games she played were those of the fashion of the day and she always played high and always won her ascendancy over mrs cherfeuil was complete the latter was treated with much apparent affection but still with the airs of a patroness i do not know that the handsome schoolmistress lent her money for i do not think that she stood in need of it but i feel assured that her whole property was at her disposal she stood in awe of her she knew her secret with his usual acuteness my good old friend discovered this immediately and he began to woo her also more for her secret than for her heart but she was a perfect mysteryi never knew till her death who she was her residence was at no time mentioned and i believe that no one knew it but the lady of the house and myself when mrs causand herself gave it me at the eve of my departing for my ship she came without notice stayed as long as she chose and departed with an equal disregard to ceremony she loved me to a folly she would hold me at her knees by the hour and scan every feature of my countenance as ophelia said of hamlet as she would draw it and then she smiled and looked grave and sighed and laughed and i like a little fool set all these symptoms of perturbation down to my own unfledged attractions whilst during their perusal she would often exclaim so like himso like him i do not know whether i ought to mention it for it is a censorious world but as i cannot enter into or be supposed to understand the feelings of a fine woman of thirtyfive caressing a lad of fifteen i have a right to suppose all such demonstrations of fondness highly virtuous and purely maternal though perhaps to the fair bestower a little pleasant i found them exquisitely so i bore all her little blandishments with a modest pleasure for observing the high respect in which she was generally held i looked upon these testimonials of affection as a great honour sought them with eagerness and remembered them with gratitude manner is perhaps more seducing than mere beauty but where they are allied the captivation is irresistible that subduing alliance was to be found in perfection in the person of mrs causand as she always dressed up to the very climax of the fashion possessed a great variety of rich bijouterie and never came down to us in the stage but always posted it i concluded that she was in very easy circumstances i cannot speak as to the extent of her mental powers as her surface was so polished and dazzling that the eye neither could nor wished to look more deeply into her i believe that she had no other accomplishment but that gorgeous cloak for all deficiencyan inimitable manner her remarks were always shrewd and replete with good sense her language was choice her style of conversation varying sometimes of that joyous nature that has all the effect without the pedantry of wit upon the hearer and at times she could be really quite energetic this is after all but an imperfect description of one who took upon herself the task of forming my address revising my gait after the dancingmaster and making me to look the gentleman this person quite destroyed ripraptons equanimity during her three or four first visits he was all hope and animation she permitted him as she did everybody else as far as words were concerned to make love as fast as he pleased but beyond this even his intrepid assurance could not carry him so his hope and animation gradually gave place to incertitude and chagrin and then by a very natural transition he fell into envy and jealousy though but fifteen i was certainly taller than the man who thought he honoured me by considering me as his rival though affairs remained in this unsatisfactory state so far as he was concerned for certain very valid reasons he had not yet chosen to vent upon me any access of his spleen but this procrastination of actual hostilities was terminated in the following manner mrs causand and i were standing one fine evening lovingly side by side in the summerhouse that overhung the river at the bottom of the garden mr riprapton washed brushed and perfumedfor the scholastic duties of the day were overwas standing directly in front of us enacting most laboriously the agreeable smiling with a sardonic grin and looking actually yellow with spite in the midst of his complimentary grimaces as mrs causand and i stood contemplating the tranquil and beautiful scene trying to see as little of the person before us as possible one of her beautiful arms hung negligently over my shoulder and now she would draw me with a fond pressure to her side and now her exquisite hand would dally with the ringlets on my forehead and then its velvety softness would crumple up and indent my blushing cheek that burned certainly more with pleasure than with bashfulness i cannot say that the usher bore all this very stoically but he betrayed his annoyance by his countenance only his speech was as bland as ever his trials were not yet over at some very silly remark of mine the joyous widow pressed some halfdozen rapid kisses on the cheek that was glowing so near her own either this act emboldened riprapton or he egregiously mistook her character and judged that a mere voluptuary stood before him for he immediately went on the vacant side and endeavoured to possess himself of her hand face neck and arms flushed up in one indignant crimson of the most unsophisticated anger i ever beheld she threw herself back with a perceptible shudder as if she had come unexpectedly in contact with something cold or dead or unnatural mr riprapton she exclaimed after a space of real emotion i have never yet boxed the ears of a gentleman but had you been one i should most assuredly have so far forgotten my feminine dignity as to have expressed my deep resentment by a blow i cannot touch anything so mean while you confined your persecutions to words i bore with it sir i only speak from my own sensations but judging by these any female who could abide your touch without repugnance must have long lost all womanly feelings and now that we are upon this subject let me give you a little friendly advice when you are permitted to sit at the same table with ladies and wish by the means of your feet to establish a secret intercourse with anyone take care in future that you do not use the wooden leg females may be more tender in their toes than in their hearts you may go sir and remember if you wish to preserve your station in this houseknow it when you behave as a gentleman that title may be conceded to you but the moment your conduct is inconsistent with that character those around you will not forget that you are no more than a hired servant and but one degree above a menial here ralph she continued giving me the violated hand cleanse it from that fellows profanation i brought it to my mouth very gallantly and covered it with kisses for the first time i saw my usherfriend not only confounded but dumb with consternation and his whitened face became purple even into the depths of his deep pockmarks with an emotion that no courtesy could characterise as amiable he moved off with none of his usual grace but retired like a very common place woodenlegged man in a truly miserable dotandgoone style what mrs causand and i said to each other on the subject when she went and seated herself in the summerhouse to recover from her excitement would i am sure have formed the groundwork and arguments of twelve good moral essays but unfortunately i have forgotten everything about it except that we stayed there till not only the dews had fallen upon the flowers but the shades of evening upon the dews as my stay at school was to be so short i was treated more as a familiar friend by all than as a pupil i stayed up with the family and took tea and supper with them rip made no appearance the evening after his lecture but retired to his chamber much indisposed while mrs causand was on her visit i always breakfasted with her teteatete in the little parlour whose french windows opened upon the garden and it was on those occasions that i found her most amusing she knew everyone and everything connected with fashionable life private and piquant and i am sure authentic anecdotes of every noble family she possessed in an exhaustless profusion nor was this knowledge confined to the nobility she knew more of the sayings and doings of some of the princes of the blood than any other person living out of their domestic circle and she knew many things with which that circle were never acquainted i am sure she could have made splendid fortunes for twelve fashionable novelwriters i had breakfasted with mrs causand in the morning after rips discomfiture and then went to prosecute my studies in the schoolroom this was the first time that my tutor and i had met since his rebuff monsieur cherfeuil had not yet taken his place at his desk as i passed the assistant who assisted me so little i gave him my usual smile of greeting but his countenance instead of the goodhumoured return was black as evil passions could make it however i paid but little attention to this unfriendly demonstration and taking my seat began as i was long privileged to do to converse with my neighbour silence vociferated the man in authority i conversed on silence i say not supposing that i was included in this authoritative demand or not caring if i were i felt no inclination to suspend the exercise of my conversational powers after the third order for silence this sudden disciple of harpocrates left his seat cane in hand and coming behind me i dreaming of no such temerity on his part he applied across my shoulders one of the most hearty con amore swingers that ever left a wale behind it exclaiming at the same time silence master rattlin here was a stinging degradation to me almost an officer on the quarterdeck of one of his majestys frigates however without taking time to weigh exactly my own dignity i seized a large slate and turning sharply round sent it hissing into his very teeth i wish i had knocked one or two of them out i wished it then fervently and of that wish wicked though it be i have never repented he was for some time occupied with holding his hand to his mouth and in a rapid and agonising examination of the extent of the damage when he could spare an instant for me he was as little satisfied with the expression of my features as with the alteration in his so he hopped down to monsieur cherfeuil while the blood was streaming between his fingers to lay his complaint in form against me i had two sure advocates below so he took nothing by his motion but a lotion to wash his mouth with and after staying below for a couple of hours he came up with a swelled face but his teeth all perfect that morning monsieur cherfeuil in very excellent bad english made a most impressive speech the pith of it was that had i not taken the law into my own hands he would most certainly have discharged mr riprapton for having exceeded his authority in striking me but as my conduct had been very unjustifiable i was sentenced to transcribe the whole of the first book of the aeneid before dinner my schoolfellows had begged off onehalf of the taskmrs cherfeuil at dinner begged off onehalf of that half when things had gone thus far mrs causand interfered and argued for a commutation of punishment the more especially as she thought an example ought to be made for so heinous an offence as she spake with a very serious air the goodnatured frenchman acquiesced in her wishes and pledged himself to allow her to inflict the penalty which she promulgated to the following effect that i should be forced to swallow an extra bumper of port for not having knocked out at least one of the wretchs teeth and she then related enough of his conduct to bring monsieur cherfeuil into her way of thinking upon the subject chapter twenty six a reconciliationa walk planned and a man plantedthe latter found to grow impatientralph at length rigged out as a reefer for two days mr rip and myself were not upon speaking terms on the third day a master barnard brings me up a slatefull of plusses minusses x y zs and other letters of the alphabet in a most amiable algebraical confusion take it to mr riprapton said i the lad took it and the mathematical master looked over it with a perplexed gravity truly edifying take it to master rattlini have no time was the result of his cogitations it was brought to me again take it to the usher said i it is of no use he dont know anything about it take it then to monsieur cherfeuil and tell him so this advice was overheard by the party most concerned and he called the boy to him who shortly returned to me with a note full of friendship apology and sorrow ending with an earnest request that i would again put him right with mrs causand as well as the sum on the slate i replied for i was still a little angry that he was very ungrateful but that as we were so soon to part perhaps for ever i accepted the reconciliation so far was well i told mrs causand what had passed and then interceded with her for her forgiveness for her anger debarred him from many comforts as it obliged him to take his solitary tea and supper in the schoolroom she consented as she did to almost everything that i requested of her and that afternoon i brought up to her the penitent handpresser her natural good temper and blandness of manner soon put him again at his ease and his lovespeeches flowed as fluently as ever we proposed a walk and accompanied by some halfdozen of the elder boys we began to stroll upon the common by some gaucherie the conversation took a disagreeable turn on our late misunderstanding and i could not help repeating what i had said in my note that mr rip had proved himself ungrateful considering the many difficulties from which i had extricated him at this last assertion before the lady he took fire and flatly denied it i was too proud to enumerate the many instances of scholastic assistance that he had received at my hands so i became sullen and silent my opponent in an equal degree brisk and loquacious my fair companion rather enjoyed the encounter and began to tally me come come said i ill lay him a crown that he will beg me to extricate him from some difficulty before the weeks over the wager was accepted with alacrity and mrs causand begged to lay an equal stake against me which i took i then purposely turned the conversation and after some time when we were fairly in the hollow made by the surrounding hills i exclaimed rip if youll give me fiveandtwenty yards ill run you three hops and a step a hundred yards for another crown done done exclaimed the usher joyously chuckling with the idea of exhibiting so triumphantly his prowess before the blooming widow the ground was duly stepped and the goal fixed whilst my antagonist all animation and spirits was pouring his liquid nonsense into the ladys ear i took care that in about the middle of the distance our raceground should pass over where some rushes were growing now riprapton had a most uncommon speed in this manner of progressing he would with his leg of flesh take three tremendous hops and then step down with his leg of wood one and then three live hops again and one dead step the step being a kind of respite from the fatigue of the hops all the preliminaries being arranged off we started i taking of course my twentyfive yards in advance the exhibition and the gait were so singular that mrs causand could scarcely stand for laughter whilst the boys shouted go it ralphwell done pegdotandgoone will beat him in the midst of these exhilarating cries what i had calculated upon happened rip before we had gone half the distance was close behind me but lo after three of his gigantic hops that seemed to be performed with at least one sevenleagued boot turned into a slipper he came down heavily upon his step with his wood among the rushes the stiff clay there being full of moisture and unsound he plunged up to his hip nearly in the adhesive soil and there he remained as much a fixture and equally astonished as lots wife first of all taking care to go the distance and thus win the wager we all frantic with laughter gathered round the man thus firmly attached to his mother earth whilst the tears ran down mrs causands cheeks and proved that her radiant colour was quite natural she endeavoured to assume an air of the deepest commiseration which was interrupted every moment by involuntary bursts of laughter for himself no wretch in the pillory ever wore a more lugubrious aspect and his sallow visage turned first to one and then to another with a look so ridiculously imploring that it was irresistible i am sorry very sorry said the lady to see you look so palei may say so lividbut poor man it is but natural seeing already that you have one foot in the grave the mender of pens groaned in the spirit i say said the schoolboy wag of the party applying an old joe miller to the occasion why is mr riprapton like pens ink and paper because he is stationary vociferated five eager voices at once in reply the casterup of sums cast a look at the delinquent the tottle of the whole of which was you shant be long on the debit side of our account but what is to be done was now the question i am afraid said i we must dig him up like a dead tree or an old post it is i believe the only way said the tutor despondingly i was relieved once that way before in the bog of ballynawashy o then you are from ireland after all said the lady only on a visit madam said the baited fixture with much asperity but really said she if i may judge from the present occasion you must have made a long stay i hope he wont take cold in his feet said a very silly blubberlipped boy his instructor looked hot with passion but really now i think of it chimed in the now enraptured widow a very serious alarm has seized me suppose that the piece of wood so nicely planted in this damp clay were to take root and throw out fibres gracious me only suppose that you should begin to vegetate i do declare that you look quite green about the eyes already mercy me whispered the wag if he should grow up hell certainly turn to a plane tree for really he is a very plain man the wielder of the ruler gave a tremendous wriggle with the whole body which proved as ineffectual as it was violent but dont you think ralph said his tormentor as the evening is drawing in that something should be done for the poor gentleman he will most certainly take cold if he remain here all night couldnt you and your schoolfellows contrive to build a sort of hut over him i am sure i should be very happy to help to carry the boughsif the man wont go to the house the house must go to the man what a fine cockshy he would make said master blubberlips o i should so like to see it said the lady it will be the first time he has been made shy in his life he was certainly like an indian bound to the stake and made to suffer mental torturebut he did not bear it with an indians equanimity as a few stragglers had been drawn to the funny scene and more might be expected i and i only of all the spectators began to feel some pity for him the more especially as i heard a stout grinning chawbacon say to the bakers boy of the village who asked him what was the matter whoy jim it bent nothink less than frenchmans usherman ha drawn all thickenham common on hisn left leg for a stocking loike come thought i its quite time after that for the honour of the academy to beat a retreat or we shall be beaten hollow by this heavyshod clodpole mr riprapton said i i dont bear you any malicebut i recollect my wager if i extricate you out of the difficulty will you own that i have won it gladly said he very sorrowfully come here my lads out knives and cut away the turf we soon removed the earth as far down as to where the hole of the wooden leg joined to the shank now my lads said i we must unscrew him round and round we twirled him his outstretched living leg forming as pretty a fairyring on the green sod with its circumgyrations as can be imagined at last after having had a very tolerable foretaste of the pillory we fairly unscrewed him and he was once more disengaged from his partial burialplace i certainly cannot say that he received our congratulations with the grace of a chesterfield but he begged us to continue our exertions to recover for him his shank or otherwise he would have to follow petruchios orders to the tailorto hop me over every kennel home for the sake of the quotation we agreed to assist and as many of us catching hold of it as could find a grip we tugged and tugged and tugged still the stiff clay did not seem at all inclined to relinquish the prize it had so fairly won at length by one tremendous and simultaneous effort we plucked it forth but in doing so those who retained the trophy in their hands were flung flat on their backs whilst the newlygained leg pointed upwards to the zenith having first wiped a little of the deep yellow adhesion away from it we joined the various parts of the man together and he taking singular care to avoid those spots where rushes grew we all reached our home with one exception in the highest gleeas to the two wagers he behaved like a gentleman and acknowledged the debtwhich was a great deal more than i ever expected after having worked some fifty problems out of hamilton moore of blessed memory and having drawn an infinity of triangles with all possible degrees of incidence with very neat little ships now upon the base now upon the hypothenuse and now upon the perpendicular my erudite usher pronounced me to be a perfect master of the noble science of navigation in all its branches for the which he glorified himself exceedingly as i had made many friends there was no difficulty in procuring for me a ship and i was to have joined the sappho a firstclass brig of war as soon as she arrived and she was expected almost immediately however as at that particular time we were relieving the danes from the onerous care of their navy the sloop was sent directly she arrived to assist in the amiable action having many who interested themselves about me some apparent and others hidden a ship was soon found for me but by what chain of recommendation i could never unravel as far as the ship was concerned i certainly had nothing to complain of she was a fine frigate and every way worthy to career over the ocean that was at that time almost completely an english dominion the usual quantity of hopes and wishes were expressed and my final leave was taken of all my village friends mr r enjoined me to correspond with him on every opportunity gave me his blessing and some urgent advice to eschew poetry and prophesied that he should live to see me posted there was nothing outwardly very remarkable in the manner of mrs cherfeuil on the eve of my departure i went to bed a schoolboy and was to rise next morning an officerthat is to say i was to mount my uniform for the first time i believe that i was already on the ships books for at the time of which i am writing the clerk of the cheque was not so very frequent in his visits and not so particular when he visited as he is at present notwithstanding the important change that was about to take place in everything connected with myself i did sleep that night though i often awokethere was a female hovering round my bed almost the whole of the night chapter twenty seven ralph commences his public career by accepting an iou he hardly knows whyhe finds his future captain based on a bottlehe is not taken by the hand so ignorant were those few on whom devolved my fitting out of what my station required that i had made for me three suits of uniform all of which had the lion upon the buttons instead of the anchor and from which the weekly account was absent my transmission from school to town was by the stage at town i was told to call on a lawyer in the kings bench walk in the temple who furnished me with twenty pounds and a letter for my future captain telling me i might draw upon him for a yearly sum which was more than double the amount i ought to have been entrusted with then coldly wishing me success he recommended me to go down that evening by the mail and join my ship immediately and wished me a good morning i certainly was a little astonished at my sudden isolation in the midst of a vast city i felt that from that moment i must commence man i knew several persons in london parents of my schoolfellows but i was too proud to parade my pride before them for i felt at the same time ashamed of wearing ostentatiously whilst i gloried in my uniform i dined at the inn where i alighted on coming to town called for what i wanted in a humble semitone said if you please sir to the waiter paid my bill without giving him a gratuity for fear of giving him offence took my place in the mail and got down without accident to chatham and slept at the house where the coach stopped on account of my hybrid uniform and my asserting myself of the navy the people of the establishment knew not what to make of me i wished to deliver my credentials immediately but my considerate landlord advised me to take time to think about itand dinner i followed his advice it is uncertain how long i should have remained in this uncertainty had not a brother midshipman in the coffeeroom accosted me and kindly helped me out with my pint of port which i thought i showed my manliness in calling for he did not roast me very unmercifully but what he spared in gibes he made up in drinking i abstained with a great deal of firmness from following his example he warmly praised my abstinence i suppose with much sincerity as it certainly appeared to be a virtue which he was incapable of practising about seven oclock my readymade friend began to be more minute in his inquiries i showed him my introductory letter and he told me directly at what hotel the captain was established and enforced upon me the necessity of immediately waiting upon him telling me i might think myself extremely lucky in having had to entertain only one officer when so many thirsty and penniless ones were cruising about to sponge on the johnny raws for himself he said he was a man of honour quite a gentleman and insisted upon paying his share of the two bottles of port consumed of which i certainly had not drunk more than four glasses secretly praising my man of honour for his disinterestedness for i had asked him to take a glass of wine which he had read as a couple of bottles i ordered my bill among the items of which stood conspicuously forth two bottles of old crusted port fourteen shillings damned imposition said my hitherto anonymous friend of all vices i abominate imposition the most i shall pay for all this wine myself here waiterre pen and ink banking hours are over now i have nothing but a fifty pound bill about me however you shall have my iou you see that i have made it out for one poundyoull just hand me the difference six shillings your name i think you said was rattlinralph rattlin a good name a very good pursers name indeed there mr rattlin you have only to present that piece of paper when you get on board to the head swab washer and hell give you either cash for it or slops i gave the gentleman who so much abhorred imposition six shillings in return for his paper which contained these words i owe you twenty shillings josiah cheeks majorgeneral of the horse marines of his majestys ship the merry dun of doverto mr ralph rattlin i carefully placed this precious document in my pocketbook among my onepound notes at that time the principal currency of the country yet could not help thinking that my friend cast an awfully hungry eye at the pieces of paper he had already commenced a very elaborate speech prefatory to the request of a loan when i cut him short by telling him that i had promised my godmamma not to lend anyone a single penny until i had been on board my ship six months which was really the case he commended my sense of duty and said it was of no manner of consequence as next morning he should be in possession of more than he should have occasion for and then a five or a tenpound note would be at my service after vainly endeavouring to seduce me to the theatre he made a virtue of my obstinacy and taking me by the arm showed me to the door of the hotel where captain reud of hms eos was located i was announced and immediately ushered into a room where i saw a sallowvisaged compact wellmade little man apparently not older than two or threeandtwenty sitting in the middle of the room upon a black quart bottle the neck of which was on the floor and the bottom forming the uneasy and unstable seat without paying much attention to me every now and then he would give himself an impetus and flinging out his arms spin round like a turnstile it certainly was very amusing and no doubt so thought his companion a fine manly handsomelooking fellow of thirtyfive or thirtyeight by his longcontinued and vociferous applause the little spinner was habited in a plain but handsome uniform with one gold epaulet on his right shoulder whilst the delighted approver had a coat splendid with broad white kerseymere facings i could observe that both parties were deeply immersed in the manycoloured delirium of much drink i looked first at one then at the other undecided as to which of the two was my captain however i could not augur ill of one who laughed so heartily nor of the other who seemed so happy in making himself a teetotum taking advantage of a pause in this singular exhibition i delivered my credentials to the former and more imposinglooking of the two who immediately handed them over to captain reud i was graciously received a few questions of courtesy asked and a glass of wine poured out for me my presence was soon totally disregarded and my captain and his firstlieutenant began conversing on all manner of subjects in a jargon to me entirely incomprehensible the decanter flew across and across the table with wonderful rapidity and the flow of assertion increased with the captain and that of assentation with his lieutenant at length the little man with the epaulet commenced a very prurient tale mr farmer cast a look full of meaning upon myself when captain reud addressed me thus in a sharp shrill tone that i thought impossible to a person who told such pleasant stories and who could spin so prettily upon a quart bottle do you hear younker youll ship your traps in a wherry the first thing tomorrow morning and get on board early enough to be victualled that day tell the commanding officer to order the ships tailor to clap the curse of god upon youi started with horror at the impietyto unship those poodles from your jacket and rig you out with the foul anchor yes sir said i but i hope the tailor wont be so wicked because i am sure i wish the gentleman no harm piously brought up said the captain well teach him to look aloft any how said the lieutenant striving to be original a wellbuilt young dog said the former looking at me approvingly who is he may i ask said the latter in a most sonorous aside mum said captain reud putting his finger to his nose and endeavouring to look very mysterious and full of important meaning but when i get him in blue waterif he were the kings sonheh farmer to be sure then he is the son of somebody sir more likely the son of nobodyaccording to the law of the land whoever launched him but ill never breathe a word or give so much as a hint that he is illegitimate i scorn like a british sailor to do that by a sidewind farmer that i ought not to do openly but there are two sides to a blanket a popish priest must not marry in england norman will was not a whit the worse because his mother never stood outside the canonical rail pass your wine farmer i despise a man a scoundrel who deals in innuendoso its despicable damned despicable i dont like however to be trusted by halvesshall keep a sharp lookout on the jokerwith me a secret is always perfectly safe o then there is a secret i see said mr farmer you had better go now mr rattlin and attend to the captains orders tomorrow the word mister sounded sharply yet not unpleasingly to my ear it was the first time i had been so designated or so dignified here was another evidence that i had or ought to cast from me the slough of boyhood and enact boldly the man i therefore summoned up courage to say that i did not perfectly understand the purport of the captains order and solicited an explanation yes said he the service has come to a pretty pass when the youngest officer of my ship asks me to explain my orders instead of obeying them i had better give him a note to the commanding officer for i may not happen to be on board when he arrives a note was written and given me goodnight mr rattlin said the captain goodnight sir said i advancing very amiably to shake hands with my little commander my action took him more aback than a heavy squall would have done the beautiful frigate he commanded the prestige of rank and the pride of discipline struggled with his sense of the common courtesies of life he half held out his hand he withdrew itit was again proffered and again withdrawn he really looked confused at length as if he had rallied up all his energies to act courageously he thrust them resolutely into his pockets and then said there younker that will do go and turn in turned out i muttered as i left the room from this brief incident young as i was i augured badly of captain reud i at once felt that i had broken some rule of etiquette but i knew that he had sinned against the dictates of mere humanity there was a littleness in his conduct and an indecision in his manner quite at variance with my untutored notions of the gallant bearing of a british sailor as i lay in bed at my inn my mind reenacted all the scenes of the previous day i was certainly dissatisfied with every occurrence i was dissatisfied with the security of my friend josiah cheeks the majorgeneral of the horsemarines of his majestys ship the merry dun of dover i was dissatisfied with my reception by captain reud of his majestys ship eos notwithstanding his skill at spinning upon a bottle nor was i altogether satisfied with the blustering halfprotecting halfoverbearing conduct towards me of his firstlieutenant mr farmer but all these dissatisfactions united were as nothing to the disgust i felt at the broad innuendoes so liberally flung out concerning the mystery of my birth chapter twenty eight ralphs heart still at homehis coffeeroom friend all abroadgets his iou cashed and sees the giver exalted to everybodys satisfaction but his own before i plunge into all the strange adventures and unlookedfor vicissitudes of my naval life i must be indulged with a few prefatory remarks the royal navy as a service is not vilified nor the gallant members who compose it insulted by pointing out the idiosyncrasies the absurdities and even the vices and crimes of some of its members human nature is human nature still whether it fawn in the court or philander in the grove the man carries with him on the seas the same predilections the same passions and the same dispositions both for good and for evil as he possessed on shore the ocean breeze does not convert the coward into the hero the passionate man into the philosopher or the mean one into a pattern of liberality it is true that a coward in the service seldom dares show his cowardice that in the inferior grades passion is controlled by discipline and in all meanness is shamed by intimate and social communion into the semblance of much better feelings still with all this the blue coat like charity covereth a multitude of sins and the blue water is as yet inefficacious to wash them all out we have said here briefly what the service will not do it will not change the nature of men but it will mollify it into much that is exalted that is noble and that is good it almost universally raises individual character but it can never debase it the world are too apt to generaliseand this generalisation has done much disservice to the british navy it forms a notion creates a beauideala very absurd one trulyand then tries every character by it even the officers of this beautiful service have tacitly given in to the delusion and by attempting to frown down all eposes of the errors of individuals vainly endeavour to exalt that which requires no such factitious exaltation if i am compelled to say this captain was a fool and a tyrant fools indeed must those officers be who draw the inference that i mean the impression to be general that all captains are either fools or tyrants let the cavillers understand that the tyranny and the folly are innate in the man but that the service abhors and represses the one and despises and often reforms the other the service never made a good man bad or a bad man worse on the contrary it has always improved the one and reformed the other it is however no libel to say that more than a quarter of a century ago of course now it is all perfection it contained some bad men among its multitude of good such as it then was i will faithfully record oh i left myself in bed my reflections affording me so little consolation when they were located in the vicinity of chatham i ordered my obedient mind to travel back to stickenham whilst i felt more than halfinclined to make my body take the same course the next morning not that my courage had failed me but i actually felt a disgust at all that i had heard and seen how different are the sharp abrading corners that meet us at every turn in our passage through real life from the sunny dreams of our imagination already my dirk had ceased to give me satisfaction in looking upon it and my uniform that two days before i thought so bewitching i had a few hours since been informed was to be soiled by a foul anchor how gladly that night my mind revelled among the woods and fields and waters of the romantic village that i had just left then its friendly inhabitants came thronging upon the beautiful scene and preeminent among them stood my good schoolmistress and my loving godmother of all the imaginary group she alone did not smile it was then and not till then that i felt the bitterness of the word farewell my conscience smote me that i had behaved unkindly towards her i now remembered a thousand little contrivances all of which in my exalted spirits i had pertinaciously eluded that she had put in practice in order to be for a few minutes alone with me i now bitterly reproached myself for my perversity what secrets might i not have heard and then my heart told me in a voice i could not doubt that it was she who had hovered round my bed the whole night previous to my departure my schoolfellows had all slept soundly yet i though wakeful had the folly to appear to sleep also whilst i was considering how people could be so unkind sleep came kindly to me and i awoke next morning in good spirits and laughed at my dejection of the preceding evening at breakfast in the coffeeroom i was a little surprised and a good deal flattered by the appearance of lieutenant farmer he accosted me kindly told me not again to attempt to offer first to shake hands with my captain for it was against the rules of the service and then he sat down beside me and commenced very patiently a me tirer les vers du nez he was a fine gallant fellow passionately desirous of promotion which was not surprising for he had served long and with considerable distinction and was still a lieutenant whilst he was more than fourteen years above his captain both in length of service and in age was i related to my lord a did i know anything of mr rose had i any connections that knew mr percival etcetera i frankly told him that i knew no one of any note and that it had been directly enjoined upon me by the one or two friends that i possessed never to converse about my private affairs with anyone mr farmer felt himself rebuked but not offended he was a generous noble fellow though a little passionate and too taut a disciplinarian he told me that he had no doubt we should be good friends that i had better go to the dockyard and inquire for the landingplace and for the eos cutter which was waiting there for stores that i was to make myself known to the officer of the boat who would give me two or three hands to convey my luggage down to it and that i had better ship myself as soon as i could he told me also that he would probably be on board before me but at all events if he were not that i was to give to the commanding officer the letter with which he had furnished me on the night before he left me with a more favourable impression on my mind than i had before entertained i paid my bill and found my way to chatham dockyard i had just gained the landingplace to which i had been directed by a gentleman who wore some order of merit upon his ankles and who kindly offered me a box of dominoes for sale when i saw a twelveoared barge pull in among the other boats that were waiting there the sternsheets were full of officers distinguishable among whom was one with a red round face sharp twinkling eyes and an honest corpulency of body truly comfortable he wore his laced cockedhat with the rosetted corners resting each on one of the heavilyepauletted shoulders his face looked so fierce and rubescent under his vast hat that he put me in mind of a large coal the lower half of which was in a state of combustion he landed with the other officers and i then perceived that he was gouty and lame and walked with a stick that had affixed to it a transverse ivory head something like a diminutive rams horn amidst this group of officers i observed my coffeeroom friend the majorgeneral of the horsemarines who seemed excessively shy and at that moment absorbed in geological studies for he could not take his eyes from off the earth however pushing hastily by the portadmiral for such was the ancient podagre ah majorgeneral said i to the abashed masters mate i am very glad to meet with you have you been to the bank this morning to cash your fiftypound bill dont know ye said my friend giving me more than the cut direct for if he could have used his eyes as a sword i should have had the cut decisive not know me wellbut you are only joking general cheeks the surrounding officers began to be very much amused and the portadmiral became extremely eager in his attention tell ye dont know ye younker said my gentleman folding his arms and attempting to look magnificent and strange well that is cool so sir you mean to deny that you drank two bottles of my port wine yesterday evening and that you did not give me your iou for the twenty shillings you borrowed of me ill trouble you if you please for the money for i was getting angry as i am quite a stranger to the head swabwasher and should not like to trouble the gentleman either for cash or slops without a formal introduction at this juncture the fiery face of the portadmiral became more fiery his fierce small eye more flashing and his ivoryhandled stick was lifted up tremblingly not with fear but rage pray sir said he to me who is he pointing to my friend and who are you this gentleman sir i take to be either a swindler or josiah cheeks majorgeneral of the horse marines of his majestys ship the merry dun of dover handing to the admiral the acknowledgment and i am sir ralph rattlin just come down to join his majestys ship the eos ill answer for the truth of the latter part of this young gentlemans assertion said captain reud now coming forward with lieutenant farmer is this your writing sir said the admiral to the discomfited masters mate in a voice worse than thunder for it was almost as loud and infinitely more disagreeable i see by your damned skulking look that you have been making a scoundrel of yourself and a fool of this poor innocent boy i hope sir you do not think me a fool for believing an english officer incapable of a lie well said boy well saidi seethis scamp has turned out to be both the scoundrel and the fool i only meant it for a joke sir said the soidisant mr cheeks taking off his hat and holding it humbly in his hand take up your note directly or i shall expel you the service for forgery the delinquent fumbled for some time in his pocket and at length could produce only threepence farthing a tobaccostopper and an unpaid tavernbill he was forced to confess he had not the money about him your fiftypound bill said i the bank must be open the majorgeneral looked at me it was a good thing for the giver of the iou that the mirth the whole transaction created did not permit the old admiral to be so severe with his whys as he would have been he however told the culprits captain whom he had just brought on shore in the barge to give me the twenty shillings and to charge it against him and then to give him an airing at the masthead till sunset telling him at the same time he might feel himself very happy at not being disrated and turned before the mast i was departing very well satisfied with this summary method of administering justice when i found that i was not altogether to escape for the old gentleman commenced opening a broadside upon me for not wearing the admiralty uniform lieutenant farmer however came very kindly to my rescue and offered the admiral a sufficient explanation i was then directed to the eos boat the coxswain and a couple of men went with me for my luggage and in less than half an hour i was being rowed down the medway towards the ship as we passed by what i looked upon as an immense and terrifically lofty seventyfour i looked up and descried majorgeneral cheeks slowly climbing up the newlytarred main topmast rigging like a snail unwillingly to the topmast crosstrees it was a bitterly cold day at the end of november and there is no doubt but that his reflections were as bitter as the weather practical jokes have sometimes very bad practical consequences chapter twenty nine ralph is shipped hulked and overcomea dark hall and an ebony servitora tailors politeness and a masters mate who sighs to be mated yet does not see that he is outmatched i found the eos all rigged and strong in the breeze with the not very agreeable aroma of dockyard paint the ships company was not however on board of her they were hulked on board of the pegasus a very brief introduction to the officers of the watch and i was shown down with my seachest my shoregoing trunk and quadrant cockedhat etcetera to the midshipmens berth in the hulk one of the afterguard performed for me the office of gentlemanusher it was a gloomy foggy chilly day and the damp of the atmosphere was mingled with the reeking dank animal effluvia that came up thick and almost tangible from the filthy receptacle of crowded hundreds as i descended into darkness and nearly felt overpowered by the compound of villainous smells i was something more than sick at heart my pioneer at length lifted up the corner of a piece of dirty canvas that screened off a space of about six feet square from the rest of the ships company this i was given to understand was the young gentlemens quarters their diningroom and their drawingroom combined even i who had not yet attained my full growth could not stand erect in this saloon of elegance i am stating nothing but literal facts on an oaken table still more greasy than the greasy decks over which i had slipped in my passage to this den stood a flickering spluttering intensely yellow candle of very slender dimensions inserted in a black quart bottle beside it was placed a battered breadbasket containing some broken biscuit and a piece of villainouslyscented cheese distinguished by the name of pursers lay near it in company with an old bloodstained wornout toothbrush and a shallow pewter washhand basin filled with horridly dirty water for seats round this table there were no other substitutes than various chests of various dimensions of such sordid penury as i then witnessed i had read but never supposed i should be compelled to witness much less to share notwithstanding the closeness of this hole it was excessively cold there was not a soul there to welcome me the petty officers being all away on dockyard duty it might have been ten oclock when i was first ushered into this region of darkness of chill and evil odours i remained with my surtout coat on sitting on my chest with my hands clasped before me stiff with cold and melancholy almost to tears how much then i panted for the breeze that blew over the heathy common where i had lately wantoned leaped and laughed as i there sat i fell into a deep and dreamlike reverie i could not after a pause convince myself that all i saw around me was real the light that the single unsnuffed candle gave became more dim and smoky i began to think that my spirit had most surely stepped into the vestibule of the abode of shadows and i wished to convince myself that my body was far far away sleeping in a pure atmosphere and under a friendly roof minute after minute cropped its weight heavily like so many pellets of lead upon my disordered brain i became confused perhaps i was nearly upon the point of syncope from the sudden change to bad air i felt that all i saw about me if not real would prove that i was mad and i feared that i should become so if the scene turned out to be no illusion at last i jumped up as i felt my stupor and my sickness increasing exclaimingthis is helland theres the devil as i observed a hideous shining black face peering at me over the top of the screen grinning in such a manner with a row of white teeth that reminded me of so many miniature tombstones stretching right across a dark churchyard no debbel sarmy name sar lillydewvat you please vant sar steward to young gentlemen sar will young massa have a lilywhite bit soft tommy sarbroil him a sodger sarbumboat alongside get a fresh herring for relish sar get me a little fresh airtake me upstairs o gemminnie hi hi hiyoung gentleman massa johnny newcome this way sar conducted by this angel of darkness i regained the deck and daylight and the nausea soon left my chest and the pain my head i then made this reflection that whatever glory a naval officer may attain if he went through the ordeal i was about essaying he richly deserved it the captain and some of the other officers now came on board i was introduced to most of them and the skipper made himself very merry with an account of my recent adventure with the masters mate who was still at the masthead as a convincing proof of the accuracy of the story and was plainly distinguishable some halfmile higher up the medway i soon entered into conversation with one of the young gentlemen who was destined to be for so long my messmate i told him that the air below would kill me he acknowledged that it was bad enough to kill a dog but that a reefer could stand it he also advised me not to have my uniforms altered by the ships tailors as it would be done in a bungling manner but to get leave to go on shore and that he would introduce me to a very honest tradesman who would do me justice i expressed my hopes to him in a dry manner that he did not belong to the regiment of horse marines he understood me and said upon his honour no that it was all fair and above board and as a recommendation which he thought would be irresistible he added that this tailor had a very pretty daughter with the very pretty name of jemima as the latter information was very satisfactory evidence as to the skill and honesty of the tradesman i could not be guilty of such a non sequitur as not to promise to employ him i then told him to make haste and come on shore with me i now was made painfully sensible that before i could enjoy my wishes a little ceremony was needful in fact that my powers of locomotion were no longer under my own control excepting for about one hundred and twenty feet in one direction and about thirtyfive in another as i was passing over the starboard side of the quarterdeck to ask leave to go on shore the captain accosted me and did me the honour to request my company to dinner at his table finding him in so bland a humour i preferred my request to live on shore till the ship sailed he smiled at the enormity of my demand and asked what induced it i frankly told him the filth and bad smell of my accommodations and also my wish not to be seen on board until my uniforms were complete hes an original said the captain to the firstlieutenant but there is some sense in his request i suppose you have no objection mr farmer young gentleman he continued turning to me you must always ask the firstlieutenant in future for leave mind dont be later than four oclock my messmate with all manner of humility now made his request which being granted we went down together to my chest and making a bundle of all the clothes that required alteration we placed that and ourselves in a shoreboat and made our way to the tailors i was there introduced to the lovely jemima she looked like a very pretty doll modelled with crumbs of white bread she was so soft so fair and so unmeaning after the order was given my maker of the outward man hazarded a few inquiries in a manner so kind and so obliging that quite made me lose sight of their impertinence when he found that i had leave to remain on shore and that my pocketbook was far from being illfurnished he expatiated very feelingly upon the exactions of living at inns offered me a bed for nothing provided only that i would pay for my breakfast and appoint him my tailor in ordinary and declared that he would leave no point unturned to make me comfortable and happy as this conversation took place in the little parlour at the back of the shop jemimamiss jemimawas present and as i seemed to hesitate the innocentlooking dear slily came up beside me and taking my hand pressed it amorously stealing at me a look with eyes swimming with a strange expression this byplay decided the business the agreement was made the terms being left entirely to mr tapes covering my inappropriate dress with my blue surtout i was about leaving with my messmate when the young lady said to her father perhaps mr rattlin would like to see his room before he goes out not particularly oh but you must you may come in and i and the servant may be out this wayyou must not come up mr pridhomme your boots are so abominably dirty there isnt it a nice roomyou pretty pretty boy said she jumping up and giving me a long kiss that almost took my breath away dont tell old leatherchops will you and i shall love you so who is old leatherchopsyour father dear me no never mind him i mean your messmate mr pridhomme im stepping into life thought i as i went downstairs and with no measured strides either what do you think of jemima said mr pridhomme as we walked arminarm towards the ramparts pretty prettywhy shes an angel if there was ever an angel on earth it is jemima tapes but what is mere beauty nothing compared to sincerity and innocenceshe is all innocence and sincerity i am glad that you believe so believe sowhy look at her she is all innocence she wont let her father kiss her why she says it is so indelicate how does she know what is or what is not indelicate damn it younker youd provoke a saint she assures me when she is forced to shake hands with a grownup man that it actually gives her a cold shudder all over i dont think that she ever kissed anybody but her mother and that was years ago perhaps she does not know how im sure she dont if i had a fortune id marry her tomorrow only im afraid shes too modest your fear is very commendable are the ladies at chatham so remarkable for modesty no and thats what makes jemima so singular i like to make people happy if they are not so and if they are even though that happiness may be the creation of a delusion i like to leave them so i therefore encouraged mr pridhomme to pour all his raptures into what he thought an approving ear and jemima was the theme until he left me at the door of the hotel at which i was to dine with captain reud whatever the reader may think of jemima i was at this period perfectly innocent myself though not wholly ignorant i should have deemed miss jemimas osculatory art as the mere effect of high spirits and hoyden playfulness had it not been for the hypocrisy that she was displaying towards my messmate i had translated gil blas at school and i therefore set her down for an intrepid coquette if not une franche aventuriere however though i pitied my messmate that was no reason why i should not enjoy my dinner that day i liked my little saffroncoloured captain much better he played the host very agreeably he made as many inquiries as he dared without too much displaying his own ignorance as to the extent of my acquirements and when he found them so far beyond his expectations he seemed to be struck with a sudden respect for me the tone of his conversation was more decorous than that of the preceding evening he gave me a great deal of nautical advice recommended me to the protection particularly of the first and second lieutenants who were also his guests approved of my plan of sleeping at the tailors and dismissed me very early no doubt with a feeling of pleasure at having removed a restraint for as i left the room i just caught the wordsmake a damned sealawyer byandby chapter thirty jealousy cooled by a wateringralph exhorteth and right wiselythe boatswain sees many things in a new lightand though he causeth crabs to be caught he bringeth them to a wrong market pridhomme had been lying in wait for me and picked me up as i left the hotel we went to the theatre a wretched affair certainly the absurdities of which i should have much enjoyed had i not been bored to death by the eternal jemima that lady was like jemima and that was not was the person in the blue silk dress as tall as jemima or the other in the white muslin quite as stout jemima was all he could talk about till at length i was so horribly jemimaed that i almost audibly wished jemima jammed down his throat but as everything must have an end even when a midshipman talks about jemima we at length got to the tailors door which was opened by the lovely jemima in propria persona not a step beyond the step of the door was the lover admitted whilst the poor wretch was fain to feast on the ecstasies of remembering that he was permitted to grasp the tip of her forefinger whilst he sighed forth his fond goodnight in a few days the eos being perfectly equipped dropped down to sheerness and i for the first time slept under the roof provided for me by his britannic majesty that is to say i was coffined and shrouded in a longitudinal canvas bag hung up to the orlop deck by two cleats one at each end in a very graceful curve very useful in forming that elegant bend in the back so much coveted by the exhibitors in regent street i had taken a rather sentimental leave of jemima who had somehow or another persuaded me to exchange lovetokens with her that which i gave her was a tolerably handsome writingdesk which i could not help buying for her as she had taken a great fancy to it indeed she told me it had annoyed her for some months because it stood so provokingly tempting in the shopwindow just over the way and besides she should be soso happy to write me such pretty letters from it the last argument was convincing and the desk was bought in return for which she presented me with a very old silver pencilcaseits age indeed she gave me to understand ought to be its greatest value in my eyes she had had it so long it was given to her by her defunct mother so i promised to keep it as long as i lived really there was no chance of my ever wearing it out by use for it was certainly quite useless but love dignifies things so much after having split it up by shoving a piece of blacklead pencil into it i put it into my waistcoat pocket saying to the heiress of the chatham tailor rich gifts prove poor when givers prove unkind ah ralph said the giver of rich gifts i shall never prove unkind so we parted and as i walked down the street she waved her hand which would have been really white had she not scored her forefinger in a most villainous manner by her awkward method of using her needle when her father was short of hands when i afterwards heard of chatham as being the universal depot of ladies who love wisely and not too well rogues and jews i could not help thinking of my writingdesk and adding to the list jewesses also about a week after we were still lying at sheerness and i had totally forgotten the innocentlooking jemima mr pridhomme was smoking in a loverlike and melancholy fashion against orders a short pipe in the midshipmens berth as the ashes accumulated he became at a loss for a tobaccostopper and i very goodnaturedly handed him over the broken broadtopped vulgarlooking pencilcase the gift of the adorable jemima his apathy at the sight of this relic of love dispersed like the smoke of his pipe where did you get this younker he cried swelling with passion in the true turkeycock style it was given to me as a keepsake by miss jemima said i very quietly its a lieyou stole it you old scoundrel you young villain take that roared my opponent and the breadbasket with its fragmental cargo of biscuits came full in my face very considerately putting bread into my mouth for his supposed injury take that said i seizing the rumbottle no he shant said pigtop the masters mate laying hold of the muchprized treasure let him take anything but that so i flung the waterjug at his head we were just proceeding to handicuffs when the masteratarms hearing the riot opened the door we then cooled upon it and a truce ensued explanations followed the truce and an apology on his part the explanation for which apology i very gladly gave him the pencilcase that i had promised to keep as long as i lived and a heartache at the same time the poor fellow had given the faithful jemima this mutable lovegift three days before it came into my possession on which occasion they had broken a crooked sixpence together i moralised upon this and came to the conclusion that whatever a tailor might be a sailor is no match for a tailors daughter born and bred up at chatham now i have nothing wherewith to amuse the reader about the mischievous tricks that were played upon me in my entrance into my naval life the clews of my hammock were not reefed i was not lowered down by the head into a bucket of cold water nor sent anywhere with a foolish message by a greater fool than myself the exemptions from these usual persecutions i attribute to my robust and wellgrown frame my disposition so easily evinced to do battle on the first occasion that offered itself and lastly my wellstocked purse and the evident consideration shown to me by the captain and the firstlieutenant as i write as much for the instruction of my readers as for their amusement i wish to impress upon them if they are themselves or if they know any that are going to enter into the navy the necessity in the first instance of showing or recommending a proper spirit never let the debutant regard how young or how feeble he may behe must make head against the first insulthe must avenge the first hoax no doubt he will be worsted and get a good beating but that one will save him from many hundreds hereafter and perhaps the necessity of fighting a mortal duel your certain defeat will be forgotten in the admiration of the spirit that provoked the contest and remember that the person who hoaxes you is always in the wrong and it depends only upon yourself to heap that ridicule upon him that was intended for your own head to say nothing of the odium that must attach to him for the cruelty the cowardice and the meanness of fighting with a lad weaker than himself this i will enforce by a plain fact that happened to myself a tall consequential thirtyyearsold masters mate threatened to beat me after the manner that oldsters are accustomed to beat youngsters i told him that if he struck me i would strike again as long as i had strength to stand or power to lift my hand he laughed and struck me i retaliated it is true that i got a sound thrashing but it was my first and last and my tyrant got both his eyes well blackened his cheek swollenand was altogether so much defaced that he was forced to hide himself in the sicklist for a fortnight the story could not be told well for him but it told for me gloriously indeed he felt so much annoyed by the whole affair that he went and asked leave to go and mess with the gunner fairly stating to the captain that he could not run the risk of keeping orderfor he was our catererif he had to fight a battle every time he had to enforce it but i cannot too much caution youngsters against having recourse in their selfdefence to deadly weapons i am sorry to say it was too common when i was in the navy it is unenglish and assassinlike it rarely keeps off the tyrant the knife the dirk or whatever else may be the instrument is almost invariably forced from the young bravos hand and the thrashing that he afterwards gets is pitiless and the wouldbe stabber finds no voice lifted in his favour he also gains the stigma of cowardice and the bad reputation of being malignant and revengeful indeed so utterly futile is the drawing of murderous instruments in little affrays of this sort that though i have known them displayed hundreds of times yet i never knew a single wound to have been inflictedthough many a heavy beating has followed the atrocious display by all means let my young friends avoid it on the day before we sailed from sheerness the captain had an order conveyed to the firstlieutenant to send me away on duty immediately for two or three hours i was bundled into the pinnace with old canvas old ropes and old blocks condemned stores to the dockyard and as i approached the landingplace appropriated for the use of admirals in posse i saw embark from the stairs exclusively set apart for admirals and postcaptains in esse my captain and the portadmiral in the admirals barge and seated between these two awful personages there sat a civilian smiling in all the rotundity and fat of a very pleasant countenance and very plain clothes and forming a striking contrast to the grim complacency and the ironbound civility of the two men in uniform the boats crew were so much struck with this apparent anomalyfor to them anything in the civilians garb to come near an officer and that officer a naval one was hardly less than portentous and argued the said civilian to be something belonging to the genus homo extraordinaryand the fat specimen in the boat with the portadmiral they thought was one of the lords of the admiralty or even mr croker himselfthe notion of whose dimlyunderstood attributes was with them of a truly magnificent nature whoever this person was he was carefully assisted up the side of our ship and remained on board for about an hour whilst we were burning with curiosity and eagerness to be on board to satisfy it and forced to do our best to allay this tantalising passion by hauling along tallied bights of rope and rousing old hawsers out and new hawsers into the boata more pleasant employment may be easily imagined for a raw cold misty day in winter i regarded all these operations very sapiently knowing as yet nothing of the uses or even of the names of the different stores that i was delivering and receiving the boatswain was with me of course but notwithstanding that i had positive orders not to let the men stray away from the duty they were performingas this official told me after we had done almost everything that we had come on shore to perform that he must borrow two of the men to go up with him to the storekeepers private house to look out for some strong fine white line with which to bowse up the best bower anchor to the spankerboomend when the ship should happen to be too much down by the stern i could not refuse to disobey my orders upon a contingency so urgent and there he left me for about two hours shivering in the boat and at length he and the men came down with very little white line in exchange for his not very white tie and truly they had been bowsingup something for mr lushby the respectable boatswain told me with very great condescension that he was a real officer whilst i was nothing but a living walkingstick for the captain to swear at when he was in a bad humour and that he had no doubt but that i should get mastheaded when i got on board for allowing those two men who were catching crabs to get so drunk similar tricks to this every young gentleman entering the service must expecttricks that partake as much of the nature of malice as of fun now in the few days that i had been in the service i very well understood that the care of the men as respected their behaviour and sobriety devolved on me the delivering of old and the drawing of new stores on the boatswain yet for the conduct of those men that he took from under my eye i felt that in justice he was answerable i therefore made no reply to the vauntings and railings of mr lushby but had determined how to act the boat came alongside there was nobody on board but the officer of the watch and mr lushby tumbled up the side and down the waist in doublequick time sending the chief boatswains mate and the yeoman of the stores to act as his deputy he certainly did his duty in that respect as two sober deputies are worth more than is a drunken principal however i walked into the gunroom to report myself and boat to the firstlieutenant the officers were at their wine i was flattered and surprised at the frank politeness of my reception and the welcome looks that i received from all i was invited to sit and a glass placed for me when i found myself tolerably comfortable and had answered some questions put to me by mr farmer our firstlieutenant the drift of which i did not then comprehend and putting a little wilful simplicity in my manner i asked with a great deal of apparent innocence if all the sailors caught crabs when they were drunk catch crabs mr rattlin said mr farmer smiling not always but they are sure to catch something worsethe cat with white linehow strange said i purposely misunderstanding the gallant officer now i know why mr lushby took up the two men and why all three came down in a state to catch crabs i thought that white line had something to do with it yes mr rattlin white line has mr farmer then motioned me to stay where i was took up his hat and went on deck i need not tell my naval readers that the boatswain was sent for and the two men placed aft it was certainly a very cruel proceeding towards the purveyor of white line who had just turned his cabin into a snuggery and had taken another round turn with a belay over all in the shape of two more glasses of halfandhalf when he found himself on the quarterdeck though the shades of evening were stealing over the watersi like a poetical phrase now and thenhe saw more than in broad daylight that is to say he saw many firstlieutenants who seemed with many wrathful countenances with many loud words to order many men to see him down many ladders safely to his cabin the next morning this real officer found himself in a very uncomfortable plight for with an aching head he was but too happy to escape with a most stinging reprimand and he had the consolation then to learn that had he not endeavoured to play upon the simplicity of mr rattlin he would most surely have escaped the fright and the exposure the simplicity chapter thirty one another mysteryall overjoyed because the eos is under weigh she works wellthrough the waterher officers through their wineralph refraineth and selfglorifietha longshore man makes a short stay on boardbecause he wont go on the wrong tack but i must now explain why i had become so suddenly a favourite in the wardroom the very stout gentleman who came off with the admiral and captain undertook the aquatic excursion on my account he made every inquiry as to my equipment my messmates and my chance of comfort yet i the person most concerned was sent out of the way lest by accident i should meet with him i never knew who he was nor do i think the captain did my shipmates had their conjectures and i had mine they took him to be what is usually called not a person but a personage i believe that he was nothing more than a personages fat steward or some other menial obesity for it was very plain that he was ashamed to look me in the face and i understand he gave himself many secondhand airs and now we are off in earnest the norelight is passed the pilot is on the hammock nettings the breeze takes the sails the noble frigate bends to it as a gallant cavalier gently stoops to receive the kiss of beauty the blocks rattle as the ropes fly through them the sails court the wind to their embrace now on one side now on the other i stand on the quarterdeck in silent admiration at the astonishing effects of this wonderful seeming confusion i am pushed here and ordered there i now jump to avoid the eddy of the uncurling ropes as they fly upwards but my activity is vaina brace now drags across my shins and now the bight of a leespanker brail salutes me not lovingly across the face the captain and officers are viewing the gallant vessel with intense anxiety and scrutinising every evolution that she is making how does she answer her helm beautifully what leeway does she make scarce perceptible the log is hove repeatedlyseven sevenandahalf closehauled stand by the captain is going to work her himself she advances head to the wind bravely like a british soldier to the breachshe is about she has stayed within her own lengthshe has not lost her way noble excellent is the scarcelysuppressed cry and then arose in the minds of that gallant band of officers visions of an enemy worthy to cope with of the successful manoeuvre the repeated broadsides the struggle and the victory their lives their honour and the fame of their country they now willingly repose upon her she is at once their home their field of battle and their arena of glory see how well she behaves against that head sea there is not a man in that noble fabric who has not adopted her who has not a love for her they refer all their feelings to her they rest all their hopes upon her the venetian doge may wed the sea in his gilded gondola ermined nobles may stand near and jewelled beauty around himreligion too may lend her overpowering solemnities but all this display could never equal the enthusiasm of that morning when above three hundred true hearts wedded themselves to that beauty of the sea the eos as she worked round the north foreland into the downs the frigate behaved so admirably in all her evolutions that when we dropped anchor in the roadstead the captain to certify his admiration and pleasure invited all the wardroom officers to dine with him as well as three or four midshipmen myself among the rest it was an animated scene that dinnerparty the war was then raging several french frigates of our own size and class and many much larger were wandering on the seas the republican spirit was blazing forth in their crews and ardently we longed to get among them as yet no one knew our destination we had every stimulant to honourable excitement and mystery threw over the whole that absorbing charm that impels us to love and to woo the unknown but this meeting at first so rational and then so convivial at length permitted its conviviality to destroy its rationality men who spoke and thought like heroes one hour the next spoke what they did not think and made me think what i did not speak no one got drunk except the purser who is always a privileged person yet they were not the same men as when they began their carouse nor i the same boy when they had finished it on that evening i made a resolution never to touch ardent spirits and whilst i was in the navy that resolution i adhered to it is a fact i am known to too many to make on this subject a solemn assertion falsely i did not lay the same restriction on wine yet even that i always avoided when i could do so without the appearance of affectation my reason such as it was never in the slightest degree tottered on her throne either with a weakness or a strength not her own the winecup never gladdened or sorrowed me even when the tepid fetid and animalised water was served out to us in quantities so minute that our throats could count it by drops i never sought to qualify its nauseous taste or increase its quantity by the addition of spirits when spirits were more plentiful than the muchcourted water this trait proves if it proves nothing else that i had a good deal of that inflexibility of character which we call in others obstinacy when we dont like it firmness when we doin ourselves always decision i give the incident that i am about to relate to show in what way fiveandtwenty years ago a manofwar was made the alternative of a jail and to prove generally speaking of what little use this kind of recruiting was to the service and as it made a great impression on me at the time though a little episodical i shall not hesitate to place it before my readers after remaining at anchor in the downs during the night we sailed next morning down the channel without stopping at spithead our ultimate destination being still a profound secret as we proceeded when we were off a part of the coast the name of which i do not remember about noonday it fell calm and the tide being against us we neared the shore a little and came to an anchor we had not remained long in our berth before we descried a shoreboat pulling off to us which shortly came alongside with a very singular cargo of animals belonging to the genus homo in the sternsheets sat a magistrates clerk swelling with importance on the afterthwart and facing the jack in office were placed two constables built upon the regular devonshire chawbacon model holding upright between their legs each an immense staff headed by the gilded initials of our sovereign lord the king seated between these imposing pillars of the state sat in tribulation dire a tall awkward young man in an elaboratelyworked white smockfrock stained with blood in front and upon the shoulders he was the personification of rural distress he blubbered a pleine voix and lifted up and lowered his handcuffed wrists with a seesaw motion really quite pathetical though the wind had fallen yet the tide was running strongly and there was a good deal of sea quite enough to make the motion in the boat very unpleasant as they held on alongside by the rope the parties in the sternsheets began bobbing at each other the staves lost and resumed and then lost again their perpendicular so much indeed as to threaten the head of the clerk whose countenance began to pale its effectual fire the captain and many of the officers looking over the gangway the following dialogue ensued commenced by the officer of the watch shoreboat hohoy in the name of the king replied the clerk between many minacious hiccoughs and producing a piece of paper i have brought you a volunteer to serve in his majestys fleet pointing to the blubberer in the smockfrock well said the captain knock off his irons and hand him up dare not siras much as my life is worth the most ferocious poacher in the country has nearly beaten in the skull of the squires head gamekeeper just the sort of man we want said the captain but you see he cant get up the side with his hands fast and i presume you cannot be in much danger from the volunteer whilst you have two such staves held by two such constables yes said the now seriouslyaffected clerk i do not think that i incur much danger from the malefactor since i am under the protection of the guns of the frigate so somewhat reassured by this reflection the brigand of the preserves was unmanacled and the whole party clerk constables and prisoner came up the side and made their appearance on the break of the quarterdeck but this was not effected without much difficulty and some lossa loss that one of the parties must have bewailed to his dying day if it did not actually hasten that awful period one of the constables in ascending the side let fall his staff his muchloved staff dear to him by many a fond recollection of riot repressed and evildoer apprehended and away it went floating with the tide far far astern his unmitigated horror at this event was comic in the extreme and the keeper of the kings peace could not have evinced more unsophisticated sorrow than did the late keeper of his conscience at the loss of the seals the more especially as the magistrates clerk refused to permit the boat to go in pursuit of it not wishing the only connecting link between him and the shore to be so far removed from his control chapter thirty two the volunteer and his fate showing how a great rogue notwithstanding that he may appear to be born to be hung will sometimes happen to drown the group on the quarterdeck was singular and ludicrous reuben gubbins for such was the name of the offender was the only son of a small farmer who it appeared had even gone the length of felony by firing upon and wounding the gamekeeper of the lord of the manor he was quite six feet high very awkwardly built and wore under his frock a longtailed bluecoat dingy buckskin nether garments and topboots with the tops tanned brown by service his countenance betrayed a mixture of simplicity ignorance and strong animal instinct he was the least suited being that could be possibly conceived of whom to make a sailor his limbs had been long stiffened by rustic employments and he had a dread of the sea and of a manofwar horrifying to his imagination in this dread it was very evident that his companions largely participated not excepting the pragmatical clerk the constable with the staff and the constable without ranged themselves on either side of the still sobbing arcadian indeed the staffless man seemed to be but little less overcome than the prisoner he felt as if all strength value and virtue had gone out of him and ever and anon he glared upon the baton of his brotherofficer with looks felonious and intent on rapine the business was soon concluded reuben rather than see himself tried for his life determined to make trial of the sea and thus became perhaps the most unwilling volunteer upon record poor fellow his sufferings must have been great the wild animal of the forest when pining for the first time in a cage or the weary landbird blown off far away upon the restless sea could not have been more out of their elements than tall and ungainly reuben gubbins on the deck of his majestys ship eos i do not know how it was for i am sure that i ought to have despised him for his unmanly and incessant weepingi knew that he had offended the laws of his countryyet when the great lout went forward disconsolately and sat himself down amidst the derision of the seamen upon a guncarriage on the forecastle i could not help going and dispersing the scoffers and felt annoyingly inclined to take his toilembrowned hand sit down beside and cry with him however i did not so far commit myself but a few hours afterwards i was totally overcome strict orders were given not to allow gubbins to communicate with anyone from the shore a little before dusk there was a boat ordered by the sentinels to keep off that contained besides the sculler a respectablelooking old man and a tall stout and rather handsome young woman directly they caught the eye of reuben he exclaimed woundikins if there beant feyther and our sister moll and running aft and putting his hat between his knees he thus addressed the officer of the watch please mr officer zur theres feyther and our moll well zur maynt i go and have my cry out with em for certain i ha behaved mortal bad against orders but surely youll let him come up to comfort loike his undutiful son no no impossible whoy lookee there zurthats feyther with the white hair and thats sister crying like mad ye can no ha the hard heart silence and go forward i looked over the side and there i saw the old man standing up reverently with his hat in one hand and a bag apparently full of money in the other undoubtedly the simple yeoman had supposed that money could either corrupt the captain or buy off the servitude of his guilty son it was a fine old countenance down the sides of which that silver hair hung so patriarchally and gracefully and there that poor old man stood bowing in his wretchedness and his bereavement with his money extended to every officer that he could catch a glimpse of as his hat or head appeared above the hammocknettings or the bulwarks the grief of his sister was commonplace and violent but there was a depth and a dignity in that of the old man that went to my very heart i could not help going up to the lieutenant and entreating him to grant the interview it wont do mr rattlin dont you know that the fellow was put on board with cp before his name i anticipate what you are going to say but humanity is a more abstract thing than you are aware of and orders must be obeyed but zur said gubbins who had again approached i can see that feyther has forgien me and hes the mon i ha most wronged arter all besides sistur wull break her heart if she doant say goodbye reubenif feyther has made it up sure other folk mought be koind oh aybut ive been a sad fellow and then he began to blubber with fresh violence the officer was a little movedhe went to the gangway hailed the boat and when she came near enough he told the old farmer kindly that his orders to prevent personal communication were strict that any parcel or letter should be handed up but that he would do well not to let his reprobate son have any money during this short conference reuben had placed himself within sight of his relatives and the sacred words of my father my son were in spite of all orders exchanged between them by this time the tide had turned the wind had risen and precisely from the right quarter so the hands were turned up up anchor the orders for the boat to keep off were now reiterated in a manner more imperative but it still hung about the ship and after we were making way as long as the feeble attempts of the boatman could keep his little craft near us the poor old man and his daughter with a constancy of love that deserved a better object hung upon our wake he standing up with his white hair blown about by the wind to catch a last glimpse of a son whom he was destined to see no more and who would without doubt as the scripture beautifully and tenderly expresses it bring down his grey hairs with sorrow to the grave long long after the stolid and sullen son had ceased apparently to interest himself about the two that were struggling after us in their really frail boat i watched from the taffrail the vain and loving pursuit indeed until the darkness and the rapidlyincreasing distance shrouded it from my view i did not leave my post of observation and the last i could discern of the mourners still showed me the old man standing up in the fixed attitude of grief and the daughter with her face bent down upon her knees to the last the boats head was still towards the shipa touching emblem of unswerving fatherly love i could not away with the old mans look it was so wretched so helpless yet so fondand was typed to my fancy so strongly by his little boat pursuing with a hopeless constancy over waves too rough for it the huge and disregarding ship so with my breast full even to suffocation with mingled emotions i went down to my berth and laying my head upon the table and covering my face with my hands i pretended to sleep the cruel torture of that halfhour i almost thought the poacher with all his misery still blessed in having a fathers lovetwas then that i felt intensely the agony of the desertion of my own parentthe love that had been denied to me to give to my own father i lavished upon the whiteheaded old man in imagination i returned with him to his desolate home i supported his tottering steps over the threshold no longer musical with an only son i could fancy myself placing him tenderly and with reverence in his accustomed chair and speaking the words of comfort to him in a low voice and looking round for his family bibleand the sister doubtless she had many sources of consolation youth was with herlife all before hershe had companions friends perhaps a lover butfor the poor old man at that moment i would have given up all my anticipations of the splendid career that i fancied i was to run in order to have gone and have been unto the bereaved sire as a son and to have found in him a father but nobody could make a sailor of reuben gubbins and reuben had no idea of making a sailor of himself it was in vain that the boatswains mate docked the long tails of his blue coat such things were done in the navy at that time razeed his topboots into seamens shoes and that he had his smockfrock reduced into a seamans shirt the soil hung upon him he slouched over the deck as if he were walking over the furrows of ploughed land and looking up into the rigging as if he saw a cockpheasant at roost upon the rattlins moreover he could talk of nothing else excepting feyther and our moll and he really ate his bread subintellige biscuit moistened with his tears if tears can moisten such flinty preparations for he was always whimpering for the sake of the fit of romance that i felt for his father i took some kind notice of this yokel afloat i believe as much as it lay in his nature he was grateful for it for to everyone else on board he was the constant butt mr farmer our firstlieutenant was a smart and somewhat exacting officer he used to rig the smokesail some twelve feet high across the mizzenmast and make the young gentlemen just caught and the boys of the ship lay out upon it in order that they might practice furling after a safe method at first nothing could persuade reuben to go a single step up the riggingnot even the ropesend of the boatswains mate now this delicacy was quite at variance with mr farmers ideas so in order to overcome it by the gentlest means in the world reuben had the option given him of being flogged or of laying out on the smokesail yard just to begin with and to get into the way of it it was a laughable thing to see this huge clown hanging with us boys on the thin yard and hugging it as closely as if he loved it he had a perfect horror of getting to the end of it at a distance when our smokesail yard was manned we looked like a parcel of larks spitted with one great goose in the midst of us doey get beyond me zur doey mr rattlin he would say ah zur id climb with any bragger in this ship for a rooks nest where i ha got a safe bough to stand upon but to dance upon this here seesawing line and to call it a horse too bent christian loike but his troubles were soon to cease he was made a waister and at furling sails stationed on the main yard i will anticipate a little that we may have done with him the winter had set in severely with strong gales with much frost and snow we were not clear yet of the chops of the channel and the weather became so bad that it was found necessary to lieto under trysails and closereefed maintop sail about two bells in the first dogwatch the firstlieutenant decided upon furling the mainsail up on the mainyard reuben was forced to go he went to leeward and the seamen full of mischief kept urging him further and further away from the bunt i was with one of the oldsters in the maintop the maintopsail had just been closereefed i had a full view of the lads on the mainyard and the terror displayed in reubens face was at once ludicrous and horrible it was bitterly cold the rigging was stiffened by frost and the cutting northeast wind came down upon the men on the leeyardarm out of the belly of the topsail with tremendous force added to which the ship notwithstanding the pressure of the lastmentioned sail surged violently for there was a heavy though a short sea the farmers son seemed to be gradually petrifying with fear he held on upon a fold of the sail instinctively without at all assisting to bundle it up he had rallied all his energies into his cramped and clutching fingers as i looked down upon him i saw that he was doomed i would have cried out for assistance but i knew that my cry would have been useless even if i had been able through the roar of the winds and the waters to have made it heard but this trying situation could not last long the part of the sail on which reuben had hung with what might be truly termed his deathclutch was wanted to be rolled in with the furl and by the tenacity of his grasp he impeded the operation rouse up my lads bodily to windward roared the masters mate stationed at the bunt of the sail let go you lubber said the sailor next to windward of reuben on the yard reuben was now so lost that he did not reply to the man even by a look now my lads now one two three and a obedient to the call of the officer with a simultaneous jerk at the sail the holdfast of the stupid peasant was plucked from his cracking fingers he fell back with a loud shriek from the yard struck midway on the main rigging and thence bounding far to leeward in the sea disappeared and for ever amid the white froth of the curling wave that lapped him up greedily he never rose again perhaps in her leeway the frigate drifted over himand thus the violated laws of his country were avenged i must confess that i felt a good deal shocked at the little sensation this to me tragical event occasioned but we get used to these things in this best of all possible worlds and if the poacher died unwept unknelled unprayed for all that can be said of the matter isthat many a better man has met with a worse fate chapter thirty three symptoms of sickness not of the sea but of the land beyond itour md wishes to write dio and prepares accordinglyralph is about to reap his first marine laurels on the rocks of cove i do not get on with this life at all i have not yet reached the cove of cork clap on more sail it is bitterly cold however and here we are now safely moored in one of the petals of the first flower of the sea in making this short passage captain reud was very affable and communicative he could talk of nothing but the beautiful coast of leghorn the superb bay of naples pleasant trips to rome visits to tripoli and other interesting parts on the african coast and on the voluptuous city of palermo with its amiable ladies and incessant festivitieshe was quite as eloquent as could reasonably be expected from a smart postcaptain of fourandtwenty we were all in a fools paradise for myself i was enraptured i was continually making extracts from horace virgil and other schoolbooks that i still carried with me which referred in the least to those places that we were at all likely to see but visions of this land of promise of this sea flowing with gentle waves and rich prizes were soon dispersed before a sad reality that without the aid of the biting weather now made most of the officers and men look blue so soon as our anchors had nipped the ground of the green island we found ourselves in the middle of a convoy of more than two hundred vessels of all descriptions that the experienced immediately knew to be west indiamen the sarcastic glee with which captain reud rubbed his skinny yellow hands when he ordered additional sentries and a boat to row guard round the ship from sunset to sunrise weather permitting to prevent desertion gave me a strong impression of the malignity of his disposition certainly the officers from the first lieutenant downwards looked when under the influence of the first surprise about as sage as we may conceive did those seven wise men of gotham who put to sea in a bowl some of them had even exchanged into the ship for certain unlawful considerations because she was so fine a frigate and the captain possessed so much interest being a very near and dear relation of the then treasurer of the navy with this interest they thought of course that he would have the selection of his own station and so he had they either did not know or had forgotten that captain reud was a west indian creole and that he had large patrimonial estates in antigua not loud but deep were the curses in the gunroom but both loud and deep were those in the midshipmans berth for the denizens thereof were never proverbial for the niceties of their expressions when the apalling certainty broke on the comminators of three years roasting in the west indies with accompaniments of misgivings about yellow jack and the palisades merely because the captain wished to go and see why the niggers did not make quite so much sugar and rum as they used to do but after all we had a sage ships company officers included for there was scarcely a man in the ship who after our destination was ascertained did not say well i thought as much and they derived much consolation from the consciousness of their foresight the knowledge of our station had a most decided effect upon two of our officers the master and surgeon the former of whom a weatherbeaten old northcountryman who had been all his life knocking about the north sea and our channels at home immediately gave himself up for lost he made his will and took a decidedly serious turn but there was another person who viewed the west india station not religiously like our master or joyously like our captain or grumblingly like the marine officer or despitefully like all the lieutenants or detestedly like my messmates or indifferently like myself he took the matter into consideration discreetly and so in order to enjoy a long life he incontinently fell sick unto death of course he knew more than any man on board how ill he was for he was the doctor himself he was not merely a naval surgeon but a regular md and with an english diploma he could appreciate as much as any man the value of life and hard indeed did he struggle to preserve the means of prolonging it he was a short round and very corpulent person with a monstrously large and pleasantlylooking face with a very high coloura colour not the flush of intemperance but the glow of genuine health this vast physiognomy was dug all over with holes not merely pockmarks but pockpits indeed his countenance put you in mind of a vast tract of gravelly soil on a sunny day dug over with holes it was so red so cavernous and withal so bright i need not mention that he was a bon vivant a most joyous yet a most discreet one even on board of ship he contrived to make his breakfasts dinners his dinners feasts and his suppers though light delicacies he was no mean proficient in the culinary art and as refined a gourmand as the dear departed dr kitchenera man to whose honour i have a great mind to devote an episode and would do so were not my poor shipmate dr thompson just now waiting for me to relieve him from his illness no sooner did our clever medical attendant understand his destination than he sent away his plate untouched at dinnerrefused his wine talked movingly of broken constitutions a predisposition to anasarea and the deceitful and dangerous appearances of florid health at supper he pronounced himself a lost man held out his brawny fist to whomsoever would choose to feel his pulse and sent for the first assistantsurgeon to make him up a tremendous quantity of prescriptions to be exhibited the ensuing nightto whatever fish might be so unfortunate as to be swimming alongside after this display and whilst he was languidly sipping a tumbler of barleywater the honourable mr b our junior luff was loud in his complaints of being what he called fairly entrapped when dr thompson in a feeble and tremulous voice read him a long lecture on patriotism obedience to the dictates of duty and selfdevotion finishing thusby heaven show me the man that flinches from his duty and ill show you whatever may be his outward bearing a craven at heart i am very illi feel that i am fast sinking into a premature gravebut what of that i should be but too happy if i could make my dying struggles subservient to my country my body mr farmermr wade this poor temple of mine contains an insidious enemya strange a dreadful and a wasting disease it is necessary for the sake of medical science for my countrys good for the health of the world at large that my death which will speedily happen should take place in england in order that after dissolution i may be dissected by the first operators viewed by the most intelligent of the faculty and thus another light be placed on the present dark paths of curative knowledge my symptoms are momentarily growing worse gentlemen messmates friends i must leave you for the night and too soon i fear for ever but never shrink your duty if they be the last words that i shall utter to youhumble though i bei may venture to hold myself up to you as a pattern of selfdevotion god bless you allgood nightand never shirk your duty of course the company to whom this was addressed were infinitely amused at this display and the thirdlieutenant observed mournfully now theres no chance for me the fat rogue is going to invalid himself i suppose that i need not trouble my liver to be diseased just now for the hypocrite wont allow another man in the ship to be sick but himself the gentlemen guessed rightly all the next day dr thompson kept his cot and was duly reported to the captain as dangerously ill now our firstlieutenant was a noble frank yet sensible and shrewd fellow and the captain was as mischiefloving wicked little devil as ever grinned over a spiteful frolic they held a consultation upon the case and soon came to a more decided opinion on it than the gentlemen of the faculty generally do on such occasions now whilst the doctor is plotting to prove himself desperately and almost hopelessly sick and the captain and mr farmer to make him suddenly well in spite of himself i shall take the opportunity of displaying my own heroic deeds when placed in the first independent command ever conferred upon me jason with his argonauts went to bear away the golden fleece columbus and his heroes to give a world to the sovereign of spain and i with two little boys pushed out of the cove perilously to procure some sand in the dingy nothing elevates a biography like appropriate comparison but i doubt whether either jason or columbus felt a more enthusiastic glow pervade their frames when each saw himself fairly under sail for unknown seas than i did when i seized the tiller of the dinghy which was by the bye a stick not at all bigger than that which i had not many months before used in trundling my hoop chapter thirty four a little boat with a large cargoworse than the drift of a dull argument ralph finds drifting across the atlantiche meets with land at length and a real irish welcomepotatoes and poteen and much more fur than furniture but this little boat as it so often bore caesar and his fortunes and our surgeon and his fat deserves and shall have a more than passing notice it was perhaps one of the smallest crafts that ever braved the seas such a floating miniature you may have conceived gulliver to be placed in when he was sighed across the tub of water by his brobdignag princess woefully and timorously manys the time and oft did the obese doctor eye it from the gangway when asking for a boat the firstlieutenant smiling benignantly would reply doctor take the dinghy it was all that the dinghy could do to take the doctor then the care with which he gently deposited himself precisely in the centre of the very small sternsheets would have afforded a fine moral lesson to those who pretend to watch over the safety of states as the little craft laden with this immense pharmacopoeian depositary hobbled over the seas it seemed almost to progress upright and walked the waters like a thing of life for it had a shrewd likeness to a young monkey learning to go upright with its two long arms steadying its uncertain gait the oars making all this resemblance indeed it was so diminutive that it often kept up the two boys that belonged to it from the fresh as well as the salt water they clapping it over their heads by way of an umbrella whenever the clouds poured down a libation too liberal to those curious in philology i convey the information that in the word dinghy the g was pronounced hard this explanation is also necessary to do justice to the pigmy floater as it was always painted in the gayest colours possible it was quite a pet of the firstlieutenants indeed he loved it so much that he took care never to oppress it with his own weight the cove of cork is a fine harbour entered by the means of a somewhat narrow straight i have forgotten the names of all the headlands and points and i am so sick of irish affairs that i do not choose to go into the next room and get the map to refer to for on it there is scarcely a spot that could meet my eye that would not give rise to disagreeable associations so i prefer writing from memory magic memory that gives me now the picture of fiveandtwenty years ago all green and fresh and beautiful on entering the cove there were on the left hand of the strait fortifications and military barracks beyond these to the seaward and just on the elbow of the land that formed the entrance to the strait our firstlieutenant discovered from the taffrail of the frigate a white patch of sand the rest of the shore was rocky ironbound and unapproachable from the sea mr farmer took me aft pointed out to me the just visible spot told me to fetch off as much sand as the dinghy could bear and return with all expedition proud of the commission about four pm the tide running out furiously i ordered the dinghies to be piped away and walking down the side with due dignity with a bucket and a couple of spades we pushed off and soon reached the spot the boat was loaded but in the meantime the tide had left and light and small as she was three little boys could not launch her till almost all the sand had been returned to its native soil all this occupied much time it was nearly dusk when we got her afloat and the wind had got up strongly from off the land it came on to rain and we had not got far from the shore before the tide swept us clean out into the atlantic we were shortly in a situation sufficiently perilous for the heroic there we were three lads whose united years would not have made up those of a middleaged man in a very little boat in a very high sea with a strong gale that would have been very favourable for us if we had wished to steer for new york as we could not make head at all against the combined strength of an adverse wind tide and sea we left off pulling and threw all the sand out of the boat we knew the tide would turn we hoped that the sea might go down and trusted that the wind would change before it was quite dark we had lost sight of the land and i began to feel a little uncomfortable as my boats crew from stem to stern no great distance assured me that we should certainly be swamped in this miserable position of our affairs and when we should have found ourselves very cold if we had not been so hungry and very hungry if we had not been so cold an hibernian mercantile vessel passed us laden with timber and fruit viz potatoes and birchbrooms and they very kindly and opportunely threw us a towrope this drogher that was a large halfdecked cutterrigged vessel made great way through the water and as we were dragged after her we were nearly drowned by the sea splashing over us and had it not been for our sandbucket it is probable that we should have filled in the state of the sea to get on board the drogher from the dinghy was an operation too dangerous to be attempted but before this assistance came what were my feelings no situation could be more disconsolate and apparently more hopeless does not the reader suppose that there was a continual fishing through my bosom of agonised feelings can he not understand that visions of my latelyforsaken green playground came over the black and massive waves and seemed to settle on them as in mockery but were i to dilate upon these horrors would he not weary of them had i been the son of a king thus situated or even the acknowledged offspring of a duke there might have been sympathy but the newlyemancipated schoolboy drowned with two lads just drafted from the marine society in a small boat off the irish coast may be thought a melancholy occurrence but involving nothing of particular interest i see my error if i wish to create an effect i must first prove that i am the son of a duke or a king i have begun at the wrong end however let the reader sneer as he will at my predicament there was something sublime in the scene around me the smallness of the craft magnified the greatness of the waves i literally enjoyed the interesting situation which naval writers who are not nautical of seas running mountains high so rejoice to describe one wave on either hand bounded my horizon they were absolutely mountain waves to me and when our little walnutshell got on the top of one it is no great stretch of metaphor to say that we appeared ascending to the clouds we could not look down upon one wave until we were fairly on the back of another now in a vessel of tolerable size let the sea rage at its worst from the ships decks you always look down upon it excepting now and then when some shortlived giant will poke up its overgrown head but i must remember that i am in tow of the potato craft though she lay well up for the harbours mouth she could not fetch it so she tacked and tacked again until nearly ten oclock at which time we in the dinghy were half frozen and almost wholly drowned the moon was now up though partially obscured by flying rack and in making a land board the honest pat in the command of the sloop shortened the towrope and hailed us telling us when we were well abreast of a little sandy bight to cast off pull in and haul up our boat above highwater mark we took his advice and without much difficulty found ourselves once more on terra firma i cannot help in this place making the reflection of the singular events that the erratic life of a sailor produces here were evidently three lives saved among which was that of the future paragon of reefers and neither the saved nor the saviours knew even the names or saw distinctly the faces of each other how many good and brave actions we sailors do and the careless world knows nothing about them the sailors life is a series of commonplace heroisms well here we are landed on the coast of ireland but in what part we knew not and with every prospect of passing the night under the grandest but in winter the most uncomfortable roof in the world the two lads begged for leave to go up and look for a house but as i had made up my mind that if a loss took place we should be all lost together i would not run the risk of losing my boats crew and finding myselfalone i refused my consent telling them that it was my duty to stay by my boat and theirs to stay by me now this was tolerably firm considering the ducking that i had enjoyed and the hunger cold and weariness that i was then enjoyingenjoying yes enjoying surely i have as much right to enjoy them if i like as the ladies and gentlemen of this metropolis have to enjoy bad health but this epicene state of enjoyment was not long to last a freshcoloured native with a prodigious breadth of face only to be surpassed by his prodigious breadth of shoulders approached and addressed us in a brogue so strong that it would like the boatswains grog have floated a marlinspike and in a stuttering so thick that a horn spoon would have stood upright in it the consequence was that though fellowsubjects we could not understand each other so he went and brought down with him a brawny brother who spoke inglis illigantly anyhow well the proverbial hospitality of the irish suffered no injury in the persons of my irish friends a pressing invitation to their dwelling and to their hospitality was urged upon us in terms and with looks that i felt were the genuine offspring of kindness and generosity of soul but i still demurred to leave my boat when they understood the full force of my objection my friezecoated friend who spoke the illigant inglis explained o by jasus and aint she welcome intirely come along ye little undersized spalpeen with your officer wont you and before i could well understand what they were about the two jontlemen had taken up his majestys vessel under my command had turned it bottom up with several shakes to clear it of the water and sand and with as little difficulty as a farmers boy would have turned upside down a thrushs cage in order to cleanse it after this operation had been performed they righted it and one laying hold of the bow and the other the stern they swung it between them as two washerwomen might a basket of dirty clothes i must confess that i was a great deal mortified at seeing my command treated thus slightingly which mortification was not a little increased by an overture that they kindly made to me saying that if i were at all tired they would with all the pleasure in the world carry me in it i preferred walking officer boats crew guides boats and oars proceeded in this manner for more than half a mile up into the country at length by the moonlight i discovered a row of earthy mounds that i positively at first thought was a parcel of heaps such as i had seen in england under which potatoes are buried for the winter i was undeceived by being welcomed to the town of some place dreadful in as and ghas and with a name so difficult to utter that i could not pronounce it when i attempted and which if i had ever been so fortunate to retain i should for my own comfort have made haste to forget i hope that the finest pisintry in the world are better located now than they were a quarter of a century ago for they are or were a fine peasantry as far as physical organisation can make them and deserve at least to be housed like human beings but what i saw when on that night i entered the mud edifice of my conductors made me start with astonishment in the first place the walls were mud all through and as rough on the inside as the out there was actually no furniture in it of any description and the only implement i saw was a large globular iron pot that stood upon spikes like a carpenters pitchkettle which pot at the moment of my entrance was full of hot recently boiled unskinned fine mealy praties round this there might have been sitting some twelve or fourteen persons of both sexes and various ages none above fiveandtwenty but it must be remembered that the pot was upon the earth and the earth was the floor and the circle was squatted round it at the fireplace each on a threelegged stool sat an elderly man and woman these stools the fastidious may call furniture if they please but were any of my readers placed upon one of them so rough and dirty were they that he or she must have been very naughty did not the stool of repentance prove a more pleasant restingplace among the squatted circle there were a bandylegged drummer and a blotchedfaced fifer from the adjacent barracks both in their regimentals they rose and capped to my uniform we were welcomed with shouts of congratulations my boat was brought in and placed bottomup along one side of the hovel and immediately the keel was occupied by a legion of poultry and half a score of pigs little and big were at the same time to be seen dubbing their snouts under the gunnel on voyages of alimentary discovery i was immediately pulled down between two really handsome lasses in the circle and with something like savage hospitality had my cheeks stuffed with the burning potatoes never was there a more hilarious meeting i and my tom thumb of a boat and my minikin crew i could well understand though my hosts spoke in their mother tongue were the subjects of their incessant and uncontrollable bursts of laughter but with all this they were by no means rude and showed me that sort of respect that servants do to the petted child of their master that is to say they were inclined to be very patronising and very careful of me in spite of myself and to humour me greatly my two boys whom i have so often dignified with the imposing title of my boats crew though treated with less or no respect at all were welcomed in a manner equally kind chapter thirty five ralph figureth at a ball excelleth and afterwards sleepethhe returneth on board and hath both his toils and his sand undervalued and thus discovereth the gratitude of firstlieutenants not yet having sufficiently hibernised my taste to luxuriate on raleighs root plain with salt i begged them to procure me something more placable to an english appetite i gave money to my hosts and they procured me eggs and bacon i might also have had a fowl but i did not wish to devour guests to whom on my boats keel i had given such recent hospitality they returned me my full change and though there was more than enough of what they cooked for me to satisfy myself and boys they would not partake of the remains until i assured them that if they did not i would throw them away at this intimation they disappeared in a twinkling then came the whiskeythe real dew i never touched it i have before stated that for three years i abstained from all spirituous liquors my lads had made no such resolution the big iron pot was now like an honest old sailor that had done his duty kicked aside the corner the drummer and fifer seating themselves on the keel of the inverted dinghy and struck up a lilt and off they went so gaily o more lads and lasses came in and jigs and reels succeeded each other with such rapidity that notwithstanding the copious supplies of whiskey the drummers arms failed him and the fifer had almost blown himself into an atrophy did i dance to be sure i did and right merrily too i had such pleasant fairhaired rosy hebelike instructresses ready to tear each others eyes out to get me for a partner then they talked irish so musically and put the kings english to death so charmingly that notwithstanding the heat and smoke of the cabin was upon them and the whiskey did more than heighten the colour on their lips they were really enchanting though stockingless creatures it has been truly said that in the social circle the extremes as to manners almost meet these ladies i suppose had gone so far beyond vulgarity that they were now converging to the superior tone and frank degagement of the upper classes positively it never struck me that i was in vulgar company i then of course could have been but an indifferent judge but i have thought of it often since and must say that in the degrading sense of the word my company of that night was not vulgar it was pastoral and perhaps barbarous but everything was natural and everything free from pretension i did not often again though i have danced with spirits as unwearied dance with a heart so light during this festive evening i saw no indications of that pugnacity so inseparable with irish hilarity though there were assembled a dozen of as pretty broths of boys as ever practised skull salutation at donybrook fair at length about one in the morning the whiskey had overpowered my boats crew and the whisking myself they made up a lair for me with abundant greatcoats in the corner of the room and my eyes gradually closed in sleep catching till they were finally sealed up every now and then twinklings of bare legs and wellturned ankles mingled with the clatter of heavy brogues and the drone of a bagpipe that had now superseded the squeak of the fife and the rattle of the drum i certainly did dream i suppose about an hour after i had fallen asleep of the clattering of sticks the squalling of women and the cursing of men and i felt an indistinct sensation as if people were practising leaping over my body and finally as if some softrounded figure had caught me in her arms i was so terribly oppressed with fatigue that i could not awake and as the last part of my dream gave me so sweet an idea of happiness and security if i may use the expression i shall say as every novelist has a right to do once in his three volumesi was lapped in elysium everything was oblivion until i was awakened by one of my lads at eight in the morning and i arose refreshed though a little stiff the hardened clay which composed the floor was neatly swept up the pigs and the poultry were driven out and a good fire was blazing under the chimney of all the party of the night before there remained only the two fine young men who brought me and my boat up the elderly couple and two blooming girls with the youngest of whom i had danced almost the whole of the previous evening i observed on one of the young men a tremendous black eye that certainly was not there the day before and the other had his temples carefully bandaged and both my boatboys complained of being kicked and trampled on during the night yet i am not so ungrateful upon such slender evidence as to assert that the dance had ended in a scrimmage or so presumptuous as to say in what manner i thought that i had been protected during the row if there had been one my hosts had nothing to offer me for breakfast but a thin and by no means tempting pot of hot meal and water i certainly did taste a little that i might not seem to disrespect the pretty norah who had prepared it for me and strove to make it palatable by a lump of butter a delicacy that was offered to no one else as i was impatient to be off i kissed the girls heartily yes heartily shook hands with the sons and prepared for my departure after having with considerable difficulty forced a halfguinea upon my hosts i begged to know the names of those to whose hospitality i was so much indebted and as well as memory will serve me at this distance of time i think they were specimens of what excellent otooles potatoes are capable of producing we then resumed our procession down to the beach i walking first bearing the boathook pikeways followed by the boat itself borne between the two athletic tooles and the procession was closed by the boats crew each with his oar upon his shoulder we were soon launched and instructed as to the course we were to take the wind and sea had gone down and the tide was favourable we had to pull about five miles to get round the bluff when we arrived at the sandy little nook from which we had made our involuntary excursion to sea the night before the spirit of obedience to orders was strong upon me and in spite of the remonstrance of the boys i went in and loaded the dinghy nearly down to the gunnel with the sand for which we had been so much perilled after all my dangers i got safely on board before noon much to the surprise of all on board who had given us up as lost and there already had been a coolness between the captain and the firstlieutenant on my account this coolness promised a warm reception for myself and i got it so occupied had mr farmer been all the day before with taking in irish beef and pork for the west indian storehouses and extra water to supply any of the convoy that might fall short of that necessary article that he had totally forgotten the sand expedition and it was eight in the evening just at the time that i was in the words of the song far far at sea that he was reminded of it mr silva the secondlieutenant begged as a favour that a boat might be lent him just to put him alongside the roebuck one of the two eighteengun brigs that was to accompany us as whippersin to the convoy as the captain was not expected on board till late mr farmer had not much hesitation in granting the request with the usual take the dinghy mr silva but just then the atlantic had been beforehand with him the dinghy had not returned she had been last seen at the sandy nook to which she had been sent the barge and cutter were immediately manned and sent to look for me they easily got to the place where i was seen loading and found the sand disturbed and nothing else they returned with some difficulty against the headwind and of course made a most disheartening report when the captain returned he was dreadfully angry well as i crept up the side sneakingly not very well knowing whether i were to enact the hero or the culprit i concocted a speech that was doomed to share the fate of the lost inventions i saw the captain and mr farmer pacing the deck but both decidedly with their duty faces on touching my hat very submissively i said sheepishly ive come on board sir and you young blackguard ive a great mind to do what mr farmer said captain reud interposing now i can assure the reader twentyfive years ago when we had nearly cleared the seas of every enemy and the british pennant was really a whip which had flogged every opponent of the ocean the young gentlemen were sometimes flogged too and more often called young blackguards than by any other title of honour all this is altered for the better now we dont abuse each other or flog among ourselves so muchand the next war i make no doubt what we have spared to ourselves we shall bestow upon our enemies i mention this that the reader may not suppose that i am coarse in depicting the occasional looseness of the naval manners of the times to punish him for staying out all night without leave thats a great fault certainly said the captain slily pray mr rattlin what induced you to commit it please sir i wasnt induced at all i was regularly blown out and now i am as regularly blown come sir ill be your friend and not permit you to finish your sentence if its a fair question mr rattlin may i presume to ask where you slept last night with the two misses otooles said i for really the young ladies were uppermost in my thoughts you young reprobate what with both said the captain grinning yes sir for i now began to feel myself safe and mr and mrs otoole and mr cornelius otoole who has red hair and mr phelim otoole who has a black eyeand the poultry and the pigs and the boats crew and where was the boat all this time sleeping with us too sir i then shortly detailed what had happened to me which amused the captain much and so he continued after all you have brought off the sand i really commend your perseverance a bucket of sand was handed up and mr farmer contemptuously filtered it through his fingers then turning to me wrathfully exclaimed how dare you bring off for sand such shelly pebbly gritty stuff as this sir if you please sir i had no hand in putting it where i found it and i only obeyed orders in bringing it off for i really felt it to be very unjust to be blamed for the act of nature and especially as three lives had been endangered to procure a few buckets of worthless earth the captain thought so too for he said to mr farmer very coldly i think you should have ascertained the quality of the sand before you sent for it and i dont think that you should have sent for it at all towards nightfall and at the beginning of ebb tide youngster you shall dine with me today and give me a history of the otooles chapter thirty six an invaliding suitthe cards well played and by a trumpthe odd trick however in much dangerthe doctor finesses with a good heart but diamonds are cutting articles two days had elapsed after my incursions upon the wild irishers during which our surgeon had kept himself closely to his cabin when he wrote a letter on service to the captain requesting a survey upon his selflibelled rotundity of body the captain according to the laws of the service in that case made and provided forwarded the letter to the portadmiral who appointed the following day for the awful inspection as i said before the skipper and his firstlieutenant had laid down a scheme of a counterplot and they now began to put it into execution immediately that dr thompson had received his answer he began to dose himself immoderately with tartarised antimony and other drugs to give his round and hitherto ruddy countenance the pallor of disease he commenced getting up his invaliding suit it had been a great puzzle to his brother officers to understand what two weasanfaced mechanicallooking men from the shore had been doing in his cabin the greater part of the night they did not believe as the doctor intimated that they were functionaries of the law taking instructions for his last will and testament though the astute surgeon had sent a note to mr farmer the firstlieutenant with what he thought infinite cunning to know in case of anything fatal happening immediately to the writer whether his friend would prefer to have bequeathed to him the testators doublebarrelled fowling piece or his superb mantons duellingpistols mr farmer replied that he would very willingly take his chance of both at twelve oclock everything was ready the survey was to take place in the captains cabin dr thompson sends for his two assistants and then for the first time for three days he emerges leaning heavily upon both his supporters can this be the jovial and rubicund doctor whose deadly white face is that that peers out from under the shadow of an immense green shade the lips are lividthe corners of the mouth drawn downand yet there is a triumphant sneer in their very depression the officers gather round him he lifts up his head slowly and then looks round and shakes it despondingly his eyes are dreadfully bloodshot his messmates the young ones especially begin to think that his illness is real there is the real sympathy of condolence in the greetings of all but the hardaweather master the witty purser and the obdurate first the invalid was apparelled in an ancient roastbeef uniform coat bottlegreen from age the waistcoat had flaps indicative of fifty years antiquity and the breeches were indescribable he wore large blueworsted stockings folded up outside above the knee but carefully wrinkled and disordered over the calf of the leg in order to conceal its healthy mass of muscle big as was the doctor his clothes were all as shakespeare has it a world too big though we cannot finish the quotation by adding for his shrunk shank instead of two lawyers clerks the sly rogue had had two industrious snips closeted with him for the purpose of enlarging this particular suit of clothes to the utmost in the name of ten thousand decencies doctor exclaimed mr farmer who made you that figure disease was the palsied and sepulchral reply but the clothesthe clothesthese incomprehensible clothes are good enough to die in but i doubt said the purser whether either they or their wearer be good enough to die there was a laugh but it was not infectious as respected the occasion of it he shook his head mournfully and said the flippancy of rude healththe inconsiderate laugh of strong youth with much difficulty he permitted himself to be partly carried up the ladder and seated in all the dignity of suffering in a chair in the forecabin the two assistants standing one on each side of him in mute observation it is twelve oclockhalfpast twelveonetwo the captain is coming on boardtell the officersthe side is mannedthe boatswain pipes and the little great man arrives and attended by mr farmer enters the cabin prepared as he was for a deception even he starts back with surprise at the figure before him with one hand upon a shoulder of each of his assistants the doctor with an asthmatical effort rises well doctor how are you the doctor shook his head matters have gone a great length i see another shake eloquent with suffering and despondency i understand from my friend here mr farmer and he were friends sometimes for half an hour together that with christian providence you have been making your will now my dear doctor it is true that we have hardly been three months associated but that time short as it is has given me the highest opinion of your convivial qualities your professional skill and the great depth of your understanding deep very deep you must not class me among the mean herd of legacyhunters but i would willingly have some token by which to remember so excellent a man and an officer so able and so unshrinking in the performance of his duties there is my tobaccobox said the doctor with feeble malice for though chewing the weed cannot cure it can conceal a bad breath the captain winced it was a thrust with a doubleedged sword he was what we now call an exquisite in person and one to whom the idea of chewing tobacco was abhorrent whilst he was actually and distressingly troubled with the infirmity hinted at for a moment the suavity of his manner was destroyed and he forgot the respect due to the dying damn the tobacco boxand damn thatnever mindno no doctor you had better order the box to be buried with you for nobody could use it after you but if i might presume so farmight use the very great liberty to make a selection i would request entreat nay implore you to leave me the whole suit of clothes in which you are now standing and if you would be so considerate so kind so generous by god ill have them stuffed and preserved as a curiosity captain reud you are too good mr staples turning helplessly to his assistant get me immediately an effervescing draught excuse my sittingi am very faintyou are so kindyou quite overcome me no not yet said the captain in a dry tone but full of meaning i may perhaps byandby when you know more of me but nowo no however ill do my best to make you grateful and im sorry to acquaint you that the admiral has put off the survey till twelve oclock tomorrow when i trust that you will be as well prepared as you are now dont be dejected doctor you have the consolation of knowing that if you die in the meantime all the annoyance of the examination will be saved you in the interim dont forget the old clothesthe invaliding suit my clerk shall step down with you into the cabin and tack a memorandum on by way of codicil to your will dont omit those highquartered squaretoed shoes with the brass buckles if you would promise to wear them out yourself no no but i promise to put them on when i am going to invalid or to lend them to mr farmer or any other friend on a similar occasion i hope said mr farmer that i shall never stand in the doctors shoes i hope you never willnor in captain reuds either the gallant commander turned from yellow to black at this innuendo which was for many reasons particularly disagreeable seeing that he was bagging to leeward like a westcountry barge laden with a haystack in this sailingmatch of wits he broke up the conference by observing you had better doctor in consideration of your weakness retire to your cabin i certainly cannot seeing my near prospect of your invaluable legacy in any honesty wish you better with all due precautions hesitations and restings dr thompson reached his cabin and i doubt not as he descended enervated as he was but that he placed like oconnell a vow in heaven that if ever captain reud fell under his surgical claws the active operations of dr sangrado should be in their celerity even as the progress of the sloth compared with the despatch and energy with which he would proceed on the coveted opportunity when he was alone he was overheard to murmur stand in my shoesthe ignorant puppies i shall see one of them if not both in their shrouds yet stand in my shoes it is true the buckles are but brass but they are shoes whose latchets they are not worthy to unloose there was then another day for the poor doctor of fasting tartarised antimony and irritating eyesalve and the captain no doubt in secret understanding with the admiral played off the same trick the survey was deferred from day to day for six days and until the very one before the ship weighed anchor it must have been a period of intense vexation and bodily suffering to the manoeuvring doctor each day as he made his appearance at noon in the captains cabin he had to wait in miserable state his hour and a half or two hours and then to meet the gibing salutation of the captain of not dead yet doctor with his jokes upon the invaliding suit the misery of the deception and the sufferings that he was forced to selfimpose to keep it up as he afterwards confessed had nearly conquered him on the third day that he was a man of the most enduring courage to brave a whole week of such martyrdom must be conceded to him had the farce continued a day or two longer he would have had the disagreeable option forced upon him either of being seriously ill or of returning instanter to excellent health chapter thirty seven valid reasons for invalidingthe patient cured in spite of himselfand a lecture on disease in general with a particular case of instruments as expositors at length the important day arrived on which the survey did assemble the large table in the cabin was duly littered over with paper and medical books and supplied with pens and ink three postcaptains in gallant array with swords by their sides our own captain being one and three surgeons with lancets in their pockets congregated with grave politeness and taking their chairs according to precedency of rank formed the hygeian court a fitting preparation was necessary so the captains began to debate upon the various pretensions of the beautiful phrynes of corkthe three medical men whether the plague was contagious or infectious or bothor neither at the precise moment when captain reud was maintaining the superiority of the attractions of a blonde daphne against the assertions of a champion of a dark phyllis and the eldest surgeon had been by the heat of the argument carried so far as to maintain in asserting the noninfectious and noncontagious nature of the plague that you could not give it a man by inoculating him with its virus the patient on whose case they had met to decide appeared in addition to the green shade our doctor had enwrapped his throat with an immense scarlet comforter so that the reflection of the green above and the contrast with the colour below made the pallor of his face still more lividly pale he was well got up captain reud nodded to the surgeons to go on and he proceeded with his own argument thus there were two debates at this time proceeding with much heat and with just so much acrimony as to make them highly interesting with the noble posts it was one to two that is our captain the daphneite had drawn upon him the other two captains both of whom were phyllisites when a man has to argue against two and is not quite certain of being in the right either he has nothing for it but to be very loud now men divine as they are have some things in common with the canine species go into a village and you will observe that when one cur begins to yelp every dogs ear catches the sound bristles up and every throat is opened in clamorous emulation captain reud talked fast as well as loud so he was nearly upon a par with his opponents who only talked loud at the other end of the table the odds were two to one which is not always the same as one to two that is the two older surgeons were opposed to the youngest these three were just as loud within one notethe note under being the tribute they unconciously paid to naval disciplineas the three captains both parties were descanting upon plagues i say sir said the little surgeon who was the eldest it is not infectious but here comes dr thompson now the erudite doctor from the first had no great chance captain reud had determined he should not be invalided the two other captains cared nothing at all about the matter but of course would not be so impolitic as to differ from their superior officeran officer too of large interest and the amphytrion of the day for when they had performed those duties for which they were so well fitted their medical ones they were to dine on the scene of their arduous labours the eldest surgeon had rather a bias against the doctor as he could not legally put md against his own name the next in seniority was entirely adverse to the invaliding as without he could invalide too he would have to go to the west indies in the place of our surgeon the youngest was indifferent just then to anything but to confute the other two and prove the plague infectious but here comes dr thompsonill appeal to him said noninfection but the appeal was unfortunate both for the appealer and the doctor the latter was an infectionist so there was no longer any odds but two against two and away they went our friend in the wide coat forgot he was sick and his adversaries that they had to verify it they sought to verify nothing but their dogmas they waxed loud then cuttingly polite then slaughteringly sarcastic and at last exceeding wroth i tell you sir that i have written a volume on the subject had you no friend near you said dr thompson at that most unfortunate time i tell you sir i will never argue with anyone on the subject unless he have read my latin treatise de natura pestium et pestilentiarum then youll never argue but with yourself said the stout young surgeon then arose the voices of the men militant over those of the men curative the finest eye vociferated our skipper captain templar that ever beamed from mortal its lovely blue contrasted with her white skin is just like a washerwomans stoneblue bag among her soapsudsstony enough here the medical voices preponderated and expressions such as these became distinctdo you accuse me of ignorance sirrr no sirrr i merely assert that you know nothing at all of the matter in the midst of this uproar i was walking the quarterdeck with the purser what a terrible noise they are making in the cabin i observed what can they be doing invaliding the surgeon said the marine officer who had just joined us looking wise doubted said the purser what a dreadful operation it must be said a young irish younggentlemen all young gentlemen in the navy are not young but for the honour of the service he might take it any how for the life of him the very thing he is trying to do was the pursers reply but let us return to the cabin and collect what we can here and record the sentences as they obtain the mastery at either end of the table look at her step said a captain speaking of his lady tottering feeble zigzag said a surgeon speaking of one stricken with the plague her fine open ivory brow is marked all over with disgusting pustules her breath is oh her delicious breath noisome poisonous corruption in fact her whole lovely body is a region of pestilent discolorations and foul sores and roared out captain templar if you would but pass a single hour in her company you would assuredly repent of your temerity said the obstinate contagionist this confusion lasted about a quarter of an hour a time sufficient in all conscience to invalide a west indian regiment well gentlemen said captain reud rising a little chafed have you come to a conclusion upon this very plain case i see the doctor looks better alreadyhis face is no longer pale i tell you what said the senior surgeon rising abruptly with the others since you will neither listen to me to reason nor to my book though i will not answer for the sanity of your mind i will for that of your body my duty sir my duty will not permit me to invalide you never saw a healthier man in my life said the second surgeon never mind doctor said the third we have fairly beaten them in the argument the gallant captains burst out into obstreperous laughter and so the survey was broken up and the principal surgeons declared that our poor doctor was in sound health because they found him unsound in his opinions the three surgeons took their departure the eldest saying with a grim smile to thompson it may correct some errors and prepare you for next invaliding day shall i send you my book de natura pestium et pestilentiarum the jolly doctor with a smile equally grim thanked him and formally declined the gift assuring him that at the present time the ship was well stocked with emetics now the good doctor was a wag and the captain for fun a very monkey the aspirant for invaliding sat himself down again at one end of the table as the captains did at the other wine anchovies sandwiches oysters and other light and stimulating viands were produced to make a relishing lunch captain reud threw a triumphant and right merry glance across the table on the silent and discomfited doctor the servant had placed before him a cover and glasses unbidden bring the doctors plate said the captain the doctor was passive the plate was brought filled with luxuries and placed directly under his nose the temptation was terrible he had been fasting and macerating himself for eight or nine days he glared upon it with a gloomy longing he then looked up wistfully and a droll smile mantled across his vast face and eddied in the holes of his deep pockmarks a glass of wine doctor the decanter was pushed before him and his glass filled by the servant the doctor shook his head and said i dare not but will put it to my lips in courtesy he did so and when the glass reached the table it was empty he then began gradually to unwind his huge woollen comforter and when he thought himself unobserved he stole the encumbrance into his ample coatpocket he next proceeded to toss about with a careless abstraction the large masses of cold fowl and ham in his plate and by some unimaginable process without the use of his knife he contrived to separate them into edible pieces they disappeared rapidly and the plate was almost as soon empty as the wineglass the green shade by some unaccountable accident now fell from his eyes and instead of again fixing it on it found its way to the pocket to keep company with the comforter near him stood a dish of delicious oysters the which he silently coaxed towards his empty plate and sent the contents furtively down his much wronged throat the other gentlemen watched these operations with mute delight and after a space captain templar challenged him to a bumper which was taken and swallowed without much squeamishness the doctor found that he had still a difficult task to play he knew that his artifice was discovered and that the best way to repair the error was to boldly throw off the transparent disguise the presence of the two stranger captains was still a restraint upon him at length he cast his eyes upon captain reud and putting into his countenance the drollest look of deprecation mingled with fun said plaintively are we friends captain reud the best in the world doctor was the quick reply and he rose and extended his open hand doctor thompson rose also and advanced to the head of the table and they shook hands most heartily the two other captains begged to do the same and to congratulate him on his rapid convalescence to prove to you doctor the estimation in which i hold you you shall dine with us and well have a night of it said the skipper oh captain reud captain reud considerreally i cannot get well so fast as that would indicate you must you must gentlemen no man makes better punch consider the punch doctor truly that alters the case as these dolts of surgeons could not fully understand the diagnostics of my disease i suppose i must do my duty for the leetle while longer that i have to live i will do my duty and attend you punctually at five oclock in order to see that there be no deleterious ingredients mingled in the punch saying which he bowed and left the cabin without leaning on the shoulder of either of his assistants but he had yet the worst ordeal to undergoto brave the attack of his messmatesand he did it nobly they were all assembled in the wardroom for those that saw him descend if not there before went immediately and joined him he waddled to the head of the table and when seated exclaimed in a stentorian voice steward a glass of halfandhalf gentlemen i presume you do not understand a medical case steward bring my case of pistols and the cold meat i say you do not understand a medical case but we do yours interrupted two or three voices at once no you dont you may understand that case better shoving his longbarrelled manton duellers on to the middle of the table now gentlemeni do not mean to bullyi am only god help me a weak civil arm of the serviceand whining a littlestill very far from well now ill state my case to you for your satisfaction and to prevent any little mistakes i was lately afflicted with a sort of nondescript atrophy a stagnation of the fluids a congestion of the small bloodvessels and a spasmodic contraction of the finitesimal nerves that threatened very serious consequences at the survey two of the surgeons ignorant quacks that they are broached a most ridiculous opiniona heterodox doctrinea damnable heresy on hearing it my indignation was so much roused that a reaction took place in my system as instantaneous as the effects of a galvanic battery my vital energies rallied the stagnation of my fluids ceased the small bloodvessels that had mutinied returned to their duty and i am happy to say that though now far from enjoying good health i am rapidly approaching it that is my case now for yours as gentlemen we are to be cooped up in this wooden enclosure for months perhaps years it is a duty that we owe to ourselves to promote the happiness of each other by good temper politeness mutual forbearance and kindness in none of these shall you find me wanting and to prove it i will say this muchsingular cases will call forth singular remarks you must be aware that if such be dwelt on too long they will become offensive to me and disturb that union which i am so anxious to promote so let us have done with the subject at oncemake all your remarks nowjoke quiz jeer and flaunt just for one half hourtaking out his watch and laying it gently on the tableby that time i shall have finished my lunch which bytheby i began in the cabin there will be sufficient time for you to say all your smart things on the occasion but if after that i hear any more on the subject by heavens that man who shall dare to twit me with it shall go with me to the nearest shore if in harbouror shoot me or i him across the table at sea now gentlemen begin if you please the devil a word will i ever utter on the matter said farmer and theres my hand upon it nor i nor i and every messmate shook him heartily by the hand and by them the subject was dropped and for ever that evening dr thompson made the captains punch having carefully locked up in his largest teachest his invaliding suit whatever impression this anecdote may make on the reader if it be one injurious to the doctor we beg to tell him that he proved a very blessing to the shipthe kind friend as well as the skilful and tender physician the promoter of every social enjoyment the soother of conflicting passions the interceder for the offending and the peacemaker for all chapter thirty eight pavingstones sometimes prove stumblingblocksa disquisition on the figurative ends by ralph figuring at the masthead thus extending his views upon the subject the next morning at daylight we weighed and by the aid of much firing of guns and the display of unmeasured bunting we got the whole of the convoy out of the cove by noon with two menofwar brigs bringing up the rear shortly after losing sight of land bad weather came on in which poor gubbins was drowned as i have before narrated by the time that we had reached madeira the ships company had settled into good order and formed that concentrated principle which enabled them to act as one man it was a young and a fine crew made up of drafts of twenties and thirties from different vessels thanks to the nepotism of the treasurer of the navy we also began to understand each others characters and to study the captains mischief was his besetting sin naturally malignant he was not but inconsiderate to a degree that would make you think that his heart was really bad one of his greatest pleasures was that of placing people in awkward and ludicrous situations he very soon discovered the fattest men among the masters of the merchant vessels and when we had run far enough to the southward to make sitting in an open boat very unpleasant he would in light winds make a signal for one of his jolly friends to come on board the more especially if he happened to be far astern then began captain reuds enjoyment after two hours hard pulling the master would be seen coming up astern wiping his brows and when within hail reud would shout to him to give awayand just as he reached the stern ladder the maintopsail of the frigate would be shivered and the boat again be left half a mile astern another attempt and another failure the captain meanwhile gloating over the poor mans misery with the suppressed chuckle of delight in which you would fancy a monkey to indulge after he had perpetrated some irreparable mischief however he would generally tease his victim no longer than dinnertime the ship would then be effectively hoveto the halfmelted skipper would get on board and the captain receive him with studied politeness much would i admire the gravity with which he would deplore the impossibility of stopping his majestys ship eos by anything short of an anchor and good holding ground no she would not be hovetogo ahead or go astern she mustbut stand still she could not during this harangue the mystified mariner would look at his commodore much wondering which of the two was the fool but mister stubbs the tormentor would continue it is now nearly six bellsyou have not dined i presume how long have you been making this little distance mister stubbs with a slow accent on the word mister six hoursbless mei would certainly ropesend those lubbers in your boat you must be hungryso must they poor fellows here mr rattlin call them up put a boatkeeper in the boat and let her drop asterntell my steward to give them a good tuckout and a glass of grog mister stubbs youll dine with me and the affair would end by the gratified hoaxed one being sent on board his own vessel about the end of twilight seeing more stars in the heavens than astronomers have yet discovered but these skippers were though very plump but very humble game for our yellowskinned tormentor he nearly drove the third lieutenant mad and that by a series of such delicate persecutions annoyances so artfully veiled and administered in a manner so gentlemanly that complaint on the part of the persecuted instead of exciting commiseration covered him with ridicule this officer was a portuguese nobleman of the name of silvathe don we could never bring our english mouths to usewho had entered our service at a very early age and consequently spoke our language as naturally as ourselves he was surnamed the paviour and when off duty generally so addressed it must not be supposed that he acquired this soubriquet on account of the gentlemen in corduroys laying by their hammers when he walked the street bidding god bless him for he was a very light and elegant figure and singularly handsome at this time i was the youngster of his watch and a great favourite with him the misfortune of his life was that he had written a bookonly one single sinbut it never left himit haunted him through half the ships in the service and finally drove him out of it he had written this book and caused it to be printedand he published it also for nobody else could his bookseller had tried and failed lamentably now don silva was always publishing and never selling his cabin was piled up with several illconditioned cases of great weight which cases laboured under the abominable suspicion of containing the unsold copies as much as ever i could learn of the matter no one ever got farther than the middle of the second page of this volume excepting the printers devils the corrector of the press and the author the book was lent to me but great reader as i am i broke down in attempting to pass the impassible passage the book might have been a good book for aught i or the world knew to the contrary but there was a fatality attending this particular part that was really enough to make one superstitiousnobody could break the charm and get over it i wish that the thought had occurred to me at that time of beginning it at the end and reading it backwards surely in that manner the book might have been got through it was of a winning exterior and tolerable thickness never did an unsound nut look more tempting to be cracked than this volume to be opened and read it had for its title the imposing sentence of a naval and military tour up and down the rio de la plate by don alphonso ribidiero da silva i have before stated that my shipmates were all strangers to each other we had hardly got things to rights after leaving cork when mr silva began as was his custom in the afternoon to publish his book he begged leave to read it to his messmates after dinner and leave was granted with bland frankness he insisted upon the opinions of the company as he proceeded he beganbut the wily purser at once started an objection to the first sentenceyea even to the title he begged to be enlightened as to what sort of tour that was that merely went up and down however the doctor came at this crisis to the assistance of the don and suggested that the river might have turns in it the reader sees how critical we are in a manofwar however in the middle of the second page appeared the fatal passage after having paved our way up the river upon which issue was immediately joined and hot argument ensued the objector of course was the purser and on this point the doctor went over to the enemy all the lieutenants followed the master stood neuter and the marine officer fell asleepthus poor silva stood alone in his glory to fight the unequal battle and in doing so after the manner of authors lost his temper five six seven times was the book begun but like the hackney coaches the audience could not get off the stones the book and the discussion were always closed together in anger just as the author was paving his way as he adopted the phrase with a parental fondness the father was called the paviour all this duly reached the ears of the captain he immediately wrote to don silva requesting his company to dinner particularly soliciting him to bring his excellent work of course the little man took care to have the doctor and purser the claret is on the table the amphytrion settles himself into a right critical attitude but with a most suspicious leer in the corner of his eye our friend begins to read his book exultingly but at the memorable passage as was previously concerted the hue and cry is raised during the janging of argument reud seems undecided and observes that he can only judge the matter from well understanding the previous style and the context and so every now and then requests him with a most persuasive politeness to begin again from the beginning of course he gets no farther than the paving after the baited author had reread his pageandahalf about six or seven times the captain smiles upon him lovingly and says in his most insinuating tones just read it over again once more and we shall never trouble you afterwe shall know it by heart as it was well understood that the author was never to get beyond that passage until he had acknowledged it absurd and egregiously foolish anybody who knows anything about the genus irritabile will be certain that if he lived till the crack of doom don silva would never have passed the rubicon it was thus that the poor fellow was tormented and every time that he was asked to dine in the cabin he was requested to bring his tour in order that the whole of it might be read the best and most imposing manner of writing is to lay down some wise dogma and afterwards prove it by example i shall follow this august method it is unwise for a midshipman to argue with the lieutenant of the watch whilst there are three lofty mastheads unoccupied qed one morning after a literary skirmish in the captains cabin the overnight mr silva smiled me over to him on his side of the quarterdeck just as day was breaking the weather was beautiful and we had got well into the trade winds mr rattlin said he you have not yet read my book you are very young but you have had a liberal education i bowed with flattered humility i will lend it to youyou shall read it and as a youthful yet a clever scholargive me your opinion of itbe candid i suppose you have heard the trivial foolish spiteful objection started against a passage i have employed in the second page and he takes a copy out of his pocket and begins to read it to me until he comes to after having paved our way up the river he then enters into a long justificatory argument the gravamen of which was to prove that in figurative phrases a great latitude of expression was not only admissible but often elegant i begged leave in assenting to his doctrine to differ from his application of it as we ought not to risk by using a figurative expression the exciting of any absurd images or catachrestical ideas the author began to warm and terminated my gentle representation by ordering me over to leeward with this pompous speech i tell you what sir your friends have spent their money and your tutors their time upon you to little purpose for know sir that when progress is to be made anywhere in any shape or in any manner a more appropriate phrase than paving your way cannot be usedsend the topmen aloft to loose the topgallant sails checked though not humbled i repeat the necessary orders and no sooner do i see the men on the rattlings than i squeak out at the top of my voice pave your way up the riggingpave your way you lubbers the men stop for a moment grin at me with astonishment and then scamper up like so many partycoloured devils mr rattlin pave your way up to the masthead and stay there till i call you down said the angry lieutenant and thus through my love for the figurative for the first time i tasted the delights of a mastheading chapter thirty nine ralph regenerateth himself and becometh good for halfanhoursingeth one verse of a hymn escheweth telling one lie and getteth his reward in being asked to breakfast what a nice varied sentimental joyous lachrymose objurgatory laudatory reflective volume might be made entitled meditations at the masthead when i found myself comfortably established in my aery domicile i first looked down on the vessel below with a feeling nearly akin to pity then around me with a positive feeling of rapture and at length above me with a heartwarming glow of adoration perched up at a height so great the decks of the frigate looked extremely long and narrow and the foreshortened view one has of those upon it makes them look but little bigger or more important than so many puppets beneath me i saw the discontented author of my elevation and of a tour up and down the rio de la plate skipping actively here and there to avoid the splashing necessary in washing the decks i could not help comparing the annoyance of this involuntary dance with the afterguard this croissez with clattering buckets and dos a dosing with wet swabs with my comfortable and commanding recumbency upon the crosstrees i looked down upon lieutenant silva and pitied him i looked around me and my heart was exceeding glad the upper rim of the sun was dallying with a crimson cloud whilst the greater part of his disc was still below the welldefined deepblue horizon all above him to the zenith was chequered with small vapours layer over layer like the scales of a breastplate of burnished gold the little waves were mantling dimpling and seemed playfully striving to emulate the intenser glories of the heavens above they now flashed into living light now assumed the blushing hue of a rosebud and here and there wreathed up into a diminutive foam mocking the smile of youth when she shows her white teeth between her beautybreathing lips as i swung aloft with a motion gentle as that of the cradled infant and looked out upon the splendours beneath and around me my bosom swelled with the most rapturous emotions everywhere as far as my eye could reach the transparent and beryldyed waters were speckled with white sails actually blushing rosy red with the morning beams far far astern hull down were the huge dull sailers spreading all their studdingsails to the wind reminding me of frightened swans with expanded wings conspicuous among these were the two menofwar brigs obliquely sailing now here and then there and ever and anon firing a gun whose mimic thunder came with melodious resonance over the waters whilst the manycoloured signals were continually flying and shifting they were the hawks among the covey of the larger whiteplumed birds at this moment our gallant frigate like a youthful and a regal giant more majestic from the lightness of her dress walked in conscious superiority in the midst of all she had as i before mentioned just set her topgallant sails in order to take her proud station in the van we now passed vessel after vessel each with a different quantity of canvas set according to her powers of sailing it was altogether a glorious sight and to my feelings excelled in quiet and cheerful sublimity any review however splendid might be the troops or imposing their numbers then the breeze came so freshly and kissingly on my cheek whispering such pleasant things to my excited fancy and invigorating so joyously the fibres of my hearti looked around me and was glad when the soul is big with all good and pure feelings gratitude will be there and at her smiling invitation piety will come cheerfully and clasp her hand surely not that sectarian piety which metes out wrath instead of mercy to an erring world not that piety dealing damnation round the land daily making the pale within which the only few to be saved are folded more and more circumscribed nor even that bigotted sensuous piety which floats on the frankincense that eddies round the marble altar and which if unassisted by the vista of the dark aisle the dimlyseen procession the choral hymn the banner and the relic faints and sees no god no none of these will be the piety of a heart exulting in the beneficence of the allgood then and there why should i have wished to have crept and grovelled under piled and sordid stone since first the aspiring architect spanned the arch at thebes which is not everlasting and lifted the column at rome which is not immortal was there ever dome like that which glowed over my head imagined by the brain of man fretted with golden fires and studded with such glorious clouds that it were almost sinful not to believe that each veiled an angel the vast concave based all around upon the sapphire horizon sprang upwards terminating above me in that deep deep immeasurable blue the best type of eternitywas not this a fitting temple for worship what frankincense was ever equal to that which nature then spread over the wave and through the air all this i sawall this i felt i looked upwards and i was at once enraptured and humbled perhaps then for the first time since i had left my schoolboys haunts i bethought me that there was a god too too often i had heard his awful presence wantonly invoked his sacred name taken in vain lately i had not shuddered at this habitual profanation the work of demoralisation had commenced i knew it then and with this knowledge the first pang of guilty shame entered my bosom i stood up with reverence upon the crosstrees i took off my hat and though i did not even whisper the prayers we had used at school mentally i went through the whole of them when i said to myself i have done those things that i ought not to have done and have left undone those things that i ought to have done i was startled at the measure of sin that i had confessed i think that i was contrite i resolved to amend i gradually flung off the hardness that my late life of recklessness had been encrusting upon my heart i softened towards all who had ever shown me kindness and in my mind i faithfully retraced the last time that i had ever walked to church with her whom i had been fond to deem my mother these silent devotions and these homeharmonised thoughts first chastened and then made me very very happy at last i felt the spirit of blissful serenity so strong upon me that forgetting for a moment to what ridicule i might subject myself i began to sing aloud that morning hymn that i had never omitted for so many years until i had joined the service awake my soul and with the sun and i confess that i sang the whole of the first verse i am sure that no one will sneer at all this the good will notthe wicked dare not the worst of us even if his sin have put on the armour of infidelity must remember the time when he believed in a god of love and loved to believe it for the sake of that period of happiness he will not cannot condemn the expression of feelings and the manifestation of a bliss that he has himself voluntarily and if he would ask his own heart and record the answer miserably cast away however it will be long before i again trouble the reader with anything so outre as that which i have just written many were the days of error and the nights of sin that passed before i again even looked into my own heart the feelings with which i made my masthead orisons are gone and for ever how often and with what bitterness of spirit have i said would that i had then died if there is mercy in heaveni say it with reverencei feel assured that then to have passed away would have been but the closing of the eyes on earth to awaken immediately in the lap of a blissful immortality since then the worlds foot has been upon my breast and i have writhed under the opprobrious weight and with sinful pride and selftrust have though grovelling in the dust returned scorn for scorn and injury for injuryeven wrong for wrong i have been a sad dog and thats the truth but i have been forced to hunt and to house and to howl with dogs much worse than myself and thats equally true maintopmasthead there squeaked out the very disagreeable treble of captain reud who had then come on deck as i was trolling shake off dull sloth and early rise mr rattlin what do you say ay ay sir ay ay sir what were you saying how many sails are there in sight i cant make out sir why not have you counted them now as i before stated i had taken off my hat and was standing up in a fit of natural devotion and the captain no doubt thought that i was bareheaded and shading my eyes the better to reckon the convoy to lie would have been so easy and i was tempted to reply to the question that i had but my better feelings predominated so at the risk of a reprimand i answered not yet sir at this moment mr silva the lieutenant of the watch placed the masthead lookouts and sent the signalman up to assist me in counting the convoy and at the same time the latter bore me a quiet message that when the number was ascertained i might come down i came on deck and gave the report i am very glad mr rattlin said the captain approvingly to see you so attentive to your duty no doubt you went up of your own accord to count the convoy indeed sir said i with a great deal of humility i did not whathow i thought when i came on deck i heard you singing out i was mastheaded sir mastheaded howfor what at this question revenge with her insidious breath came whispering her venom into my ear but a voice to the warnings of which i have too seldom attended seemed to reverberate in the recesses of my heart and say be generous if i had told the truth maliciously i should have assuredly have drawn ridicule and perhaps anger on the head of the lieutenant and approbation to myself i therefore briefly replied for impertinence to mr silva sir and i was amply repaid by the eloquent look that with eyes actually moistened my late persecutor cast upon me i read the look aright and knew from that moment that he was deserving of better things than a continued persecution for having unfortunately misapplied an expression i immediately made a vow that i would read the tour up and down the rio de la plate with exemplary assiduity i am glad said the captain that you candidly acknowledge your offence instead of disrespectfully endeavouring to justify it i hope mr silva that it is not of that extent to preclude me from asking him to breakfast with us this morning by no means said silva his features sparkling with delight he is a good lad i have reason to say a very good lad i understood him and though no explanations ever took place between us we were till he was driven from the ship the most perfect friends well said the captain as he turned go down the quarterdeck ladder you will at the usual time both of you pave your way into the cabin i am sure mr silva you wont object to that though i have not yet made up my mind as to the propriety of the expression so well have the purser and talk it over in a friendly goodhumoured way and saying this he disappeared with a look of merry malignancy that no features but his own could so adequately express the scene at the breakfasttable was of the usual description authority masking illnature under the guise of quizzing on the one hand and literary obstinacy fast resolving itself into deep personal hostility on the other chapter forty how to make a days work easyralph avoideth trouble by anticipating land but is anticipated by the enemya chapter altogether of chasing which it is hoped will pleasantly chase away the readers ennui we had now the usual indications of approaching the land in fact i had made it by my reckoning a fortnight before the nonnautical reader must understand that the young gentlemen are required to send into the captain daily a days work that is an abstract of the course of the ship for the last twentyfour hours the distance run and her whereabouts exactly now with that failing that never left me through life of feeling no interest where there was no difficulty to overcome after i had fully conquered all the various methods of making this calculation to make it all became a great bore so i clapped on more steam and giving the ship more way and allowing every day for forty or fifty miles of westerly currents i by my account ran the eos high and dry upon the island of barbadoes three good weeks before we made the land thus i had the satisfaction of looking on with placid indolence whilst my messmates were furiously handling their gunters scales and straining their eyes over the small printed figures in the distance and departure columns of john hamilton moore of blessed cursed memory in a cabin over degrees fahrenheit that was melting at the same time the youthful navigator and the one miserable pursers dip that tormented rather than enlightened him with its flickering yellow flame as we neared the island greater precautions were taken to preserve the convoy we sailed in more compact order and scarcely progressed at all during the night the whippersin were on the alert for it was well known that this part of the atlantic was infested with numerous small french menofwar and some privateer schooners that morning at length arrived when it was debated strongly whether the faint discoloration that broke the line of the western horizon as seen from the masthead were land or not as daylight became more decided so did the state of our convoy the wolves were hovering round the sheep well down to the southward there was a large squarerigged threemasted vessel fraternising with one of our finest west indiamen the stranger looked tall grim and dark with his courses up but his topgallant sails and royals set the white sails of the merchant vessel and she was under a press of sail were flying in all directions she was hoveto with her studdingsails set and many of her tacks and sheets were flapping to the wind both vessels were hull down from the deck and we well understood what was going forward right astern and directly in the winds eye of us was a flat broad schooner running before the wind with nothing set but her fore staysail as she lifted to the sea at the edge of the horizon her strength of beam was so great and her bulwarks so little above the water that she seemed to make way broadside on rather than to sail in the usual position there was no vessel particularly near her those of the mercantile navy that most enjoyed her propinquity did not seem by the press of sail that they were carrying to think the situation very enviable however the falcon one of our menofwar brigs was between this schooner and all the convoy with the signal flying may i chase but this was not all a whitish haze cleared up to the northward there was a spanking felucca with her long lanteen sails brailed up and sweeping about in the very centre of a knot of dull sailing merchant vessels four of which by their altered courses had evidently been taken possession of reversing the good old adage first come first served we turned our attention to the last appearance we made the signal to the other manofwar brig the curlew to chase and capture the felucca she not being more than two miles distant from her no sooner did the convoy generally begin to find out how matters stood than like a parcel of fussy and frightened old women they began to pop pop pop firing away their one and twopounders in all directions and those farthest from the scene of action serving their guns the quickest and firing the oftenest it seemed to them of but little consequence so long as the guns were fired where the shot fell now this was a great nuisance as it prevented by the smoke it raised our signals from being distinguished even if these belligerents in a a small way had not been so occupied by these demonstrations of their valour from attending to them indeed the volumes of smoke the popping created became very considerable i do not now know if there be any convoy signal in the merchant code equivalent to cease firing if there were at that time i am sure it was displayed but displayed or not the hubbub was on the increase we were at last compelled to fire shot over these pugnacious tubs to quiet them and there was thus acted the singular spectacle of three vessels capturing the convoy whilst the artillery of its principal protector appeared to be incessantly playing upon it having our attention so much divided there was a great deal of activity and bustle though no confusion on our decks we were hoisting out the boats to make the recaptures and dividing the marines into parties to go in each in the midst of all this hurry when mr farmer our gallant firstlieutenant was much heated a droll circumstance occurred the consequence of the indiscriminate firing of the convoy a boat pulled alongside and a little swabman with his face all fire and in an awfully sinful passion jumped on the quarterdeck with something rolled up in a silk handkerchief he was so irritated that whilst he followed the firstlieutenant about for two or three minutes he could not articulate out of my way man mr burn see that all the small arms are ready and handed down into the boat in good order out of my way manwhat the devil do you want muster the pinnaces crew on the starboard gangwaymove all these lubberly marines mr silva if that stupid fool dont cease firing send a shot right into him man man what do you wantwhy dont you speak there sir at last stammered out the little angry master of a brig unfolding his handkerchief and exhibiting a twopound shot in a most filthy condition whatwhat do you think of that sir slap on board of me from the lady jane sirthrough clean through my bulwarks into the cooks slushtub theres murder and piracy for you on the high seasmy slushtub sirmy bulwarks sir damn you and your slushtub tooout of my way sail trimmers aloft and get ready the topmast and topgallant studdingsails am i to have no redress sir is a british subject to have his slushtub cannonaded on the high seas and no redress sir sir sir i tell you sir if you dont do me justice ill go on board and open my fire upon that scoundrelly lady jane now this was something like a gasconade as our irritated friend happened to have but three quakers wooden guns on each side that certainly were not equal to the merits of that apocryphal good dog that could bark though not bitehowever they looked as if they could you had better said captain reud go on board the lady jane and if you are man enough give the master a hiding if im man enough said he jumping with his shot into his boat with ireful alacrity shortly after taking my glass i looked at the lady jane and sure enough there was a pugilistic encounter proceeding on her quarterdeck with all that peculiar gout that characterises englishmen when engaged in that amusement in answer to the signal of the falcon which was astern of the convoy and between it and the gigantic schooner shall i chase we replied no by this time we had thrashed our convoy into something like silence and good order we then signalled to them to close round the falcon and heaveto to the falcon to protect convoy we had now been some time at quarters and everything was ready for chasing and fighting but the fun had already begun to the northward our second manofwar brig the curlew had closed considerably upon the felucca which was evidently endeavouring to make the chase a windward one the brig closed more upon her than she ought it certainly enabled her to fire broadside after broadside upon her but as far as we could perceive with little or no effect in a short time the privateer contrived to get into the winds eye of the manofwar and away they went after the four ships had been taken possession of and which were each making a different course we sent three of the boatsthe barge yawl and pinnaceunder the command of mr silva in order to recapture them of which there was every prospect as the breeze was light and would not probably freshen before ten oclock for however the captured vessels might steer their courses must be weather ones as if they had attempted to run to leeward they must have crossed the body of the convoy having now made our arrangements we turned all our attention to leeward upon the large dark threemasted vessel that still remained hoveto seeming to honour us with but little notice she had taken possession of the finest and largest ship of the convoy long as i have been narrating all these facts i assure the reader they did not occupy ten minutes in action including the monomachia on board of the lady jane just as we had got the ships head towards the stranger with every stitch of canvas crowded upon her and the eightoared cutter manned armed and marined towing astern they had got the captured west indiaman before the wind with everything set the stranger was not long following this example but steered about a sw and by w course whilst his prize ran down nearly due south i have always found in the beginning that the size of the chase is magnified either by the expectations or the fears of the pursuers at first we had no doubt but that the flying vessel was a french frigate as large or nearly as large as ourselves we knew from good authority that a couple of large frigatebuilt ships had evading our blockading cruisers escaped from brest and were playing fine pranks among the west india islands everybody immediately concluded the vessel in view to be one of them if this conjecture should turn out true there would be no easy task before us seeing how much we had crippled ourselves by sending away in the boats so many officers and men it now became a matter of earnest deliberation to which of the two ships we should first turn our attention as the probabilities were great against our capturing both the prince william the captured west indiaman i have before said was the largest and finest ship of the convoy indeed she was nearly as large as ourselves mounted sixteen guns and we had made her a repeating ship and employed her continually in whippingin the bad sailers the chase after her promised to be as as long as would have been the chase after the frenchman mr farmer who was all for fighting and getting his next step of promotion was for nearing the west indiaman a little more sending the cutter to take possession and then do our best to capture the frigate now the cutter pulled eight oars there were two goodlooking jollies with their muskets between their knees stuck up in the bows six in the sternsheets mr pridhomme the enamoured masters mate and the irish young gentleman who had seen as much service and as many years as myself with the coxswain who was steering mr farmer of course measured everybodys courage by his own but i think it was taxing british intrepidity a little too much to expect that nineteen persons in broad daylight should chase in an open boat and which must necessarily pull up a long sternpull of perhaps two or three hours exposed to the fire of those on board and then afterwards supposing that nobody had been either killed or wounded by the ball practice that would have been certainly lavished on the attacking party to get alongside and climb up the lofty side of a vessel as high out of the water as a fiftygun ship we say nothing of the guns that might have been loaded by the captors with grape and the number of men that would infallibly be placed to defend and to navigate so noble a vessel captain reud weighed all this and decided upon making with the frigate the recapture first and then trusting to providence for the other for which decision which i thought most sound he got black looks from the firstlieutenant and some of the officers and certain hints were whispered of dark birds sometimes showing white feathers the sequel proved that the captain acted with the greatest judgment to our utter astonishment we came up hand over hand with a vessel which we before had shrewd suspicions could going free sail very nearly as well as ourselves of course we were now fast leaving the convoy we found that the felucca had worked herself dead to windward and was by this time nearly out of gunshot of the curlew and that the faineant strange schooner had now made sail and was on such a course as approximated her fast to the other privateer the large vessel perceiving our attention solely directed to the capture shortened sail and made demonstrations of rescue at this mr farmer grinned savage approbation and not yet having had a good view of her hull we all thought from her conduct that she was conscious of force we were therefore doubly on the alert in seeing everything in the very best order for fighting the bulkheads of the captains cabin were knocked down and the sheep pigs and poultry gingerly ushered into the hold preparatory to the demolition of their several pens styes and coops on the main deck all this i found very amusing but i must confess to a little anxiety and younker as i was i knew if we came to action that the eighty or ninety men away in the boats would be very severely felt i was also sorry for the absence of mr silva as i had a great yet puerile curiosity to see how a man that had written a book would fight the run of an hour and ahalf brought us nearly alongside the prince william when we expected at the least a ten hours chase it was well we came up so soon the frenchman had clapped forty as illlooking savage vagabonds on board of her as ever made a poor fellow walk the plank they had fully prepared themselves for sinking the cutter as soon as she could come alongside and their means for doing so were most ample as our prisoners came up the sides we soon discovered by the shabby faded and rent uniforms of the two officers among them that they belonged to the french imperial service they bore their reverse of fortune notwithstanding they belonged to a philosophical nation with a very despicable philosophy they stamped with rage and ground their sacres unceasingly between their teeth they could not comprehend how so fine a looking vessel should sail so much like a haystack the mystery was however soon solved the third mate with about half a dozen men had been left on board of her and the provident and gallant young fellow had whilst the frenchmen were so preoccupied in preparing to resist the threatened attack of the boat contrived to pass unobserved overboard from the bows a sparesail loaded with shot that effectually had checked the ships way had the frenchmen turned their attention to that part of the vessel without they had examined narrowly they would have perceived nothing more than a rope towing overboard he certainly ought to have shared with us prizemoney for the recapture but after all he sustained no great loss by not having his name down on the prizelist as nobody but the captain ever got anything for what we did that day he lucky dog got his share in advance many said much more for appointing the messrs isaiahsons and co as our agents they got the money and then as the possession of much cash of other peoples is very impoverishing they became bankrupts paid nothingfarthing in the pound were very much commiserated and the last that we heard of them was that they were living like princes in america upon the miserable wreck of their own property we made of course most anxious and most minute inquiries of messieurs les francois as to the class of vessel to which they belonged and which we were in turn preparing to pursue as might be expected we got from them nothing but contradictory reports but they all agreed in giving us the most conscientious and disinterested advice not to think of irritating her as we should most certainly be blown out of the water we read this backwards if she were strong enough to take us it was their interest that we should engage her and thus their liberation would be effected as it was notwithstanding these many occurrences only eight am when we made the recapture and as the convoy were all still in sight we only put six men in the prince william which in addition to the english still on board were sufficient to take her to the curlew near which vessel the merchantmen had all nestled and orders were transmitted to her commanding officer to see that men enough were put on board the recapture to insure her safety chapter forty one ralph maketh acquaintance with bloody instruments and boweth to the iron messengers of death and is taught to stand fire by being nearly knocked down we now pressed the ship with every stitch of canvas that we could set we had already learned the name of our friend in the distance it was the jean bart indeed at this time almost every fourth french vessel in those seas if its occupation was the cutting of throats was a jean bart however jean bart long before we had done with the prince william had spread a cloud of canvasa dark one it is true and had considerably increased his distance from us it was a chase dead before the wind by nine oclock the breeze had freshened i dont know how it could be otherwise considering the abundance of wishing and votive whistling at ten we got a good sight of johnny crapauds hull from the maintop and found out that she was no frigate i was not at all nervous before but i must confess at this certainty my courage rose considerably i narrowly inspected the condition of the four afterquarter guns my charge and was very impressive on the powderboys as to the necessity of activity coolness and presence of mind dr thompson now came on deck very much lamenting the disordered rites of his breakfast the jocular fellow invited me down into the cockpit to see his preparations in order as he said to keep up my spirits by showing me what excellent arrangements he had made for trepanning my skull or lopping my leg should any accident happen to me i attended him what with the fearnought an amazingly thick cloth of a woollen texture screens and other precautions against fire it was certainly the hottest place in which i had yet ever been the dim yellow yet sufficient light from the lanterns gave a lurid horror to the various ghastly and bloodgreedy instruments that were ostentatiously displayed upon the platform crooked knives that the eye alone assured you were sharp seemed to be twisting with a living anxiety to embrace and separate your flesh and saws appeared to grin at me which to look upon knowing their horrid office actually turned my teeth on edge there were the three assistantsurgeons stripped to their shirts with their sleeves tucked up ready looking anxious keen and something terrified as to the burly doctor with his huge round red face and his coarse jokes he abstracted something from the romantic terrors of the place but added considerably to the disgust it excited as he strongly reminded me of a carcass butcher in full practice no doubt his amiable purpose in bringing me to his den was to frighten me and enjoy my fright be that as it may i took the matter as coolly as the heat of the place would permit me the first lesson in bravery is to assume the appearance of it the second to sustain the appearance and third will find you with all that courage that doth become a man by noon we had a staggering breeze we could now perceive that we were chasing a large corvette though from the endon view we had of her we could not count her ports the eos seemed to fly through the water at one oclock the spars began to complainpreventer braces were rove but no one thought of shortening sail at two oclock we had risen the jean bart so as to clear her broadside from the waters edge as seen from our decks the appetites of the doctor and purser had risen in proportion they made a joint and disconsolate visit to the galley all the fires were put out the hens were cackling and the pigs grunting in dark security among the water casks miserable men there was no prospect of a dinner they were obliged to do detestable penance upon cold fowl and ham liquified with nothing better than claret burgundy and the small solace derivable from the best brandy mixed with filtrated water in most praiseworthy moderation at three oclock we had the jean bart perfectly in sight and we could from the foreyard observe well the motions of those on deck the master was broiling his very red nose over his sextant in the forestay sail netting when it was reported that the frenchman was getting aft his two long brass bow chasers and in half an hour after we had the report from the said brass bellowers themselves followed by the whistling of the shot one wide of the ship but the other smack through our foresail and which must have passed very near the nose of our respectable master most of the officers myself with the rest were standing on the forecastle though not the first shot that i had seen fired in anger it certainly was the first that had ever hissed by me this first salute is always a memorable epoch in the life of a soldier or sailor by the rent the shot made in the foresail it could not have passed more than two yards directly over my head i was taken by surprise everybody knows that the rushing that the shot makes is excessively loud as the illustrious stranger came on board with so much pomp and ceremony i from the impulse of pure courtesy could not do otherwise than bow to it for which act of politeness the firstlieutenant gave me a very considerably tingling box of the ear my angry looks my clenched fists and my threatening attitude told him plainly that it was no want of spirit that made me duck to the shot just as i was passionately exclaiming siriii captain reud put his hand gently on my shoulder and said mr rattlin what are you about mr farmer that blow was not deserved i sir said he drawing himself up proudly ducked to the first shot many a fine fellow that has bobbed to the first has stood out gallantly to the last what could you expect mr farmer from such a mere boy and to strike him fie upon it that blow if the lad had weak nerves though his spirit were as brave as nelsons and as noble as your namesakes that foul blow might have cowed him for ever they are getting ready to fire again was now reported from the foreyard here rattlin continued the captain take my glass seat yourself upon the hammockcloths and tell me if you can make out what they are about two flashes smoke and then the rushing of the shot followed by the loud and ringing report of the brass guns and of the reverberation of metal was heard immediately beneath me one of the shot had struck the fluke of the anchor in the forechains there mr farmer said the captain exultingly did you mark that i knew iti knew it sir he neither moved nor flinchedeven the long tube that he held to his eye never quivered for an instant oh mr farmer if you have the generous heart i give you credit for never never again strike a younker for bobbing at the first or even the fifth shot i was wrong sir was the humble reply i am sorry that i should have given you occasion to make this public reprimand no farmer said the little creole very kindly i did not mean to reprimand only to remonstrate the severest reprimand was given you by mr rattlin himself i could at that moment have hugged the little yellowskinned captain wicked as i knew him to be and stood unmoved the fire of the grape of a twentygun battery but was i not really frightened at the whistling of the shot yes a little chapter forty two its well to have a long spoon when one sips soup with the devilthe captains shot seldom misses it is always a greater proof of courage to stand fire coolly than to fire captain reud i must suppose wished to try the degree of intrepidity of his officers by permitting the chase to give us several weighty objections against any more advance of familiarity on our parts a quarter of a century ago there were some very strange notions prevalent in the navy among which none was more common than that the firing of the bow guns materially checked the speed of the vessel the captain and the firstlieutenant both held this opinion thus we continued to gain upon the corvette and she being emboldened by the impunity with which she cannonaded us fired the more rapidly and with the greater precision as our rent sails and ravelled running rigging began to testify i was rather impatient at this apparent apathy on our parts mr burn the gunner seemed to more than participate in my feelings our two bowguns were very imposinglooking magnates they would deliver a message at three miles distance though it were no less than a missive of eighteen pounds avoirdupois and we were now barely within half that distance mr burn was particularly excellent at two thingsa long shot and the long bow in all the ships that i have sailed i never yet met with his equal at a cool embellished intrepid lie or at the accuracy of his ball practice baron munchausen would have found no mean rival in him at the former and were duels fought with eighteen pounders lord camelford would have been remarkably polite in the company of our master of projectiles i was upon the point of writing that mr burn was burning with ardour i see it writtenit is something worse than a puntherefore per omnes modos et casusheretical and damnableconsequently i beg the reader to consign it to the oblivion with which we cover our bad actions and read thusthe gunner was burning with impatience to show the captain what a valuable officer he commanded the two guns had long been ready and with the lanyard of the lock in his right hand and the rim of his glazed hat in his left he was continually saying shall i give her a shot now captain reud the answer was as provokingly tautologous as a member of parliaments speech who is in aid of the whipperin speaking against time wait a little mr burn well mr rattlin said the fat doctor blowing himself up to me so you have been knightedon the field of battle tooknight banneret of the order of the light bobs i was standing with the captains glass to my eye looking over the hammocks in order to get near me he had been obliged to cling hold of the hammock rails with both hands so that his huge round red face just peeped above the tarpaulin hammock cloths his chin resting upon them no bad type of an angry sun showing his face above the rim of a black cloud through a london november fog take care doctor i sang out for i had seen the flashings of the enemys guns light bobs said the jeering doctor when away flew the upper part of his hat and down he dropped on the deck on that part which nature seems to have purposely padded in order to make the fall of man easy no light bob however said i the doctor arose rubbing with an assiduity that strongly reminded me of my old schoolmaster mr root to your station doctor said the captain harshly spoilt a good hat in trying to make a bad joke and he shuffled himself below your gig captain reud cut all to shivers said a petty officer this was the unkindest cut of all as we were approaching barbados the captain had caused his very handsome gig to be hoisted in from over the stern placed on the thwarts of the launch and it had been in that position only the day before very elaborately painted the irritated commander seized hold of the lanyard of one of the eighteen pounders exclaiming at the same time mr burn when you have got your sight fire the two pieces of artillery simultaneously roared out their thunders the smoke was driven aft immediately and down toppled the three topmasts of the corvette the falling of those masts was a beautiful sight they did not rush down impetuously but stooped themselves gradually and gracefully with all their clouds of canvas a swan in mid air with her drooping wings broken by a shot slowly descending might give you some idea of the view but after the descent of the multitudinous sails the beauty was wholly destroyed where before there careered gallantly and triumphantly before the gale a noble ship now nothing but a wreck appeared painfully to trail along laboriously its tattered and degraded ruins what do you think of that shot mr farmer said the little captain all exultation pray mr rattlin where did mr burns shot fall one of the shot struck the water about half a mile to port sir said i for i was still at my post watching the proceedings o mr burn mr burn what could you be about it is really shameful to throw away his majestys shot in that manner oh mr burn said the captain more in pity than in anger mr burn looked ridiculously foolish o mr burn said i is this all you can show to justify your bragging if ever i fire a shot with the captain again said the mortified gunner may i be rammed crammed and jammed in a mortar and blown to atoms in the space of a quarter of an hour we were alongside of the jean bart she mounted twentytwo guns was crowded with a dirty crew and after taking out most of them and sending plenty of hands on board in two hours more we had got up her spare topmasts before dark everything appeared to be as if nothing had occurred with the exception of the captains gig and the doctors hat and hauling our wind in company with our prize we made sail towards that quarter in which we had left our convoy at daylight next morning we found ourselves again with our convoy mr silva had recaptured the four vessels taken by the felucca the falcon hove in sight about midday she had chased the felucca well to windward when the immense large schooner had intruded herself as a third in the party and she and the felucca as well as i could understand had united and gave the manofwar brig a pretty considerable tarnation licking as brother jonathan hath it she certainly made a very shattered appearance and had lost several men however in the official letter of the commander to captain reud all this was satisfactorily explained he had beaten both and they had struck but owing to night coming on before he could take possession of them they had most infamously escaped in the darkness however it did not much signify as they were now having struck lawful prizes to any english vessel that could lay hold of them i thought at the time that there was no doubt of that the next day we made the land the low island of barbados had the appearance of a highlycultivated garden and the green look so refreshing in a hot country and so dear to me as it reminded me of england chapter forty three a naval dinner with its consequencesa naval argument with its consequences alsothe way down the river paved at last and the process and the person of the unfortunate paviour finally arrested we made but a short stay at little england as the barbadians fondly call their verdant plat and then ran down through all the virgin islands leaving parts of our convoy at their various destinations our recaptured vessels with a midshipman in each also went to the ports to which they were bound when we were abreast of the island of saint domingo our large convoy was reduced to about forty all of which were consigned to the different ports of jamaica our prize corvette was still in company as we intended to take her to port royal we were all in excellent humour luxuriating in the anticipation of our prizemoney and somewhat glorious in making our appearance in a manner so creditable to ourselves and profitable to the admiral on the station all this occupied our minds so much that we had hardly opportunity to think of persecution but some characters can always find time for mischief especially when mischief is but another name for pleasure the activity which mr silva had displayed in making the recaptures had gained him much respect with his messmates and seemed to pave the way for a mutual good understanding however he was invited to dinner with his two constant quizzers the fat doctor and the acute purser just as we had made the east of jamaica i it having been my forenoon watch was consequently invited with the officer of it we had lately been too much occupied to think of annoying each other but those who unfortunately think that they have a prescriptive right to be disagreeable and have a single talent that way the most common of talents seldom violate the advice of the scripture that warns us not to hide that one talent in a napkin we found our sarcastic little skipper in the blandest and most urbane humour he received me with a courtesy that almost made me feel affection for him we found mr farmer the firstlieutenant with him and had it not been for a sly twinkling of the eye of the captain and very significant looks that now and then stole from mr farmer as he caught the expression of his commanders countenance i should have thought that that day there was no minching malicho or anything like mischief meant there were but five of us sat down to table yet the dinner was superb we had or rather the captain supplied himself now with all the luxuries of a tropical climate and those of the temperate were though he could boast of little temperance far from exhausted we had turtle dressed in different ways though our flat friend made his first appearance in the guise of an appetising soup we had stewed guanna a large sort of delicious lizard that most amply repairs the offence done to the eye by his unsightly appearance in conciliating in a wonderful manner all those minute yet important nerves that providence has so bountifully and so numerously spread over the palate the tongue and the uvula the very contemplation of this beneficent arrangement is enough to make a swearing boatswain pious we lacked neither fish beef nor mutton though it is true that the carcasses of the sheep after having been dressed by the butcher and hung up under the halfdeck gave us the consolation of knowing that whilst there was a single one on board we should never be in want of a pooplantern so delicately thin and transparent were the teguments that united the ribs indeed when properly stretched the body would have supplied the place of a drum and but little paring away of the flesh would have fitted the legs and shoulders for drumsticks of fowls we had every variety and the curries were excellent reud kept two experienced cooks one was an indian well versed in all the mysteries of spices and provocatives the other a frenchman who might have taken a high degree in baron rothschilds kitchen which hebrew kitchen is we understand the best appointed in all the christian world the rivals sometimes knocked a pot or so over with its luscious contents in their contests for precedency for cooks and kings have their failings in common but i must confess that their creole master always administered evenhanded justice by very scrupulously flogging them both well we will suppose the dinner done and the west indian dessert on the table and that during the repast the suavity of our host had been exemplary he found some means of putting each of us on good terms with himself at how little expense we can make each other happy the refreshing champagne had circulated two or three times and the pineapples had been scientifically cut by the sovereign hand of the skipper who now in his native regions seemed to have taken to himself an increased portion of life all this time nothing personal or in the least offensive had been uttered the claret that had been cooling all day by the means of evaporation in one of the quarter galleries was produced and the captain ordered a couple of bottles to be placed to each person with the exception of myself having thrown his legs upon another chair than that on which he was sitting he commenced now gentlemen let us enjoy ourselves we have the means before us and we should be very silly not to employ them in a hot country i dont like the trouble of passing the bottle it is a great trouble to me when it is a full one said dr thompson besides the bustle and the exertion destroys the continuity of hightoned and intellectual conversation said captain reud with amiable gravity it is coming now thought i lieutenant silva looked at first embarrassed and then a little stern it was evident that that which the captain was pleased to designate as highlytoned intellectual conversation was despite his literary attainments and the pas of superiority the publishing a book had given him no longer to the authors taste i have been thinking said captain reud placing the forefinger of his left hand with an air of great profundity on the left side of his nose i have been thinking of the very curious fatality that has attached itself to mr silvas excellent work under correction captain reud said silva if you would permit this unfortunate work to sink into the oblivion that perhaps it too much merits you would confer upon me its undeserving author an essential favour by no means i see no reason why i may not be proud of the book and proud of the author mr silva starts providing the book be a good book indeed it is a great thing for me to say that i have the honour to command an officer who has printed a book the mere act evinces great nerve mr silva winces and said the wicked purser captain reud you must be every way the gainer by this the worse the book the greater the courage if mr silvas wit you may test my wit by my book mr if you choose to read it and the author looked scornfully and my courage when we reach port royal and the officer looked magnificently no more of this said the captain i was going to observe that perhaps i am the only officer on the station or even in the fleet that has under my command a live author with the real book that he has published now mr silva we are all comfortable hereno offence is meant to youonly compliment and honour will you permit us to have it read to us at the present meeting we will be all attention we will not deprive you of your winegive the book to the younker if you will be so kind captain reud to promise for yourself and the other gentlemen to raise no discussion upon any particular phrase that may arise the captain did promise we shall presently see how that promise was kept the book was sent for and placed in my hands now i fully opined that at least we should get past the second page i was curiously mistaken here steward said the skipper place half a bottle of claret near mr rattlin when your throat is dry younker you can whet your whistle and when you come to any particular fine paragraph you may wash it down with a glass of wine if thats the case sir i think with submission i ought to have my two bottles before me also but if i follow your directions implicitly captain reud i may get drunk in the first chapter mr silva thanked even a midshipman with a look of real gratitude for this diversion in his favour i had begun to like the man and there might have been a secret sympathy between us as one day it was to be my fate also to write myself author having adjusted ourselves into the most comfortable attitudes that we could assume i began as lord ogleby hath it with good emphasis and good discretion to read the tour up and down the rio de la plate before i began the captain had sent for the master and the honourable mr b so i had a very respectable audience i had no sooner finished the passage after we had paved our way down the river than with one accord and evidently by preconcert every one stretching forth his right hand as do the witches in macbeth roared out stop it was too ludicrous my eyes ran with tears as i laid down the book with outrageous laughter mr silva started to his feet and was leaving the cabin when he was ordered back by captain reud an appearance of amicability was assumed and to the old argument they went baiting the poor author like a bear tied to a stake debating is a thirsty affair the two bottles to each and two more quickly disappeared the wine began to operate and with the combatants discretion was no longer the better part of valour whilst words fell fast and furious i observed something about eight feet long and one high on the deck of the cabin covered with the ensign it looked much like a decorated seat mr silva would not admit the phrase to be improper and consequently his associates would not permit the reading to proceed during most of the time the captain was convulsed with laughter and whenever he saw the commotion at all lulling he immediately by some illtimed remark renewed it to its accustomed fury at length as the seamen say they all had got a cloth in the windthe captain two or threeand it was approaching the time for beating to quarters the finale therefore as previously arranged was acted captain reud rose and steadying himself on his legs by placing one hand on the back of his chair and the other on the shoulder of the gentleman that sat next to him spoke thus gentlemenim no scholarthat isyou comprehend fullyon deck theredont keep that damned tramplingand put me outwhere was i please sir said i you were saying you were no scholar i wasntcouldnt have said so i had the best of educationsbut all my masters were dulldamned dullso they couldnt teach a quick lad like me too quick for themcouldnt overtake me with their damned learning im a straightforward man ive common sensecomcommon sense let us take a common sense view of this excruciationexexi mean exquisite argument gentlemen come here and the captain between two supporters and the rest of the company with mr silva approached the mysterious looking elongated affair that lay covered with the unionjack like the corpse of some lanky giant who had run himself up into a consumption by a growth too rapid the doctor and purser who were doubtlessly in the secret wore each a look of the most perplexing gravitythe captain one of triumphant mischief the rest of us one of the most unfeigned wonder if spluttered out captain reud seesawing over the yet concealed thing if mr paviour you can pave your way down a river my name sir is don alphonso ribidiero da silva said the annoyed lieutenant with a dignified bow well then don alphonso ribsaredearo damned silva if you can pave your way down a river let us see how you can pave it in a small way down this hogtrough full of water plucking away with the assistance of his confederates the ensign that covered it with fools heads roared out the exasperated and i fear not very sober portuguese though i was close by i could not fully comprehend the whole manoeuvre the captain was head and shoulders immersed in the filthy trough which uncleaned was taken from the manger that part of the maindeck directly under the forecastle and filled with salt water the doctor and purser had taken a greater lurch and fallen over it sousing their white waistcoats and wellarranged shirt frills in the dirty mixture the rest of us contrived to keep our legs the ship was running before the wind and rolling considerably and the motion aided by the wine and the act of plucking aside the flag might have precipitated the captain into his unenviable situation he thought otherwise no sooner was he placed upon his feet and his mouth sufficiently clear from the salt water decoction of hogwash than he collared the poor victim of persecution and spluttered out mutinymumumutinysentry gentlemen i call you all to witness that mr silva has laid violent hands upon me the paviour of ways was immediately put under arrest and a marine with a drawn bayonet placed at his cabin door and the captain had to repair damages vowing the most implacable vengeance for having been shoved into his own hogtrough did ever anybody know any good come of hoaxing chapter forty four the palisade banquet and major flushfires anthem to yellow jackwhos afraidthe sands of lifes hourglass will run out rapidly unless well soaked with wine we will despatch the object of persecution in a few words lieutenant silva was given the option of a courtmartial or of exchanging into a sloop of war he chose the latter the captain and his messmates saw him over the side two days after we had anchored in port royal the spiteful commander purposely contrived when his effects were whipped into the boat that one of the heavy suspiciouslooking cases should be swung against the gun and smashed the result was exactly what we all expected the water was strewn with copies in boards of the tour up and down the rio de la plate they must certainly have been light reading as they floated about triumphantly i wonder whether they will pave their way up to kingston said the captain with a sneer as the author would not suffer them to be picked up they sank one by one and disappeared like the remembrance of their creator in the minds of his companions we heard a few weeks after that he had died of the yellow fever and thus he with his books was consigned to oblivion or is only rescued from it if happily this work do not share his fate by this short memento of him yellow fevermalignant consumer of the bravehow shall i adequately apostrophise thee i have looked in thy jaundiced face whilst thy maw seemed insatiate but once didst thou lay thy scorched hand upon my frame but the sweet voice of woman startled thee from thy prey and the flame of love was stronger than even thy desolating fire but now is not the time to tell of this but rather of the eagerness with which most of my companions sought to avoid thee captain reud had got apparently into his natural as well as native climate the hotter it was like a cricket he chirped the louder and enjoyed it the more young and restless he was the personification of mischievous humour and sly annoyance the tales he told of the fever were ominous appalling fatal none could live who had not been seasoned and none could outlive the seasoning for myself i might have been frightened had i not been so constantly occupied in discussing pineapples but the climax was yet to be given to the fears of the fearful all the officers that could be spared from the ship were invited to dine with the mess of the th regiment then doing duty at kingston and port royal that day captain reud having been invited to dine with the admiral at the penn we were consequently deprived of his facetiousness all the lieutenants and the wardroom officers with most of the midshipmen were of the party the master took charge of the frigate suppose us all seated at the long table chequered red and blue with major flushfire the officer in command of the garrison at the top of the table all scarlet and gold and our own dear dr thompson all scarlet and blue at the bottom these two gentlemen were wonderfully alike the majors scarlet was not confined to his regimentals it covered his face there was not a cool spot in that flamecoloured region the yellow of his eyes was bloodshot and his nose was richly bardolphian the expression of his features was thirst but it was a jovial thirst withala thirst that burned to be supplied encouraged pampered the very idea of water was repugnant to it hydrophobia was written upon the majors brow we have described our rubicund doctor before he always looked warm but since his entrance into the tropics he had been more than hot he had been always steaming there was an almost perceptible mist about him his visage possessed not the adust scorch of the majors his was a moist heat his cheeks were constantly parboiling in their own perspiration he was a meet croupier for our host ranged on each side of this noble pair were the long lines of very pale and anxious faces i really must except my own for my face never looked anxious till i thought of marrying or pale till i took to scribbling the possessors of which were experiencing a little the torment of tantalus the palisades those graves of sand turned into a rich compost by the everrecurring burial were directly under the windows and the landbreeze came over them chill and dank in palpable currents through the jalousies into the heated room and had one thrust his head into the moonlight and looked beneath he would have seen hundreds of the shellclad vampires upon their long and contorted legs moving hideously round and scrambling horribly over newlymade mounds each of which contained the still fresh corpse of a warrior or of the land or of the ocean in a small way your landcrab is a most indefatigable resurrectionist but there is retribution for their villany they get eaten in their turn delicate feeding they are doubtlessly and there can be no matter of question but that at that memorable dinner a double banquet was going on upon a most excellent principle of reciprocity the epicure crab was feeding upon the dish man belowwhilst epicure man was feeding upon the dishedup crab above true the guests knew it not i mean those who did not wear testaceous armour the gentlemen in the coats of mail knew very well what they were about it was at the time of which i am speaking a standing joke to make johnny newcome eat landcrab disguised in some savoury dish thank god that was more than a quarter of a century ago we trust that the social qualities and the culinary refinements of the west indians do not now march a lecrevisse and progress a reculons there we all sat prudence coqueting with appetite and the finest yellow curries contending with the direst thoughts of yellow fever ever and anon some amiable youth would dash off a bumper of claret with an air of desperate bravery and then turn pale at the idea of his own temerity the most cautious were scotch assistantsurgeons and pale young ensigns who played the flute the midshipmen feasted and feared the major and the doctor kept on the even tenor of their way that is they ate and drank a lenvi we will now suppose the kings health drank with the hearty and loyal god bless him from every lipthe navy drank and thanks returned by the doctor with his mouth full of vegetable marrowthe army drank and thanks returned by the major after clearing his throat with a bumper of brandyand after rule britannia had ceased echoing along the now silent esplanade and that had been thundered forth with such energy by the black band an awful pause ensues our firstlieutenant of marines rises and like conscience with a still small voice thus delivers himself of the anxiety with which his breast was labouring major flushfire may i claim the privilege of the similar colour of our cloth to entreat the favour of your attention ah hehbut this land breezeladen perhaps with the germs of the yellowfevermephiticand all thatyou understand me dr thompson as much as you do yourself thank youmen of superior educationsympathyand all thatyou understand me fully major now this nightbreeze coming through that halfopen jalousiemiasmataand all that dr armstrong dr thompsonmedical pillpillars of the stateyou will pardon the classical allusion i wont growled out the doctor ahso like youso modestbut dont you think the draught is a little dangerous do you mean the doctors or this said the inattentive and thirsty major fetching a deep breath as he put down the huge glass tumbler of sangaree oh dear noi mean the night draught through the window the best way to dispose of it said the purser nodding at the melting galen no replied major flushfire courteously theres no danger in it at alli like it bless me major said the marine why it comes all in gusts like it all the better rejoined the major with his head again half buried in the sangaree glass degustibus non est disputandum observed thompson very true said the marine officer looking sapiently that remark of yours about the winds is opposite we ought to dispute their entrance as you said in latin but is it quite fair my dear doctor for you and me to converse in latin we may be taking an undue advantage of the rest of the company greek greek said the purser ay certainlyit was greek to mr smallcoates muttered thompson to be sure it was said the innocent marine major flushfire continued he once more upon his legs may i again entreat the honour of your attention dr thompson has just proved by a quotation from a greek author virgil or paracelsus i am not certain which that the entrance of the night air into a hot room is highly injurious and in inand all that you understand me perfectlywould it be asking too much to have all the windows closed ovens and furnaces cried out the chairman starting up look at me and worthy dr thompson are we persons to enjoy a repetition of the black hole of calcutta the sangaree quashasuffocation the thought chokes me and he recommenced his devotions to the sangaree it melts me responded the doctor swabbing his face with the napkin are you afraid of taking cold said the purser to mr smallcoates taking coldlet the gentleman take his wine said the major i must confess i am not so much afraid of cold as of fever i believe major you have been three years in this very singularly hot and cold climate now my dear sir may i tax your experience to tell us which is the better method of living some say temperance carried out even to abstemiousness is the safer others that the fever is best repelled by devils punch burnt brandy and high living indeed i may say that i speak at the request of my messmates do major give us your opinion i think said the man of thirst the medical gentlemen should be applied to in preference to an old soldier like myself they have great practice in disposing of fever cases but if we must die either of diet or the doctor i am for knowing said the purser not what doctor but what sort of diet is most dilatory in its despatch well i will not answer the question but state the facts my messmates can vouch for the truth of them five years ago and not three i came out with a battalion of this regiment we mustered twentyfive officers in all we asked ourselves the very same question you have just asked of me we split into two parties nearly even in number twelve of us took to water temperance and all manner of preservatives the other thirteen of us led a harumscarum life ate whenever we were hungry and when we were not hungry drank whenever we were thirsty and when we were not thirsty and to create a thirst we qualified our claret with brandy and generally forgot the water or substituted madeira for it in making our punch this portion of our body like jack falstaff was given to sleeping on bulkheads on moonlight nights shooting in the midday sun riding races and sometimes hem assistingaaat drinkingmatches here the worthy soldier made a pause appeared more thirsty than ever scolded quasha for not brandying his sangaree and swigging it with the air of alexander when he proceeded to drain the cup that was fatal he looked round with conscious superiority the pale ensign looked more palethe sentimental lieutenants more sentimentalmany thrust their wine and their punch from before them and there was a sudden competition for the waterjug the marine carried a stronger expression than anxiety upon his featuresit was consternationand thus hesitatingly delivered himself andsososir the bons vivantsdeludedpoor deluded gentlemen all perishedbutpardon medelicate dilemmabut yourself my good major exactly mr smallcoates and within the eighteen months there was a perceptible shudder through the company military as well as naval the pure element became in more demand than ever and those who did not actually push away their claret watered it the imperturbable major brandied his sangaree more potently but said mr smallcoates brightening up the temperate gentlemen all escaped the contagionundoubtedly i beg your pardonthey all died within the year i alone remain of all the officers to tell the tale the year eight was dreadful poor fellows the good majors voice faltered and he bent over his sangaree much longer than was necessary to enjoy the draught blank horror passed her fearful glance from guest to guest even the rubicund doctors mouth was twitched awry i did not quite like it myself but im alive said the major rallying up from his bitter recollections and the brandy is just as invigorating and the wine just as refreshing as ever the major is alive said the marine officer very sapiently is that brandy before you mr farmer ill trouble you for iti really feel this claret very cold upon my stomach yes he repeated after taking down a tumblerfull of half spirits half wine the major is aliveandso am i the major is alive went round the table let us drink his health in bumpers the major returned thanks and volunteered a song i begged it and the reader may sing it as he pleases though i shall please myself by recording how the major was pleased to have it sung gentlemen said he you will do me the favour to fill a bumper of lemonade and when i cry chorus chorus me standing with the glasses in your hands and at the end of each chorus you will be pleased to remember that the glass is to be drained no heeltaps after and no daylight before now for it my lads and with a voice that must have startled the land crabs from their avocations he roared out yellow jack yellow jack hie thee hack hie thee back to thy damp drear abode in the jungle ill be sober and staid and drink lemonade try and catch meyoull make a sad bungle yellow jack but he came the queer thief and he seized my righthand and i writhd and i struggled yet could not withstand his hot griping grasp though i drank lemonade he grinnd and he clutchd me though sober and staid chorus with increasing loudness yellow jack yellow jack hie thee back hie thee back to thy damp drear abode in the jungle well be sober and staid and well drink lemonade try and catch usyoull make a sad bungle yellow jack tremendously bumpers of sangaree roared the major and sang yellow jack yellow jack hie thee back hie thee back to thy pestilent swamp quickly hie thee for ill drink sangaree whilst my hearts full of glee in thy deathdoing might ill defy thee yellow jack but the fiend perseverd and got hold of my side how i burnd and i froze and all vainly i tried to get rid of his graspthough i drank sangaree no longer my bosom exulted with glee chorus still more loudly yellow jack yellow jack hie thee back hie thee back to thy pestilent swamp quickly hie thee for well drink sangaree whilst our hearts throb with glee in thy deathdoing might we defy thee yellow jack after the sangaree strong and highly spiced had been quaffed the excitement grew wilder and the leader of our revels exclaimed at the top of his voice wine gentlemen winebrimmers and thus continued yellow jack yellow jack hie thee back hie thee back begone to thy father old sootie pure wine now ill drink so jack i should think of me thou wilt never make booty yellow jack but a third time he came and seized hold of my head twas in vain that the doctor both blisterd and bled my hand and my side and my heart too i think would soon have been lost though pure wine i might drink chorus yellow jack yellow jack hie thee hack hie thee back begone to thy father old sootie pure wine now well drink so jack we should think of us thou wilt never make booty yellow jack brandy shouted the major brandyhes a craven who shirks the call there was no one there craven but myself my youth excused my apostacy from the nights orgies the major resumed his red face intensely hot and arid yellow jack yellow jack hie thee back hie thee back to the helldam corruption thy mother for with brandy ill save my heart and thus brave thee and fell death thine own brother yellow jack to brandy i took then jack took his leave brandypunch and neat brandy drink morn noon and eve at night drink then sleep and be sure my brave boys naught will quell yellow jack but neat brandy and noise the chorus most uproariously yellow jack yellow jack hie thee back hie thee back to the helldam corruption thy mother for with brandy well save our hearts and thus brave thee and fell death thine own brother yellow jack at last yellow jack was thundered out loud enough to awake his victims from the palisades the company were just then fit for anything but certainly most fit for mischief our firstlieutenant intimated to me that our jollyboat was waiting to take the junior officers on board considerate manso i took the hint marvelling much upon the scene that i had just witnessed whether or not there was any mystic virtue in the exorcisory cantation of the previous night i cannot determine but it is certain that next morning though headaches abounded among our officers indications of the yellow fever there were none chapter forty five insubordination followed by elevationa midshipman triced up in midair affording a practical lesson on oscillationall truck and no barter but as it is not my intention to write a diary of my life which was like all other midshipmens lives in the west indies i shall pass over some months during which we remained tolerably healthy took many prizes cut out some privateers and spent money so rapidly gained in a manner still more rapid of my own messmates i remember but little they were generally shockingly ignorant young men who had left school too early to whom books were an aversion and all knowledge save that merely nautical a derision i had to go more often to fistycuffs with these youths in defending my three deckerswords of latin or greek derivationthan on any other occasion i remember well that the word idiosyncrasy got me two black eyes and my opponent as pretty a luxation of the shoulder by being tumbled down the main hatchway at the close of the combat as any man of moderate expectations might desire i was really obliged to mind my parts of speech i know that instead of using the obnoxious word idiosyncrasy i should have said that mr soandso had a list to port in his ideas i confess my errormy sin against elegance was great but it must be said in extenuation that then i was young and foolish however i really liked my mode of life notwithstanding my occasional squabbles with my messmates upon my inadvertently launching a firstrate i can safely say i was beloved by everybodynor is the term too strong the captain liked me because i was always well dressed of an engaging appearance and a very handsome appendage to his gig and aidedecamp in his visits on shore perhaps from some better motives though certainly amidst all his kindness to me he once treated me most tyrannously the doctor and the purser liked me because i could converse with them rationally upon matters not altogether nautical the master almost adored me because having a good natural talent for drawing i made him plans of the hold and the stowage of his tiers of watercasks and sketches of headlands in his private logbook to all which he was condescending enough to put his own name the other superior officers thought me a very good sort of fellow and my messmates liked me because i was always happy and cheerfuland lent them money the crew to a man would have done anything for me becauseit was very foolish certainlyi used for some months to cry heartily when any of them were tied up and afterwards when i got rid of this weakness i always begged as many of them off from the infliction of the lash of mr farmer the firstlieutenant as i could with him i could take the liberty if i found him in a good humour though i dared not with the captain for though the latter had some attachment for me it was a dreadfully wayward and capricious feeling the longer i sailed with him the more occasion i had to dread if not hate him the poor man had no resources it is not therefore surprising that he began to have recourse to habitual ebriety then under the influence of his wife he would be gay mischievous tyrannical and even cruel according to the mood of the moment yet at the worst though his feet faltered when in his cups his tongue never did he even grew eloquent under the vinous influence it sharpened his cunning and wonderfully increased his aptitude for mischief it was a grievous calamity to all on board the ship that we could not give his mind healthful occupation i said that he was fond of me but i began to dread his affection and to feel myself as being compelled to submit to the playful caresses of a tiger as yet not only had we not had the slightest difference but he had often humoured me to the detriment of the service and in defiance of the just discipline mr farmer wished to maintain if i presumed upon this who shall blame such conduct in a mere boy and then captain reud was necessary to me i found that i could not avail myself of my too ample allowance until he had endorsed my bills of exchange however the concealed fang of the paw that had so often played with and patted me into vanity was to wound me at length it came upon me terribly and entered deeply into my bosom i was learning to play chess of the purserthe game had already become a passion with me it was also my turn to dine in the wardroom and consequently i was invited the anticipated game at chess enhanced the value of the invitation that same forenoon the captain and i had been very sociable he gracious and i facetious as i could i had been giving him a history of my various ushers and he had been pleased to be wonderfully amused i was down in the midshipmens berth a full hour after i had received the wardroom invitation the captains steward shoved his unlucky head within the door and croaked out captain reuds compliments to mr rattlin and desires his company to dinner today i answered carelessly rather flippantly perhaps tell the captain im going to dine in the wardroom i meant no disrespect for i felt none perhaps the fellow who took back my answer worded it maliciously i had totally forgotten as soon as i had uttered my excusal whether i had or had not used the word compliments or respectsperhaps thoughtlessly neither one nor the other i dined in the wardroom enjoyed my chess and good easy youth with all my blushing honours thick upon me of having given mate with only trifling odds in my favour the drum beat to evening quarters i was stationed to the four aftermost carronades on the quarterdeck i had run up in a hurry and at that period straps to keep down the trousers not having been invented my white jeans were riddled a good deal up the leg i passed the captain touched my hat and began to muster my men unconscious of any offence i stole a look at my commander but met with no goodhumoured glance in return he had screwed up his little yellow physiognomy into the shape of an illconditioned and battered face on a brass knocker he had his usual afternoon wineflush upon him but a feeling of vindictiveness had placed his feelings of incipient intoxication under complete mastery so you dined in the wardroom mr rattlin yes sir my hat reverently touched not liking the looks of my interrogator and you did not even condescend to return the compliments i sent you with my misplaced invitation to dinner dont recollect sir mr rattlin in consideration of your ignorance i can forgive a personal affrontdammebut by the living god i cannot overlook disrespect to the service you young misbegotten scoundrel what do mean by coming to quarters undressed look at your trousers sir the captain is in a passion certainly thought i as i quietly stooped to pull the offending garment down to my shoes mr farmer mr farmer do you see the young blackguard said the commander confound me he is making a dressingroom of my quarterdeckand at quarters toowhich is the same as parade hither sirrahhoho my young gentleman young gentleman trulya conceited little bastard the word burnt deeply into my young heart and caused a shock upon my brain as if an explosion of gunpowder had taken place within my skull but it passed instantaneously and left behind it an unnatural calm pray sir said i walking up to him deliberately and resolutely how do you know that i am a bastard do you hear the impudent scoundrel pray sir who is your father oh that i knew said i bursting into tears i bless god that it is not you to the masthead to the masthead wheres the boatswain start him up start him up the boatswain could not make his way aft till i was some rattlings up the main rigging and thus his intentional and kind dilatoriness saved me from the indignity of a blow twice i gazed upon the clear blue and transparent water and temptation was strong upon me for it seemed to woo me to rest but when i looked inboard and contemplated the diminutive shrivelled jaundiced figure beneath me i said to myself not for such a thing as that before i had got to the maintop i thought this morning he loved mepoor human natureand when i got to the topmast crosstrees i had actually forgiven him it has been my failing through life as shakespeare expresses it to have always lacked gall god knows how much i have forgiven merely because i have found it impossible to hate but it was to be tried still more i had settled myself comfortably on the crosstrees making excuses for the captain and condemning my own want of caution and anticipating a reconciliatory breakfast with my persecutor when his shrill voice came discordantly upon my ears masthead there sir up higher sirup higher i hesitatedthe order was repeated with horrid threats and imprecations there were no rattlings to the topgallant rigging it had been tremendously hot all day and the tar had sweated from the shrouds and i was very loath to spoil my beautiful white jean trousers by swarming up them however as i perceived that he had worked himself into a perfect fury up i went and to the topgallantmasthead embracing the royal pole with one arm and standing on the bights of the rigging my nether apparel in performing this feat appeared as if it had been employed in wiping up a bucket of spilled tar but i was not long to remain unmolested in my stand on the high and giddy mast my astonishment and dismay were unbounded at hearing captain reud still vociferate up higher sir the royal pole stood naked with nothing attached to it but the royal and the signalhalyards the latter running through the truck my lady readers must understand that the truck is that round thing at the top of all the masts that looks so like a button i could not have got up the wellgreased pole if i had attempted it a practised seaman could certainly and indeed one of those worthies who climb for legs of mutton at a fair might have succeeded to mount a few inches what said i half aloud does the tyrant mean he knows that this thing i cannot do and he also knows that if i attempt it it is probable i shall lose my hold of this slippery stick and be rolled off into the sea if he wishes to murder me he shall do so more directly forgive himnever ill brave him first and revenge myself after again that deadly calm came over me which makes soft dispositions so desperate and to which lighthaired persons are so peculiarly subject in these temperaments when the paleness becomes fixed and unnatural beware of them in their moods they concentrate the vindictiveness of a life in a few moments and though the paroxysm is usually short it is too often fatal to themselves and their victims i coolly commenced descending the rigging whilst the blackest thoughts crowded in distinct and bloodstained array upon my brain i bethought me from whence i could the most readily pluck a weapon but the idea was but instantaneous and i dismissed it with a mighty effort at length i reached the deck whilst the infuriated captain stood mute with surprise at my outrageously insubordinate conduct the men were still at their quarters and partook of their commanders astonishment but i am convinced of no other feeling when i found myself on deck i walked up to captain reud and between my clenched teeth i said to him slowly and deliberately tyrant i scorn you i come premeditatedly to commit an act of mutiny i give myself up as a prisoner i desire to be tried by a courtmartial i will undergo anything to escape from you and i dont think that with all your malice you will be able to hang me i consider myself under an arrest then turning upon my heel i prepared to go down the quarterdeck hatchway captain reud heard me to the end in silence he even permitted me to go down half the ladder unmolested when rousing himself from his utter astonishment he jumped forward and spurning me with his foot violently on my back dashed me on the main deck i was considerably bruised and before i got to the midshipmens berth two marines seized me and dragged me again to the quarterdeck once more i stood before my angry persecutor looking hate and defiance to the masthead sir immediately i will not i consider myself a prisoner you refuse to go i do quartermaster the signal halyards sling mr rattlin mr rattlin was slung now run the mutinous rascal up to the truck in a moment i was attached to a thin white line waving to and fro in mid air and soon triced up to the very top of the royal pole and jammed hard to the truck is this believed perhaps not yet no statement was ever more true at the time when this atrocity was perpetrating not an officer interfered my sufferings were intense the sun was still hot my hat had fallen off in my involuntary ascent and as the ship was running before the wind under her topsails the motion at that high point of elevation was tremendous i felt horribly seasick the ligature across my chest became every moment more oppressive to my lungs and more excruciating in torture my breathing at each respiration more difficult and before i had suffered ten times i had fainted so soon as the captain had seen me run up he went below leaving strict orders that i should not be lowered down directly the captain was in his cabin the firstlieutenant the doctor purser and the officers of the watch held a hurried consultation on my situation but the goodnatured doctor did not stop for the result but immediately went below and told reud if i remained where i was i should die those who knew the navy at that time will anticipate the answer no others canlet him die and be damned the good doctor came on deck desponding mr farmer then hailed me once and again and again of course he received no answer i heard him but at that moment my senses were fast leaving me the sea with its vast horizon appearing so illimitable from the great height where i was swaying rocked to my failing sight awfully to and fro the heavens partook of the dizzying motion i only of all the creation seemed standing still i was sick unto death and as far as sensation was concerned then and there i died upon receiving no reply mr farmer sent one of the topmen up to look at me no sooner had he reached the topgallant rigging than he reported me dead a cry of horror escaped from all the deck the captain rushed up he needed no report he was frantic with grief he wept like a child and assisted with his own hands to lower me down they were his arms that received himself that bore me to his cabin like a wilful boy who had slain his pet lamb or a passionate girl her dove he mourned over me it was a long time before my respiratory organs could be brought into play my recovery was slow and it was some time before i could arrange my ideas a cot was slung for me in the cabin and bewildered and exhausted i fell into a deep sleep i awoke a little after midnight perfectly composed and suffering only from the weal that the cord had made across my chest before a table and his countenance lighted by a single lantern sat the captain his features expressed a depth of grief and a remorse that were genuine he sat motionless with his eyes fixed upon my cot my face he could not see owing to the depth of the shadow in which i lay i moved he advanced to my cot with the gentleness of a woman and softly uttered ralph my dear boy do you sleep the tones of his voice fell soothingly upon my ear like the music of a mothers prayer no captain reud but i am very thirsty in an instant he was at my side with some weak wine and water i took it from the hand of him whom a few hours before in my animosity i could have slain ralph said he as he received back the tumbler ralph are we friends oh captain reud how could you treat a poor lad thus who respected who loved you so much i was maddo you forgive me ralph and he took my not unwilling hand to be sure but do me one little favour in return anything anything ralphill never masthead you again oh i was not thinking of that i ought not to have put you in a passion punish memasthead medo anything captain reud but call me not bastard he made no reply he pressed my hand fervently he put it to his lips and kissed iton my soul he did then after a pause gently murmured goodnight and as he passed into the aftercabin to his bed i distinctly heard him exclaim god forgive me how i have wronged that boy the next day we were better friends than ever and for the three years that we remained together not a reproachful word or an angry look ever passed between us i must be permitted to make three observations upon this to me memorable transaction the first is that at that time i had not the power of retention of those natural feelings of anger which all should carry with them as a preservation against or a punishment for injury and insult i know that most of my male and many of my female readers will think my conduct throughout pusillanimous or abject my mothers milk as it were still flowed in my veins and with that no ill blood could amalgamate all i can say is that now i am either so much better or so much worse that i should have adopted towards captain reud a much more decided course of proceedings my second remark is that this captain had really a good heart but was one of the most striking instances that i ever knew of the demoralising effect of a misdirected education and the danger of granting great powers to early years and great ignorance with good innate feelings no man ever possessed moral perceptions more clouded and lastly that this statement is not to be construed into a libel on the naval service or looked upon in the least as an exaggerated account as to libel the gentlemanly deportment the parental care of their crews and the strict justice of thousands of captains cannot in the least be deteriorated by a single act of tyranny by a solitary member of their gallant body and as to exaggeration let it be remembered that in the very same year and on the very same station that my tricingup to the truck occurred another postcaptain tarred and feathered one of his young gentlemen and kept him in that state a plumed biped for more than six weeks in his hencoop this last fact obtained much notoriety from the aggrieved party leaving the service and recovering heavy damages from his torturer in the court of civil law my treatment never was known beyond our frigate chapter forty six ralph entereth into the regions of romance and privateering carried thither by a pilot malgre luian inopportune visit shortly after the illegal suspension of the habeas corpus that i recorded in the last chapter the portion of the navy stationed in the west indies became actively employed in the conquest of those islands still in the possession of the french some fell almost without a struggle others at much expense of life both of the military and naval forces as everyone who could find a publisher has written a book on all these events from the capture of the little spot deseada to the subduing the magnificent island of guadaloupe and the glorious old stonebuilt city of domingo i may well be excused detailing the operations among other bellicose incidents that varied the dull monotony of my life was the beating off a frigate equal in force to our own though i believe that we were a little obliged to her for taking leave of us in a manner so abrupt though we could not certainly complain of the want on her part of any attention for the short and busy hour that she stayed with us for she assisted us to shift all our topmasts and as before she met us we had nothing but old sails to display she considerably decorated us with a profusion of ribands gaily fluttering about our lower masts and the topmasts that were still standing gracefully hanging over our sides we were too polite and wellbred not to make some return for all these petits soins as between the tropics the weather is generally very warm we evinced a most laudable anxiety that she should be properly ventilated so we assiduously began drilling holes through and through her hull and i assure the reader that we did it in a surpassingly workmanlike manner but in the midst of this spirited exchange of courtesies our gallic friend remembered that he had or might have another engagement so he took his leave and as he had given us so many reasons to prevent our insisting to attend upon him we parted en pleine mer leaving us excessively annoyed that we were prevented from accompanying him any further in captain reuds despatches he stated and stated truly that we beat him off why he went i could not understand for excepting in the shattered state of her hull and more particularly in a sad confusion of her quarter gallery with her two aftermost maindeckports he sailed off with her colours flying and every sail drawing even to her royals but the french used to have their own method of managing these little matters but let us rapidly pass over these follies and hasten to something more exquisitely foolish and yet i cannot i have to clear away many dull weeds and tread down many noxious nettles before i can reach the one fresh and thornless rose that bloomed for a short space upon my heart and the fragrance of which so intoxicated my senses that for a time i was under a blessed delusion of believing myself happy i had now been two years and a half in the west indies and i was fast approaching my nineteenth year at this period we had retaken several english west indiamen in one of these retaken merchant vessels there was found as the french prizemaster and now of course our prisoner a mercurial little fellow of the name of messurier he was very proud of the glory of his nation and still prouder of his own as france possessed many historians and monsieur adolphe sigismund messurier but one and that one himself of course he had the duty of at least three hundred savants thrown upon his own shoulders he performed it nobly and with an infinite relish now when a person who is given to much talking is also given to much drinking it generally happens injurious as is the vice of the grogbottle that the vice of the voluble tongue is still worse when in his cups he told of the scores that he had slain counting them off by threes and fives upon his fingers his thumbs indicating captains his forefingers firstlieutenants and so on with the various grades in our service until the aspirants or middies were merely honoured by his little finger as their representative we only laughed and asked him if he had been so destructive to the officers how many men had fallen by the puissance of his arm it seemed that these latter were too numerous and too ignoble to be counted for that question was always answered with a bah and a rapidly passing over the extended palm of his left hand with his open right one but when one evening he mentioned that he could pilot a frigate into the inland waters from whence swarmed the crowd of schooner privateers that infested the islands and by their swift sailing to windward eluded our fastest ships we laughed still and i did something more i reported this boast to captain reud then exclaimed my valorous little creole by all the virtues of a long eighteen he shall take in his majestys frigate eos whenever he protested by a long eighteen in the efficacy of whose powers he had the most implicit reliance we might look upon the matter as performed the next morning whilst monsieur messurier was solacing his aching head with his hands oblivious of the events of the preceding evening he was feelingly reminded of his consummate skill in pilotage he then became most unnaturally modest and denied all pretensions to the honour now captain reud had no idea that even an enemy should wrap up his talent in a napkin so he merely said to him you must take my ship in when the captain had made up his mind the deed generally trod upon the heels of the resolve poor man he was always in want of something to do and thus he was too happy to do anything that offered excitement monsieur messurier was in despair he prayed and swore alternately talked about sacrificing his life for the good of his country and told us in a manner that convinced us that he wished us to believe the absurdity that honour was the breath of his nostrils however the captain was fully intent upon giving him the glorious opportunity of exclaiming with effect dulce et decorum est pro patria mori not knowing the strength of the stronghold that it was our intention to surprise captain reud cruised about for a few days until he had collected another frigate a sloop of war and two eighteengun brigs the commanders of all being of course his juniors having made all necessary arrangements one beautiful morning we found ourselves close off the ironbound and rocky shores of the east end of saint domingo we ran along shore for a couple of hours when we perceived an opening in the lofty piles of granite that frowned over the blue ocean this was the entrance into the harbour where lay our destined prizes captain reud taking the responsibility into his own hands had determined to lead in the charts were minutely examined but they gave us no hope the soundings laid down were so shallow and the path so intricate that by them we wondered much how even a privateer schooner could make the passage in safety to a frigate drawing threeandtwenty feet of water the attempt seemed only a precursor to destruction we hoveto the captains of the other vessels were signalled on board and with them and our firstlieutenant and master a sort of council of war was held and as everyone present gave his voice against the attempts our skippers mind was made up directly he resolved to go in trusting to the chapter of accidents to a gracious providence and monsieur messurier upon the foreyard with a seaman with a pistol at each ear to scatter his brains the moment the ship struck the weather was brilliant the wind moderate and fair when we bore up to the mouth of the passage it was something at once ludicrous and painful to witness the agony of our pilot in spite of himself between oaths protestations and tremors the perspiration of terror flowing down his face mingled with his tears he conned the ship with a precision that proved at least in that matter that he was no vain boaster but we had scarcely advanced a few hundred yards within the gorge than i had eyes only for the sublimity of the scenery that opened itself in succession as we passed the water was as smooth as the cheek as bright as the smile and as blue as the eye of our first love indeed it was deeply beautifully blue as lord byron saithto that deeply we owed everything the channel was so narrow that in many places there was not sufficient room to tack the ship even if she could have turned within her own length and in two remarkable points we had not sufficient width to have carried our studdingsails at one singularly romantic spot of this pass the rocks far above our mastheads leant over towards each other and the ancient forest trees that crowned the heights mingled their feathery branches and permitted us to get a sight of the vaulted blue above us only at intervals between the interstices of the darkgreen foliage the seamen regarded their situation with wonder not unmixed with awe but the view was not the unvaried one of two gigantic walls festooned with flowers and crowned with trees at intervals we found the channel open into wide lagoons with shelving and verdant shores studded with white stone buildings and well cultivated plantations and then the passage would narrow again suddenly and the masses of rock rose so high on each side of us as almost to exclude the light of the day the way was tortuous but not abruptly so and as we wound through it ever and anon we came to some picturesque inlet some cool grotto so beautiful that its very beauty must have peopled it with nymphs for none could look upon them without feeling for a time like poets at the entrance the heaving water rose and fell with a heavy moaning against the eternal bases of the rocks though the surface in midchannel was perfectly smooth but as we advanced the dull indulation gradually subsided and its measured splash no longer echoed among the cliffs the silence as we proceeded grew strange to us an awe crept over us like that which is felt upon the first entrance into a vast cathedral and the gentle wind came to us noiselessly and dying away at intervals left the ship silently stealing on impelled for a space by no visible means the hush throughout the ship was tomblike and the few words of command that from time to time broke upon the ear sounded hollow and unearthly from the reverberations of the overhanging precipices but quickly the scene would change the jutting promontories and overtopping walls would recede and a fairy spot encircled by forestland would open upon us studded with green islands glorious in all the beauties of an eternal spring and crowded and crowned with flowers of every hue and of a brilliancy the most intense we proceeded in this delightful manner for more than twelve miles yet no one had appeared in the least to notice our approach had the most trivial attempt at defence been made we could not have proceeded a quarter of the distance for i verily believe that we passed by points so overhanging that a couple of pounds of gunpowder properly applied and fired at the right moment would have tumbled fragments of solid rock upon us that would have crushed us to the bottom in an instant to mention nothing of the several protruding corners of this singular pass on which two or three guns could have raked an approaching vessel for half an hour with impunity as i have before stated that it would be impossible in those straitened passages to have turned a broadside to bear on any impediment on we came and at last a noble bay or rather saltwater lake opened upon us with two wide rivers delivering their waters into the bottom of it on our right lay the town of aniana with a fort upon a green mount overlooking the houses and rising much higher than our floating pennant our unexpected entree like all other mistimed visits caused the visited a terrible degree of confusion twelve or thirteen beautiful schooners had their sweeps out and all their sails set immediately we having anchored opposite the town about noon the breeze fell away into almost a perfect calm and off they went making the best of their way up the rivers there were several other craft lying off the town into which the inhabitants were crowding with all their effects of any value no doubt intending to go a little way up into the country also to avoid the inconvenience of inopportune calls the signal was made for our little squadron to get out their boats chase and capture chapter forty seven treats of kind intentions frustrateda visiting party prevented by one ball too many having been givenand readymade domestic happiness for strangers we first of all brought out the heavily laden craft that were still near the town and anchored them under our guns to the privateers that showed their heels the larger boats gave chase and coming up with them one after another they were finally all captured had they but acted in combination i think they might have resisted the boats with success but their commanders seemed to have lost all presence of mind in the confusion and astonishment into which our sudden appearance had thrown them now all this was very pleasant to us messieurs les concernes we calculated upon having the whole wealth of the french town and the little french fleet converted into lawful prizemoney the deeplyladen poopencumbered brigs and schooners so ungracefully down by the stern we imagined to be full of treasure visions of gold glittered before our minds eye we were about to recover the plunder of ages for it must be confessed that this aniana was no better than a haven for pirates one of us was cruelly undeceived in one respect as yet we had met with no manner of resistance whatever it was ten oclock in the evening the full moon giving us a very excellent imitation of daylight when all the commanders who had dined with our yellow skipper came on deck in the highest possible glee delightedly rubbing their hands and calculating each his share of the prizemoney all this hilarity was increased every now and then by some boats coming on board and reporting to us as commodore another privateer or some fugitive merchantman taken and then immediately shoving off in chase of others well gentlemen said the skipper ill tell you what well do well send the marines on shore tomorrow and take possession of the town however we will be very civil to the ladieswe will by venus as commanding officer ill permit of no rudeness none whatever who could think or frightening them i suppose captain reud there can be no harm in going ashore now and paying them a visit just to alleviate their fears was the reply of one of the commanders not tonight not tonight depend upon it all the best of the beauty and the best of the wealth is safely stowed in this numerous fleet quietly anchored about us we have them all safe there might be some villains lurking about the town with their cane knives in their belts let us have all clear and daylight before us not that i think there is any pluck among themthey have not spirit enough to throw a stone at a dog hardly had these taunting words escaped his lips than bang crash and a fourandtwenty pound shot came reeking through the waisthammocksfor they had not yet been piped downand covered us over with horsehair and an abominable composition called flock the ball took a slanting direction through the main and orlop decks and came out just below the waterline making instantly a leak that we could not affect to despise droll said reud shaking the dust from his person very said his welldined echoes around him if this be jesting thought i the cream of the joke is to come yet beat to quarters mr rattlin the lieutenants and more than half of the crew were away in the boats the men were soon at their guns and as they had been only slightly secured they were ready to return the fire almost immediately upon looking up at the source of our annoyance we found that it was a hopeless case the height was so great and so immediately above us that without heeling the frigate over not a gun could be brought to bear another shot from the battery served to quicken our deliberations there was no time to be lost captain reud sent the various commanders on board their respective vessels with orders as fast as any of their boats came in to send them to us immediately with their marines for ourselves all our boats were away except the gig into that i jumped followed by the captain and six marines every man except a quartermaster and a couple of lookouts was piped down below with strict orders that they were to stay there and not expose themselves and the ship was left in charge of the gunner whilst the carpenter and his crew were actively employed in the wings in plugging the shotholes for every ball that was fired came in somewhere upon the decks and made its way through the ships sides low under the water however annoying as this was there were but two guns playing upon us which though served with admirable precision fired but slowly we had not lain on our oars a quarter of an hour between the ship and the shore a space of not more than forty yards when we were joined by seven boats of various dimensions crammed as full of jollies as they could possibly hold we were on shore in a moment and without much care as to forming we all scrambled up the hill as fast as we could it was very steep indeed but we were not fired upon by any smallarms whatever and the guns could not be sufficiently depressed from the embrasures to be made to bear upon us they certainly must have perceived us for the moon was shining with singular splendour but they seemed to take no notice of our advance but fired twice upon the frigate as we were climbing or rather scrambling up this assault was an affair got up with so little premeditation that captain reud had no other arms than his regulation sword and his aidedecamp my redoubtable self no other weapon of offence than a little crooked dirk so considerably curved that it would not answer the purpose of a dagger to stab with and so blunt that i am sure though it might separate it could not cut through a plumpudding though i was approaching pari passu with my commander to a parapet where there there was no imminent deadly breach i was so much ashamed of my sidearms that i would not expose them to the night air up we tumbled close under the low turfconstructed battlement and as we were in the act of scrambling over it we received a straggling and illdirected fire of musketry one hurrah from our party and we were into the fort in a moment and that on the two flanks as well as the front for all the service that i could render i might as well have charged as a midshipman usually walks the decks with my hands in my pockets however there we were face to face with our opponents on the planked floor of the fort just as they were making up their minds to run away but they did not go quite as soon as they ought in jumping over the turfy mound it must be supposed as was really the case that it took us an instant or two to recover our equilibrium and ascertain the surety of our footing but that instant was a very annoying one for the frenchman directly opposed to captain reud deliberately put his musket against the said captains face and though i unarmed as i was actually did strike up this musket as much as i was able it had only the effect of making the bayonet at the end of it score a deep wound from the bridge of his nose to the top of his forehead when the trigger was pulled and the whole crown of captain reuds skull completely blown away the shot turned him round like a weathercock i naturally halfturned also giving the enemy the advantage of studying my profile whilst i endeavoured to support my captain in my arms and then the same man being bent on mischief thrust his bayonet right through the back of my neck grazing the vertebra and entering on the right and coming out on the left side having in this manner made a sheath for his weapon the blackguard left it there and thus having trussed me as with a skewer showed me his back and fled the buttend of the musket falling to the ground gave me a terrible wrench of the head but relieved me at the same time of my incumbrance that was the first time i ever bled for my country indeed i bled much more than my poor captain however the gentlemen of the fort rushed out as we rushed in and rolled head over heels down the other side of the hill three or four were killed on the platform among whom at the time i devoutly wished was the inflictor of my wound some were shot as they ran down the inland side of the hill and the fort was ours with the loss of one man killed and i think six wounded my hurt was very trifling a piece of adhesive plaster on the two orifices was all the surgical assistance that i either had or required but the case with poor reud was very different i detest giving a revolting description of wounds i shall only say that this was a most dreadful one he lay for a month almost in a state of insensibility and though he lived for more than half a year with his head plated with silver i know that he was never afterwards perfectly sane walking about for a couple of days with a stiff neck which was all the inconvenience i experienced i assumed no little upon my firmness in storming and on my honourable scars the next morning all the prizes were secured the town formally taken possession of and whilst captain reud lay in the torpor of what was all but death it was deliberated what we should do with our conquest it was a matter of some difficulty to decide upon at this period the two factions of the blacks petions and christophes held the western parts of the fine island of saint domingo the spaniards had large possessions in the centre of the island and the french still held a sway over the city of saint domingo and had a precarious footing in the eastern division where we now were the place was too insignificant to garrison for a permanent conquest for the english many of our officers and all the men wished very naturally to plunder it but the captain of the other frigate now the commander would not listen to the proposal for a moment however we totally destroyed their small dockyard burned three fine schooners on the stocks demolished the fort that had been so pernicious to captain reud and which commanded the town and then the officers and small parties of the ships company were permitted to go on shore and to live at free quarters upon the inhabitants strict orders were given to respect life and limb and the honour of the ladies and these orders were generally well enforced it was certainly a pleasant thing to go on shore and walk into any house that pleased you call for what you wanted be very protecting and after having eaten and drunk to satiety to depart without having to cast up the items of a bill these brigands were treated much too leniently for i verily believe that for a vast number of years all the male population were born bred lived and had died pirates they were of all nations of the earth and i must say that this blending of the various races had produced a very handsome set of men and very beautiful women there were many english females among them who had been captured in our merchant vessels and had been forced into marriages with their lawless captors they were for the most part like the sabine women reconciled to their lot and loath to leave their lords their mansions and their children the governor of the place a french colonel was captured as he endeavoured to make his escape in one of the schooner privateers we had him on board of our ship for some time and he confessed that the place flourished only by means of what he was pleased to designate as free trading the prizes deeply laden left the port one after the other and then the menofwar brigs afterwards the sloop of war and at length our consort the frigate we now lay alone in these quiet waters and there we remained for nearly three months all this time our captain could hardly be said to be living no one was allowed to come aft beyond the mizzenmast we always spoke with hushed voices and walked about stealthily upon tiptoe the bells ceased to be struck and every precaution was taken to preserve the most profound silence but our amusements on shore were more than commensurate for our restraints on board most of the officers and men took unto themselves wives pro hac vicechalked or rather painted their names upon the doors of their mansions and made themselves completely at home chapter forty eight liaisons dangereusesralph diveth into the dilemma of love and admireth the fatherly conduct of the parent of his dulcineayet rageth and weepeth that she is a slave who hath enslaved him at this time i had begun to look fierce if anyone did not concede to me the rights and privileges of a man and especially since i had received my bayonet wound my vanity upon this score became insupportable younker was now a term of bitternesss to me on the word lad i looked with sovereign contempt boy i had long done with heartily i prayed for a beard but it came not so in order to supply the deficiency i used to practise looking stern before my dressingglass but all my efforts at an outward semblance of manliness were vain my face was much too fair and feminine though my stature and the firmness of my frame were just what i wished i was not on board the vessel after the first week that she lay in the port of aniana nor did i rejoin her until she as in the very act of sailing out of it how am i to approach this subject so romantic so delicious and so delicate how can i record events that in proving to me that i had a heart first destroyed its strength by the sweet delirium of ecstasy and thus having enfeebled almost broke it before the poetic ardour had often been upon me but the fire was lighted up at the shrine of vanity and i sang for applause it was to be rekindled by love but to burn with a concealed fury to be whispered only to my own soula feeling too great for utterance too intense for song was to devour me i experienced ecstasies that were not happiness i learned the bitter truth that rapture is not bliss about a week after we had obtained a quiet settlement in the town and very many of us a quiet settlement in the hearts as well as in the houses of the beautiful creoles and half castes i also went on shore with modesty walking steadily on my righthand whilst madam temptation was wickedly ogling me on the left i looked in on the establishments of several of my brother officers and certainly admired the rapidity with which they had surrounded themselves with all manner of domestic comforts including wives and in some instances large families of children there was much more than readymade love in these arrangements anyone may buy that for readymoney but a readymade progeny a readymade household and a readymade wife without one stiver of ready money was the astonishment but english sailors can do anything well at number rue coquine i accepted the pursers invitation to dinner at four en famille it seemed quite natural my dove said he youll get us a bit of fish mr rattlin loves fish certainly my love said mrs purser pro tempore looking a battery of amiabilities allow me to introduce you to my sisterinlaw maamselle davalonge said the purser presenting a very well dressed young lady to me with all the ease of a family man the introduction took place immediately and the lady and i found each other charming indeed we said so after a few more compliments and a very pretty song accompanied by the guitar from mademoiselle i took my leave promising to be punctual to my appointment i was not punctuali never saw their dear faces again i left the town and strolled up into the interior keeping however our small fleet in sight and walking seaward i found the environs well cultivated and the houses in the various plantations solidly built and of stone from every habitation that i passed i had pressing invitations to enter and refresh myself these i declined at length i arrived at a beautiful wood evidently under the care of man for the different trees were so arranged as to produce a romantic effect the shade that the lofty mahoganytrees afforded was very grateful for it was now a little after noon and in this grove i paced slowly up and down nursing my pride with all manner of conceits at length in the distance and much below where i stood i heard voices in violent altercation among which the vast heavings blow me tights a stopper over all with other such nautical expletives were predominant i broke from my cover and found myself immediately on a slope before a very respectable habitation nearly surrounded by boilinghouses and other outbuildings necessary to a sugar and coffee plantation the group before me consisted of a small energetic old and whitehaired frenchman neatly dressed in a complete suit of nankeen with his broadbrimmed straw hat submissively in his hand speaking all manner of fair and unintelligible french words to two jacks not of my ship between which two now pulled this way now plucked that was a timid and beautiful girl of about fifteen years of age there were several negroes grinning and passive spectators of this scene i understood it in a moment so did my gentlemen in the tarpaulin hats they were off to me in a less time than a topgallant breeze takes to travel aft from the flying jibboom supposing the ship to be at single anchor i took out my pocketbook wrote down their names most likely pursers ones and ordered them on board their vessel directly they obeyed or rather appeared to do so and departed casting many a lingering longing look behind leaving me the triumphant master of the fieldthe paladin who had rescued the fair for which i received much clapping of hands from the dark visages and an intense look of gratitude from the fair pale creature whom i had released from the very equivocal rudeness of her admirers the thanks from monsieur manuel the father were neither silent nor few and when he found that i could converse in french he exhausted the vocabulary of that copious language of all its expressions of gratitude i hardly could perceive that i had rendered any service at all i had struck no blows and had run no risk i had merely spoken and obedience followed however as i could not stem the torrent of his gratitude i determined to divert its course by yielding to his urgent entreaties to accompany him to his house and recruit myself after my perilous and heroic deed we were soon seated in the coolest room of his mansion and every west indian luxury was quickly produced to tempt my palate in fifteen minutes he had acquainted me with his parentage his possessions and his history he assured me with gesticulations and a few oaths that he was not at all connected with the brigands that inhabited the town belowthat he despised them knew them all to be pirates or abettors of pirates revolutionists and republicansthat he was at heart yea in heart and soul a royalist and devotedly attached to the vieux regime that the estate he now cultivated he had inherited from his father who had been one of the few spared in the revolt of the blacks that he had been educated at paris but for the last fiveandthirty years had hardly been off his own groundsthat he had no wife and indeed never married had no family at all excepting josephine who sat beside him who was his very dear and only child he did not add a slave and the daughter of a slave i now looked upon her steadfastly for the first time and with the most intense emotion but it was pity i had been sufficiently long in the west indies to know exactly the relation in which she stood to her father however he went on to relate how she had been born to him by a beautiful mulatto for whom he had given a great sum yet at this she startled not moved not blushed not but hers was not the calmness of obduracy but of innocence strongly did i commiserate her and gently strove to draw her into discourse i found her ignorant oh how profoundly ignorant she had no ideas beyond the estate in which she lived and those that she had gathered from the gang of negroes that worked it her father had taught her nothing but to play a few tunes by ear upon the guitar and sing some old french songs yet she had been accustomed to all the observances of a ladyhad slaves to wait upon her and was always elaborately sometimes richly dressed isolated as she had been i soon discovered that she was a compound of enthusiasm talent and melancholy she was little more than fifteen years old yet that age in those tropical climates answers fully to a european oneandtwenty in form she was a perfect woman light rounded and extremely active all her motions were as graceful and as undulating as the gentlyswelling billow if she moved quickly she bounded if slowly she appeared to glide on effortless through space she had taken her lessons of grace in the woods and her gymnasium had been among the sportive billows of the ocean it is but of little use me describing her face for everyone supposes that in these affairs the author draws at once as largely as he can upon his own imagination and as he dares upon the credulity of his readers though a slave she had but little of the black blood in herin her complexion none she was not fair but her skin was very transparent very pure and of a dazzling and creamy sort of whiteness i have seen something like it on the delicate chinese paintings of the secluded ladies of that very secluded empire and should imagine it just such a permanent tint as the roman empress strove to procure by bathing every day in milk colour she had none and thrilling must have been the emotions that could call it into her placid and pensive cheeks her features were not chiselled and had any sculptor striven to imitate them on the purest marble he would have discovered that chiselling would not do they were at once formed and informed by the deity it is of no use talking about her luxurious and nightemulating hair her lips and those eyes that seemed to contain in their small compass a whole sea of melancholy in which love was struggling to support a halfdrowned joy as i turned to converse with her she looked up to me confidingly she appeared as it were incessantly to draw me to her with her large black eyes they seemed to say to me come nearer to me that i may understand thee art thou not something distinct from the beings that i see around mesomething that can teach me what i am and will also give me something to venerate to idolise and to love as i continued to speak to her her attention grew into a quiet rapture yet still a sublime melancholy seemed to hold her feelings in a solemn thraldom my name my rank and my situation were soon disclosed to the father and daughter and the former seeing how entranced we were with each others company like a prudent parent left us to ourselves my french was much purer and more grammatical than hers hers much more fluent than mine yet notwithstanding this deficiency on both sides we understood each other perfectly and we had not been above two hours together alone before i told her that i loved her for her very ignorance and she had confessed to me that she loved me becausebecausethe reader will never guess whybecause i was so like the good spirit that walked gently through the forests and gathered up the fevermists before they reached the dwellings of man i very naturally asked her if she had seen this being she said no but knew him as well as if she had for old jumbila a negress had so often talked to her about him that her idea of him was as familiar to her as the presence of her father you have much to unlearn my sweet one thought i and i shall be but too happy to be your preceptor at sunset monsieur manuel returned led us into another apartment where a not inelegant dinner was served up to us knowing the habits of my countrymen we sat over some very fine claret after josephine had retired i took this opportunity to reproach him in the mildest terms that i could use with the dreadful ignorance in which he had suffered a creature so lovely and so superior to remain his reply was a grimace a hoisting of his shoulders above his head an opening of his hands and fingers to their utmost extent and a most pathetic que voulezvous i will tell you friend manuel i answered for his wine had warmed me much his daughter more i would have had her taught at least to read and write that she had an immortal soul a soul as precious to its maker as to herself i would have had her taught to despise such superstitious nonsense as obeoism mist spirits and all the pernicious jargon of spells and fetishes i would my dear manuel have made her a fit companion for myself for with such beauty and such a soul i am convinced that she would realise female perfection as nearly as poor humanity is permitted to do que voulezvous again met my ears it was attended by some attempt at justification of his very culpable remissness he assured me that according to the laws social as well as judicial a person of her class were she possessed of all the attributes of an angel could never be received into white society nor wed with any but a person of colour the light of education he asserted would only the more show her her own degradation he said he felt for her deeply felt for her and that he shuddered at the idea of his own death for in that event he felt assured that she would be sold with the rest of the negroes on the estate and be treated in all respects as a slaveand she had been so delicately nurtured she had indeed her long white fingers and velvety hand bore sufficient testimony to this but can you not manumit her said i impossible when the island was more settled and better governed than now the legal obstructions thrown in the way of the act were almost insuperable at present it is impossible i have no doubt that our bloodthirsty enemies the spaniards who are our nearest neighbours immediately you english leave the town as you have dismantled our forts and carried away almost all the male population captive will come and take possession of this placenot that i care a sou for the brigands whom you have just routed out i shall have to submit to the spanish authority and their slave laws are still more imperative than ours though they invariably treat their slaves better than any other nation no there is no hope for poor josephine could you not send her to france sacre dieu they guillotined all my relations all my friendsall alland my friend i never made gold by taking a share in those long low schooners that you have kindly taken under your care i have some boxes of doubloons stowed away it is true but after all i am attached to this place i could not sell the estate for want of a purchaser and i am surrounded by such an infernal set of rascals that i never could embark myself with my hard cash without being murdered no we must do at rome as the romans do a sweet specimen of a roman you are thought i and i fell into a short reverie but it was broken up most agreeably by seeing josephine trip before the open jalousies with a basket of flowers in her hand she paused for a moment before us and looked kindly at her father and smilingly at me it was the first joyous really joyous smile that i had seen in her expressive countenance it went right to my heart and brought with it a train of the most rapturous feelings god bless her heart i do love her dearly said the old man ill give you a convincing proof of it my young friend rattlin ah bah but you other english have spoiled allyou have taken him with you who why captain durand that large low black schooner was his yes he would have treated her well said monsieur le pere musing and he offered to sign an agreement never to put her to fieldwork or to have her flogged put whom to fieldworkflog whom said i all amazement josephine to be sure had you not taken him prisoner i was going next month to sell her to him for two hundred doubloons now may god confound you for an unholy unnatural villain said i springing up and overturning the table and wine into the fatherly lap of monsieur manuel if you did not stand there my host i would with my hand on your throat force you on your knees to swear thatthat that youll never sell poor poor josephine for a slave flog her said i shuddering and the tears starting into my eyesi should as soon have thought of flogging an empresss eldest daughter be pacified my son said the old slavedealer deliberately clearing himself of the debris of the dessertbe pacified my son the words my son went with a strange and cheering sound into my very hearts core the associations that they brought with it were blissfuli listened to him with calmness be pacified my son he continued and i will prove to you that i am doing everything for the best the old colonel our late governor would have given three times the money for her i could not do better than make her over to a kindhearted man who would use her well and who i think is fond of her not to part with her for a heavy sum would be fixing a stigma upon her and wretched as all this reasoning appeared to be i was convinced that the man had really meant to have acted kindly by selling his own daughter what a pernicious damnable atrocious social system that must have been where such a state of things existed chapter forty nine ralph deserteth his dutyall for love or the world well lost with his wits into the bargainvery nice disquisitions on honour the soyez tranquille of monsieur manuel had but a transient effect it brought no consolation with it what i had heard seemed to clog the usual healthy beating of my heart my respiration laboured and i fell into a bitter reverie the profoundest pity the most impassioned admiration and the most ardent desire to afford protectionare not these the ingredients that make the allpotent draught of love let universal humanity replyi loved but the feeling generally so blissful came upon my young heart and steeped it in the bitterness of apprehension my bosom was swollen with big resolves with the deepest affection for one and hate for all the rest of my species and the thought came over me vividly of flight with the young and pensive beauty into the inaccessible seclusion of the woods and of the unalloyed happiness and the imaginary glories of a savage life in this sudden depression of spirits my mind looked not unloathingly on mutual suicide it was a black and a desponding hour and fell upon me with the suddenness of a total eclipse on a noontide summers day i sat with my clasped hands between my knees and my head hanging upon my breast almost unconscious of the black servitors around me who were reordering the room that i had so recently disarranged i noted all this as something that did not belong to the world in which i had existence everything around me seemed the shadows of somebodys dream in which i had no part and could take no interest i had but two allabsorbing ideas and these wereinjustice and josephine so distraught was i with the vastness of the one and with the loveliness of the other that when the young and splendid reality stole into the apartment softly and moved before my eyes in all the fascination of her gracefulness yet was i scarcely conscious of the actual presence of her whose ideal existence was torturing my brain to the cold the unimpassioned or the unpoetical this may seem impossible i will not go into metaphysical reasonings on the subject i only know that it was true whilst i was conceiving her flying from oppression with me her protector into some grim solitude she came and placed herself almost unnoticed by my side took my unresisting hands between her own and seeing how little i appeared to notice the endearment she gradually sank on her knees before me and placing her forehead upon my hands remained for a space in silence feeling her hot tears trickling through my fingers called me back from my dark reverie and as i became aware of the present a sigh so deep and so long burst forth that it seemed to rend my bosom those dark lustrous melancholy eyes swimming in tears were then lifted up to mine ages of eloquence were contained in that one look in it i read the whole story of her life the depth of her love the fealty of her faith and the deep the unspeakable prayer for sympathy for love and for protection the mute appeal was unanswerable it seemed to be conveyed to me by the voice of destiny to my mind louder and more awful than thunder at that moment i pledged myself eternally to her and gradually drawing up her yielding light and elastic form from my knees to my bosom i sobbed out whilst i breathe dearest thou shalt never writhe under the lash and then giving way to an uncontrollable passion of weeping i mingled my tears with hersand we were happy yes our young love was baptised with tearsan ominous and a fitting rite we cried in each others arms like children as we were at first with anguish then with hope and affection and at length in all the luxury of a newborn bliss when this passion had a little subsided and smiles and murmuring ejaculations of happiness had driven away the symbols of what is not always anguish old manuel approached and appeared much pleased at the tokens of affection that we mutually lavished upon each other and then with my arm encircling josephines slender waist and her fair face upon my shoulder he began his artful discourse gradually he led me to speak of myself my friends my views and ultimately my strange and mysterious story was fully unfolded even in this prolonged relation i was amply rewarded by the impassioned looks at once so tender and so thrilling of the beauteous listener by my side and by the ready tear at every passage that told of suffering the fond creature still creeping more closely to me at every instance of danger and bright the beam of triumph would flash from her eye responsive to every incident of my success when all was told and half wondering and faintly smiling i finished by the rather silly expression ofand here i am i was immediately imprisoned in the arms of josephine as she pathetically exclaimed and for ever josephine speaks well said manuel rising and placing patriarchally a hand on the head of each of us my children would it were for ever it appears by the narrative that monsieur has done us the great honour to relate that he is a castawayan unownedand if my young friend makes use of all the wisdom he doubtless possesses in so high a degree he will join us in blessing providence that has given the gallant young homeless one a home for i need not tell him that all he sees around is histhe land and the house and to the hitherto unloved a young and tender heart that will cherish him to the fatherless a father and thus the old emigre concluded his speech with a tear glistening in his eyeand an unexceptionable bow had he flung himself into my arms the effect would have been complete i hate to record scenes of this sort but as i have imposed the task upon myself i will go through it and though the temptation is great seeing what i was then the disciple as well as the offspring of romance and what i now am worldly in the worlds most sordid worldliness to do my penance in selfmockeryfor the sake of the young hearts still unseared i will refrain i was exceedingly affected and agitated at this appeal the purport of which i could not misunderstand my emotions at first prevented me from speaking i arose from the sofa josephine still hanging upon my shoulder and taking her fathers hand led them both to the window the sun was near the horizon and mountain sea and green valley and dark forest were steeped in a roseate glory about three miles distant and beneath us my gallant frigate sat in the bosom of the gently rippling waters like a sultana upon her embroidered divan her ensign and her pennant streaming out fair and free to the evening breeze i pointed to her and with a voice scarcely articulatefor at that period the sob would rise too readily to my throat and the tear start too freely to my eyei exclaimed behold my homemy country claims the duty of a son monsieur knows best said manuel almost coldly his countrymen have conquered us you are a gallant race undoubtedly but one of them has not shown much mercy to my daughter the passionate girl was at my feetyes kneeling at my feet and her supplicating hands were clasped in that attitude of humility that is due only to god who taught her the infinite pathos of that beautiful posture taught her she had no teacher save nature and love josephine said i lifting her gently up and kissing her fair brow you are breaking my heart i cannot stand thisi must rush out of the house i have never said i loved youmean subterfuge but you do you doit is my fateit is yoursfor three years i have been expecting youdisbelieve me notask the obeah woman it is true and then hurrying out the words like the downpouring of the mountain torrent she continued do you love medo you love medo you love me i do josephinei do distractedly but stern honour stands in the way and what is this honour she exclaimed with genuine simplicity for it was evident that if she had ever heard the word before she had not the remotest idea of its meaning et quelle est cette honneurla and there was contempt in her tone i had no words to reply will this honour do that for you which my fatherwhich iwill do what has this honour done for himtell me father has it put that gay blue jacket on him or that small sword by his side show him my dear father the rich dresses that we have and the beautiful arms will honour watch you in your hours of sickness take you out in the noonday heats and show you the cool shady places and the refreshing rippling springs what is this honour that seems to bid you to break my heart and make me die of very grief monsieur manuel said i extremely confused have the kindness to explain to dear josephine what honour is a rule of conduct he replied with severity that was never recorded never understood and which men construe just as suits their convenience one honest impulse of the heart is worth all the honour i ever heard of this was a delicate helping of a friend in a dilemma i turned for relief from the sarcastic father to the beautiful countenance of the daughter and i there beheld an expression of intense sorrow that agonised me her sudden and to me totally unexpected animation had disappeared melancholy seemed to have drooped her darkest wings over her i thought that she must soon die under their noxious shadow for one instant my eyes caught hers i could not stand the appeal i will stay said i gently until the ship sails i had then for the first time to witness the enthusiasm of the melancholy temperamentthe eloquence of unschooled nature the bending figure that seemed to collapse in weakness upon my supporting arm suddenly flung herself from me her rounded and delicate figure swelled at once into sudden dignity her muscles assumed the rigidity yet all the softness of a highlypolished grecian statue and stood before me as if by enchantment half woman half marble beautiful inexpressibly i was sorely tried there was no action no waving of the arms as she spoke her voice came forth musically as if from sacred oracle that oracle having life only in words monsieur manuel had very wisely departed not an hournot a minutenot an instant orfor ever young sir you have already stayed too long if you stay not always leave me to dream of you and to die the thorn is in my heart it may kill me gradually go why sir have you looked upon me as man never before looked why why have you mingled your false tears with mine that were so trueand oh so loving but what am i who thus speak so proudly to a being whom if i did not know he was treacherous i should think an angel un des bons esprits i a poor weak ignorant girl of colourborn of a slave to a slaverywhose only ambition was to have been loved loved for a short short whilefor know that i am to die earlyi should not have troubled you long but you are too good for mei was a presumptuous fool go and at once and take with you all that i have to givethe blessing of a youngborn bondswoman all this time she had stood firmly and nearly motionless with her hands folded beneath her heaving bosom at some distance from me i approached her with extended arms and had some such foolish rhapsody on my tongue as beautiful daughter of the sun for i had already contemplated her under a new character when retreating and waving me from her she continued already too much of thislet me die by cruelty rather than by caresses which are the worst of cruelty i feel a new spirit living within me i am a child no more yesterday i should have crouched before you as one degraded as i ought to do you have pressed me to your bosomyou have spoken to me as your equaleven your tears have bathed my brow you have ennobled me oh it is a happiness and a great glory i formerly so humble command you to gogo dear dear ralph you will not kill me quite by going now therefore be generous and go i was already sufficiently in love and began to feel ashamed of myself for not having as yet caught a little of her enthusiasm josephine said i in a quiet serious tone give me your hand i took itit was deadly cold at that moment all her best blood was rallying round her young heart i led her to the open window and showed her the noble frigate so hateful to her sight and said dear josephine in that ship there are more than three hundred gallant fellows all of whom are my countrymen and some of them my familiar friends i have often shared with them danger under the very jaws of death i have broken my bread with some of them constantly for nearly three years these are all claims on me you see that i am speaking to you calmly i had no idea what a little impassioned orator you weredo not look so dejected and so humble i love you for it the more i only made the remark to convince you that what i now say is not the mere prompting of a transient impulse but josephine in my own faraway land i have also a few friends nor am i wholly a castaway there is a mystery about my origin which i wish to dissipate yet that i cherish if i conduct myself as i have hitherto done in time i shall have the sole control and government of a vessel as proud as the one before you and of all the noble spirits it will contain the mystery of which i have spoken i am most sanguine will be cleared up and i may peradventure one day take my place among the nobles of my land as it now is among the nobles of the sea weep not thus my love or you will infect me with emotions too painful to be borne let us be calm for a little space the reign of passion will commence soon enough mark me josephine for yougod forgive me if i commit sinfor you i cast off my associates sever all my ties of friendship let the mystery of my origin remain unravelled renounce the land of my birthfor you i encounter the peril of being hung for desertion josephine you will incur a great debta heavy responsibility my heart my happiness is in your hands josephine i stay for ever for ever a wild shriek of joy burst from her delighted lips as she leaped to my bosom and for the first time our lips sealed the mysterious compact of love after a moment i gently released myself from the sweet bondage of her embrace and said dear josephine this cannot be to me a moment of unalloyed joy you see the sun is half below the horizon give me one moment of natural grief for so surely as i stay here so surely like that orb are all my hopes of glory setting and for ever and the tears came into my eyes as i exclaimed farewell my countryfarewell honoureos my gallant frigate fare thee well as if instinct with life the beautiful vessel answered my apostrophe the majestic thunder of her maindeck gun boomed awfully and methought sorrowfully over the waters and then bounded among the echoes of the distant hills around and above me slowly dying away in the distant mountains it was the gun which as commodore was fired at sunset it is all over i exclaimed i have made my electionleave me for a little while alone chapter fifty ralph falleth into the usual delusion of supposing himself happy wisheth it may last all his life making it a realityas yet no symptoms of it dispelling but the brightest sunset may have the darkest night she bounded from me in a transport of joy shouting he stays he stays and i heard the words repeated among the groups of negresses who loved her it seemed to be the burthen of a general song the glad realisation of some prophecy for ere the night was an hour old the old witch who had had the tuition of josephine had already made a mongrel sort of hymn of the affair whilst a circle of black chins were wagging to a chords of goramity good buchra body stays i saw no more of josephine that night the old gentleman her father joined me after i had been alone nearly two hourstwo hours i assure the reader of misery i contemplated a courtship of some decent duration and a legal marriage at the altar i tried to view my position on all sides and thus to find out that which was the most favourable for my minds eye to rest uponit was but a disconsolate survey sometimes a dark suspicion that i repelled from me as if it were a demon whispering murder in my ear would hint to me the possibility that i was entrapped however the lights that came in with monsieur manuel dissipated them and darkness together he behaved extremely wellgave me an exact account of all his possessions and of his ready money the latter of which was greatly beyond my expectations and the former very considerable he immediately gave me an undertaking that he would if i remained with him adopt me as his son allow me during life a competency fit to support me and his daughter genteelly and to make me his sole heir at his death this undertaking bound him also to see the proper documents duly and legally drawn up by a notary so as to render the conditions of our agreement binding on both parties we then spoke as father and son of our future views we were determined to leave the island immediately we could get anything like its value for the plantation and the large gang of negroes upon it but where go to then englandmy desertion franceyes it was there that we were to spend our lives and thus we speculated on future events that the future never owned i have said before that during the whole time that i was in the navy i never was intoxicatedand never once swallowed spirituous liquors both assertions are strictly true this memorable evening over our light supper i drank perhaps two glasses of claret more than was my wont at captain reuds table i was excessively wearied both in mind and body i became so unaccountably and lethargically drowsy that in spite of every effort of mine to the contrary i fell fast asleep in the midst of a most animated harangue of the good manuel upon the various perfections of his lovely daughtera strange subject for a lover to sleep upon but so it was had josephines nurse and the obeah woman anything to do with it perhaps they are skilful druggers if my life and the lives of all those dearer to me than life itself had depended upon my getting up and walking across the room i could not have done it how i got to bed i know not but i awoke in the morning in luxuriant health with a blushing bride upon my bosom and then ensued days of dreamy ecstasy my happiness seemed too great too full too overflowing to be real everything around me started into poetry i seemed to be under the direction of fairy spirits all my wants were cared for as if by invisible hands it appeared to me that i had but to wish and gratification followed before the wish was half formed i was passive and carried away in a trance of happiness i was beset with illusion and so intense were my feelings of rapture mingled with doubt and my blissful distraction so great that it was late in the day before i noticed the dress i had on the light and broadbrimmed planters hat the snowy white jean jacket and trousers and the infinitely fine linen shirt with its elaborately laced front had all been donned without my noticing the change from my usual apparel it was a dress from its purity and its elegance worthy of a bridegroom i learnt afterwards that josephines old negressnurse had with many and powerful incantationsat least as powerful as incantations always areburied under six feet of earth every article of clothing in which i had first entered the mansion well there we were a very pretty version of paul and virginianot perhaps quite so innocent but infinitely more happy roving hand in hand through orange bowers and aromatic shades love is sweet and a first love very very delightful but when we are not only loved but almost worshipped that that is the incense that warms the heart and intoxicates the brain wherever i turned i found greeting and smiles and respectful observance hovered along my path the household adored their young mistress and me through her old manuel seemed serenely happy he encouraged us to be alone with each other i could write volumes upon the little incidents and interesting ones too of this singular honeymoon i observed no more bursts of passion in josephine her soul had folded its wings upon my bosom and there dreamed itself away in a tender and loving melancholy how i now smile and perhaps could weep when i call to mind all her little artifices of love to prevent my ever casting my eyes upon the hated ship as i have related before our little squadron at anchor in this secluded bay departed one by one leaving only the eos with her sorelywounded captain yet though i saw them not i knew by josephines triumphant looks when a vessel had sailed all the jalousies in front of the house were nailed up so that if by chance i wandered into one of the rooms in that quarter i saw nothing i had been domesticated in this paradisea fools perhaps but still a paradisea month and i was sitting alone in the shade reading behind the house when josephine flew along the avenue of lemontrees and flung herself into my arms and sobbing hysterically exclaimed my dear dear ralph now you are almost wholly mine there is only one left and that one my josephine speak not of it think not of it sweet it is not yours but swear swear to me again you will never more look upon it do dearest and i will learn a whole column extra of words in two syllables and i repeated the ofteniterated oath and she sat down tranquilly at my feet like a good little girl and began murmuring the task she was committing to memory and how did the schooling get on oh beautifully we had such sweet and so many schoolrooms and interruptions still more sweet and numerous sometimes our hall of study was beneath the cool rock down the sides of which green with age the sparkling rill so delightfully trickled sometimes in the impervious quiet and flowerenamelled bower amidst all the spicy fragrance of tropical shrubs and sometimes in the solemn old wood beneath the boughs of trees that had stood for uncounted ages and the interruptions repeatedly the book and the slate would be cast away and we would start up as if actuated by a single spirit and chase some singularly beautiful hummingbird sometimes the genius of frolic would seize us and we would chase each other round and round the old mahoganytrees with no other object than to rid ourselves of our exuberance of happiness but the most frequent interruptions were when she would close her book and bathing me in the lustre of her melancholy eyes bid me tell her some tale that would make her weep or with a pious awe request me to unfold some of the mysteries of the universe around her and commune with her of the attributes of their great and beneficent creator was not this a state of the supremest happiness joy seemed to come down to me from heaven in floods of light the earth to offer up her incense to me as i trod upon her beautiful and flowerencumbered bosom the richlyplumaged birds to hover about me as if sent to do me homage even the boughs of the majestic trees as i passed them seemed to wave me a welcome joy was in me and around me there was no pause in my blissful feelings i required no relaxation to enjoy them more perfectly for pleasure seemed to succeed pleasure in infinite variety it was too glorious to last the end was approaching and that end was very bitter chapter fifty one a short chapter and a miserable onethe less that is said of it the better i had been living in the plantation nearly three months my little wife for such i held her to be had made much progress in her educationmore in my affection she could not i had already put her into joining hand and i began to be as proud of her dawning intellect as i was of her person and of her love i had renounced my country and in good faith i had intended to have held by her for ever and when i should find myself in a country where marriage with one born in slavery was looked upon as no opprobrium i had determined that the indissoluble ceremony should be legally performed to do all this i was in earnest but events or destiny or by whatever highsounding term we may call those occurrences which force us on in a path we wish not to tread ruled it fearfully otherwise i religiously abstained from looking towards the ship or even the sea yet i plainly saw by the alternations of hope and joy and fear on josephines sweet countenance that something of the most vital importance was about to take place they could not conceal from me that parties of men had been searching for me because for a few days i had been in actual hiding with josephine three or four miles up the woody mountain i must hurry over all this for the recollection of it even at this great lapse of time is agonising the night before the eos sailed she would not sleepher incessant tears the tremulous energy with which clasped me and held me for hours all told the secret that i wished not to know all that night she watched as a mother watches a departing and firstborn childtearfullyanxiouslybut overcome with fatigue and the fierce contention of emotions as the morning dawned her face drooped away from mine her clasping arms gradually relaxed and murmuring my name with a blessing she slept did she ever sleep again may god pardon me i know not i hung over her and watched her almost worshipping until two hours after sunrise i blessed her as she lay there in all her tranquil beauty fervently and instead of my prayers i repeated over and over again my oath that i would never desert her but some devil in order to spread the ashes of bitterness through the long path of my afterlife suggested to me that now as the frigate had sailed for some time there could be no danger in taking one last look at her indeed the thought of doing so took the shape of a duty i stole out of bed and crept softly round to the front of the house the place where the gallant ship had rode at anchor for so many weeks was vacantall was still and lonely i walked on to a higher spot and far distant among the sinuosities of the romantic entrance to the harbour my eye caught for a moment her receding pennant i therefore concluded that everything was safethat i was cut off and for ever from my country a little qualm of remorse passed through my bosom and then i was exceeding glad the morning was fresh and the air invigorating and i determined to walk down to the beautiful minutelysanded beach and enjoy the refreshment of the seabreeze just sweeping gently over the bay to do this i had to pass over a shoulder of land to my left i gained the beach and stood upon it for some minutes with folded arms this particular walk had been so long debarred to me that i now enjoyed it the more i was upon the point of turning round and seeking the nest where i had left my dove sleeping in conscious security when to my horror i beheld the eos pinnace fullmanned and doublebanked the wave foaming up her cutwater and roaring under her sixteen oars rapidly round the rocky hummock that formed the eastern horn of the little bay her prow soon tore up the sand and the thirdlieutenant a masters mate and the officer of marines with four privates leaped ashore immediately for a few moments i was paralysed with terror and then suddenly springing forward i ran at the top of my speed i need not say that my pursuers gave chase heartily i had no other choice but to run on straight before me and that unfortunately was up a rocky rugged side of a steep hill that rose directly from the beach covered with that abominable vegetable or shrub the prickly pear i was in full view and being hailed and told that i should be fired upon if i did not bring to in the space of a short three minutes before i was out of breath i was in the hands of my captorsa prisoner i prayedi knelti wept it was useless i have scarcely the courage to write what then took place it was so fearfulit was so hideous bounding down the hill in her nightdress her long black hair streaming like a meteor behind her and her naked feet usually so exquisitely white covered with blood came josephine shrieking ralph ralph her voice seemed to stab my bosom like an actual knife behind her came running her father and a number of negro men and women before she could reach me they had flung me into the sternsheets of the boat shove off shove off shouted the lieutenant and the boat was immediately in motion like a convicted felon or a murderer taken in the fact i buried my craven head in my knees and shut my eyes i would not have looked back for kingdoms but i could not or did not think of preventing myself from hearing the boat had not pulled ten yards from the beach when i heard a splash behind us and simultaneous cries of horror from the boats crew and those on shore among which the agonised voice of the heartbroken father rose shrilly as he exclaimed josephine my child i looked up for a moment but dared not look round and i saw every man in the boat dashing away the tears from his eyes with one hand as he reluctantly pulled his oar with the other give way give way roared the lieutenant stamping violently against the grating at his feet give way or by god shell overtake us the poor girl was swimming after me rattlin said selby stooping down and whispering in my earrattlin i cant stand it if it was not as much as my life was worth i would put you on shore directly i could answer him only by a long convulsive shudder the horrible torment of those moments then ascended the loud howling curses of the negroes behind us the seamen rose up upon their oars and with a few violent jerks the pinnace shot round the next point of land and the poor struggler in the waters was seen no more tidings never after came to me of her i left her struggling in the waters of the ocean my first love and my last my only one i was taken on board stupefied i was led up the side like a sick man no one reproached me no one spoke to me i became physically as well as mentally ill i went to my hammock with a stern feeling of joy hoping soon to be lashed up in it and find my grave in the deep blue sea at first my only consolation was enacting over and over again all the happy scenes with josephine but as they invariably terminated in one dreadful point this occupation became hateful i then endeavoured to blot the whole transaction from my memoryto persuade myself that the events had not been realthat i had dreamed themor read them long ago in some old book but the mind is not so easily cheatedremorse not so soon blinded chapter fifty two the captain taketh to tantrumsand keepeth on board monkeys bears and disciplineit is feared also that the moon hath too much to do with his observations notwithstanding my misery i became convalescent i went to my duty doggedly everybody saw and respected my grief and the affair was never mentioned to me by any with one only exception and that was six months after by a heavy brutal mastersmate named pigtop who had been in the pinnace that brought me off he came close to me and without preparation he electrified me by drawling out i say rattlin what a mess you made of it at aniana that girl of yours to my thinking burst a bloodvessel as she was giving you chase i saw the blood bubble out of her mouth and nose liar i exclaimed and seizing a heavy block that one of the afterguard was fitting i felled him to the deck the basehearted poltroon went and made his complaint to captain reud who ordered him to leave the ship immediately he came into harbour we must now retrograde a little in the narrative in order to show what events led to the disastrous catastrophe i have just related captain reud having been lying for many many weeks apparently unconscious of objects around him one morning said in a faint low voice when dr thompson and mr farmer the firstlieutenant were standing near him send ralph rattlin to read the bible to me now since my absence some supposed i had been privately stabbed by one of the few ferocious and angry marauders still left in the town but as no traces of my body could be found still more of my shipmates believed that i had deserted in plain sincerity these latter friends of mine were as our transatlantic brethren say pretty considerably slapdashically right however as the shock to the wounded captain would have been the greater to say that i had been assassinated they chose the milder alternative and told him that they feared i had deserted captain reud merely said i dont believe it turned his face to the bulkhead and remained silent for three or four days more still as he was proceeding towards convalescence he began to be more active or rather ordered more active measures to be taken to clear up the mystery of my disappearance parties were consequently sent to scour the country for miles round but i was too well concealed to permit them to be of any utility the only two seamen that had seen me near manuels premises belonged to the frigate which had sailed before my captain had recovered his faculties but i was not to be so easily given up perhaps he remembered that what remained of life to him was preserved by me and notwithstanding his cruel usage i well knew that he entertained for me a sincere affection as the eos got under weigh after remaining so long at anchor in the port that the men observed she would shortly ground upon the beefbones that their active masticators had denuded and which were thrown overboard the wind was light and the boats were all out towing with the exception of the pinnace which was ordered to sweep round the bay and look into all the inlets in order to seek for some vestige of my important self for good or for evil the heartrending results ensued how short is the real romance of life a shout of joya pulsation of ecstasyand it is over in the course of my eventful life i have seen very fair faces and very many beautiful forms the fascinations of exterior loveliness i have met combined with high intellect unswerving principles and virtuous emotions awful from their very holiness the fair possessors of many of these lofty attributes i have sometimes wooed and strove to love but though i often sighed and prayed for a return of that heartwhole and absorbing passion there was no magic no charm to call the dead embers into life that young and beautiful savage swept from my bosom all the tenderer stuff she collected the fresh flowers of passion and leftit is of no consequencejosephine farewell let us talk idly it is a droll world let us mock each other and call it mirth there is my poor halfderanged captain cutting such antics that even authority with the twoedged sword in his hand cannot repress the outbursting of ignoble derision first of all he takes a mania for apes and monkeys disrates all his midshipmen taking care however that they still do their duty and makes the ships tailor rig out their successors in uniform the officers are aghast for the maniac is so cunning and the risk of putting a superior officer under an arrest so tremendous that they know not what to do besides their captain is only mad on one subject at one time indeed insanity seems sometimes to find a vent in monomania actually improving all the faculties on all other points well the monkey midshipmen did not behave very correctly so captain reud had them one afternoon all tied up to one of his guns in the cabin and one after the other well flogged with the catoninetails it was highly ludicrous to see the poor fellows waiting each for his turn well knowing what was to come they never than when under the impression of their fears looked more human that night they stole into the cabin by two or three in the dead of the night and nearly murdered their persecutor this looked very like combination and an exercise of faculties that may be nearly termed reasoning they were all thrown overboard the next phantasy was the getting up of the forecastle carronades into the tops thereby straining the ship and nearly carrying away the mast that folly wore out and the guns came down to their proper places then a huge bear came on boarda very gentlemanly dignified fellow never in a hurry and who always moved about with a gracious deliberation captain reud amused himself by endeavouring to teach him to dance and a worthless blackguard who could play on the pipe and tambour and who probably had led a bear about the country was taken into especial grace and was loaded with benefits in order to assist his captain in his singular avocations come and see my bear dance do come and see him dance was now the little creoles continual cry but the bear did not take his tuition kindly and grew daily more ferocious till at length seizing his opportunity he caught up the diminutive skipper and nearly hugged the breath out of his body and almost rubbed his red nose off his yellow face in endeavouring to bite him through his muzzle the star of ursa major was no longer in the ascendant and he was bartered away with the master of the first merchant vessel we met for a couple of gamecocks and the bearleader was turned back into the waist and flogged the next day for impertinence whilst two days before the vagabond was too proud to say sir to a middy but it would be ridiculous to enumerate the long succession of these insane whimsicalities each latter one being more bizarre than the preceding whether a man be mad or not christmas will come round again now jack from time immemorial thinks that he has a right undeniable to get drunk on that auspicious day in harbour that right is not discussed by his officers but is usually exercised sub silentio under their eyes with everything but silence on the part of the exercisers even at sea without the ship be in sight of the enemy or it blows hard enough to blow the ships coppers overboard our friends think it hard very hard to have their cups scored next morning upon their back and indeed to keep all a frigates crew from intoxication on a christmasday would be something like undertaking the labour of sisyphus for as fast as one man could be frightened or flogged into sobriety another would become glorious it was for this very reason that captain reud the christmasday after he had received his wound undertook the task and as the weather was fine he hoped to find it not quite so hard as rolling a stone up a steep hill and invariably seeing it bound down again before it attains the coveted summit immediately after breakfast he had the word passed fore and aft that no man should be drunk that day and that six dozen not of wine would be the reward of any who should dare in the least to infringe that order what is drunkenness what it is we can readily pronounce when we see a man under its revolting phases what is not drunkenness is more hard to say is it not difficult to ascertain the nice line that separates excitement from incipient delirium not at all to a man like captain reud to understand a disease thoroughly a physician will tell you that you will be much assisted by the having suffered from it yourself upon this selfevident principle our aesculapius with the epaulettes was the first man drunk in the ship after dinner that day he had heightened his testing powers with an unusual even to him share of claret well at the usual time we beat to quarters that is always done just before the hammocks are piped down and it is then that the sobriety of the crew as they stand to their guns is narrowly looked into by the respective officers for then the grog has been served out for the day and it is supposed to have been all consumed the captain of course came on the quarterdeck to quarters making tack and half tack till he fairly threw out his starboard grapplingiron and moored himself to one of the belaying pins round the mizzenmast mister farmer said he to the first luff you see i know how to keep a ship in disciplinenot hiccup a man drunk on board of her i doubt it sir was the respectful answer i think sir i can see one now said he taking his eyes off his superior after a searching glance and looking carelessly around where is he oh sir we must not forget that it is christmasday so if you please sir we will not scrutinise very particularly but we will scruscrutinise very particularly remember me of scru scrutinise mister rattlina good word that scruscrewstrenails tenpenny nailshammersironclamps and dogfasteningswhat were we all talking about mr farmer oh sobriety we willassuredly hiccup find out the drunken man so with a large cortege of officers the masteratarms and the ships corporals captain reud leaning his right arm heavily upon my left shoulderfor he was cunning enough just then to find that the gout was getting into his footwe proceeded round the ship on our voyage of discovery now it is no joke for a man half drunk to be tried for drunkenness by one wholly so it was a curious and a comic sight that examinationfor many of the examined were conscious of a cup too much these invariably endeavoured to look the most sober as we approached the various groups around each gun the different artifices of the men to pass muster were most amusing some drew themselves stiffly up and looked as rigid as ironstanchions others took the examination with an easy debonair air as if to say who so innocent as i some again not exactly liking the judge quietly dodged round shifting places with their shipmates so that when the captain peered into the eyes of the last for the symptoms of ebriety the mercurial rascals had quietly placed themselves first to the sharp startling accusation you are drunk sir the answers were beautifully various the indignant no sirthe wellacted surprise i sirthe conciliatory god bless your honour no sirthe logical bill bowling was cook today sirand the sarcastic no more than your honours honour to witness were as we small wits say better than a play the search was almost unavailing the only fish that came to the net was a poor idiotic young man that to my certain knowledge had not tasted grog for months for his messmates gave him a hiding whenever he asked for his allowance to the sudden youre drunk sir of captain reud the simple youth taken by surprise and perhaps thinking it against the articles of war to contradict the captain said yes sir but i havent tasted grog since you got drunk sir take him aft masteratarms and put him in irons the scrutiny over our temperate captain went aft himself glorifying that in all the ships company there was only one instance of intoxication on christmasday and thus he delivered himself hiccupping on the gratifying occasion i call that discipline mr farmer the only drunken man in his majestys vessel under my command aft on the poop in irons and that fellow not worth his salt i quite agree with you said the sneering purser that the only fellow who has dared to get disgracefully drunk today is not worth his salt but he is not in irons aft on the poop i am sure he is not said the first lieutenant that is asastonishing said the mystified extirpator of intemperance as he staggered into his cabin to console himself for and to close his labours with the two other bottles the reader will perceive from these incidents that it was time that captain reud retired to enjoy his laurels on his solum natale in otium cum as much dignitate as would conduce to the happiness of one of his mischiefloving temperament the admiral on the station thought so too when reud took the ship into port royal he superseded the black pilot and took upon himself to con the ship the consequence was that she hugged the point so closely that she went right upon the church steeple of old port royal which is very quietly lying beside the new one submerged by an earthquake and a hole was knocked in the ships forefoot of that large and ruinous description which may be aptly compared to the hole in a patriots reputation who has lately taken office with his quondam opponents with all the efforts of all the fleet that sent relays of hands on board of us to work the pumps we could not keep her afloat so we were obliged first putting a thrummed sail under her bottom to tow her alongside of the dockyard wharf lighten her and lash her to it the same evening by nine oclock she had an empty hull and all the ships company and officers were located in the dockyard and preparations were made the next day for heaving the frigate down it was the opinion of everybody that had not our skipper been the nephew of a very high official of the admiralty he would have been tried by a courtmartial for thus attempting to overturn submarine churches and cracking the bottom of his majestys beautiful frigate as it was we were only ordered to be repaired with all haste and to go home very much indeed to the satisfaction of everybody but the captain himself chapter fifty three a fever case and a potion of love if not altogether a lovepotion what are the doctors about when men die despite of their knowledge and are cured without itralph knoweth not however i must retrograde it may seem surprising that i have made so little mention of my messmates for it would seem that to a midshipman the affairs and characters of midshipmen would be paramount to me they were not so for reasons that i have before stated besides our berth was like an eastern caravanserai or the receivingroom of a pesthouse they all died were promoted or went into other ships excepting two and myself who returned to england it must not be supposed that we were without young gentlemen sometimes we had our full complement sometimes half fresh ones came and they died and so on before i had time to form friendships with them or to study their characters they took their long sleep beneath the palisades or were thrown overboard in their hammocks this was much the case with the wardroom officers the first lieutenant the doctor and the purser were the only original ones that returned to england with us the mortality among the assistantsurgeons was dreadful they messed with us indeed i have no recollection of the names or even the persons of the majority of those with whom i ate and drank and acted they being so prone to prove this a transitory world we were tolerably healthy till the capture of saint domingo when being obliged to convey a regiment of french soldiers to the prisons at port royal they brought the fever in its worst form on board and notwithstanding every remedial measure that the then state of science could suggest we never could eradicate the germs of it the men were sent on board of a hulk the vessel thoroughly cleansed and fumigated and finally we were ordered as far north as new providence but all these means were ineffectual for at intervals nearly regular the fever would again appear and men and officers die hitherto i had escaped the only attack to which i was subjected took place in the capstanhouse for so the place was called where we were bivouacked during the heaving down of the ship i record it not that my conduct under the disease may be imitated but on account of the singularity of the access and the rapidity of the cure i had to tow from port royal up to kingston a powderboy and through some misconduct of the coxswain the boats awning had been left behind six or seven hours under a sun vertical at noon through the hottest part of the day and among the swamps and morasses so luxuriant in vegetable productions that separate port royal from kingston is a good ordeal by which to try a european constitution for the first time my stamina seemed inclined to succumb before it when i returned to port royal at about four in the afternoon the first peculiar sensation with which i was attacked was a sort of slipping of the ground from under me as i trod and a notion that i could skim along the surface of the earth if i chose without using my legs then i was not as is most natural to a fasting midshipman excessively hungry but excessively jocular so instead of seeking good things to put into my mouth i went about dispensing them from out of it i soon began to be sensible that i was talking much nonsense and to like it at length the little sense that i had still left was kind enough to suggest to me that i might be distinguished by my first interview with that king of terrors saffroncrowned jack shall i go to the doctor said i noi have the greatest opinion of doctor thompsonbut it is a great pity that he cannot cure the yellowfever no doubt hell be offended and we are the greatest of friends but i have always observed that all those who go to the doctor begin going indeedfor from the doctor they invariably go to their hammocksfrom their hammocks go to the hospitaland from the hospital go to the palisades so while there was yet time i decided to go in quite an opposite direction i went out of the dockyard gates and to a nice matronly free mulatto who was a mother to meand something more she was a woman of some property and had a very strong gang of young negroes that she used to hire out to his majesty to work in his majestys dockyard and permit for certain considerations to caulk the sides and bottoms of his majestys vessels of war notwithstanding this intimate connection between his majesty and herself she did not disdain to wash or cause to be washed the shirts and stockings of his majestys officers of the navy that is if she liked those officers now she was kind enough to like me exceedingly and though very pretty and not yet very old all in a very proper and platonic manner she was also a great giver of dignity balls and when she was full dressed miss belinda bellarosa was altogether a very seductive personage a warrant officer was an abomination she had refused the hands of many masters mates and i knew for true to use her own bewitching idiom that several lieutenants had made her most honourable overtures well to miss belinda i made the best of my way i am choice in my phrases i could hardly make my way at all for a strange sort of delirium was supervening immediately she saw me she exclaimed ah goramity him catched for sureit break my heart to see him you know i lub massa rattlin like my own piccaninny selp me god he very bad my queen of countless indians dear duchess of doubloons marry me tonight and then youll be a jolly widow tomorrow hear him him how talk of marry me oh bella dear if you will not kill me with kindness what shall i do i cannot bear this raging pain in my head youve been a kind soul to me pardon my nonsense i could not help it let one of your servants help me to walk to the doctor nebber nebber doctor and she spat on the floor with a sovereign contempt ah massa ralph me lub you dearlydat sleep here tonightme lose my reputationnebber mind you you what for you no run dorcas a get me from massa jacksons store bottle good port tell him for me missy bellarosa you phebe oder woman of colour dere why you no take massa ralph and put him in best bed him bad for certainlymake haste or poor buckra boy die so with the assistance of my two dingy handmaidens i was popped into bed and according to the directions of my kind hostess a suffocating number of blankets heaped upon me shortly afterwards and when my reeling senses were barely sane enough to enable me to recognise objects my dear doctress with two more negresses to witness to her reputation entered and putting the bottle of port with a white powder floating at the top of it into a china bowl compelled me to drink off the whole of it then with a look of great and truly motherly affection she took her leave of me telling the two nurses to put another blanket on me and to hold me down in the bed if i attempted to get out then began the raging agony of fever i felt as one mass of sentient fire i had a foretaste of that state which i hope we shall all escape save one of everburning and neverconsuming but though moments of such suffering tell upon the wretch with the duration of ages this did not last more than half an hour when they became exchanged for a dream the most singular and that never will be forgotten whilst memory can offer me one single idea methought that i was suddenly whisked out of bed and placed in the centre of an interminable plain of sand it bounded the horizon like a level sea nothing was to be seen but this white and glowing sand the intense blue and cloudless sky and directly above me the eternal sun like the eye of an angry god pouring down intolerable fires upon my unprotected head at length my skull opened and from the interior of my head a splendid temple seemed to arise rows of columns supported rows of columns order was piled upon order and as it arose babellike to the skies it extended in width as it increased in height and there in this strange edifice i saw the lofty the winding the interminable staircase the wide and marblepaved courts nor was there wanting the majestic and splashing fountain whose cool waters were mocking my scorchedup lips and there were also the long range of beautiful statues the structure continued multiplying itself until all the heavens were full of it extending nearly to the horizon all around under this superincumbent weight i had long struggled to stand it kept bearing down more and more heavily upon the root of my brain the anguish became insufferable but i still nobly essayed to keep my footing with a defiance and a pride that savoured of impious presumption at length i felt completely overcome and exclaimed god of mercy relieve me the burthen is more than i can bear then commenced the havoc in this temple that was my head and was not there were the toppling down of the vast columns the crushing of the several architraves the grinding together of the rich entablatures the breaking up with noise louder than ever thunder was heard by man of the marble pavements the ruins crushed together in one awful confusion above menature could do no more and my dream slept the sun was at its meridian height when i awoke the next day in health with every sensation renewed and that too in the so sweet a feeling that makes the mere act of living delightful i found nothing remarkable but that i had been subjected to a profuse perspiration miss bellarosa met me at breakfast all triumph and i was all gratitude i was very hungry and as playful as a schoolboy who had just procured a holiday eh massa ralph suppose no marry me todaywhat for you say no yes to dat because dear bella you wouldnt have me tryyou ask me said she looking at me with a fondness not quite so maternal as i could wish bella dearest will you marry me for true for true tanky massa rattlin dear tanky you make me very happy but for true no were you older more fifteen year or me more fifteen year younger perhapsbut tank ye much for de comblement now go and tell buckra doctor so as i could not reward my kind physician with my hand which bytheby i should not have offered had i not been certain of refusal i was obliged to force upon her as splendid a trinket as i could purchase for a keepsake and gave my sable nurses a handful of bits each bits of what say the uninitiated i dont know whether i have described this fever case very nosologically but very truly i know i have chapter fifty four a new character introduced who claimeth old acquaintanceshipnot very honest by his own account which giveth him more the appearance of honesty than he deservethhe proveth to be a steward not inclined to hide his talent in a napkin during all the time that these west indian events had been occurring that is nearly three years i had no other communication with england than regularly and repeatedly sending there various pieces of paper thus headed this my first of exchange my second and third not paid or for varietys sake this my second of exchange my first and third etcetera or to be more various still this my third my first and secondall of which received more attention than their strange phraseology seemed to entitle them to but i must now introduce a new character one that attended me for years like an evil shadow nor left me until the beginning of the end the ship had been hove down the wound in her forefoot healed that is to say the huge rent stopped up and we were beginning to get water and stores on board and i was walking on the quay of the dockyard when i was civilly accosted by a man having the appearance of a captains steward he was pale and handsome with small white hands and if not actually genteel in his deportment had that metropolitan refinement of look that indicated contact with genteel society though dressed in the blue jacket and white duck trousers of the sailors sunday best at a glance you would pronounce him to be no seaman before he spoke to me he had looked attentively at several other midshipmen some belonging to my own ship others young gentlemen who were on shore on dockyard duty at length after a scrutiny sufficient to make me rather angry he took off his hat very respectfully and said have i the honour of speaking to mr ralph rattlin you have well my man ah sir you forget me and no wonder my name sir is daunton joshua daunton never heard the name before in my life oh yes you have sir begging your pardon very often indeed why you used to call me jossey little jossey come here you little vagabond and let me ride you pickaback the devil i did why mr rattlin i was your fag at mr roots school now i knew this to be a lie for under that very respectable pedagogue and in that very respectable seminary as the reader well knows i was the fagged and not the fagger now really joshua daunton said i i am inclined to think that you may be joshua the little vagabond still for upon my honour i remember nothing about you seeing there were so many hundred boys under mr roots my schoolfellow you might have been but may i be vexed if ever i fagged you or any one else now my good man prove to me that you have been my schoolfellow first and then let me know what i can do for you afterwards for i suppose that you have some favour to ask or some motive in seeking me i have indeed he replied with a peculiar intonation of voice that might have been construed in many ways he then proceeded to give me many details of the school at islington which convinced me if there he had never been he had conversed with some one who had still he evaded all my attempts at crossexamination with a skill which gave me a much higher opinion of his intellect than of his honesty with the utmost efforts of my recollection i could not call him to mind and i bluntly told him so i then bade him tell me who he was and what he wanted i am the only son of an honest pawnbroker of shoreditch he was tolerably rich and determined to give me a good education he sent me to mr roots school it was there that i had the happiness of being honoured by your friendship now sir you perceive that though i am not so tall as you by some inches i am at least seven or eight years older shortly after you left school to go to another at stickenham i also left with my education as my father fondly supposed finished sir i turned out bad i confess it with shamei was a rascal my father turned me out of doors i have had several ups and downs in the world since and i am now steward on board of the london the west indiaman that arrived here the day before yesterday very well joshua but how came you to know that i went to school at stickenham because in my tramping about the country i saw you with the other young gentlemen in the playground on the common hum but how in the name of all that is curious came you to know that i was here at port royal dockyard and a young gentleman belonging to the eos oh very naturally sir about two years ago i passed again over the same common with my associates i could not resist the wish to see if you were still in the playground i did not see you among the rest and i made bold to inquire of one of the elder boys where you were he told me the name of the ship and of your captain the first thing on coming into the harbour that struck my eye was your very frigate alongside the dockyard i got leave to come on shore and i knew you directly that i saw you but why examine so many before you spoke to me however i have no reason to be suspicious for time makes great changes now what shall i do for you give me your protection and as much of your friendliness as is compatible with our different stations but daunton according to your own words you have been a sad fellow before i extend to you what you require i ought to know what you really have done you spoke of trampinghave you been a trampera gipsy i have have you ever committed theft only in a small way ah and swindledonly in a small way of course the temptations were great where will this fellow stop thought i let us see however how far he will go and then giving utterance to my thoughts i continued the step between swindling and forgery is but very short and i pausedfor even i had not the confidence to ask him are you a forger very was the short dry answer i was astonished perhaps he will confess to the commission of murder oh as you were just saying to yourself we are the mere passive tools of fatewe are drawn on in spite of ourselves if a man comes in our way why you know in selfdefencehey what do you mean sir a little prick under the ribs in a quiet way the wanderings and jerkings of the angry hand will happen you understand me too well i am afraid sir i have never yet shed mans bloodi never will perhaps sir you would not depend upon my virtue for thisyou may upon my cowardice i tremblei sicken at the sight of blood i have endeavoured to win your confidence by candouri have not succeeded may i be permitted to wish you a good day stop daunton this is a singular encounter and a still more singular conference as an old schoolfellow you ask me to give you my protection the protection of a reefer is in itself something laughable and then as an inducement you confess to me that you are a villain only in guilt just short of murder perhaps by this bravado sort of confession you have endeavoured to give me a worse impression of your character than it really deserves that you might give me the better opinion of your sincerity is it not so in a great measure it is i thought so now let me tell you daunton that that very circumstance makes me afraid of you but still i will not cast aside the appeal of an old schoolfellow what can i do for you give me the protection afforded me by a manofwar by taking me as your servant utterly impossible i can press you directly or give the hint to any of the many menofwar here to do so but the rules of the service do not permit a midshipman to have a separate servant do you wish to enter only on board of your ship and with the privilege of waiting upon you and being constantly near your person thank you but what prevents my impressing you even as you stand there these very ample protections and he produced them yes i see that you are well provided but why give up your good berth on board the london mr rattlin i have my reasons permit them as yet to remain secret there is no guilt attached to them may i sail with you in the capacity of your servant i have told you before that you cannot be my servant solely you must be the servant of the midshipmens berth yes with all my heart provided that you pledge me your honour that i shall never be put to any other duty i was astonished at this perseverance and very honestly told him all the miseries of the situation for which he seemed so ambitious they did not shake his resolution i then left him and spoke to mr farmer let the fool enter was the laconic reply but he will not enter but on the conditions i have mentioned and his protections are too good to be violated then i authorise you to make them we are short of men but joshua would not enter he required to be pressed so i went on board his own merchantship according to previous arrangement and pressed him he made no resistance and produced no documents he only called the master of the ship and the first and second officer to witness that he was a pressed man and then taking his kit with him he even cheerfully tripped down the side into the boat and thus for nearly an eventful year i was the instrument of placing my evil genius near me chapter fifty five the art of mischief made easyrather hard upon the experimentedheaven preserve me from my friends ill take care of my enemies myself say the honest spaniards and so says honest ralph and so filling our cabins with invalided officers we sailed for england we took home with us a convoy and a miserable voyage we made of it in taking my soidisant schoolfellow on board the eos i had shipped with me my mephistophiles the former servant to the midshipmens berth was promoted to the mizzentop and joshua daunton inducted with due solemnities to all the honours of waiting upon about half a dozen fierce unruly midshipmen and as many sick supernumeraries and he formally took charge of all the messplate and munitions de bouche of this submarine establishment there was no temptation to embezzlement our little society was a commonwealth of the most democratic descriptionand as usually happens in these sort of experiments there was a community of goods that were good for nothing to the community i will give an inventory of all the movables of this republic for the edification of the curious among these i must first of all enumerate the salle a manger itself a hot little hole in the cockpit of about eight feet by six which was never clean this diningroom and breakfastroom also contained our cellars which contained nothing on which cellars we lay down when there was roomyour true midshipman is a recumbent animaland sat when we could not lie for the same reason that the romans called a grove lucus these cellerets were called lockers because there was nothing to lock in them and no locks to lock in that nothing withal in the midst stood an oak table carved with more names than ever rosalind accused orlando of spoiling good trees with besides the outline of a ship and a number of squares which served for an immovable draughtboard one battered spoutless handless japannedtin jug that did not contain water for it leaked some tin mugs seven or perhaps eight pewter plates an excellent old iron tureen the best friend we had and which had stood by us through storm and calm and the spiteful kick of reefer and the contemptuous slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in the galley which tureen contained our cocoa in the morning our peasoup at noon and after these multiplied duties performed the character of washhand basin whenever the midshipmans fag condescended to cleanse his hands it is a fact that when we sailed for england of crockeryware we had not a single article there was a calabash or so and two or three sections of cocoanut shells we had no other provisions than barely the ships allowance and even these were of the worst description bread it is well remarked is the staff of life but it is not quite pleasant to find it life itself and to have the power of locomotion every other description of food was in the same state of transition into vivification there is no exaggeration in all this from the continual coming and going and the state of constant disunion in which we lived it was every man for himself and god i am sorry to say seemed to have very little to do with any of us so complete was our disorganisation and so great our destitution as a mess that after the first week the supernumerary sick young gentlemen were relieved from this candlelight den of starvation and of dirt and distributed among the warrant officers it was to wait upon our persons to administer to our wants and to take care of our culinary comforts that joshua daunton was duly installed it was very ludicrous to see our late servant giving up his charge to our present onethe solemnity with which the iron tureen and the one knife and the three forks that were not furcated seeing that they had but one prong each were surrendered joshuas contempt at the sordid poverty of the republic to which he was to administer was quite as undisguised as his surprise i again and again requested him to do his duty in some other capacity in the ship but he steadily refused the silky softspoken cockneydialected josh got me into continual hot water at first he seemed to consider himself as my servant only consequently he was continually thrashed and i on his appeal taking his part had to endeavour to thrash the thrasher now this could not always be conveniently done the more i suffered for this daunton the more ardently he seemed to attach himself to me but there appeared to be much more malice than affection in his fidelity nothing prospered either with me or my messmates he contrived in the most plausible manner possible to spoil our almost unspoilable meals he always managed to draw for us the very worst rations and to lay the blame on the pursers steward in bringing aft our miserable dinners his foot would slip or a man would run against himor somebody had taken it off the galleyfire and thrown it in the manger saltwater would miraculously intrude into my messmates rumbottle and my daily pint of wine was either sour or muddy or sandy or afflicted with something that made it undrinkable in one word under the care of the good joshua messieurs the midshipmen ran a most eminent risk of being actually starved many a time after we had gone through the motions of dining without eating and as we sat in our dark hot hole over our undrinkable potations and our inedible eatables each of us resting his hungry head upon his aching elbows watching the progress of some animated piece of biscuit would master daunton the slave of our lamp which bytheby was a bottle bearing a miserably consumptive pursers dip beside which a farthing rushlight would look quite aldermanici say this slave of our lamp would perch himself down on the combings of the cabletier hatchway in the midst of the flood of heavens blessed daylight that came pouring from aloft into this abyss and very deliberately take out his private store of viands and there insultingly wag his jaws with the most complacent satisfaction in the faces of his masters the contrast was too badthe malice of it too tormenting whilst he was masticating his beautiful white american crackers and smacking his lips over his savoury german sausage we were grumbling over putrid bones and weavilly biscuit that we could not swallow and yet hunger would not permit us to desert it was a floating repetition of the horrors of tantalus well to myself this rascal was most submissivemost eager in forcing upon me his services he relieved my hammockman of his duty but somehow nothing prospered to which he put his hand the third night the nails of the cleat that fastened my headclews up to the deck above me drew and i came down by the run head foremost and immediately where my head ought to have alighted on the deck was found the carpenters pitch kettle with the blade of an axe in the centre of it and the edge uppermost no one knew how it came there and had i shot out as young gentlemen usually do on such occasions i should if i had not been quite decapitated at least have died by the axe not being asleep when the descent took place i grappled with my neighbour the old fat assistantsurgeon and he with the next and the three came down on deck with a lunge that actually started the marine officerwho everybody knows is the best sleeper on board happily for myself i fell from my hammock sideways next the accommodating joshua got the sole charge of my chest and though nothing was missed in a short time everything was ruined the cockroaches ate the most unaccountable holes in my best uniforms my shoes burst in putting them on my boots cracked all across the upper leathers and the feet of my stockings came off when i attempted to draw them on the obsequious joshua was equally assiduous with his other six masters and even more successful so that in addition to being starved there was every possibility of our being reduced to nakedness this was no pleasant prospect running out of tropical latitudes towards england in the month of january in the course of six weeks such a ragged woebegone gaunt and famished gang of reefers was never before huddled together in one of his majestys vessels of war the shifts we were obliged to have recourse to were quite amusing to all but the shiftmakers the only good hat and wearable uniform coat went round and round it was a happy thing for this disconsolate seven that we were all nearly of a size to aggravate our misfortunes we could no longer get an occasional dinner either in the captains cabin or the wardroom for our clothes were all in rags in the meanwhile joshua daunton grew more and more sleek and pale and fat he throve upon our miseries he played his part at length so well as to avoid thrashings he possessed in perfection that which in classic cockpit is called the gift of the gab he was never in the wrong indeed he began to get a favourite with each of the individuals over whom he was so mercilessly tyrannising while each thought himself the tyrant all this may seem improbable to wellnurtured shorebred young gentlemen and ladies but midshipmen were always reckless and idlethat is personally on actual service they have ever been equally reckless but commensurably active this kindness of joshua in taking all trouble off our hands soon left us almost nothing wherewith to trouble ourselves chapter fifty six an anticipated dinnerall the enjoyment spoiled by the first cuta suit of clothes illsuited for wearingand joshua daunton trying on a pair of iron leggingsmore easily put on than shaken off this imp this flibbertygibbet was killing us by inches at length one of the masters mates no longer being able to starve quietly and philosophically as became a man of courage was again determined by one last effort to dine and breakfast and sup in the captains cabin and wardroom as often as he could so finding that there was enough new blue cloth on board with buttons etcetera to make him a complete suit he purchased them at an enormous price on credit and set the ships tailors to work incontinently by this time we were with our homewardbound convoy on the banks of newfoundland it was misty and coldand we were chilly and ragged in such a conjuncture of circumstances even the wellclothed may understand what a blessing a new suit of warm blue must bethat suit bearing in its suite a long line of substantial breakfasts dinners and suppers all this was about to be mr pigtops our kind messmate and respectable mate of the orlop deck he had already begun to protest upon the unreasonableness of rotatory coats or of having a quarterdeck pair of trousers like the wives of the ancient britons common to the sept the ungrateful rogue he had on at the very time the only quarterdeckgoing coat among us which was mine and which he had just borrowed to enable him to go on deck and report everything right below captain reuds compliments to mr pigtop and would be glad of his company to dinner angelic words when the invited reefer has a clean shirt or collar and a decent uniform mr pigtops compliments to captain reud and will be most happy to wait on him there you dogs said the elated pigtop i say no more lending of clothes here you josh jump forward and tell the tailor i must have my uniform by four bells josh jumped forward with a very intelligent grin upon his tallowcomplexioned but handsome countenance now the captain and wardroom officers all knew very well of the unaccountable destruction of our clothes which they affected to believe was not unaccountable to them they said it arose from very natural causes a little of which was to be ascribed to dampness a little to the cockroaches and a great a very great deal to our proverbial carelessness well a midshipman careless but some people may libel with impunity whatever they thought they enjoyed our dilemmas both of food and of clothing an hour before the captains dinner was ready the much envied suit was brought aft and duly displayed on mr pigtops chest the wardroom officers or at least those of them with whom he could take that liberty were invited out to view it it was pronounced for shiptailoring excellent pigtops elation was great so was josh dauntons but all in a quiet submissive way our envy was proportionate josh was an excellent barber and he volunteered to shave the happy dineroutthe offer was accepted then came the turn of fatethen commenced the long series of the poor mates miseries it was no fault of dauntons certainlybut all the razors were like saws the blood came out over the black visage of mr pigtop but the hair stayed most pertinaciously on the sufferer sworehow horribly he swore the time was fast elapsing after a most tremendous oath from the sufferer which would have almost split an oak plank joshua said in his lowly and insinuating voice mr pigtop pray dodo do sir try the razors yourself my heart bleeds sir more than your facedo try sir for i think the captains servant is now coming down the hatchway to tell you dinner is ready in despair the hungry depilator seized the razors and being exasperated with hurry he made a worse job of it than joshua where josh had made notches pigtop made gashes the ships barber was then sent for and he positively refused to go over the bloody surface but joshua daunton was the true friend the friend in need with mr pigtops permission he would go and borrow one of dr thompsons razors the offer was gratefully accepted in the meantime dinner was actually announced it is just about as wise to attempt to keep the hungry tiger from his newlyslaughtered prey as for a mid to make the captain of a manofwar wait dinner reud did not wait however the fresh razor did its work admirably in the adroit hand of joshua the hitherto intractable beard flew off rapidly and joshuas tongue moved more glibly even than his razor barbers in the act of office have like the house of commons the privilege of speech they are not amenable afterwards for what they say in the act they are omnipotent for who would quarrel with a man who is slipping a razor over your carotid artery not certainly mr pigtop thus spoke joshua amid the eloquent flourishes of his instrument mr pigtop ive a great respect for youa very great respect indeed sir if you have not been a good friend to me yet you willi know it sir you are not like the other flighty young gentlemen i have a respect for years sira great respect for years and honour a middleaged gentleman indeed sir it must be a great condescension in you to permit yourself to be only a mastersmate of a frigate seeing that you are quite an elderly gentleman da therethat was very imprudent indeed sir of you to open your mouth it was not my fault you know that the brush went into it indeed some people like the taste of soapsudswholesome i assure youvery a stubble of your growth sir always requires a double latheringdont speak oh sir you are a happy manexceeding your face will be as smooth as a mans borrowing money you boy just run up the afterhatchway and tell the captains steward that mr pigtop will be in the cabin in the flourish of a razor or before a white horse can turn grey permit me to take you by the nose the true handle of the face sir it gives the man as it were a sort of a command sir of the whole head he can box the compass with it happy indeed you are sir and much to be envied there was one of the captains turtles killed yesterdayjumbo is a cook a most excellent cooka spoonful of the soup today will be worth a kings ransoma peck of march dust poohi wouldnt give a spoonful of that soup for a hundred bushels of it take my advice sir and have soup twice sir as it was carried along the maindeck im dishonest if the young gentlemen didnt follow it with the water running down in streams from the corners of their mouths and their tongues entreatingly lolling out like a parcel of hungry dogs in cripplegate following the catsmeatmans barrow one more rasp over your upper lip and you are as smooth as the newborn babetalking of lips as the first spoonful of that turtlesoup glides over themthe devil ill take god to witness it was an accidentthe roll of the ship joshua daunton was on his knees before mr pigtop who was in an agony of pain holding on his upper lip which was nearly severed from his face whilst the blood was streaming through his fingers doctor thompson with diachylon and black stickingplaster was soon on the spot to the assistance of the almost dislipped mastersmate after the best was done for it the poor fellow cut but a sorry appearance still his extreme hunger made almost furious by the vision of the turtlesoup so artfully conjured up by the malicious joshua got the better of his sense of pain and with a great band of black plaster reaching transversely from the right nostril to the left corner of his mouth the grimlooking mr pigtop made haste to don the new uniform in the meantime the protestations and tears of joshua had convinced everybody that the horrible gash was merely the effect of accident for the ship was rolling a great deal at the moment what the captain and his guests were doing in the cabin above with the turtlesoup it is needless for me to state for that same soup was never fated to gladden the wounded lip of mr pigtop the hasty and famishing gentleman in his very first attempt to draw on his new trousers to the astonishment of all his messmates who had now gathered round him found them separated in the middle of each of his legs he might as well have attempted to clothe himself with cobweb continuations they came to pieces almost with a shake the waistcoat and coat were in the same predicament they had not the principle of continuity in them everybody was lost in amazement except mr pigtop whose amazement quite as great as ours was lost in his still greater rage it was extremely unfortunate for joshua daunton that he had cut the lip that day the kind doctor was still by during the apparelling or the attempt at it he examined the rotten clothes and he soon discovered that they had been saturated in different parts by some corrosive liquid that instead of impairing really improved the brilliancy of the cloth during these proceedings captain reud and his guests had eaten up the dinner but the captain not being pleased to be pleasantly humoured that day sent word to mr pigtop to go to the masthead till midnight for disrespect in not attending to the invitation that he had accepted there was no appeal and aloft went the wounded ragged famished hoper of devouring turtlesoup joshua looked very demure and very unhappy but dr thompson set on foot an inquiry and the truth of the destruction of the clothes was soon ascertained the loblollyboy that is the young man who had charge of the laboratory where all the medicines were kept confessed after a little hesitation that for certain glasses of grog he had given this pernicious liquid to daunton so while one of his masters was contemplating the stars from the masthead the destroyer of reefers kits had nothing else to do but to contemplate the beauty of his own feet placed with a judicious exactitude in a very handsome pair of bilboes under the half deck chapter fifty seven the catofninetails begets a tale the most annoying to ralphthe story of the three crows beaten hollowsevens the main and a losing casta promised treatise on ornithology put an end to rather abruptly by the biplumal resolving themselves into the mere bipedal when fully secured the poor wretch sent for me he was in a paroxysm of fear he protested his innocence over and over again he declared that he should die under the first lash that it was for love of me only that he had come on board of a manofwar he conjured me by the fellowship of our boyish days by all that i loved and that was sacred to us to save him from the gangway the easiness of my nature was worked upon and i promised to use my influence to procure for him a pardon i went to mr farmer but all my efforts were unavailing the culprit passed a sleepless night in the intolerable agony of lear before he was brought up to be flogged mr pigtop had been fully avenged the gratings are rigged the hands are turned up and joshua daunton is supported by two ships corporals in a nearly fainting state and stripped by anotherhe is too much paralysed to do it himself the officers are mustered on the break of the quarterdeck and the marines are drawn up under arms on the gangway captain reud looks fierce and forbidding and mr farmer for his generally impassible features really quite savage i come forward shudderingly and look down the wandering and restless eyes of the frightened young man meet in an instant what most probably they are seekingmy own ralph rattlin speak for me to the captain the words were in themselves simple but they were uttered in a tone of the most touching pathos they made me start i thought that i knew the voice not as the voice of joshua daunton the mischievous imp that had tormented us all so scientifically but of some dear and longforgotten friend ralph rattlin speak for me to the captainthis must not be but it shall be by g said the irascible creole captain reud said i let me entreat you for this once only boatswains mate oh captain reud if you knew what a strange sympathy the thiefs cat indeed sir since he has been on board he has never stolen mr rattlin another word and the masthead stand back stebbins let douglas give him the first dozen now this douglas was a huge rawboned boatswains mate that flogged left handed and had also a peculiar jerk in his manner of laying on the catoninetails and that always brought away with it little knobs of flesh wherever the knots fell and so neatly that blood would at every blow spout from the wounds as from the puncture of a lancet besides the torture was also doubled by first scoring over the back in one direction and the righthanded floggers coming after in another they cut out the skin in lozenges i looked in the captains face and there was no mercy i looked below and there appeared almost as little life after the lefthanded scotchman had bared his brawny arm and measured his distance and just as he was about to uplift it and strike daunton murmured out ralph rattlin i knew your father beware or your own blood will be dishonoured in me that voicethey shall flog you through me i exclaimed and was about to leap into the waist and cover him with my arms when i was forcibly withheld by the officers around me whilst the captain roared out he shall have another dozen for his impudent falsehood boatswains mate do your duty the terrific lash like angry scorpions fell upon the white and quivering flesh and the blood spurted out freely it was a vengeful stroke and loud and long and shrill was the scream that followed it but ere the second stroke fell the head of the tortured one suddenly collapsed upon the right shoulder and a livid hue spread rapidly over the face and breast he is dead said those around in a halfhushed tone the surgeon felt his pulse and placed his hand upon his breast to seek for the beating of the heart and shaking his head requested him to be cast loose he was immediately taken to the sickbay but with all the skill of the doctor his resuscitation was at first despaired of and only brought about at length with great difficulty the fact was not that he had been flogged but very nearly frightened to death and i was utterly miserable the words that daunton had spoken at the gangway and the strange interest that i had taken in his behalf gave rise to suspicions that i felt to be degrading he had declared himself to be of my blood the officers and crew construed the expression as meaning my brother i was now for the first time looked coldly upon i felt myself avoided such conduct is chillingtoo often fatal to the young and proud heart it will rise indignant at an insult but guarded and polite contumely and long and civil neglect wither it i was fast sinking into an habitual despondency this confounded joshua had previously completely ruined my outward man the inward man was in great danger from his conduct perhaps his machinations i was shunned with a studied contempt the more particularly as my messmates were the subjects of the constant jibes of the captain and the other officers which messmates were of a unanimous opinion that master joshua ought to have been hung inasmuch as it is now apparent that their ruined apparel was all derivable from his malice and his practice of chemistry made easy they all panted with impatience for his convalescence in order that they might see mr rattlins elder brother receive the remainder of his six dozen i verily believe that as i approached my native shores i should have fallen into a settled depression of spirits which would have terminated in melancholy madness had i not been roused to exert my moral energies and awaken my halfentombed pride by a stinging and a very wholesome insult so soon as we were ordered home captain reuds mental aberrations became less frequent but when they supervened they were more extravagant in their nature he grew roguish fretful and cruel though he never spoke to me harshly he addressed me more rarely i had not dined with him for a long while he had taken the mysterious destruction of my wardrobe as a valid excuse and had gone so far on one occasion in a very delicate manner as to present me with a complete change of linen which perished like the rest under the provident care of joshua but after the claim of relationship by that very timid personage there was no consideration in reuds look and whenever he did speak to me there was a contemptuous harshness in his tone that would have very much wounded my feelings at any other time but just then i took but little notice of and interest in anything when i say that we were reduced to rags in our habiliments the reader is not to take the words au pied de lettre by taking up slops from the purser and by aid of the ships tailor we had been enabled to walk the quarterdeck without actual holes in our dress but the dresses themselves were grotesque for the imitation of our spruce uniform was villainous and our hats were deplorable they were greased with oil and broken and sewed and formless or rather multiform bad as were our fittingsout we had not enough of them through the rude and the cold flying mists of winter after we had struck soundings we again saw england it was in the inclement month of january i was starved and half clad a beggar of any decent pretension had he met me in the streets of london would have taken the wall of me though i had at the time more than three hundred dollars in cash spanish doubloons and silver a power for drawing bills for a hundred a year more than three years pay due and prizemoney to a very considerable amount under these circumstances my eyes once more greeted my native land i got into disgrace i record it frankly as my boast is throughout this biography to have spoken the truth of all the different variations of my life since the captains incipient insanity the eos had gradually become an illregulated ship the gallant firstlieutenant formerly so smart and so active had not escaped the general demoralisation he was a disappointed man he had not distinguished himself god knows it was neither for want of daring nor expense of life he had cut out everything that could be carried and had attempted almost everything that could not i am compelled to say that these bloody onslaughts were as often failures as successes he was no nearer his next step on the ladder of promotion than before his temper became soured and he was now often lax sometimes unjust and always irritable the other officers shared in the general falling off and too often made the quarterdeck a display for temper the thirdlieutenantyes i think it was the thirdhad mastheaded me about the middle of the first dogwatch most likely deservedly for i had lately affected to give the proud and sullen answer before i went aloft to my miserable station i represented to him that i had the first watch that there was now but three of the young gentlemen doing their duty the others having very wisely fallen ill and taken the protection of the sicklist i told him respectfully enough that if he kept me up in that disagreeable station from halfpast five till eight i could not possibly do my duty for very weariness from eight till midnight it was a physical impossibility but he was inexorable up i went the demon of all evil passions gnawing at my heart it was almost dark when i went aloft it was a gusty dreary night bitterly very bitterly cold i was illclad at intervals the fierce and frozen drifts like the stings of so many wasps drove fiercely into my face and i believe that i must confess that i cried over my crooked and aching fingers as the circulation went on with agony or stopped with numbness it is true i was called down within the hour but that hour of suffering had done me much constitutional mischief i was stupified as much as if i had committed a debauch upon fat ale however i was too angry to complain or to seek relief from the surgeon i went on deck at halfpast eight with obtuse faculties and a reckless heart the frigate was with a deeplyladen convoy attempting to hold her course in the chops of the channel it blew very hard the waves were bounding about us with that short and angry leap peculiar in tempestuous weather to the narrow seas between england and france it was excessively dark and not carrying sufficient sail to tack we were wearing the ship every halfhour showing of course the proper signal lights to the convoy we carried also the customary pooplight of the commodore such was the state of affairs at a little after nine the captain the firstlieutenant the master the officer of the watch and the channel pilot that we had taken on board off the scilly islands with myself were all on deck both the signal midshipmen were enjoying the comforts of sickness in their warm hammocks below now i will endeavour to give a faithful account of what happened and let the unprejudiced determine in the horrible calamity that ensued how much blame was fairly attributable to me i must premise that owing to shortness of number even when all were well there was no forecastle midshipman a dreadful gust of icy wind accompanied by the arrowy sleet rushes aft rather heading us the wind is getting more round to the east wed better wear at once said the pilot to the master the pilot advises us to wear said the master to the captain mr farmer said the captain to the firstlieutenant watch and idlers wear ship mr pond said mr farmer to the lieutenant of the watch a diminutive and peppery little man with a squeaking voice and remarkable for nothing else excepting having a large wife and a large family whom he was impatient to see wear mr rattlin squeaked mr pond through his trumpet order the boatswains mate to turn the watch and idlers upwear ship boatswains mate bawled out the sleepy and sulky mr rattlin watch and idlers wear ship ay ay sirwhew whew whittle whewwatch and idlers wear ship tumble up there tumble up masteratarms brush up the bonepolishers what an infarnal nonsensical ceremony growled the pilot sotto voce all bawl and no hawllucky we have plenty of searoom jump aft mr rattlin said the captain and see that the convoysignal to wear is all right mr rattlin makes one step aft are the foretopmast staysail halliards well manned mr rattlinjump forward and see said the officer of the watch mr rattlin makes one step forward is the deep sealead ready said the master mr rattlin jump into the chains and see mr rattlin makes one step to the rightstarboard the wise it call mr rattlin what the devil are you aboutwheres the hand stationed to the foresheet said the firstlieutenant jump there and see mr rattlin makes one step to the left handport the wise it call wheres the midshipman o th watchwheres the midshipman o th watch roars out the captain by heavens theres no light to show over the bows mr rattlin be smart sirjump forward and see to it the chilled the torpid and halfstupified mr rattlin finally went forward to the forecastle where he ought to have been from the first and more especially as the boatswain was also on the sicklist the consequence of all these multitudinous and almost simultaneous ordersto jump and see when bytheby it was too dark to see anything a yard off properlywas that one of the signal lanterns was blown out and the signal consequently imperfectthat the foretopmast staysail halliards were so badly manned that those upon them could scarcely start that then necessary sail from its nettingthat the people were not ready with the deep sealeadthat little mr pond was obliged to put down his trumpet and ease off the foresheet himself till relieved by the quartermaster but still there actually was a lantern over the bows and that in good time well the noble ship was no longer buffeted on her bows by the furious wind as the haughty essex turned on his heel from the blow of his termagant mistress queen so did the eos turn her back to the insulting blast and flew rapidly before it owing to the darkness of the night assisted by the weak voice of mr pond whose orders could not be very distinctly heard perhaps a little to his lubberly manner of working the ship the bounding frigate was much longer before the wind than necessary i was straining my sight near the cathead on one side and the captain of the forecastle on the other but we could discover nothing in the nearly palpable obscure on she dashed and our anxious eyes saw nothing whilst our minds feared greatlyshe is at her utmost speed in her reckless course she seems sufficiently powerful to break up the steadfast rock or tear the shoal from its roots at the bottom of the ocean on she rushes i think i hear faintly the merchant cry of yeoyoyeo but the roar of the vexed waters beneath our bows and the eternal singing of the winds through the froststiffened shrouds prevent my being certain of the fact but i tremble excessivelywhen behold a huge long black mass is lying lazily before us and so close that we can almost touch it hard aport i roared out at the top of my voice hard astarboard sang out the captain of the forecastle equally loudly vain vain were the contradictory orders the frigate seemed to leap at the object before her as at a prey and dire was the crash that ensued as we may suppose the wrathful lioness springs upon the buffalo and meeting more resistance from its horny bulk than she had suspected recoils and makes another spring so did the eos strike rebound then strike again i felt two distinct percussions the second stroke divided the obstacle the eos passed through it or over it and the eye looked in vain for the vast west indiaman the bearer of wealth and gay hopes and youth and infancy manly strength and female beauty there was a smothered feminine shriek hushed by the whirlpool of downabsorbing waves almost as soon as made it was not loud but it was fearfully distinct and painfully human one poor wretch only was saved to tell her name and speak of the perished as usual they had kept but a bad lookout her officers and her passengers were making merry in the cabinthe winecup was at their lips and the song was floating joyously from the mouths of the fair ones returning to the land of their nativity the blooming daughters the newlymarried wife and two matrons with their innocent ones beside them were all in the happiness of their hopes when the destroyer was upon them suddenly truly like a strong man in the darkness of night and they were all hurled in the midst of their uncensurable revelry to a deep grave over which no tombstone shall ever tell of their whereabout our own jibboom was snapped off short and as quickly as is a twig in frosty weather supposing the ship had struck every soul rushed on deck they thanked god it was only the drowning of some forty fellowcreatures and the destruction of a fine merchantship we hauled the single poor fellow that was saved on board the consternation among the officers was very great it blew too hard to lower the boats no effort was or could be made to rescue any chance struggler not carried down in the vortex of the parted and sunken ship all was blank horror besides the consternation and dismay natural to the appalling accident there was the fear of the underwriters and of the owners and of damages before the eyes of the captain i was sent for aft i had not the charge of the deck said captain reud looking fiercely at the firstlieutenant i am not responsible for this lubberly calamity i had not the charge of the watch or the deck either said mr farmer in his turn looking at small mr pond who was looking aghast surely i cannot be held responsible but you gave orders siri heard you myself give the word to raise the foretackthat looks very like taking charge of the deckno no i am not responsible not so fast not so fast mr pond i only assisted you for the good of the service and to save the foresail mr pond looked very blank indeed until he thought of the master and then he recovered a great portion of his usual vivacity small men are always vivacious no no i am not responsiblei was only working the ship under the directions of the master read the night orders mr farmer the night orders be damned said the gruff old master i will not have my night order damned said reud you and the officer of the watch must share the responsibility between you no offence at all sir to you or the night orders either i am heartily sorry i damned themheartily but in the matter of wearing this here ship precisely at that there time i only acted under the pilot who has charge until we are securely anchored surelye i cant be sponsible well said the pilot heres a knot of tangled ropeyarnbut that yarn wont do for old weatherbrace for dye see im a sea william civilian and not in no ways under martial lawand im only aboard this here craft as respects shoals and that likeim clearly not sponsiblenothing to do in the varsal world with working hersponsible poohwhy did ye not keep a better lookout forard why mr rattlin why said the captain the firstlieutenant the lieutenant of the watch and the master i kept as good a one as i couldthe lanterns were over the bows you may depend upon it said the captain that the matter will not be permitted to rest as it is the owners and underwriters will demand a court of inquiry mr rattlin had charge of the forecastle at the time mr rattlin come here sir you sang out just before this calamity happened to port the helm i did sir quartermaster continued reud did you port the helm now mind what you say did you sir because if you did not six dozen we did sirhard aport and the ship immediately after struck yes sir pooh the case is clearwe need not talk about it any longer a clear case mr farmer mr rattlin has charge of the forecastlehe descries a vessel aheadhe takes upon himself to order the helm hard aport and we run over and sink her accordingly he is responsible clearly clearly was the answering echo from all the rejectors of responsibility mr rattlin i am sorry for you i once thought you a promising young man but since your desertion at anianawe must not mince matters nowyou have become quite an altered character you seem to have lost all zeal for the service zeal for the service is a thing that ought not to be lost for a young gentleman without zeal for the service is a young gentleman surelyyou understand mewho is not zealous in the performance of his duty i think i have made myself tolerably clear do you think sir i should hold now the responsible commission i do hold under his majesty if i had been without zeal for the service i am sorry that i have a painful duty to perform i must place you under an arrest till i know what may be the port admirals pleasure concerning this unpleasant business forfor the loss of the mary anne of london you are clearly responsible clearly omnes rursus had you sung out hard astarboard instead of hard aport the case might have been different clearly go down below to your berth and consider yourself a prisoner the young gentlemen in his majestys service are not permitted to run down west indiamen with impunity clearly in these kind of capstanhead courtmartials at which captains will sometimes administer reefers law woe to the weakest a defence was quite a work of superfluity so consoling myself with the vast responsibility with which all at once i found myself invested i went and turned in anathematising every created thing above an inch high and a foot below the same dimensions however in a very sound sleep i soon forgot everythingeven the horrible scene i had just witnessed chapter fifty eight distressing disclosures and some very pretty symptoms of brotherly lovewith much excellent indignation utterly thrown awayjoshua daunton either a very great man or a very great rogueperhaps both as the terms are often synonymous i hope the reader has not forgotten joshua daunton for i did not having a very especial regard to the health of his body he took care to keep himself ill the seventyone lashes due to him he would most generously have remitted altogether his eagerness to cancel the debt was only equal to captain reuds eagerness to pay and to that of his six midshipmen masters to see it paid old pigtop was positively devout in this wish for after the gash had healed it left a very singular scar that traversed his lip obliquely and gave a most ludicrous expression to a face that was before remarkably illfavoured one side of his visage seemed to have a continual ghastly smirk like what you might suppose to decorate the countenance of a halfdrunken succubus the other a continual whimper that reminded you of a latelywhipped baboon i concluded that daunton was really ill for he kept to his hammock in the sickbay and dr thompson was much too clever and too old a manofwars man to be deceived by a simulated sickness the day after when i was enjoying my arrest in the dignified idleness of a snooze in a peajacket on one of the lockers the loblollyboy came to me saying that daunton was much worse and that he humbly and earnestly requested to see me i went though with much reluctance he appeared to be dreadfully ill yet an ambiguous smile lighted up his countenance when he saw me moodily standing near him he was seated on one corner of the bench in the bay apparently under the influence of ague for he trembled excessively and he was well wrapped up in blankets altogether notwithstanding the regularity of his features he was a revolting spectacle the following curious dialogue ensued daunton i am ready to hear you thank you ralph fellow you may have heard that i am a prisonerin disgracebut not in dishonour but know scoundrel that if i were to swing the next minute at the yardarm i would not tolerate or answer to such familiarity speak respectfully or i leave you mr rattlin pray do not speak so loudly or the other invalids will hear us hear us sirrah they may and welcome scoundrel can we have any secrets the fiery hate that flashed from the eye of venomous impotence played upon me at the very moment that the tone of his voice became more bland and his deportment more submissive mr rattlin your honour will you condescend to hear me it is for your own good sir pray be no longer angry i think i am dying will you forgive mewill you shake hands with me and he extended to me his thin and delicate hand oh no no i exclaimed accompanying my sneer with all the scorn that i could put in my countenance such things as you dont die reptiles are tenacious of life for the malicious and apelike mischiefs that you have done to me and to my messmatesthough in positive guilt i hold them to be worse than actual felonyi forgive youbut interchange the token of friendship with such as younever ralph rattlin i know you insolent rascal know yourself dare to send for me no more i leave you i turned upon my heel and was about leaving this floating hospital when again that familiar tone of the voice that had struck the inmost chord of my heart in his shrieking appeal at the gangway arrested me and the astounding words which he uttered quickly brought me to his side in that strange tone that seemed to have been born with my existence he exclaimed distinctly yet not loudly brother ralph listen to me liar cheat swindler i hissed forth in an impassioned whisper close to his inclined ear my heart disowns youmy soul abhors youmy gorge rises at you i abominatei loathe youmost contemptible yet most ineffable liar oh brother and a hectic flush came over his chalky countenance whilst a sardonic smile played over his features you can speak low enough now tis a pity that primogeniture is so little regarded in his majestys vessels of war but methinks that you are but little dutiful seeing that i am some ten years your senior and that i do not scorn to own you though you are the son of my fathers paramour the horrible words shot ice into my heart i could no longer retain my stooping position over him but feeling faint and very sick i sat down involuntarily beside him but the agony of apprehension was but for a moment a mirth stern and wild brought its relief to my paralysed bosom and laughing loudly i jumped up and exclaimed josh you little vagabond come carry me apickabackson of a respectable pawnbroker of whitechapelhow many paramours was the worthy old gentleman in the habit of keeping respectable scion of such respectable parent who finished his studies by a little tramping a little thieving a little swindling a little forgingi heartily thank you for the amusement you have afforded me oh my good brother deceive not yourself i repeat that i have tramped thieved swindled ay and forged and to whom do i owe all this ignominy to youto youto you yet i do not hate you very very much you showed some fraternal feeling when they seared my back with the indelible scar of disgrace i have lied to you but it suited my purpose and i have given you the confidence due to a liar what still incredulous brother of mine do you know theseand these the handwriting was singular and very elegant i knew the letters at once they were the somewhat affected amatory effusions of that superb woman mrs causand whom i have described in the early part of this life they spoke of ralphof ralph rattlinand described with tolerable accuracy my singular birth at the crown inn at reading there were three letters the two first that i read contained merely passionate protestations of affection the third that had reference to myself spoke darkly after much that is usual in the ardent style of unhallowed love it went on as nearly as i can recollect in these wordsi have suffered greatlysuffered with you and for you the child is however now safe and well provided for it is placed with a decent woman of the name of brandon rose brandon a discovery now is impossible we have managed the thing admirably the child is fair etcetera etcetera in the midst of my agitation i remarked that the writer did not speak of the infant as my child nor with the affection of a motherand yet without a great stretch of credulity the inference seemed plain that she was the parent of it though not a fond one mysterious man who are you and who am i your disgraced your discarded yet your legitimate brother more it suits me not now that you should know i am weak in frame but i am steel in purpose you you have been the bane of my life since your clandestine birth our father loved me no more i will have my broad acres backi willthey are mineand you only stand between me and them desperate and degraded mani believe even after this pretended confession that you are an impostor to me as much as you are to the rest of the world i now understand some things that were before dark to me my life seems to stand in your wayand your cowardice only prevents you from taking it you tell me you are a forgerthese letters are forgeries mrs causand is not my mother nor are you my brother pray where did you get them i stole them from our fathers escritoir amiable son but i weary myself no more with your tissue of falsehoods tomorrow we shall cast anchor i will leave the service and devote the rest of my life to the discovery of origin i will learn your real name i will trace out your crimesand the hands of justice shall at once terminate my doubts and your life of infamywe are enemies to the death a fair challenge and fairly spoken i accept it from all my soul you refused my hand in brotherly love for by the grey hairs of our common parent in brotherly love it was offered to youwill you now take it as a pledge of a burning a neverdying enmity between us it is at present emaciated and witheredit has been seized up at your detested gangwayit has been held up at the bar of justice but it will gain strength my brotherthere take it sirand despise it not i shuddered as i received the pledge of hate and his grasp though i was in the plenitude of youthful vigour was stronger than my own this dreadful conference had been carried on principally in whispers but owing to several bursts of emotion on my part enough had transpired among those present to give them to understand that i had been claimed as a brother and that i had very hardheartedly rejected the claim after we had passed our mutual defiance there was silence between us for several minutes he coiling himself up like an adder in his corner and i pacing the deck my bosom swelling with contending emotions if he should really be my brother thought i the idea was horrible to me i again paused in my walk and looked upon him steadfastly but i found no sympathy with him his style of thin and pallid beauty was hateful to methere was no expression in his countenance upon which i could bang the remotest feeling of love he bore my scrutiny in his weakness proudly daunton said i at length you have failed in endeavouring to make a tool you have created an enemy and an avenger of the outraged laws i shall be in london in the course of eightandforty hoursyou cannot escape meif it cost me a hundred pounds i will loose the bloodhounds of justice after youyou shall be made in chains to give up your hateful secret i am no longer a boy nor you nor the lawyer that administers my affairs shall longer make a plaything of me i will know who i am thank god i can always ask mrs cherfeuil at that name a smile no longer bitter but deeply melancholy and almost sweet came over his effeminate features but it lasted not long that smile like a few tones of his voice seemed so familiar to me was i one of two existences the consciousness of the one nearly but not quite blotting out the other i looked upon him again and the smile was gone but a look of grief solemn and heartrending had supplied its placeand then the big and involuntary tear stood in his eye i know not whether it fell for he held down his arm to the concealment of his face and spoke not had the wretch a heart after all as i turned to depart he lifted up his face and all that was amiable in its expression had fled with a calm sneer he said may i trouble you mr rattlin for those letters which i handed over to you for your perusal i shall keep them is your code of equity as low as mine they are my property i paid dearly enough for them and what says your code of honour to such conduct there take your detested forgeries we shall meet in london mr rattlin forgets that he is a prisoner absurd the charge cannot be sustained for a moment be it so peradventure i shall be in london before you chapter fifty nine listeners seldom hear good things of themselvesralph at a dreadful discount with his messmates but contrives to settle his accounts with his principal debtor i left him with a strong foreboding that he would work me some direful mischief for the long day i sat with my head buried in my hands on the sordid table of our berth i ate not i spoke not the ribaldry of my coarse associates moved me not their boisterous and vulgar mirth aroused me not they thought me owing to my arrest and my anticipations of its consequences torpid with fear they were deceived i was never more alive my existence wasif i may so speakglowing and fiery hot my sense of being was intense with various misery towards evening another piece of intelligence reached me that alarmed and astounded me since the laying on of the one lash on the back of joshua daunton our old servant had descended from the mizzentop again to wait upon us he was in his way an insatiate newsgatherer but he was as liberal in dispensing it as he was eager in acquiring it the midshipmen were drinking out of the still unbroken cups and two or three tin pannikins their grog at eight oclock in the evening when our unshod and dirty attendant spoke thus oh mr pigtopsuch newssuch strange news youll be so very sorry to hear it sir and so will all the young gentlemen what has the ship tumbled overboard or the pigballast mutinied for arrears of pay oh sir ten thousand times worse than that that thief of the world sir joshua daunton is not to have his six dozen after all though he did corrupt all the midshipmens clothes sir dr thompson has taken him into his own cabin and nothing is now too good for him but hanging said the indignant and scarred masters mate if hes not flogged ill have the life out of him yet though he should turn out to be the only son of lord dunknowwho pigtop was a wit in a small midshipmanlike way hes turned out to be some great man they say howeverin clog or so i think they call it though for my part i remembers him in irons well enough not more than a fortnight aback and hes had a taste of the girl with nine tails howeverthats one comfort to me whatever he may turn out the vulgar have strange sources from which to derive comfort but are you sure of all this bill said mr staines because if he should turn out to be somebody ill make him pay me for my traps thats as certain now as that hell be sent to old davy certain sure he showed the doctor papers enough to set up a lawyers shop but thats not the best of ithumha do you think mr pigtop that mr rattlins caulking ie asleep he has not moved these three hours i owe rattlin one for bringing this blackguard on board there may be something in this after all he claimed rattlin as his brother at the gangway or something of the sort now that makes me comfortable it will take our proud messmate down a peg or two im calculatingwith his smooth face and his little bits of latin and greek and his parleyvooing oh oh but its as good as a bottle of rum to me with all his dollars and his bills and his airs i never had a brother seized up at the gangway and the captain and the officers once made such a fuss about him damn his smooth faceive a great mind to wake him and hit him a wipe across the chaps he knocked me down with the davitblock for twitting him about that girl of his that was drowned swimming after him ill have satisfaction for that the captain ordered me to leave the ship for being knocked down wellwe shall see wholl be ordered to leave the ship now i never caused a girls death by desarting her upon my soul ive a great mind to rouse him and hit him a slap of the chaps i hate smooth faces well said staines you may depend upon it rattlin is asleep or he would have wopped you pigtop for your compliments he i should very much like to see itthe spooney if mr rattlin is caulking said our valetdechambre there cant be no harm done whatsomever but they do say in the sickbay as how mr rattlin isnt himself but that joshua daunton is he and that he is nobody at all whatsomever though gibbons says and hes a cute one that if mr rattlin is not mr rattlin seeing as how joshua daunton is mr rattlin mr rattlin must be somebody elseand as a secret he told me as like as not he must be joshua daunton well heres comfort again if mr rattlinmr indeedturns out to be a swindler as im sure he will it wouldnt be lawful nor right nor proper in me to pay him the money i owe him said the conscientious mr pigtop damn his smooth facei should like to have the spoiling of it here was important information for me to ruminate upon i was determined to remain still as long as i could gain any intelligence but the conversationif conversation we must term the gibberish of my associateshaving taken another turn i slowly lifted up my smooth face and confronting mr pigtops rough one i said to him very coolly mr pigtop i am going to do what you would very much like to seei am going to wop you wop meno no its not come to that yet i have heard something ive a character to supporti must not demean myself there is my smooth face right before youi dare you to strike ityou dare not then thus base rascal i beat you to the earth and pigtop toppled down now all this was very wrong on my part and very imprudent for i must confess that he had before beaten me in a regular fistic encounter but it was really a great relief to me i longed for some vent to my angry and exasperated feelings we were soon out in the steerage oh the wolfishness of human nature that low and brutal fight was a great luxury to me positively at the time i did not feel his blows at every murderous lunge that i made at him i shouted take that daunton or was that well planted brother had we fought either with sword or pistol the enjoyment would have been infinitely less to me there was a stern rapture in pounding him beneath mein dashing my hands in his bloodin disfiguring his face piecemeal in our evil passions we are sad brutes pigtop had the pluck natural to englishmenhe would rather not have fought just then but having once begun he seemed resolved to see it out manfully the consequence wasto use a common and expressive phrasei beat him to within an inch of his life and then cried with vexation because he could no longer stand up to be beaten out of the little that my fury had left him when the fray was over my sturdy opponent had no reason to be envious of my smooth face rather inflamed than satiated with the result of my encounter whilst my opponent turned into his hammock and there lay moaning i with both my eyes dreadfully blackened and my countenance puffed up threw myself upon the lockers and there sleeplessly passed the whole night devouring my own heart if for a moment i happened to doze i was tearing in my imagination joshua daunton piecemeal hurling him down precipices or crushing him beneath the jagged fragments of stupendous rocks it was a night of agony chapter sixty soft tack one of the best tacks after allthat legs of mutton sometimes produce friendships of long standing completely proved as well as the value of good grain best ascertained after it has been well thrashed the next day we anchored in the downs weak stiff and ill i surveyed myself in my dressingglass my battered features presented a hideous spectacle but i cared not i was a prisoneri should have no occasion to emerge from the gloom of the steerage this was truly a happy return to my native shores but i was not altogether left without commiserationnot altogether without sympathy both dr thompson and the purser looked in to see me the doctor especially seemed to feel deeply for my situation he told me that he had heard a strange story but that as yet he was not at liberty to mention any particulars he assured me that he had entirely acquitted me of any participation in a series of base deceptions that had been practised upon an ancient a distinguished and wealthy family he bade me hope for the best and always consider him as my friend the purser spoke to the same effect i told them that my conviction was that it was they and not i who were the victims of deception i stated that i had never pretended to rank or parentage of any sort i acknowledged that everything connected with my family was a perfect mystery but i asked them how they could place any faith in the assertions of a man who was in a mean capacity when i met with himwho had confessed to me a multiplicity of villainiesand who had corroborated the truth of his own confessions by his uniformly wicked conduct whilst on board to all this they both smiled very sapiently and told me they had their reasons well said i you are wise and compared to me old men you cannot think this daunton a moral characteryou cannot think him honest still telling me you are my friends you champion him against me and yet i know not how or in what manner if he should prove my brother the world is wide enough for us both let him keep out of my way if he can depend upon it doctor he is acting upon an afterthought he has been forced into a desperate course you marked his abject cowardice at the gangway during the many hours that he was in irons before that punishment he so much dreaded was inflicted why did he not then send for you and to save himself make to you these important disclosures merely because he did not think of it by heavensa light rushes on mehe is a housebreakerhe has committed some burglary and stolen papers relating to me and no doubt he has followed me first with the intention of selling to me the purloined secret at some unconscionable price and he has since thought fit to change his plan for something more considerable more wicked my poor boy said the doctor kindly you are under a delusion let me change the subject and puncture you with my lancet under the eyes they are dreadfully contused well rattlin we are to go to sheerness directly and be paid off you may depend upon it the captain will think better about this arrest of yours particularly as the two men at the wheel positively contradict the quartermaster and affirm that the helm was put hard astarboard and not hard aport it appears to us that it was of little consequence when the ship was first discovered how the helm was put the fault was evidently on the part of those who so awfully suffered for it bytheby there has been a change among the lords of the admiraltythere are two new junior ones begging your pardon doctor what the devil is a change among the junior lords of the admiralty to a halfstarved imprisoned blackenedeyed ragged reefer much more than i was aware of now said i to the purser if you wish to do me a real kindness change me some of my spanish for english money and let the first bumboat that comes alongside be ready to go ashore in ballast for i shall certainly clear it my request was immediately complied with and my friends for the present took their leave those blessed bearers of the good things of this life the bumboats were not yet permitted alongside every five minutes i sent master bill up to see great are the miseries of a midshipmans berth when the crockery is all broken and the grog all drunk and the salt junk all eaten but great exceedingly great are the pleasures of the same berth when after a long cruise on coming into port the first boat of soft tack is on the table the first leg of mutton is in the boiler and the first pound of fresh butter is before the watering mouths of the expectants aldermen of london you feed muchepicures of the westend you feed delicately but neither of you know what real luxuries are go to sea for six months upon midshipman allowance eked out by midshipmens improvidence and on your return the greasy bumboat first beating against the ships sides will afford you a practical lesson upon the art of papillary enjoyment it is i must confess very unromantic and not at all like the hero of three volumes to confess that for a time my impulses of anger had given way to the gnawings of hunger and i thought for a time less of joshua daunton than of the first succulent cut into a leg of southdown mutton the blessed avatar at length took place the bumboat and the frigate lovingly rubbed sides and like an angel descending from heaven i saw bill coming down the afterhatchway his face radiant with the glory of expectant repletion a leg of mutton in each hand two quarternloaves under each arm and between each pair of loaves was jammed a pound of fresh butter i had the legs of mutton in the berth and laid on the table that i might contemplate them whilst i sent my messenger up for as many bottles of porter as i could buy but i was not permitted to enjoy the divine contemplation all to myself my five messmates came to partake of this access of happiness as the legs of mutton lay on the table how devoutly we ogled their delicate fat and speculated upon the rich and gravycharged lean we apostrophised themwe patted them endearingly with our handsand when bill again made his appearance laden with sundry bottles of porter our ecstasy was running at the rate of fourteen knots an hour my messmates settled themselves on the lockers smiling amiably how sorry they were that my eyes were so blackened and my face so swollen with what urbanity they smiled upon me i was of the right sortthe good fellowdamn him who would hurt a hair of my head they were all ready to go a step further than purgatory for me gentlemen said i making a semicircular barricade round me of my four quarternloaves my two pounds of fresh butter and eleven of my bottles of porter for i was just about to knock the head off the twelfth who under such circumstances could have waited for corkscrewsgentlemen said i get your knives ready we will have lunch shylock never flourished his more eagerly than did my companions theirs each eyeing a loaf gentlemen we will have lunchbut as i dont think that lately you have used me quite well countenances all round serious and as i have as you all well know laid out much money with little thanks upon this mess faces quite dejected permit me to remind you that there is still some biscuit in the breadbag and that this before me is private property the lower jaws of my messmates dropped as if conscious that there would be no occupation for them i cut a fine slice off the new bread spread it thickly with the butter tossed over a foaming mug of porter and eating the first mouthful of the delicious preparation with a superfluity of emphatic smacks i burst into laughter at the woebegone looks around me what said i could you think so meanly of me you have treated me according to your natures i treat you according to mine fallto dogs and devourpeck up the crumbs scarecrows as the creole calls you and be filled but pause and be just even to your own appetites notwithstanding our lunch let us dine let us divide the four loaves into eight equal portions there are six of us here and bill must have his share we will have more for our dinner when the legs of mutton make their appearance we drank each of us a bottle of porter and finished our halfquartern loaves with wonderful alacrity bill keeping us gladsome company my messmates then left the berth pronouncing me a good fellow the eighth portion of soft tommy and butter with a bottle of porter i made the servant leave on the table and then sent him again to the bumboat to procure other necessaries to make the accompaniments to our mutton perfect in the meantime pigtop who lay in his hammock directly across the window of our berth had been a tantalised observer of all that had passed i crouched myself up in one corner of the hole and was gradually falling into disagreeable ruminations when mr pigtop crept out of his hammock and into the berth and sat himself down as far from me as possible rattlin said he at length dolefully you have beaten me dreadfully it was your own seekingi am sorry for your sufferings welli thank ye for that samei dont mean the beatingyou know that i stood up to you like a man is there malice between us on my part none why did you provoke me i was wronginfarnally wrongand may be i would have owned it beforebut for your quick temper and that hard punch in the chaps i have had the worst of it it goes to my heart rattlin that i an old sailor and a man nearly forty should be knocked about by a mere boy it is not decentit is not becomingit is not naturali shall never get over it i wish i could undo the done things of yesterday and so do i heartilyfervently wellthat is kindly saidand i old enough to be your fatherand twentyfive years at seabeaten to a standstill sorry i ever entered the cursed ship how much of all this thought i is genuine feeling how much genuine appetite i was sorry for the poor fellow however rattlin owing to one crooked thing and another we have lately fared miserably the ship has been a hell upon the waters i am faint for the want of something to support me is that prog and that bottle of porter private property they are my property i do not offer them to you because i would not that you thought that i was aping magnanimity for the respect that i shall always owe to an old sailor i say to you frankly that if your feelings are sufficiently amicable towards me to take it take it and with it a welcome and a wish that it may do you much goodbut if your blood is still evil towards me for the sake of your own integrity you would reject it though you starved rattlin i break bread with you as a friend i am confoundedly sorry that i have been prejudiced against youand theres my hand upon it i shook hands with him heartily and said pigtop i cannot regret that i did my best to repel your insult but i sincerely regret its consequences henceforward you shall insult me twice before i lift my hand against you once i will never insult you again i will be your fast friend and perhaps i may have the means of proving it it now became my turn to be astonished instead of seeing the hungry oldster fallto like a ravenous dog he broke off a small corner from the bread ate it and was in the act of retiring when i hailed him halloapigtopwhats in the wind now my friend you do but little honour to my cheer and i am sure that you must want it no no said pigtop with much feelingyou shall never suppose that the old sailor sold the birthright of his honour for a mess of pottage well felt and well said by all thats upright but nevertheless you shall drink this bottle of porter and eat this bread and butterand so ill een cut it up into very excellent rounds you shant accept my friendship without accepting my fare i like your spirit so well pigtop that for your sake i will never judge of a man again until i have thrashed him soundly to the surprise of my messmates when they assembled punctually to the feast of mutton they discovered me and old pigtop hand in hand across the table discussing another bottle of porter chapter sixty one ralph is placed in an awkward predicament being put upon his trial to prove his identity and having no witnesses to call but himselfall voices against him but his own at this period every day nay almost every hour seemed to bring its startling event ere good digestion had followed our very good appetites bustle and agitation pervaded the whole ship it had been telegraphed from on shore that one of the junior lords of the admiralty was coming on board immediately there was blank dismay in our berth how could my messmates possibly go on the quarterdeck and assist to receive the dignified personage much did i enjoy the immunity that i supposed being a prisoner gave to me the portentous message came down that the young gentlemen in full uniform are expected to be on the quarterdeck to receive the lord of the admiralty all the consolation that i could give was quoting to them the speech of lady macbeth to her guestsgo nor stand upon the order of your going the firing of the salute from the maindeck guns announced the approach and the clanking of the muskets of the marines on the deck after they had presented arms the arrival of the lord plainly to me in my darksome habitation ten minutes had not elapsed during which i was hugging myself with the thought that all this pomp and circumstance could not annoy me when breathless with haste there rushed one two three four messengers each treading on the heels of the other telling me the lord of the admiralty wished to see me immediately in the captains cabin me see me what in the name of all that is disastrous can he want with me i would come when i had made a little alteration in my dress trusting that he was as impatient as all great men usually are when dealing with little ones i hoped by dilatoriness to weary him out and thus remain unseen vain speculation a minute had scarcely elapsed when one of the lieutenants came down in a halffriendly halfimperative manner to acquaint me that i must come up immediately the scene that ensuedhow can i sufficiently describe it had i not been sustained by the impudence of desperation i should have jumped overboard directly i had got on deck i found myself not well knowing by what kind of locomotion i got there in the forecabin where was spread a very handsome collation round which were assembled some fifteen officers all in their fulldress uniforms in the midst of which a feeble delicatelooking and excessively neatly dressed old gentleman stood in plain clothes his years must have been far beyond seventy he was fidgety indeed to that degree that would induce you to think that he was a little palsied i cannot answer for the silent operations that take place in other mens minds but in my own even under the greatest misfortunes a droll conceit will more rally my crushed spirits than all the moral consolations that blair ever penned if this be the junior lord of the admiralty thought i how venerably patriarchal must be his four seniors i smiled at the idea as i bowed let us describe the person that smiled and bowed to this august assembly figure to yourself a tall youth attired in a blue cotton jacket with the uniform button a once white kerseymere waistcoat and duck trousers on which were mapped in cloudy coloursproduced by stains of blackstrap peasoup and the other etceteras that may be found in that receptacle of abominations an illregulated midshipmans berthmore oceans seas bays and promontories than nature ever gave to this unhappy globe beneath these were discovered a pair of dark blue worsted stockings terminated by a pair of pursers shoesthings of a hybrid breed between a pair of castoff slippers and the ploughmans clodhoppers fitting as well as the former and nearly as heavy as the latter now this costume in the depth of winter was sufficiently light and bizarre but the manner in which i had contrived to decorate my countenance soon riveted all attention to that specimen of the human face divine marred by the hand of man thanks to the expertness of mr pigtop my eyes were singularly well blackened and the swelling of my face particularly about the upper lip had not yet subsided owing to my remaining so much since my arrest in the obscurity of the betweendecks and perhaps to some inflammation in my eyes from my recent beating i blinked upon those before me like an owl astonishing said my lord whiffledale is that mr ralph rattlin the same my lord said captain reud shall i introduce him to your lordship by no manner of meansyetfor his fathers sakereally ridiculoushenry the fifth baron of whiffledaleah black eyes filthy costume very particularly filthy upon my honour how is this captain reud of course my present visit is not official but merely to satisfy my curiosity as a gentleman how is it that your firstlieutenant permits the young gentlemen to so far disgracei must use the wordthe serviceas you seeinin my young friend there with the worsted stockings and swelled lip andblack eyes when i first made my appearance all the captains then and there collected had looked upon me with anything but flattering regards some turned up their noses some grinned all appeared astonished and all disgusted at the conclusion of this speech i was surprised at the benignity which beamed upon me from under their variously shaped and coloured eyebrows there was magic in the words for his fathers sake and my young friend captain reud replied it is not my lord so much the fault of mr rattlin as it would at the first blush appear to be he himself pressed a wicked mischievous young blackguard who was appointed the young gentlemans servant incredible as the fact may appear my lord he contrived in a manner that dr thompson can best explain to you to destroy all the clothes of his young master merely in the wantonness of his malice i know that mr rattlin is well provided with money and that he will take the first opportunity again to assume the garb of a gentleman and i do assure your lordship that no man becomes it better sir if this youth be mr rattlini believe itthe very oldest blood in the country flows in his veinsbut it does seem a kind of species of miracle how a scion of that noble house should stand before me his fathers friend with two black eyes and a ragged jacketthere may be some mistake after all i was going mr rattlin to take you with me to my hotel having matters of the utmost importance to communicate to you but oh noi am not fastidious so we had better first have a little private conference in the aftergentlemen will you excuse usbowing roundcaptain reud will perhaps do me the favour to be of the party so into the aftercabin we three went i burning with impatience and speechless with agitation supposing that the muchcoveted secret of my parentage would be at length unfolded to me lord whiffledale and captain reud being seated with their backs to the cabinwindows and i standing before them with the light full upon my disfigured face i must have had a great deal more the look of a battered blackguard being tried for petty larceny than a young gentleman on the eve of being acknowledged the heir to greatness by a very noble lord there was a pause for some minutes during which lord whiffledale was preparing to be imposing and the light of mischief began to beam with incipient insanity in reuds eye certainly i said to myself he will not dare to practise one of his mad pranks upon a lord of the admiralty what will not madness dare his lordship having taken snuff very solemnly and looked round him with a calm circumspection fixing his dull eye upon me and wagging his head with an equable motion slowly up and down spoke as follows there is a providence above us all it is seen mr rattlin in the fall of a sparrowit has protected our glorious institutionsit has sanctified the pillars of the state providence is mr rattlindo you really know what providence is i ask you the question advisedlyi always speak advisedlyi ask you do you know what providence is do not speak interruptions are unseemlythere are few who interrupt me providence young man has brought me on board this frigate todaythe wind is northeasterly what there is of it may increase my catarrh there is the hand of providence in everything i promised my most honourable friend that i would see you as you arehow equipped how lodged how cabined cribbed confined apt quotationyou are cabinedyou are cribbedyou are confinedcribbedlook at your countenanceas i said before tis the hand of providence begging your lordships pardon said reud submissively with the dubious twinkle in his eye for interrupting a nobleman who is so seldom interruptedi rather think that it was the fist of pigtop pigtopprovidencemy quotation captain reud i have not really the pleasure of understanding you this young gentleman who has been so lately under the chastening hand of providence pigtop is now about to receive from that bountiful hand some of the choicest gifts it is in the happiness of man to receiverank wealth a fathers blessing oh tis too muchi am affectedwhat can i possibly do with him with those black eyes mr ralph rattlin you have not yet spoken to meindeed how can you what words would be sufficiently expressive ofofwhat you ought to express captain reud dont you find this scene rather affecting young gentleman i am here to verify youare you fully prepared sir to be as it were verified my lord my lord i am bursting with impatience bursting with impatience the scene is affecting certainly touchingcomplete with the exception of the black eyes what would not miss burney make of it in one of her admirable novels but you might have made use of a better word than burstingi am ready to dissolve with emotion at this tender scenethe discovery of his parentage to a tall ingenuous youthburstingyou might have used first burningsecondly glowingthirdly consumingfourthly ragingfifthly dyingsixthly there is perishing but i will not much insist upon the last though it is certainly better than bursting you mean to say that you are burning not bursting with impatienceit is a natural feeling it is commendable it is worthy of a son of your most honourable fatheri will faithfully report to him this filial impatience and how eager i was to remove it i do not say satisfy it a person less careful of the varieties of language would have said satisfyan impatience satisfied is what a contradiction of terms but an impatience removed isisthe removal of an impatience this interview will grow very touching those blackened eyesi would that there were a green shade over them are you prepared to be verified i bowed fearing that any other expression of my wishes would lead to further digression his lordship then putting on his spectacles and reading from a paper commenced thus i all the while trembling with agitation are you the person who was nursed by one rose brandon the wife of joseph brandon by trade a sawyer i am what name did you go by when under the care of those persons ralph rattlin brandon right very good i shall embrace him shortlymy heart yearns towards him were you removed to a school by a gentleman in a plain carriage from those brandons i was to where to mr roots academy righta good boy an amiable boy he was removed to mr roots and having there imbibed the rudiments of a classical education you were removed to where to a boardingschool kept by a french gentleman at stickenham where in his wife i thought i had found a mother stop we are not come to that yet that is too affectingof that anon as somebody says in some play have you captain reud a glass of water ready should this amiable youth or myself feel faint during this exciting investigation perfectly ready said the creole decidedly in one of his insane fits for he immediately skipped behind his lordship and jumping upon the locker stood ready to invert a glass of water upon his nicelypowdered head containing at least three gallons this glass being a large globe containing several curious fish which swung attached to a beam directly over my interrogator here was a critical situation for me a mad captain about to blow the gampus ie souse a lord of the admiralty that same lord i firmly believed about to declare himself my father i was in a manner spellbound afraid to interrupt the conference i bethought me that my lord whiffledale would be no less my father wet or dry and so i determined to let things take their course so i permitted his lordship to go on with his questions at every one of which captain reud looking more like a baboon than a human being canted the globe more and more all very satisfactoryall very satisfactory indeed and now ralph on whom have you been in the habit of drawing for your allowance while you were in the west indies mr of kings bench walk in the temple perfectly correctperfectlystill reading are you a wellgrown youth for your age i am of an interesting physiognomy here the malicious madman grinned at me in the most laughable manner over the devoted head of the ancient lord i hope you will think so my lord when i have recovered my usual looks ughhumhaof dark brown hair approaching to black with intensely black eyes noyes mine was the negative captain reuds the affirmative spoken simultaneously at this crisis his lordship had made a very proper and theatrical start captain reud grasped the glass with both hands and the severe bright eye of dr thompson fell upon the prankplaying captain the effect was instantaneous he slunk away from his intended mischief completely subdued the fire left his eye the grin his countenance and he stood beside his lordship in a moment the quiet and gentlemanly postcaptain deferentially polite in the presence of his superior i understood the thing in a momentit was the keeper and his patient i am particularly sorry my lord said the doctori am very particularly sorry captain reud to break in upon you unannounced the fact is i did knock several times but i suppose i was not heard this letter my lord i hope will be a sufficient apology his lordship took the letter with a proud condescension captain reud said dr thompsons presence is always acceptable to me lord whiffledale read this letter over three times distinctly then from his usual white he turned a palish purple then again became white in no other manner did he seem to lose his selfpossession dr thompson said he at length very calmly let me see some of these documents immediately anticipating the request my lord i have them with me the doctor then placed in his hands several letters and papers at length his lordship exclaimed i am confounded it is wholly beyond my comprehensioni know not how to act it is excessively distressing i wish on my soul i had never meddled in the business can i see the young man certainly my lord i will bring him to you immediately during dr thompsons short absence his lordship walked up and down with a contracted brow and much more than his usual fidgety movements not wholly to my surprise but completely to my dismay the doctor reappeared with my arch and only enemy by his sidejoshua daunton the contrast between him and me was not at all in my favour not in uniform certainly but scrupulously clean with a superfine blue cloth jacket and trousers white neckerchief and clean linen shirt he looked not only respectable but even gentlemanly i have before described my appearance i may be spared the hateful repetition and so said his lordship turning to joshua you are the true and veritable ralph rattlin i am my lord said the unblushing liar the young gentleman near you is my illegitimate brother his mother is a beautiful lady of the name of causand a most artful woman she first contrived to poison sir reginalds mind with insinuations to my disfavour and at last so well carried on her machinations as to drive me first from the paternal roof and lastly i confess it with horror and remorse into a course so evil as to compel me to change my name fly from my country and subject me to the lash at the gangway if these documents that i confide to your hands and to yours only will not remove every doubt as to the truth of my assertions afford me but a little time till i can send to london and every point shall be satisfactorily cleared up he then placed in lord whiffledales hands the papers that had been so convincing to dr thompson captain reud now reduced by the presence of the good doctor to the most correct deportment stepped forward and assured his lordship that i at least was no impostor and that if imposition had been practised i had been made an unconscious instrument perhaps said his lordship after scrutinising the papers and returning them to joshua the young gentleman with the blackened eyes will do us the favour in a few words to give us his own version of the story for may i die consumptive if i can tell which is the real simon pure placed thus in the embarrassing situation of pleading for my own identity i found that i had very little to say for myself i could only affirm that although always unowned i had been continuously cared for and that the bills i had drawn upon mr the lawyer in the kings bench walk in the temple had always been honoured my lord shook his head when i had finished diplomatically he took snuff he then eyed me and my adversary carefully he now waved his head upwards and downwards and at length opened his mouth and spoke captain reud i wash my hands of this business i cannot decide i was going to take on shore with me the legitimate and toolong neglected son of my good old friend sir reginald where is that son i come on board the eos and i ask him at your hands captain reud is that person with the discoloured countenance my friends son certainly not is that other person his sona disgraced man knowing the noble race of my friend i should say certainly not where is sir ralphs sir reginaldss son he is not here or if he be here i cannot distinguish him i wash my hands of iti hate mysteries i will take neither of them to london i am under some slight obligations to sir reginaldand yeti cannot decide the weight of evidence certainly preponderates in favour of the new claimant captain reud perhaps will permit him to land and he may go up to town immediately and have an interview with mr the lawyer and if he can satisfy that person he will receive from him further instructions as to his future proceedings chapter sixty two the confessions of a madman which nevertheless embrace a very wise cautionralph gets his libertyticketvery needless as he is determined henceforward to preserve his libertyand being treated so uncivilly as a sailor determines to turn civilian himself here captain reud interrupted the speaker and told him that joshua was a prisoner under punishment and waiting only for convalescence to receive the remainder of his six dozen lashes at hearing this his lordship appeared truly shocked and drawing reud aside they conversed for some minutes in whispers at the conclusion of this conference captain reud stepped forward and regarding joshua with a look of much severity he said young man for the sake of other parties and of other interests your errors are overlooked your discharge from this ship shall be made out immediately if you are the person you claim to be your three or four months pay can be of no consequence to you have you sufficient money to proceed to london immediately much more than sufficient sir i thought so proceed to london to the lawyers if you are no impostor i believe that a fathers forgiveness awaits you forget that you were ever in this ship my clerk will make out your discharge immediately take care of yourself you are watched there is a wakeful eye upon you if you swerve from the course laid down for you and go not immediately to mr s office be assured that you will be again in irons under the halfdeck have i my lord correctly expressed your intentions correctly captain reud joshua daunton get your bag ready and in the meantime i will give the necessary orders to the clerk you may go with an illconcealed triumph on his countenance joshua daunton bowed submissively to all but myself to me he advanced with an insulting smile and an extended hand i shrank back loathingly farewell brother ralph i told you that i should be in london before you will you favour me with any commands wellyour pride is not unbecomingi will not resent it for your fathers sake and for his and for your sake i will forgive the juggle that has hitherto placed the natural sonthat is i believe the delicate paraphrasein the station of the rightful heir farewell i made no reply he left the cabin and in an hour after the ship i shall not advantage myself of that expression so fully naturalised in novels that my feelings might be conceived but cannot be expressed for they can be expressed easily enoughin two wordsstupefied indignation after joshua had departed the other persons remaining in the aftercabin followed shortly after with the exception of myself for reud told me to stay where i then was until he should see me again in the course of an hour lord whiffledale went on shore with his cortege and captain reud returned into the aftercabin which i had been during his absence disconsolately pacing he was a little flushed with the wine he had taken but perfectly sane he came up to me kindly and placing his hands upon my shoulders looked me fully and sorrowfully in the face there was no wild speculation in his eyes they looked mild and motherly the large tears gathered in each gradually and at length overflowing the sockets slowly trickled down his thin and sallow cheeks he then pressed his right hand heavily on the top part of his forehead exclaiming in a voice so low so mournful and so touching that my bosom swelled at its tones it is hereit is here ralph my good ralph said he after he had seated himself weeping all the while bitterly we will take leave of each other now we are true brothers in sorrowour afflictions are the sameyou have lost your identity and i mine ever since that cursed night at aniana john reuds soul was loosened from his body i have the greatest trouble to keep it fixed to my corporeal frame it goes away in spite of me at times and some other soul gets into this withered carcass and plays me sad trickssad tricks rattlinsad tricks my identity is gone and so poor youth is yours we will part friends these tears are not all for youthey are for myself too i do not mind crying before you now for it is not the true john reud that is now weeping you think that i have been a tyrant to youbut i tell you rattlin there is a tyrant in the ship greater than iit is that horrible dr thompson he is plotting to take away my commission and to get me into a madhouse oh my godmy god remove from me this agony hath thine awful storm no thunderboltthy wave no tomb must i die on the straw like a beast of burden worn to death by loathsome toiland so many swords to have flashed harmlessly over my head so many balls to have whistled idly past my body but gods will be done bear yourself my dear body carefully in the presence of all medical men they have the eye of the fanged adder you know that your identity also has been questioned but your fate is happier than mine for you can hear see touch your double but mine always eludes me when i come home after an excursion to my own temple but if i were you when i got hold of the thing that says it is and is not yourself i would grind it i would crush it i would destroy it i will so may heaven help me at my utmost need well said my boy well saidbecause he has no right to get himself flogged and thus give a wretched world an opportunity of saying that ralph rattlin had been brought to the gangway but do not let this cast you down you will do well yetwhile ioh that i had a soni might then escape god bless youi must pray for strength of mindstrength of mindmark me strength of mind go my good boy if misfortunes should overtake you and they leave me anything better than a dark cell and clanking chains come and share it with me now go and he wrung my hands bitterly and tell doctor thompson i wish to speak with him and just hint to him how rationally and pleasantly we have been discoursing togetherand remember my parting wordsdeport yourself warily before the doctors carefully preserve your identity and sometimes think on your poor captain this last interview with captain reud for it was my last would have made me wretched had it not been swallowed up by a deeper wretchedness of my own early next morning we weighed and made sail for sheerness on anchoring in the medway captain reud went on shore and as i shall have no more occasion to refer to him i shall state at once that the very fate he so feared awaited him six months after he had left the eos he died raving mad in a private receptacle for the insane at sheerness we were paid off as i went over the side of the eos for the last time i was tempted to shake the dust from off my feet for of a surety it had lately been an accursed abode to me in order entirely to elude all observation from my late companions i abandoned everything i had on board not worth much truly with the exception of my sextant and telescope and took on shore with me only the clothes miserable they were in which i stood i went to no hotel or inn but seeing a plain and humble house in which there were lodgings to let for single men i went and hired a little apartment that contained a press bedstead i took things leisurely and quietly i was now fully determined to discover my parentage and after that event entirely to be governed by circumstances as to my future course of life and the resuming of the naval profession my first operations were sending for a tailor hatter and those other architects so essential in building up the outer man the costume i now chose was as remote from official as could be made i provided myself with one suit only leaving the rest of my wardrobe to be completed in london knowing that i had an active and intelligent enemy who had two days the start of me i was determined to act with what i thought caution i had more than a halfyears stipend due to me i accordingly drew for it upon the lawyer nearly pounds intimating to him at the same time by letter my arrival in england and asking if he had any instructions as to my future disposal this letter was answered by return of post written with all the brevity of business stating that no such instructions had been received and inclosing an order on the sheerness bank for the money so far all was highly satisfactory it proved two things first that joshua daunton had not yet carried his machinations in the quarter from which arose the supplies and secondly that i should now have considerable funds wherewith to prosecute my researches in the space of three days behold me dressed in the fashionable costume of the periodblue coat broad yellow buttons yellow waistcoat with ditto white corduroy continuations tied with several strings at the knees and topped boots it was in the reign of the bloods and the ruffians more ferocious species of coxcombs than our dandies and much more annoying chapter sixty three ralph finds everywhere great changesgives way to his feelings and makes a fool of himselfthis chapter will be found either the worst or the best of ralphs confessions according to the feelings of the reader having stayed one week at sheerness and laid down my plan of future action i started in the passage boat for chatham there was not much room for recumbency i found it however and placed the only luggage that i had a small parcel covered with brown paper under my head as a pillow the parcel contained my logs and my certificates and a single change of linen very providentially i had placed my payticket with my bank notes in my pocketbook once as i opened my eyes at the explosion of an oath more loud than usual methought i saw the sudden and whitecomplexioned face of joshua daunton hanging closely over mine i started up and rubbed my eyes but the vision had fled i was determined to be watchful and with this determination in full activity i again fell asleep nor was i once more properly awakened until we had arrived at chatham when i had roused myself up to my consternation i discovered that my pillow was nowhere to be found many of the passengers had already gone their ways and those who remained knew nothing about me or my packet indeed i only drew suspicions on myself as my paucity of baggage and the pretensions of my dress were decidedly at variance the gentleman in topboots and with the brown paper parcel seemed ridiculous enough seeing how ineffectual noise was i held my peace now that i had nothing else to hold got on the outside of the first coach for london and by ten at night i found myself in the coffeeroom of the white horse in fetter lane the next morning when i arose it was my birthday the th of february and i stood at mine inn a being perfectly isolated but i was not idle on descending into the coffeeroom i procured the court guide but my most anxious scrutiny could discover no such person among the baronets as sir reginald rattlin paying my bill i next went to somerset house and drew my pay i then repaired to the aristocratic mansion of lord whiffledale in grosvenor square not at home and in the country for some time were the surly answers of the indolent porter it was a day of disappointments the lawyer who cashed my bills was civil and constrained to all my entreaties first and to my leading questions afterwards he gave me cold and evasive answers he told me he had received no further instructions concerning me reiterated his injunctions that i should not endanger the present protection that i enjoyed by endeavouring to explore what it was the intention of those on whom i depended to keep concealed and he finally wished me a good morning and was almost on the point of handing me out of his office but i would not be so repelled i became impassioned and loud nor would i depart until he assured me on his honour that he knew almost as little of the secret as myself and that he was only the agent of an agent never having yet had any communication with the principal whose name even he assured me he did not know i had now nearly exhausted the day the intermingling mists of the season and the heavy smoke of the town were now shrouding the streets in a dense obscurity there were no gas lights then profoundly ignorant of the intricacy of the streets of the metropolis i was completely at the mercy of the hackneycoachmen and they made me buy it extremely dear merely from habit i again repaired to the white horse and concluded my nineteenth natal day in incertitude solitude and misery to stickenhamyes i would go there immediately but the resolve gave no exulting throb to my bosom i went to that spot so consecrated to my memory by bright skies and brighter faces the spot where i had so often urged the flying ball and marshalled the mimic armyit was there that i stood and i asked of a miserable halfstarved woman where was the playground of my youth and she showed me a brickfield i walked a few steps further and asked for the schoolhouse of my happiest daysand one pointed out to me a brawling alehouse it was a bitter change i asked of another where was now my old lighthearted deeplearned french schoolmaster monsieur cherfeuil he had gone back to france the emigres had been recalled by napoleon there was one other question that i dreaded yet burned to aski need not state how fearful it was to me since it was to learn the fate of her whom i had honoured and loved and hailed as my motherthe beautiful and the kind mrs cherfeuil i conjectured that she too had gone to france with her husband and the idea was painful to me there have been great alterations here my good girl said i to a young person whom i afterwards met very great indeed sirthey have ruined father and mother your name my dear is susan archer bless me so it is sir and you seem a very intelligent little girl indeed yes i have had a good deal of booklearning but all that is past and gone now when mrs cherfeuil lived in that house she took care that we should always have a home of our own fire in the grate and a loaf in the cupboardshe had me sent to schoolbut now she is gone gonewherewith her husband dont you know sir said she with a quiet solemnity that made me shudder with dreadful anticipations if you will come with me i will show you i dared not ask the awful question is she dead i took my gentle guide by the hand and suffered her to lead me slowly through the village neither of us spoke we had almost attained to the end of the hamlet when my sad guide gently plucked me by the arm to turn down to the right no said i tremulously that is not the way we must go forward that lane leads to the churchyard and to mrs cherfeuil go on and regard me not in another minute we were both sitting on a newlymade grave the little girl weeping in the innocent excess of that sorrow that brings its own sweet relief my at first low and almost inaudible murmurs gradually grew more loud and more impassioned at last they aroused the attention of my weeping companion and she said to me artlessly it is of no use taking on in this way sir she can never speak up from the grave she is in heaven now and god does not permit any of his blessed saints to speak to us sinners below you are quite right my good girl said i ashamed of this betrayal of my emotion it is very foolish indeed to be talking to the dead over their damp graves and not at all proper but i have a great fancy to stay here a little while by myself pray go and wait for me at the end of the lane i will not keep you long and i have something to say to you i will do as you tell me sir most certainly i will tell you all about her death for i was a sort of help to the nurse i know you now sir and thought i knew you from the first i shall not repeat the extravagances that i uttered when alone i was angry with myself and with all the world and i fear that i exasperated myself with the thought that i did not sufficiently feel the grief with which i strove to consecrate my loss i remember i concluded my rhapsody thus again i call upon you by the sacred name of motherfor such you were and no other will my heart ever acknowledge i adjure you to hear me swear that i will have all the justice done to your memory that man can do and may we never meet in those realms where only the injured find redress if i fail to scatter this sacred earth in token of dishonour upon the head of him who has dishonoured youwere he even my own father it is an oath may it be recorded should that record be used as my sentence of death having made this harsh and impious vow the effect of overexcitement i tore a considerable portion of the earth from the grave and folding it in my handkerchief i knotted it securely and placed it round my heart next to my skin like those belts that are worn by roman catholics as instruments of penance with a wish for something very like the shedding of blood in my heart and with a fervent prayer in my imagination and on my lips i left mrs cherfeuils humble grave and joined my companion in one little halfhour i found my belt of vengeance so cold and so inconvenient that i heartily wished i was well rid of it it is a miserable confession a sad falling off in my heroics but the oath that i had voluntarily and so solemnly taken prevented me from ridding myself of the disgusting incumbrance according to the account of my companion all was smiles and happiness and sunshine around mrs cherfeuil when a person made his appearance by the description of whom i at once recognised that fiend daunton domestic happiness then ceased for the poor lady rumours of the worst nature got abroad her little french husband instead of being as for twelve years before he had been her shadow her slave and her admirer became outrageous and cruel and after the horrid word bigamy had been launched against her she never after held up her head she sickened and died nor did daunton succeed in his plans of extorting moneybut his scheme was infinitely more deep and more hellish he had but not till after her death declared himself to be her son this instead of having any effect upon the outraged widower only made him more eager to drive the impostor from his presence and the opportunity offering itself to leave the spot now so hateful to him and the country that had sheltered him and in which he had grown so rich he availed himself of it eagerly this account did not aggravate my implacable feelings against this daunton for my hate was beyond the capability of increase after hearing all that the little wench had to discover and rewarding her i proceeded alone to wander over the spots that were once so dear to me in this melancholy occupation when the cold mists of the early evening fell i continued heaping regret upon regret until a more miserable being short of being impelled to suicide could not have trod the earth about five it began to grow dark and weary both in mind and body i commenced climbing the long hill that was the boundary of the common on my return to london on the surrey side of the hill for its apex separated it from another county the descent was more precipitousso much so that it is now wholly disused as a road for carriages and not only was it precipitous but excessively contorted the bends sometimes running at right angles with each other high banks clothed with impervious hedges and shadowed by tall trees made the road both dank and dark and at the time that i was passing or rather turning round one of the elbows of this descent a sturdy fellow with a heavy cudgel followed at some distance by a much smaller man accosted me in a rude tone of voice by bawling out i say you sir whats oclock go about your business and let me pass take that for your civility and with a severe blow with his stick he laid me prostrate i was not stunned but i felt very sick and altogether incapable of rising in this state i determined to feign stupefaction so i nearly closed my eyes and lay perfectly still the huge vagabond then placed his knee upon my chest and called out to his companion i say mister come and see if this here chaps the right un the person called to came up and immediately after through my eyelashes i beheld the diabolical white face of daunton it was so dark that to recognise me he was obliged to place his countenance so close to mine that his hot breath burned against my cheek he was in a passion of terror and trembled as if in an access of ague it is said he whilst his teeth chattered is he stunned mister now i take that as an insult dye think that john gowles need strike such a strip of a thing as that ere twice hushhow very very cold it is where is your knife will you do it most sartainly not therehes at your mercyi never committed murder yetno no must think of my precious soul a bargains a bargainmy part ont is done gowles dont talk so loud i cant bear the sight of bloodand oh godof this bloodit would spurt upon my hand strike him again over the headhe breathes heavilystrike him no said the confederate sullenly tell yeull have neither art nor part in this ere murder during this very interesting conference i was rallying all my energies for one desperate effort intending however to wait for the uplifted knife to grasp it in order that i might turn the weapon against the breast of one assassin and then use it as a defence against the other would to god said the villain adding blasphemy to concerted murderwould to god that my hand was spared this task give me the knife now where shall i strike himi have no strength to drive it into him far tell ye mister ull have nought to do with the murderbut ud advise thee to bare his neck and thrust in the point just under his right ear hush will it bleed much damnably horriblehorrible do you think the story about cain and abel is true as god is in heaven cant it be done without blood ill have nothing to do with the murder but mister if so be as you are so cravenhearted take your small popper and send a ball right into his heart it is a gentlemans death and will make the prettiest small hole imaginable and bleed none to signify but mind ye this ere murders all your own at this critical moment as i was inhaling a strong breath in order to invigorate my frame for instant exertion i heard two or three voices in the distance carolling out in a sort of disjointed chorus many droll sights ive seen but i wish the wars were over now or never said joshua producing and cocking his pistol i leaped upon my legs in an instant and seizing the weapon which was a small tool manufactured for a gentlemans pocket by the barrel with my left hand and this amiable specimen of fraternity by the right the struggle of an instant ensued the muzzle of the pistol was close upon my breast when my adversary discharged it i felt the sharp hard knock of the ball upon my chest and the percussion for the moment took away my breath but my hold upon the villains throat was unrelaxed the gurgling of suffocation became audible to his brutal companion ods sneckens said the brute but this ere murdered man is throttling my mister in his deaththroe down at once came his tremendous cudgel upon my arm i released my grip and again fell to the earth hes a dead man said gowles run for your life mind mister i had neither art nor part in this ere and they were almost immediately out of sight and out of hearing at the report of the pistol the jolly choristers struck up prestissimo with their feet they were standing round me just as the retreating feet of my assassins had ceased to resound in the stillness of the darkness a voice which i immediately knew to be that of my old adversary the masters mate pigtop accosted me holloa shipmatefallen foul of a pirate mayhaphavent slipped your wind ha ye messmate no but i believe my arms broken and i have a pistol ball between my ribs which way did the lubbers sheer off shall we clap on sail and give chase it is of no use i know one of them well they shall not escape me why i know that voice yesnodamn meit must be ralph rattlinit beant sureand here on his beam ends a shot in his hull and one of his spars shattered id sooner have had my grog watered all my life than this should have fallen out you have not had your grog watered this evening pigtop said i rising assisted by himself and his comrades i dont feel much hurt after all true true shipmate but we must clap a stopper over all smallshot in the chest are bad messmates we must make a tourniquet of my skysail here so without heeding my cries of pain he passed his handkerchief round my breast and by the means of twisting his walkingstick in the knot he hove it so tight that he not only stopped all effusion of blood but almost all my efforts at breathing my left hand still held the discharged pistol which i gave into the custody of pigtop upon further examination i found that there was no fracture of the bone of my arm and that all things considered i could walk tolerably well however i still felt a violent pain in my chest attended with difficulty of breathing at the least accelerated pace chapter sixty four ralph appears before a magistrate and proves to be more frightened than hurt though frightened as little as a veritable hero should bea great deal of fuss about a little dust not kicked up but finally laid down we got on nevertheless pigtop shaking his head very dolefully whenever i paused to recover breath we entered the first house that we came to that of an agricultural labourer we told our adventure and the good man immediately proceeded to acquaint the patrol and the constable i was anxious to examine the nature of my wound to which my old messmate would not listen for a moment he was particularly sorry that he saw no blood from which symptom he argued the worstlooking upon me as a dead man being certain that i was bleeding inwardly i decided for a postchaise that i might hasten to town and make my depositions for i was determined to let loose the hounds of the law after my dastardly enemies without the loss of a moment the chaise was soon procured and much to the satisfaction of pigtop we drove directly to bow streetthe good fellow having a firm persuasion that the moment his makeshift tourniquet was withdrawn i should breathe my last i had no such direful apprehensions when we arrived at the office the worthy magistrate was on the point of retiring the clatter of the chaise driving rapidly up to the door and the exaggerated report of the postboy heralded us in with some eclat the magistrate when he had heard it was a case of murder very well disguised his regret at the postponement of his dinner mr pigtop insisted upon supporting me although i could walk very wellquite as well as himself considering his potations and insisted also upon speaking he was one of the old school of seamen and could not speak out of his profession accordingly he was first sworn we will give the commencement of his deposition verbatim as he is one of a class that is fast disappearing from the face of the waters if you please your worship i and my two concerts that are lyingto in my wake after having taken in our wood and water at woolwich we braced up sharp bound for london what do you mean by your wood and water said the magistrate our bub and grubheres a magistrate for you aside to meyour worship down to our bearings so as bill here said as how we were working tom coxs traverseyour worship knows what that means well enough indeed sir i dont its the course the lawyers will take when they make sail for heaven i can see in the twinkling of a pursers dip that your worship is no lawyer this sir is the first time anyone has had the impertinence to tell me so well well no offence i hope your worshipthere is no accounting for taste as the monkey said when he saw the cat pitch into the tar barrel and then the worthy witness embarked into a very irrelevant digression about landsharks the magistrate however was patient and sensible and at length overcame the great difficulty arising from his never having been to sea and pigtop never having been to law his deposition having been translated into the vulgar tongue out of nautical mysticisms was duly sworn to yet not without an interruption when the magistrate heard that it was supposed that i had the pistolball still somewhere in my bodyhe wishing me to be examined by a surgeon immediately mr pigtop was opposed to this lest i should die upon the spot but i gave the magistrate more satisfaction by telling him i had good reason to suppose that the ball had not penetrated deeply i was the last examined and i almost electrified pigtop when i deposed that i knew well the person of my murderous assaulter and that it was joshua daunton at this announcement my quondam messmate slapped his hand upon his knee with a violence that echoed through the court grinned then looked profoundly serious but made me very thankful by holding his peace and shaking his head most awfully when i proceeded to give a very accurate description of this wretchs person looks of understanding passed between three or four of the principal runners who were attentively listening to the proceedings when this business was concluded the magistrate said to me the young man who has committed this outrage upon your person we have strong reason to believe is amenable to the laws for other crimes he has eluded our most active officers and it was supposed that he had left the kingdom it appears now that he has returned you have had a most providential escape the pistol will give us a good clue there is no doubt but that shortly we shall be able to give a good account of him let me now advise you mr rattlin to have your hurt examined come into my private room a surgeon will be here in an instant pigtop and i were then ushered into a room on one side of the office i looked extremely foolishalmost in fact as confused as if i had been charged with an offence the surgeon soon made his appearance but in the short interval the magistrate had begun to thrust home with his questions as to who i was what were my intentions and the probable motives of dauntons attempt on my life all these i parried as well as i could without letting him know anything of the supposed consanguinity between myself and the culprit his motive i accounted for as revenge for some real or imaginary insult inflicted by me when we were on board the eos upon my persisting to refuse for some time to strip that the wound might be examined the magistrate began to look grave and the surgeon hinted that it was perhaps as well not to seek for what was not to be found the dread of being looked upon as an impostor overcame my shame at the expose of my romantic weakness poor pigtop had alarms upon totally other grounds he watched with painful anxiety the unwinding of his tourniquet ready to receive me dying into his arms his surprise was greater i fear me than his joy when he discovered no signs of bleeding when his handkerchief was removed what in the name of pharmacy is this said the surgeon detaching my belt of earth but here is the ball howeverit has more than broken the skin and there has been a good deal of blood extravasated but it has been absorbed by the mould in this handkerchief by whatever means this singular bandage was placed where i found it you may depend upon it young gentleman that it has saved your life i presume mr rattlin that you are a catholic said the magistrate and that you have been a very naughty boy if so the penance that your confessor has enjoined you has been miraculously providential and i shall think better of penances for the rest of my life the lie so temptingly offered for my adoption i was about to make use of but when i reflected from whence i had collected that sacred earth i dared not profane it by falsehood so with a faltering voice and my eyes filling with tears i told the magistrate the truth my young friend said he these superstitious fancies and acts are best omitted i am sure that you do not need this earth to remember your mother besides it must be prejudicial to your health to carry it about your person to say nothing of the singularity of the deed take my advice and convey it carefully to the nearest consecrated ground and there reverently deposit it we will preserve this ball with the pistol and now let mr ankins dress your slight wound we must see you well through this affair and the admiralty must prolong your leave of absence if it be necessary i should wish to know more of you as a private individualthere is my card you are a very good lad for honouring your mother fare ye well with many compliments from the surgeon also and a roller or two of cotton round my chest we mutually took leave of each other the gentleman very considerately refusing the guinea that i tendered him having discharged the postchaise mr pigtop his two companions and myself left the officei bearing in my hand the handkerchief nearly filled with mould what did i do with itsaturated as it was with my blood and owing as i did my life to it perhaps sweet and gentle lady you think that i preserved it in a costly vase over which i might weep or had it made up by some fair hands systematically into a silken belt and still wore it next my heart or at least that i placed it in a china flowervase and planted a rosetree therein which i watered daily by my tears alas for the lovers of the romantic i did none of these i told you before all my incidents turn out to be mere matteroffact affairs like a good boy i did as the magistrate bade me as i passed by saint pauls covent garden i turned into the churchyard and with a silent prayer for the departed and asking pardon of god for the profanation of which i had been guilty i poured out the whole of the dust with reverence on a secluded spot and then returned and joined my companions taking leave of them shortly after i repaired to the white horse in fetter lane and eating a light supper retired to bed early and thus finished this very memorable day on the day succeeding i found my arm so much swollen and myself altogether so ill that i kept my bed i need not mention that the same surgeon attended me i took this opportunity of furnishing myself with a few necessaries and a carpetbag so i was no longer the gentleman without any luggage on the third day of my confinement to the house sitting alone in the deserted coffeeroom chewing the cud of my bitter fancies mr pigtop made his appearance though i knew the man to be thoroughly selfish i believed him to have that dogged sort of honesty not uncommon to very vulgar minds as just then any society was welcome i received his condolements very graciously and requested his company to dinner my invitation was gladly accepted and he occupied the time previous to that repast in giving me a history of his life it was a very common one he was the son of a warrantofficer he was all but born on board a manofwar at the age of fifteen he got his rating as a midshipman and then rose to be a masters mate there his promotion ceased and to all appearances for ever he had been already twentyfive years in the service and was turned forty never having had anything beyond his pay his life had been one of ceaseless privation and discontent he had now nearly spent all his money and had omitted to make those reparations to his wardrobe rendered so necessary by the malignity of joshua daunton he wished to leave the service and be anything rather than what he had been he had no relations living and positively no friends his prospects were most disconsolate and his wretchedness seemed very great however he found considerable relief in unburthening himself to me after our frugal dinner of rump steaks and our one bottle of port he returned to the subject of the morning by asking my advice as to his future conduct nay pigtop i replied you should not ask me you are much more capable of judging for yourselfyou who have been so much longer in the world than i there you are out of your reckoning i have lived more than twice your years and have never been in the world at all on shore im like a pig afloat in a washingtub what would you advise me to do you have no relations or friends to assist you the mournful shake of the head was eloquently negative and yet you will not resume that life for which alone you were educated i will not and i cannot well you must either go on the highway or marry a fortune look at this figureheadlook at this scar nono one will ever splice with such an old ravelledout ropeyarn as andrew pigtop the road is no longer a gentlemanly profession i intend to be a servant you pigtopbegging your pardon who the devil would be encumbered with you you i hopeno dont laugh i know you to be a gentleman born and that you have a hundred a year by hints that i have picked up i believe when you come of age and all is done right by you that youll have thousands we have one view in commonto hang that rogue daunton i certainly do not wish to put on your livery without you insist upon it call me your secretary or anything you likeonly let me be near youyour servant and your friend i saw the poor fellows eye glisten and his weatherworn features quiver i looked upon his worn and shabby uniform and reflected upon his long and unrequited services venerate him i knew that i never could but i already pitied him exceedingly i resolved at least to assist him and to keep him near me for a time well pigtop i at length said if you would be faithful to the backboneto the shedding of my blood stand by me now in my distress and while i have either soul or body i will peril them for your safety pigtop i believe you say no more about it i engage you as my travelling tutor and i will pay you your salary when i come of age that is if i am able now what money have you three pounds fifteen shillings and sevenpencehalfpenny not enough to take me down to the guardship when i have paid my bill at the tavern then my good fellow go and pay it immediately and come back with all possible speed the prompt obedience that he gave to my first order augured well for his attention on his return i addressed him seriously to this effect my friend you shall share with me to the last shilling but believe me my position is as dangerous as it is unnatural it is full of difficulty and requires not only conduct but courage i have a parent that either dares not or from some sinister motive will not own me and i fear me much that i have a halfbrother that i know is pursuing me with the assassins knife whilst i am pursuing him with the vengeance of the law it is either the death of the hunted dog for me or of the felons scaffold for him the event is in the hand of god we must be vigilant for my peril is great my implacable enemy is leagued with some of the worst miscreants of this vast resort of villainy he knows all the labyrinths of this babel of iniquity and the fraternal steel may be in my bosom even amidst the hum of multitudes that man has a strong motive for my death and to personify me afterwards already has he stolen my vouchers and my certificates the mystery to me appears almost inscrutable but his inducements to destroy me are obvious enough i think that i am tolerably safe here though i am equally sure that i am watched here is money go now and purchase two brace of serviceable pistols and a couple of stout swordcanes we will be prepared for the worst of course you will sleep here and hereafter always take up your abode in whatever place i may be as you return you must find in some quiet street an unobtrusive tailorhe must not have a shopbring him with you i must put you in livery after all why if so be you must i suppose you mustim off pigtop did his commissions well he returned with the arms and the tailor i hope said he you wont want me to wear this livery long not long i hope my friend said i addressing the man of measures this gentleman lately in the navy has had recently a very serious turn he is profoundly repentant of the wickedness of his past lifehe has had a callhe has listened to it it is not unlikely that he may shortly take out a licence to preach make him a suit of sadcoloured clothes not cut out after the vanities of the world your own would not serve for a bad model you go to meeting i presume i have received gracei eschew the steeplehousei receive the blessed crumbs of the word that fall from the lips of that light of salvation the reverend mr obadiah longspinner a holy and a good man doubtless would that we were all like him but our time will comeyes our time will come as is the outward man of the reverend mr obadiah longspinner so would my friend have his outward manverily and his inward alsoimproved unto sanctity the devout tailor snuffled out amen and did his office whilst pigtops clothes were preparing he was not idle he procured all the requisites for travelling and i sent him on a fruitless mission to discover the residence of the brandons he was told by the neighbours that a year back they had all emigrated to canada everything seemed to favour the machinations of my enemy and to prevent my gaining any clue by which to trace him out or the object of my search however i had one chance leftan interview with the superb mrs causand that lady that joshua had so kindly bestowed upon me for a mother in three days behold us in private lodgings the reverend mr pigtop looking as sour as any canting methodist in barebones parliament and quite reconciled to the singularly starch figure that he presented there was certainly a sad discrepancy between his dress and his discourse however it was a good travelling disguise and very serviceable to a petty officer breaking his leave of absence with my health perfectly recovered dressed with the greatest precision and with a beating heart i went to call upon mrs causand on her all my hopes rested i knew that as a schoolboy she was extremely fond of me and i really loved her as much as i admired her i had never before visited her and was consequently totally ignorant of the style in which she lived i found the house which she inhabited for i always carefully preserved her address to be one of those which faced hyde park i was rather chilled as i observed its quiet aristocratic appearance the porter told me that if i would walk into the adjoining parlour and favour him with my name he would go up immediately she was alone and announce me chapter sixty five ralph finding himself in pleasant places prepareth a lovespeech which is not uttered in this chapterralph describeth only in about five minutes the servant returned bowed and led the way he stepped up quietly and slowly there was an awe in his deportment that chilled me he opened the door of the drawingroom with extreme caution and gentleness bowed and closed it upon me as i stood near the threshold the last low tones of some plaintive and soothing melody sung in a tone much more subdued than that of common conversation died faintly away to the vibrating of a chord of the harp and a youthful figure bathed in a misty light from the window recess rose and moving silently across the room without once casting her eyes upon myself disappeared through a door parallel to the one by which i had entered whilst i remain in the darker portion of this saloon it is necessary for me to describe it i could not have imagined such a combination of taste and luxury at first i was almost overpowered by the too genial warmth of the apartment and the aromatic and roseimbued odours that filled it i trod on and my step sank into a yielding carpet which seemed to be elastic under my feet and which glowed with a thousand never fading though mimic flowers the apartment was not crowded though i saw candelabra vases and sidetables of the purest marble supported upon massive gilt pedestals in all this there was nothing singularit was the work of the upholsterer but the beautiful arrangement was the work of a presiding taste at the further end of this superb room stood two fluted and gilded pilasters and two pillars of the corinthian order the capitals of which reached the ceiling but they were not equidistant from each other the space from the pilaster to the pillar on either side being much less than that between the two pillars between the two former there were placed statues of the purest marble what fabled god or goddess they were sculptured to represent i know not i only felt that they personified male and female beauty i was too agitated to permit myself to notice them accurately between this screen of pillars and statues hung two distinct sets of drapery the one of massive and crimson silk curtains entirely opaque by their richness and their weight of texture that drew up and aside with golden cords the other of a muslin almost transparent how managed i had no time to examine when the draperies fell in their gorgeous and graceful folds to the ground they made of the saloon two parts and the division that embraced the windows had then all the privacy of a secluded apartment when the curtains were let fall thus intercepting the light from the bayed windows there was still sufficient from the three sashwindows on the left of this large apartment to give splendour to what would then become the inner room the heavy draperies that hung between the pillars were drawn up but the light muslin was dropped even with the rich turkey carpet through which i caught but a dim and glowing view of the recess it was as nearly as i can recollect about three oclock in the afternoon and the sun just dallying with the top of the trees in the distant kensington gardens sent his level beams directly through the large windows and the orangetrees and exotics that were placed about them i advanced to the screen and when close upon it i perceived the figure though but faintly of mrs causand reclining upon a couch i pausedi do not think on account of the distribution of the light that she could have seen me through the veil that intervened between us i dared not break through it without a summons and there i stood for two unpleasant minutes endeavouring to imagine of what nature my reception would be and whether a lady surrounded by so much magnificence would listen to the appeal of her former petplayfellow at this time it was the fashion in full dress to show the whole of the arm bare to the shoulder at length from out of the mass of rich shawls there was lifted the white rounded exquisitively shaped though somewhat large arm of the lady beckoning me to enter but sound there was none she is delighted to play the empress said i as i pushed aside the curtain and stood before her in her odoriferous sanctum verily in the pride of her beauty she never looked more beautiful she was in full dressand as i surveyed her in mute admiration and my mind was busy at once with the past and the present i pronounced her improved since i had last seen her for i could perceive no difference in her countenance except that her rounded and classic cheek glowed with a ruddier hue and her eyes sparkled with a more restless fire i stood before her at the foot of the couch and my heart confessed that the perfection of womanly beauty lay beneath my wondering eyes but a beauty which if in smiles would rather madden with voluptuousness than subdue with tenderness and if in repose seemed to command worship more than solicit affection as i stood mutely there i looked into her regal countenance for some encouragement to speaki saw none i then strove to read there the sentiment then passing in her mind and to my confusion to my dismay it seemed to me that she was endeavouring to conquer in her countenance the expression of pain i watched intentlyi was not deceiveda sudden convulsion passed over her features succeeded by the paleness of an instant and then a gush of tearsi was moved almost to weeping yet dared not advance her tears were hurried off instantly and then again her dear smile of former days sunned up her countenance into something heavenly chapter sixty six ralph beginneth a conversation totally beyond his comprehension and yet comprehendeth more than the conversation is meant to conveyhe feeleth some inclination towards lovemaking but checketh himself valiantly my own brave ralph said she extending to me both her hands your schoolboy lover said i an immense weight of anxiety removed from my mind as i kissed her jewelled fingers hush ralph such words are vanitiesbut ask me not why oh my dear boy make the most of this visit i will i willhow beautiful you are how very very beautiful am ii rejoice to hear you say so ralph speak to me as my own devoted my more than loved friendby all the affection that i have lavished on you speak to me truly do you dearest ralph see no alteration in me a little said i smiling triumphantly a very little for

days and weeks nay months before stand from me and let me look at youyou ralph are also much very much improvedperhaps there is a little too much cast of thought upon your browthat thought is a sad wrinkle makerbut ralph you are not well dressed but come and sit by me now there on that low footstool i always loved to play thus with your pretty curlsi wish that they were a shade darker as you have grown so manly it would have been as well truly as i look into the ingenuous brightness of your countenance the joys of past happy hours seem to wing themselves back and whisper to me that word so little understoodhappiness but ralph we will be alone together for this day at leastyou shall dine with me herewe will have no interruptionyou shall tell me all your deeds of armsand you naughty boy of love also reach that bell and ring itbut gently i obeyed and the same handsome young lady whom i had before seen answered the silver summons she glided in and stooped over to mrs causand as she lay on the couch and their short conference was in whispers as she retired i was rather puzzled by the deep sorrow on her countenance and the unfeigned look of pity with which she regarded her mistress or her friend when we were again alone i resumed my low seat and was growing rather passionate over one of her beautiful hands when looking down apparently much pleased with these silly endearments she said yes ralph make the most of it hand and heart all all are yours for the little space that they will be mine strange and disloyal thoughts began their turmoil in my bosom and speculation was busy and prospects of vanity began to dance before my eyes old enough to be my mother what then mother the thought brought with it the black train of ideas of which daunton was the demoniac leader he had asserted that the superb woman before me might claim from me the affection of a son i then felt most strongly that i was not there to play any ridiculous part the protestations that i was about to utter died on my lipsi spake not but pressed the hand that i held to my heart now ralph said mrs causand relate to me all the wonders that you have encounteredspeak lowlyand she threw a white and very thin handkerchief over her face but my dear madam why may i not gaze upon the countenance that you know is very dear to me and this setting sunhow glorious do you know that at his rising and his setting i have often thought of you pray come to the window and look upon it before it is quite hid among the trees ralph by all the love that i bore your mother by the affection

over the region of her heart the shock it gave me was electricthat heart trembled beneath her bosom rapidly as flutter the wings of the dying birdthen pausedthen went on i looked into her face and saw again the instant and momentary pallor that had surprised me so much on my first entrance the paroxysm was as short as it was violent and her features again returned to their usual placidity of majestic beauty you know it all now ralphthe least motion sets my heart in this unaccountable furyandalas alas every attack is more acute than the last they tell me that i am dyingi cannot believe it i cannot even comprehend it i have none of the symptoms of death upon me everything around me breathes of health and happinessyou alone were wanting to complete the sceneyou are herenono i will not

to me impossiblebut still the youngest of us cannot always escapehoping trusting relying on the best we should be prepared for the worst but i am not prepared she exclaimed with a fierce energy that breathed defiance and then relapsing into a profound melancholy she mournfully continuedand i cannot prepare myself have you spoken to a clergyman said i not knowing exactly what else to say is not this some book of divine consolation i took it up it was the popular novel of the day entitled the rising sun what a profound mockery for a deathbed i tell you my dear ralph that you must not agitate me talk of anything but my approaching deathfor know that i am resolved not to die tomorrow there will be a consultation over my case of the very first of the medical faculty in the world ralph do not you league together with the rest of the world and condemn me to an untimely death untimely indeed she had now evidently talked too much she closed her eyes and seemed to enjoy a peaceful and refreshing slumber i sat by and watched her was i then in a sickchamberwas that personification of beauty doomed i looked round and pronounced it incredible i gazed upon the recumbent figure before me so still so living and yet so deathlike and moralised upon the utter deception of appearances at length she awoke apparently much reanimated my dear ralph said she why are you not in mourning i understand youand i perceive that you are now in black but i must not disturb youyet if i dared i would ask you one questionoh in pity answer itwas she my mother does death absolve us from our oaths i am not dear lady casuist enough to answer you that question but do you know that i have become a desperate character lately i write myself man and will prove the authenticity of the signature with my life i have renounced my professionevery pursuit every calling every thoughtthat may stand between me and the development of the mystery of my birth it is the sole purpose of my lifethe whole devotion of my existence ralpha foolish onejust now bide the course of events i will notif i can control them through this detestable mystery i have been insulted revileda wretch has had the hardihood the turpitude to brand both you and meme as the baseborn child and you as the ignominious parent who who who a palefaced handsome short smoothworded villain with a voice that i now recognise for the first timea cowarda swindler that calls himself undoubtedly among other aliases stop ralph in misery and for the first time she sat upright on her couch the crisis of a whole life is at handi must go through it if i die on the spotring again for miss tremayne the gentle and quiet lady was soon at mrs causands side there was a little whispering passed between them some medicines put on the small worktable near the head of the couch and finally a tolerably large packet of papers she then cautioned mrs causand most emphatically to keep herself tranquil and bowing to me slightly glided out of the room chapter sixty seven the veil is fast dropping from before ralphs mysterious parentage strange disclosures and much good evidence that this is a very bad worldralphs lovesymptoms are fast subsiding ralph said the lady when we were again alone i have through the whole of my life always detested scenes and to the utmost of my power ever repelled all violent emotions i am not now going to give you a history of my lifeto make my confessions and ask pardon of you and god and then dienonsense but i must say that your fate has been somewhat strangely connected with my own i acknowledge to you at once that i am a fallen womanbut as i never had the beauty so i never had the repentance of a magdalen i fell to one of the greatest upon the earth i still think that it was a glorious fate i know that you are going to wound me deeply i will take it meekly may it be in some measure looked upon as a small expiation for my one great error but spare me as long as you are able the name of this person you have described with such bitternessit may not after all be he who has been almost the only bitterness that has yet poisoned my cup of a too pleasurable existencetis pleasurable alas until even in this my eleventh hour tell me all and then i shall be able to judge how much it may be my duty to reveal to you it was a fine study that of observing the gradual emotion of this worldly and magnificent woman as i proceeded with my eventful tale i took it up only at that period when joshua daunton first made his application to me to be allowed to enter the eos the beginning of my narrative fell coldly upon her and her features were strung up to that tension which i had often before observed in persons who were bracing up their nerves to undergo a dangerous surgical operation they were certainly not impassive for in the fixed eyes that glared upon me there was a strange restlessness though not of motion the first symptoms of emotion that i could perceive took place when i described the lash descending upon the shrinking shoulders of daunton she clasped her hands firmly together and upturned her eyes as if imploring heaven for mercy or entreating it for vengeance i perceived as i proceeded that i was gradually losing ground in her affectionsthat she was in spite of herself espousing the cause of my pledged enemy and when i told her of the defiance that i had received in the sickbay she murmured forth well done well done followed by a name that was not mine when i related to her the documents that he had shown me to convince me that he was no impostor she said ralph it is enoughit is of little consequence now what name you may give him he is my son and my halfbrother oh no no young sir disgraced as he has been a nobler blood than that of rattlin flows in his veins degraded disgraced as he is neither on the side of the father nor of the mother need he blush for his parentage but you are his sworn enemyi can now listen more calmly to what you have to say but graceless as he is he should not have denied his own mother mrs causand said i in a tone of voice more cold than any with which i had yet addressed her it seems that you have and that most unreasonably too taken part against me in no point have i sinned against you or yours i have all along been the attacked the aggrieved party i will no longer offend your ears or wring your heart by a recapitulation of your sons delinquencies he has done me much wrong he is contemplating moreonly place me in a situation to do myself justice and silence on the past shall seal my lips for ever but know that he has stolen all my documents and intends passing himself to whomever may be my father as his legitimate son as myself this must not befoolish mad wicked boy that i his mother must stand up his accuser must act against him as his enemy but i have long ago discarded himalmost cursed him oh ralph ralph had he been but like youbut from his youth upwards he has been inclined to wickednessno fortune could have supplied his extravagancehe has exhausted even a mothers love i refused him money and he stole my papersi never dreamt of the vile use that he intended to put them to spare me for a little while and i will let you know all but should you once get his neck under your heel oh tread lightly on my poor william she had evidently another and a most severe attack of her complaint which passed rapidly over like the rest but she now had for the first time in my observation recourse to her medicines when sufficiently recovered she continued ralph neither you nor any one else shall know my private history it is enough for you to understand that i was almost from infancy destined to associate with the greatest of the sterner sex early was i involved in this splendiddegradation the austere would call it though degradation i never held it to be even appearances were preserved for before my wretched son was born i was married to one of the pages of a german court who was sixty years of age and properly submissive and distant to the english ear this sounds like a confession of infamy let me not ralph endeavour to justify it to youi was taught otherwisenow if i could i would not regret it your father then an only son sometimes visited at the house of the person over whose establishment i presided andand mark me ralph injuriously as you must now think of me i presided over but one deride me not when i tell that to that distinguished personage i was chaste she paused and i thought that her voice faltered strangely and that the assertion died upon her lips and i made no reply i was by no means astonished at this detail i could only look upon her most anxiously and await her future disclosures i have she continued lived for the world and found it a glorious one the husband of my heart and the husband of ceremony have long both been dead i enjoy a competencynay much moreand yet they talk to me of dying tomorrow will decide upon my fate i have lived a good life according to my capabilitiesit is no delusionbut should the sentence of tomorrows consultation be fatal then the lawyer and the clergyman and why not today because it is ours ralph or rather yours well your mother was of good though not of exalted familythe daughter of a considerable freeholder in our neighbourhood she was the eldest of many children and the most beautiful born of all in the county her father sent her to london and she became thus for her station and the period over educated she foolishly preferred the fashionable and refined and luxurious service in a noblemans family to a noble independence in her honest fathers spacious house it was her mistake and her ruin ralph i loved your motheryou know itbut as a governess in the duke of es family i hated and feared her i dont think that she was more beautiful than i but hehe whom i will never mentionbegan to be of that opinionat least i trembled reginald rathelin loved her wooed her i entered with eagerness into his schemeshis success was my security miss daventry at first repulsed me but at length i overcame her repugnancemany ladies notwithstanding my ambiguous position awed by the rank of my protector received mewe became friends the beautiful governess elopedi managed everythingthey were married i was myself a witness of the ceremony thank god i exclaimed fervently reginald was wild and dissipated poor and unprincipledhe cajoled his wife and suffered her again to return to her menial station in the dukes family in due time there was another journey necessary it was when you were born at reading a little while and yet a little while was the constant plea of the now solicited husband and i will own you my dear elizabeth and boast of you before all the world my poor mother about two years after this marriage sir luke the father of reginald fell ill and the neglect of the husband became only something a little short of actual desertion your mother had a proud as well as a loving spirit she wrote to the father of reginaldshe interested the duke in her favourshe was now as anxious for publicity as concealment but the expectant heir defied us all he confessed himself a villain and avowed that he had entrapped your mother by a fictitious marriage and he my fatherbut you you her friend he deceived me also he declared the man who pretended to perform the marriage ceremony was not in holy orders he dared us to prove it his father bred up in prejudice of birth and family did not urge the son to do justice to your mother but satisfied his conscience by providing very amply for yourself he first took credit to himself for thus having done his duty then the sacrament and died your father now sir reginald in due time proposed for the richest heiress in the three adjacent counties and was rejected with scorn we made a strong party against himthe seat of his ancestors became hateful to himhe went abroad his princely mansion was locked uphis estates left to the management of a grinding steward and the world utterly forgot the selfcreated alien from his country then alas after all i am illegitimate and if you werebut methinks that you are now feeling more for yourself than your mother oh no no tell me of her after this expose she lived some few years respected in the dukes family but she changed her namehome to her fathers she would never gono tidings ever reached her of the man she looked upon as her seducer it must be confessed however that he took great care of his childhe appointed agents to watch over your welfare though i firmly believe that he never saw you in his life i think that he once made the attempt when i was at roots school but before i was brought to him his conscience smote him and he fled like a craven from his only and injured son most probably rumour said that he had made several visits to england under a strict incognito but i must pausethe evening is fast waninglet me repose a little and then we will have lights and dinner she fell back upon her couch and appeared again to slumber chapter sixty eight ralph thinks seriously about changing his namegets a little unwilling justice done to himself and gains much informationthe whole wound up suddenly and sorrowfully it was nearly dark as i sat for more than half an hour by the side of the impenitent beauty i could not conceive that she was in any danger whilst she discoursed with me so fully her voice was firm though not loud and were it not for a short and sudden check sometimes in the middle of a word i should say that i never before heard her converse more fluently or more musically whilst she yet reclined the servants brought in lights and made preparations for our little dinner a small table being laid close to mrs causands couch when this exquisite repast was ready and miss tremayne made her appearance mrs causand rose apparently much renovated she looked almost happy without assistance she walked from her sofa and took her place at the table there fanny said she quite triumphantlyand not a single attack this dear ralph has surely brought health with him yesterday this exertion would have killed me do not however said the lady try yourself too much we dined cheerfully she seemed to have forgotten her son and i my muchinjured mother after the dinner was concluded and miss tremayne had retired and my hostess had returned to her sofa she sent for her writingdesk and then proceeded with her narrative your mother my dear ralph yearned for your society she had saved a considerable sum of moneyshe wished for a home to procure which she married that little ugly learned frenchman cherfeuilbut even that she did not do until it was currently reported and generally believed that your father was dead i admire the delicacy of the scruplei honour her for it sip your wine ralphyoull find it excellenti will indulge in one glass let dr hewings say what he willto your health my little lover and may i soon hail you as sir ralph rathelin how is it possible you shall hear we were talking about your good mother when she had married this cherfeuil who was the french assistant at a large school she found out the agents to whom you were entrusted and soon arranged with them that you should be domesticated under her own roofyou were removed to stickenham and she and you were happy oh how happy well you know it was in those happy days that i had first the pleasure of forming an acquaintance with the inimitable ralph rattlin but why rattlinmy name must be either daventry or rathelin rathelin of a suretyit was first of all corrupted to rattlin by that topmost of all topsawyers joe brandonit having thus been so established for many reasons concealment among the rest your mother thought it best for you to retain it now ralph mark thisabout eight or rather seven months ago i took a short trip to my native country in germany never was my health more redundant i left your mother prosperous and happy and beautiful as evershe had heard of you and heard much in your favour though you never once condescended to write to any one of us whilst i was inyour father returned a changed manchanged in everything even in religion he had turned penitent and a catholic and so had his travelling companion the very man who had married him to your sweet mother then he was in holy orders he was god of infinite justice i thank you the reverend mr thomas came here to my very house when i was away with a long and repentant letter from his patronfull of inquiries for yourself and for your mother lady rathelin where is that inestimable letter oh where said the again agonised mrs causand ralph much mischief was done in that absencemy boy my lost william he whom you know as joshua daunton broke into his mothers house rifled my escritoir and carried off some of my most important documentsthat unread letter among the number but how know you its contents said i breathless with agitation by the tenor of these succeeding ones from sir reginald and his priest she opened her desk and gave me two letters from my father to her they were as she described them repentant and spoke most honourably and most fondly of my deceased motherpraying mrs causand most earnestly to tell him of the happiness and the whereabouts of his wife and you did of course no ralph i did notlook at the dates it was a fortnight after these arrived before i returned home i weep even now when i think of itthree days before i returned your mother had died almost suddenly ah true true said i mournfully but a sudden pang of agony seizing my inmost heart i suddenly started up and seizing her roughly by the hand i said sternly look me in the face madamdo you see any resemblance there to my poor poor mother oh very very greatbut why this violence because i now understand the villainy that caused her death your son murdered hersee in me her reproachful countenanceoh mrs causand you and yours have been the bane the ruin of me and mine what do you mean by those horrible words ralph beware or you will yourself commit a dastardly murder upon me even as you stand there mrs causand i will be calm i see it all with the first letter of sir reginald in his hand he went to stickenham and with the murderous intent strong in his black bosom he branded my mother with bigamy incensed the weak frenchman against her and in twentyfour hours did the mortal work that years of injustice and injury could not effect good god it must be soralph i do not ask you to forgive himbut pity his poor suffering motherhe has broken my heartnot ralph in the mystical but in the actual the physical sense in the very hour in which i returned home i found a warrant had been issued for his apprehension as a housebreaker and the stonyhearted reprobate had the cruelty to insult his mother by a letter glorying in the fact at the same time demanding a thousand pounds for his secrecy and the papers that he had stolen the shock was too much for me i had an attack a fiti know not whati fell senseless to the earthmy heart has never since beaten healthfully oh perhaps after all it would be a happiness for me to diepoor elizabethmy more than sister my friend but why do i waste my time here said i starting up and seizing my hat the reptile is at work where lives sir reginaldmy demon like double may be there before me he may personate me long enough to kill my father and rifle his hoards i must awaybut ere i go know that with these abstracted papers he sought me in the west indies cheated me out of my name on my return to england and finally waylaid and attempted with a low accomplice to assassinate me on my return from stickenham god of heaven let me diehe could never have been son of minelet me know the horrid particulars nononoi must awayor more murders will be perpetrated stop ralph a little momentdo not go unprovided take these and thesehe stole not all the documentslet me also give my testimony under my own hand of your identity it may be of infinite service to you she then wrote a short letter to sir reginald describing accurately my present appearance and vouching that i and none other was the identical ralph rattlin who was nursed by the brandons and born at reading take this ralph and show it to sir reginald i only ask one thing spare the lifeonly the lifeof that unfortunate boyand in his spare minefor i am unprepared to die the mercy that he showed my mother i had proceeded no further in my cruel speech when a great noise was heard at the door and two roughlooking bow street officers attended by the whole household rushed into the room they advanced towards the upper end of this elegant sanctum mrs causand sprang up from her sofa and standing in all the majesty of her beauty sternly demanded what means this indignity beg your ladyships pardon sorry to intrudedutynever shy that you know maamonly a searchwarrant for one joshua daunton alias sneaking willie alias whitefaced stop no more of this ribaldryyou see he is not herei know nothing concerning himof what is he accused of forgery housebreaking and with an accomplice of an attempt to murder a young gentleman a naval officer of the name of ralph rattlin mrs causand turned to me sorrowfully and exclaimed oh ralph was this well done of you her fortitude her sudden accession of physical strength seemed to desert her at once and she who just before stood forth the undaunted heroine now sank upon her couch the crushed invalid at length she murmured forth feebly ralph rid me of these fellows i soon effected this i told them that i was the culprits principal accuser that i was assured he was not only not within the house but i verily believed many miles distant they believed me and respectfully enough retired miss tremayne the companion and nurse of the invalid now with myself stood over her she had another attack upon the region of her heart and it was so long before she rallied that we thought the fatal moment had arrived when she could again breathe freely her colour did not as formerly return to her cheeks they wore an intense and transparent whiteness at once awful and beautiful yet she spoke calmly and collectedly i entreated to be permitted to departmy intercessions were seconded by the young lady but the now cold hand of mrs causand clasped mine so tightly and the expression of her eyes was so imploring that i could not rudely break away from her but a few short minutes she exclaimed and then fare you well i feel worse than i ever yet rememberand very cold it is not now the complaint that has cast me down upon a sickbed that seems invading the very principle of lifea chilly faintness is coming over meyet i dare not lay my head upon my pillow lest i never from thence lift it again ralph here is a warmth in your young bloodsupport me i cradled her head upon my shoulder and whispered to miss tremayne who immediately retired to procure the speedy attendance of the physician are we alone ralph said the shuddering lady with her eyes firmly closed i have a horrid presentiment that my hour is approaching everything is so still around and within me every sensation seems deserting me rapidly but oneand that is a mothers feeling you will leave me here to die amongst menials and strangers miss tremayne said i soothingly is but a hired companion engaged only since the occurrence of these attacks yes you will desert me to theseand for what god of retributionto hunt down the life of my only son will you will you ralph do this overcruel thing he has attempted minehe still seeks it let us talk let us think of other matters compose your mind with religious thoughts your strength will rally during the night tomorrow comes hope the consultation of physicians and with gods good blessings life and health to hear to know that he is to die the death of the felon promise me to forego your purpose or let me die first i have sworn over the grave of my mother that the laws shall decide this matter between us if he escape i forgive him and may god forgive him too and must it come to this she sobbed forth in the bitterness of her anguish whilst the tears streamed down her cheeks from her closed eyelids will this cruel youth at length extort the horrible confessionit must be soone pangand it will be over let me forego your supportlay me gently on the pillow for you will loathe me a little while ago and i told you i had been faithful to himit was a bitter falsehoodknow that my son my abandoned william is also the son of your fathersay will his blood now be upon your hands tell me beautiful cause of all our miseries does your miserable offspring know this yes said she very faintly yet he could seek my lifebaselybut no matter his blood shall never stain my handi will not seek himif he crosses my path i will avoid himi will even assist him to escape to some country where unknown he may by a regenerated life wipe out the dark catalogue of his crimes make his peace with man here and with his god hereafter will you do all this my generous my good my godlike ralph you and god be my witnesses she sprang up wildly from her apparent state of lethargy clasped me fervently in her arms blessed me repeatedly and then in the midst of her raptures she cried out oh ralph you have renewed my being you have given me long years of life and health and happiness you and here she uttered a loud shriek that reverberated through the mansion but it was cut short in the very midsta thrilling a horrible silence ensuedshe fell dead upon the couch i stood awestruck over the beautiful corpse as it lay placidly extended disfigured by no contortion but on the contrary a heavenly repose in the featuresa sad mockery of worldly vanity death had arrayed himself in the last imported parisian mode at that dying shriek in rushed the household headed by the physician and closely followed by the companion with the hired nurses methought that the doctor looked on this wreck of mortality with grim satisfaction i knew it said he slowly and doctor phillimore is nothing more than a solemn dunce i told him that she would not survive to be subjected to the consultation of the morrow and how happens it said he turning fiercely to the companion and the nurses that my patient was thus left alone with this stripling stripling sir said i young man let us not make the chamber of death a hall of contention tell me miss tremayne how comes my patient thus unattended or rather thus ill attended it was her own positive command said the young lady in a faltering voice ah she was always imperious always obstinate there must have been some exciting conversation between you sir turning to me and the lady did you say anything to vex or grieve her on the contrary she was expressing the most unbounded hope and happiness when she died and the name of god was not on her lips the prayer for pardon not in her heart when she was snatched away i shook my head well said he it is a solemn end and she was a wilful lady do you know miss tremayne if she has any relations livingthey should be sent for i know of none a person of distinction whose name i am not at liberty to mention sometimes visited her we had better send for her solicitor some other conversation took place which i hardly noticed the body was adjusted on the couch we left the room and the door was locked as i walked quietly almost stealthily home i felt stunned health and mortality death and life seemed so fearfully jumbled together that i almost doubted whether i was not traversing a city of spirits my achates stared at me when i described to him the late occurrences so you have at length discovered him said he i havea voice almost from the grave has imparted to me all that i wished to knowand something more i have sprung from a beautiful racebut we must not speak ill of kith and kin must we pigtop for certain not and so your father actually did send that old lord to look after you at your return from the west indies well that shows some affection for you at all events the fruits of which affection daunton is no doubt now reaping well let us go and cut his throat or rather turn him over to the hangman no pigtop i have promised his mother that i will not attempt his life but i have not humph let us to roost tomorrow at break of day we will be off for rathelin hall see that our arms are in order and now to what rest nature and good consciences will afford us chapter sixty nine mr pigtop believeth in ghosts and hath some trust in witches but none at all in lawyersa consultation after supper and after supper action early next morning mr pigtop and myself were seated in a postchaise making the best of our way towards the western extremity of england when we had arrived at exeter where we found it necessary to sleep in order to gain some little restoration from the fatigues of our incessant travelling we made up our minds to hire three horses and a groom and having very accurately ascertained the exact site of rathelin hall which was situated a few miles to the northeastward of barnstaple we arrived there towards the close of the day and put up at a very decent inn in an adjoining village the old and large house was distinctly visible notwithstanding the wellwooded park in which it was situated from the windows of our inn a conference with our host fully realised our worst fears he informed us that sir reginald was not expected to live many days that his whole deportment was very edifying and moreover that his dying hours were solaced and sweetened by the presence and the assiduities of his only and longdisowned but now acknowledged son ralph we moreover learned that this ralph came attended by a london attorney and that they with the priest thomas in the intervals between rest refection and prayer were actively employed in settling his sublunary affairs very much to the dissatisfaction of a mr seabright the family solicitor and landsteward of the estate where does mr seabright live was my question instantly why here sir to be sure in our town of antwick and mortally in dudgeon he has taken all this undoubtedly and with justice was my reply so faithful a servant who has for so many years had the sole management of the rathelin affairs should not be cast off so slightly give us as good a supper landlord as your skill and antwick can produce and let us have covers for three send your porter down to mr seabrightbut i had better write a note so i sent to him a polite invitation to sup with us telling him that two strangers wished to see him on important business to all these proceedings pigtop demurred he was for the summary process of going before a magistrate next morning and taking out a warrant to apprehend joshua daunton on the capital charge for which he was pursued in london and thus at one blow wind up the affair but i held my promise to mrs causand to be sacred and determined to give him my fraternal enemy one chance of escaping pigtops repugnance however to the employment of a lawyer could not be overcome so not being able to obtain his consent i determined to try and do without it which my friend averred to be impossible at nine oclock precisely as the smoking dishes appeared so did the lawyer a sudden emotion was perceptible on his ironbound visage when his eyes first fell upon me of the nature of which i could form no idea mr pigtop bowed to him very stiffly and it was some time before the genuine cordiality of my manner could put mr seabright at his ease while we were at table i begged to decline giving him our names as i was fearful that the intelligence might travel to the hall and thus give some scope for further machinations on the part of joshua but as is too often the case we were prudent only by halves the groom that we had hired not being enjoined to secrecy had unhesitatingly told everyone belonging to the establishment our appellations the landlord and his household were much struck by the similarity of the name by which i still went rattlin and that of rathelin and thus whilst i was playing the cautious before mr seabright the news had already reached the hall and those most concerned to know it that two gentlemen a mr rattlin and a mr pigtop with their groom had put up at the three bells in the village and had sent for the lawyer when after supper we had carefully secured the privacy of our apartment amidst many nudges and objurgations from my former shipmate i proceeded to relate to the astonished solicitor who i was and what were my motives for appearing at that juncture in the neighbourhood i also told him of the personation of myself that i understood was then going on at the hall at the same time totally suppressing every other guilty circumstance of dauntons life when i had finished my recital i produced my documents and notwithstanding that he was almost breathless with wonder he confessed that he believed implicitly all my assertions and would assist me to recover my rights and disabuse my father to the utmost of his abilities you have lost much valuable time said he this impostor has now been domesticated some days with sir reginald i think with you that he has no ulterior views upon the title and the estates his object is present plunder and the inducing your father through the agency of that scoundrel london lawyer to make him sign such documents that everything that can be willed away will be made over to him we must tomorrow proceed in a body to the hall and take the villains by surprise i will now return home and prepare some necessary documents as this is a criminal matter i will also take care to have the attendance of an upright and clearseeing magistrate who will proceed with usnot certainly later than ten oclock to morrow he then took his leave with an air of much importance and more alacrity than i could have expected from a man of his years when pigtop and myself were left alone neither the first nor the second norwester of brandyandwater could arouse him from his sullen mood he told me frankly and in his own seaslang that he could not disintegrate the idea of a lawyer from that of the devil and that he was assured that neither i nor my cause would prosper if i permitted the interference of a landshark i was even obliged to assume a little the authority of a master in order to subdue his murmurings to convince his judgment i did not tryin which forbearance i displayed much wisdom we each retired to our respective room with less of cordiality than we had ever displayed since our unexpected reunion i had no sooner got to bed than i determined by a violent effort to sleep i had always a ready soporific at hand it was a repeating and rerepeating of a pious little ode by a late fashionable poet it seldom failed to produce somnolency at about the twelfth or thirteenth repetition i would recommend a similar prescription to the sleepless and i can assure them that there is much verse lately printed and by people who plume themselves no little upon it that need not be gone over more than twice at furthest excepting the person may have saint vitus dance and then a third time may be necessary i would specify some of these works were it at all necessary but the afflicted have only to ask at random for the last published volume of poems or to take up an annual either old or new and they may be dosed without the perpetration of a pun three times had i slept by the means of my ode and three times had i awaked by some horrible dream that fled my memory with my slumbers i could draw no omen from it for my mind could not bring it out sufficiently distinct to fix a single idea upon it however as i found my sleep so much more miserable than my watchfulness i got up and putting on a portion of my clothes began to promenade my room with a slow step and a very anxious mind i had made but few turns when my door was abruptly thrust open and pigtop stalked in fully dressed i cant sleep rattlin said he and tarnation glad am i to see that you cant caulk either a dutiful son you would be to be snoozing here and very likely at this very moment the rascals knife is hacking at your fathers weasand it is not yet twelve oclock and i saw from my window from whence i can see the hall plainly a strange dancing of light about the windows and you may take an old sailors word that something uncommons in the wind let us go and reconnoitre with all my heart any action is better than this wretched inactivity of suspense i will complete my dress and you in the meantime look to the pistols we were soon ready and sallied forth unperceived from the inn we had no purpose no ultimate views yet both pigtop and myself seemed fully to understand that we should be compelled into some desperate adventure i was going armed and by night like an assassin to seek the presence or at least to watch over the safety of a father i had never seen never loved and never respected the space that separated the abode of my father from the inn was soon passed and a little after midnight i stood within the gloomy and parklike enclosure that circumscribed the front of the large old mansion the lodge was a ruin the gates had long been thrown down and we stumbled over some of their remnants imbedded in the soil and matted to it with long and tangled grass i observed that there was a scaffolding over the front of the lodge but whether it were for the purpose of repairing or taking down i could not then discover as my companion and myself advanced to the front of the building we also observed that lofty as were its walls it was scaffolded to the very attics and some part of the roof of the right wing was already removed altogether a more comfortless a more dispiriting view could hardly have been presented and its disconsolateness was much increased by the dim and fitful light that a young moon gave at intervals upon gables casements and clumps of funereal yews and this as we stood before the portals said i to pigtop is my inheritancemine is it not a princely residence it looms like a county jail thats being turned into a private madhouse if so be as how witches werent against the law of the land this seems the very place for them do you believe in ghosts verily yes andno because i think that i see the ghosts of a hearse and four horses among those tall trees at that corner then pig we must be on the alertfor i see it too but the vision has assumed the everyday deception of a postchaise and four jeer as you will it is a hearse somebodys just losing the number of his mess it will take away a corpse tonight depend upon it that a postchaise pooh i can see the black plumes waving upon the horses heads andhark at the low deep moanings that seem to sweep by it that is not at all naturallet us go back i was never more resolved to go forward there is villainy hatching completing wrap your cloak closely about your countenance dont mistake the wind for groans nor the waving branches of cedartrees for hearseplumes but follow me whos afraid said pigtop his chattering teeth answered the question as i was prepared for everything i was not surprised to find the principal door open and the hall filled with ironbound cases and several platechests as we stepped into the midst of these completely muffled in our cloaks a fellow came and whispered to us is all ready hush said i oh no fearthey are at prayers in sir reginalds bedroomhe is going fasthe is restlesshe cannot sleep where are the servants snoring in their nests and who is with sir reginald nobody but the priest and his son master ralphwithout the lawyer has gone up since he saw all right about the chaise but am i on the right lay surely joshua daunton and i enoughyoure up to trapso lend us a hand and let us take the swag to the shaythough swag it aint for its joshs by deed of law sir reginald signs and seals tonight as they say he cant live over tomorrow no there is no occasion to stir yet which is the way to sir reginalds room i must speak one word to joshua before we start i know the countersignit will bring him out to me in a moment i would advise you in the meantime just to step to the chaise and see all right and bring it up nearer the door quietlymind quietly for these boxes are damned heavy youre right there said the accomplice and departed on his errand after previously showing me the staircase that led to the apartment of my sick father when the rascals steps were no longer heard now pigtop said i show your pluck help me to lock and bar the halldoorgoodso one bloodhound is disposed of he dare not make a noise lest he should rouse the establishment now follow mebut hark ye no murder the reptiles life must be spared pigtop made no answer but pointed to his scarred and disfigured lip with a truly ferocious grin it is necessary for the fully understanding of the catastrophe that ensued that i describe the site of the old building in which such startling events were passing the front approach was level from the road but on the back there was a precipitous and rugged and rocky descent up to the very buttresses that supported the old wallsnot certainly so great or so dangerous as to be called a precipice for on the extreme right wing of the rear of the house it was no more than a gentle inclination of the soil deepening rapidly towards the left and there directly under the extremity of that wing assuming the appearance of a vast chasm through the bottom of which a brawling stream chafed the pointed stones on its way to the adjacent sea sir reginalds sleepingroom was a large tapestried apartment on the firstfloor the windows of which occupied the extreme of the left wing of the house and was directly over the deepest part of the chasm which i have described all this part of the mansion was scaffolded also the ends of the poles having what appeared to be but a very precarious insertion on the projections of the rocks below it had been the intention of sir reginald thoroughly to repair his mansion but falling sick and in low spirits he had ordered the preparations to be delayed the scaffolding had been standing through the whole of the previous winter and the poles and more especially the ropes that bound them to the crosspiece had already gone through several stages of decay chapter seventy conclusion my associate and myself advanced stealthily and noiselessly up the staircase we met no one the profoundest security seemed to reign everywhere favoured by the dark shadows that hung around us we advanced to the door that was nearly wide open and we then had a full view of everything within the picture was solemn seated in a very highbacked elaboratelycarved and gothic chair supported on all sides by pillows sat the attenuated figure of my father i gazed upon him with an eager curiosity mingled with awe his countenance was long and ghastlythere was no beauty in it its principal expression was terror it was evident that his days were numbered i looked upon him intently i challenged my heart for affection and it made no answer directly before my father was placed a table covered with a rich and goldembroidered cloth bordered with heavy gold fringe upon which stood four tall wax candles surrounding a mimic altar surmounted by an ebony crucifix his chaplain dressed in popish canonicals was mumbling forth some form of prayer and a splendidlyilluminated missal lay open before him there was also on the table a small marble basin of water and a curiously inlaid box filled with bonesrelics no doubtimbued with the spirit of miracleworking the priest was perhaps performing a private midnight mass the fitful attention that sir reginald gave to this office was painful to contemplate his mind was evidently wandering and he could bring himself to attend only at intervals at another table a little removed from the one i have described sat the person of the london attorney he had also two lights and he was most busily employed in turning over and indexing various folios of parchment but i have yet to describe the other figurethe to me loathsome person of my illegitimate halfbrother he was on his knees mumbling forth the responses and joining in the prayers of the priest he was paler and thinner than usual he looked however perfectly gentlemanly and was scrupulously welldressed as yet i had not heard the voice of sir reginald his lips moved at some of the responses that the two made audibly but sound there was none at length when there was a total cessation of the voices of the other and a silence so great in that vast apartment that the rustling of the lawyers parchments was distinctly heard even where i stood even this hardened wretch seemed to feel the general awe of the moment and ceased to disturb the tomblike silence in the midst of this the prematurelyold sir reginald suddenly lifted up his voice and exclaimed loudly in a tone of the most bitter anguish lord jesu have mercy upon me the vast and ancient room echoed dolorously with the heartbroken supplication it was the first time that my fathers voice fell upon my ear it was so plaintive so imbued with wretchedness that the feeling of resentment which i take shame to myself i had long suffered in my bosom melted away at once and a strange tenderness came over me i could have flung myself upon his bosom and wept i felt that my mothers wrongs had been avenged even as it was with all the secrecy that i had then thought it my interest to preserve i could not refrain in a subdued yet earnest tone from responding to his broken ejaculation from the very bottom of my heart amen a start of surprise and terror as my hollow response reached the ears of all then and there assembled followed my filial indiscretion each looked at the other with a glance that plainly asked was the voice thine and each in reply shook his head a miracle exclaimed the priest the sinners supplication has been heard let us pray during this solemn scene events of a very different description were taking place at the inn which we had just clandestinely left our exit had been noticed the landlord was called up he became seriously alarmed the more especially when the direction that we had taken had been ascertained he immediately concluded that we had gone to rathelin hall to commit a burglary or perhaps a murder he summoned to his aid the constables of the village called up the magistrate and the lawyer mr seabright and with a whole posse of attendants proceeded to the rescue we will conduct them to the door that pigtop and myself had secured when we barred out dauntons accomplice and there leaving them return to the sickchamber after the reverend gentleman had concluded his extempore prayer but few of the sentences of which reached our place of concealment sir reginald said my friends the little business that we have to do tonight had better be done speedily i feel unusually depressed i hope that it is not the hand of death that is pressing so heavily upon me i would live a little while longerbut the will of god the redeemer of our sins be done bring the papers herei will sign them my friend brown and you my poor and too long neglected ralph addressing joshua i trust to your integrity in all this matter for not only am i averse to but just now incapable of business but my dear ralph before we do this irrevocable deed kneel down and receive a repentant fathers blessing and hear that father ask with a contrite heart pardon of his son and of his god the parchments were brought and placed before the baronet by the assiduous lawyer and the sonfor son to sir reginald he really was with looks of the most devout humility and his eyes streaming with hypocritical tears knelt reverently down at the feet of the trembling and diseasestricken parent his feeble hands are outstretched over the inclined head of the impostor his lips partthisthisi cannot bearso before a single word falls from our common father i rush forward and kneeling down beside my assassinbrother exclaim in all the agony of wretchedness and the spirit of a newlyborn affection bless me even me also o my fatherhe has taken away my birthright and behold he would take away my blessing also bless even me ralph rattlin by all thats damnable screamed forth the selfconvicted impostor thus this apparently imprudent and rash step was productive to me of more service than could have been hoped from the deepestlaid plan in a moment we were on our feet and our hands on each others throats this sudden act seemed miraculously to invigorate our father he rose from his seat and standing to the full height of his tall and gaunt figure placing his bony hand heavily on my shoulder and looking me fixedly in the face said if thou art ralph rathelin who then is this the baseborn of your paramour and with a sudden energy i hurled him from me and he lay bruised and crouching beneath the large oriel window at the extremity of the room it was unseemly said and cruelly done said the baronet sorrowfully oh but now my sins are remembered upon me i cast my sons loose upon the face of the earth and in my dying hour they come and struggle together for their lives before my eyes verily am i punished my crime is visited heavily upon me the other parties in the room were little less affected with various emotions the london attorney was making rapidly for the door when he was met by the advancing pigtop who thrust him again into the apartment and then boldly faced the priestthe latter still in his canonicals the former dressed as a sectarian preacher their antipathy was mutual and instantaneous but ere the really reverend gentleman could begin some pious objurgation at this apparent interference with his communicant pigtop indulged in one of the heaviest oaths that vulgarity and anger together ever concocted and straightway went and seized the crouching joshua and lugged him before the agonised father exclaiming warrants out against him sir reginald for burglary forgery and assassinationhe is my prisoner the craven had not a word to sayhis knees knocked togetherhe was a pitiable object of a terrorstricken wretch sir reginald already began to look down upon him with contempt and my heart bounded within me when i already found him leaning parentally on my shoulder speak trembleris this person the veritable ralph rathelin pity me pardon me and i will confess all splits said the attorney and vanished through the now unguarded door speak this gentleman is your lawful sonbut i also no moreescapethere is goldescapehide yourself from the eye of man for ever no said pigtop giving him a remorseless shake do you see this scar let him go instantly pigtopobey mei have promised his motherit is sacred for my sake said sir reginald at this instant the steward rushed in partly dressed crying out sir reginald sir reginald the constables and the magistrates have broken down the halldoor and are now coming upstairs to arrest the housebreakersthey have packed up all the plate and it lies in the hall ready to be carried off my god it is too late said sir reginald wringing his hands no said i let him escape by the window be so good sir said i to the priest to secure the doorwe shall gain time hold it as long as you can against all intruders the scaffolding will enable the culprit to reach the ground with comparatively little danger the priest obeyed and not only fastened the door but also barricaded it with furniture now pigtop said i if you wish to preserve my friendship assist this poor wretch to escapehe is paralysed with his abject fears come sir addressing joshua you will certainly be hung if you dont exert yourself hell be hung yet said pigtop sulkily but i am an old sailor and will obey ordersnevertheless i know that i shall live to see him hung come along sirrah between us we led him to the window we then thrust him out and he stood shivering upon the crossboarding of the scaffolding level with the windowsills slide down the poles and run said iand pigtop together i cant said he shuddering the chasm is awfully deep you must or die the death of the felon oh what shall i do cast off the lashing just above you said pigtop pass it over the crosspiece over your head make a running noose put it under your arms and keep the other end of the rope in your hand you may either cling to the pole with your legs as you like or notfor then you can lower yourself down at your ease as comfortably as if you were taking a nap come away pigtopshut the window close the shuttersthe constables are upon us i exclaimed this was done immediately and thus was the immaculate joshua shut out from all view as the attacks on the door of the apartment became more energetic and we concluded that joshua was now safe we were going to give the authorities entrance when we heard a dreadful crash on the outside of the window the lubbers gone by the run by god said pigtop hell escape hanging after all let us hope in mercy not said sir reginald shuddering i trust it is not so i hear no scream no shriek i am sure by the sound that it was the toppling down of the boards he has most likely displaced some of them in his descent shall we admit sir reginald the people who are thundering at the door not yet let there be no appearance of disorderremove these pointing to the small altar and crucifixand would it not be as well my friend to divest yourself of those holy vestments they are irritating to heretical eyes assist me sir to my chair i placed him respectfully nearly in the position in which i first discovered him all vestiges of the catholic religion were carefully removed and the door at last thrown open the crowd entered hurried explanations ensued but we could not conceal from the magistrate that a robbery had been planned and nearly effected and that the real culprits for whom at first pigtop and i had been mistaken had escaped at length the master of the inn suggested that perhaps they had passed out of the window and might be still upon the boarding or the scaffolding the shutters were hastily thrown openand sight of horrors joshua daunton was discovered hanging by the neckdead sir reginald gazed for some moments in speechless terror on the horrible spectacle and then fell back in a deathlike swoon the body was brought in and every attempt at resuscitation was useless he had died and was judged may he have found pardon some thought that he had hung himself intentionally so completely had the noose clasped his neck others among whom were pigtop thought differently the old sailor was of opinion from the broken boards that had given way beneath his feet that when he had got the noose below his chin and no lower his footing or the scaffolding had failed him and that letting go the other end of the rope it had taken a half hitch and thus jammed upon the crosspole however the operation was brought about he was exceeding well hung and the drop represented to perfection as pigtop had prophesied the postchaise in the shrubbery was turned into a hearse in order to convey his body to the inn for the coroners inquest i knew i should live to see him hung said pigtop doggedly as he bade me goodnight when we both turned into our respective rooms for the night in the house of my father contrary to all expectations the shock instead of destroying seemed to have the effect of causing sir reginald to rally he lived for six months after became fully satisfied of my identity and just as he was beginning to taste of happiness in the duty and affection of his son he died having first taken every legal precaution to secure me the quiet possession of my large inheritance my grief at his decease was neither violent nor prolonged after his burial i was on the point of repairing the old mansion when i found myself involved in three lawsuits which challenged my right to it all i soon came to a determination as to my plan of action i paid off all the establishment and having got hold again of my fosterfather and mother mr and mrs brandon i rebuilt the lodge for them comfortably and there i located them i shut up the whole of the hall except a small sittingroom and two bedrooms for pigtop and myself and thus we led the lives of recluses having no other attendants than the brandons by these means i was enabled to reserve all my rents for carrying on my lawsuits without at all impairing the estate in eighteen years i thank god i ruined my three opponents and they all died in beggary the year after i came into undisputed possession of my estates the next heir got a writ issued against me of de inquirendo lunatico on the ground of the strange and unworthy manner that i as a baronet with an immense estate had lived for those last eighteen years i told my reasons most candidly to the jury and they found me to be the most sensible man that they had ever heard of placed in a similar position after having thus speedily settled these little matters as i was fast approaching my fortieth year i began to alter my style and live in a manner more befitting my rank and revenues yet i still held much aloof from all intimacy with my neighbours i am now in my fortyfirst year and grown corpulent it is now twentyone years since i saw my unfortunate parent interred and i walk about my domains sir ralphed to my hearts contentor more properly speaking discontent old pigtop is a fixture for he has now really become old i cannot call him my friend for i must venerate him to whom i give that title and veneration or even esteem pigtop was never born to inspire my humble companion he is not for no person in his deportment towards me can be less humble than he he is as quarrelsome as a ladys lapdog and seems never so happy as when he has effectually thwarted my intentions prince hal said of the jolly winebibber jack that he could have better spared a better man of pigtop i am compelled to say morei could not spare him at all he has become necessary to me he was never very handsome but now in his sixtysecond year he is a perfect fright so at least everybody tells me for i dont see it myself his duties about my person seem to be continually healthily irritant the most important one of which is to keep me a bachelor and scare away all womankind from rathelin hall he controls my servants and helps me to spoil them such a set of heavy bloated goodfornothing impudent and happy dogs never before fed upon a baronets substance contradicted him to his very face and fought for him behind his back the females in my establishment bear but a most niggardly proportion to the malesin the ratio of falstaff one pennyworth of bread to his many gallons of sack and these few are the most hideous poxmarked bleareyed damsels that the country could produceall pigtops doing never shall i forget the consternation the blank dismay of his countenance when one fine sunshiny morning i announced to him my intention of installing in the mansion some respectable middleaged gentlewoman as my housekeeper it was some time before he could find his speech blood and thunder bombs and fury what have i done that you should turn me out of your house in my grey hairsnow im dismantled as it were and laid up in ordinary turn you out piggy what could put that in your foolish noddle if madam comes in i cut my cable and pay off rathelin hall right abafteven if i die in a ditch and am buried by the parish take a housekeeperoh lord oh lord oh lord i would just as soon see you married or in your coffin but some such a person is absolutely necessary in an establishment of this extent so a housekeeper ill have of some sort why the devil need it be a woman then why wont a man dowhy wont i do you yes meandrew pigtop i ask the appointmentdo theres a good sir ralph make it out directly clap your signature to it and let it run as much like a commission as possible i ask it as a favour you know the great sacrifices that i have made for you the first time i ever heard of them upon my honour pray enlighten me why you must be convinced sir ralph if i had not left the navy to attend you all the world over as the pilotfish sticks to the shark i should by this time have been an old postcaptain and very likely cb into the bargain you who remained one quarter of a century a mastersmate during an active war should rush up through the grades of lieutenant and commander to be posted during another quarter of profound peace but perhaps you would have depended upon your great family interest well if i make out your commission as my housekeeper will you do the duties of the office on course and wear the uniform on course if so be it be such as a man might wear i bar petticoats and mobcaps and female thingamies will you carry the keys on course and see that the rooms and the passages are well swept and that the maids are up betimes in the morning damn themon coursecertainly and when lady aurelia cosway and her five beautiful daughters drive up to the door will you go and receive them in the ball and making them a profound curtsey beg to conduct them into a dressingroom no because dye see no ladies ever came further than your door and whom may i thank for that me assuredly said pigtop very proudly i do i did not make out his commission which vexed him but on the other hand i did not get me a housekeeper which at first a little vexed me but really my friend in an ex officio manner does most of the duties of the office to which he aspired extremely well without vanity i still preserve my good looks though i must confess to a little unbecoming obesity of figure yet through my indolence and the perseverance of pigtop and perhaps certain recollections of a green and bright bay in one of the summer islands i do fear that i am a confirmed bachelor

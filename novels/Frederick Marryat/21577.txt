peter simple by captain marryat captain frederick marryat was born july and died august he retired from the british navy in in order to devote himself to writing in the following years he wrote books many of which are among the very best of english literature and some of which are still in print marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories he says somewhere that when he sat down for the day's work he never knew what he was going to write he certainly was a literary genius peter simple was published in the fourth book to flow from marryat's pen this e text was transcribed in by nick hodson and was reformatted in and again in peter simple by captain frederick marryat chapter one the great advantage of being the fool of the family my destiny is decided and i am consigned to a stockbroker as part of his majesty's sea stock unfortunately for me mr handycock is a bear and i get very little dinner if i cannot narrate a life of adventurous and daring exploits fortunately i have no heavy crimes to confess and if i do not rise in the estimation of the reader for acts of gallantry and devotion in my country's cause at least i may claim the merit of zealous and persevering continuance in my vocation we are all of us variously gifted from above and he who is content to walk instead of to run on his allotted path through life although he may not so rapidly attain the goal has the advantage of not being out of breath upon his arrival as well as i can recollect and analyse my early propensities i think that had i been permitted to select my own profession i should in all probability have bound myself apprentice to a tailor for i always envied the comfortable seat which they appeared to enjoy upon the shopboard and their elevated position which enabled them to look down upon the constant succession of the idle or the busy who passed in review before them in the main street of the country town near to which i passed the first fourteen years of my existence but my father who was a clergyman of the church of england and the youngest brother of a noble family had a lucrative living and a soul above buttons if his son had not it has been from time immemorial the heathenish custom to sacrifice the greatest fool of the family to the prosperity and naval superiority of the country and at the age of fourteen i was selected as the victim if the custom be judicious i had no reason to complain there was not one dissentient voice when it was proposed before all the varieties of my aunts and cousins invited to partake of our new year's festival i was selected by general acclamation flattered by such an unanimous acknowledgment of my qualification i felt a slight degree of military ardour and a sort of vision of future grandeur passed before me in the distant vista of which i perceived a coach with four horses and a service of plate but as my story is not a very short one i must not dwell too long on its commencement i shall therefore inform the reader that my father who lived in the north of england did not think it right to fit me out at the country town near to which we resided but about a fortnight after the decision which i have referred to he forwarded me to london on the outside of the coach with my best suit of bottle green and six shirts to prevent mistakes i was booked in the way bill to be delivered to mr thomas handycock number saint clement's lane carriage paid my parting with the family was very affecting my mother cried bitterly for like all mothers she liked the greatest fool which she had presented to my father better than all the rest my sisters cried because my mother cried tom roared for a short time more loudly than all the rest having been chastised by my father for breaking his fourth window in that week at last i tore myself away i had blubbered till my eyes were so red and swollen that the pupils were scarcely to be distinguished and tears and dirt had veined my cheeks like the marble of the chimney piece my handkerchief was soaked through with wiping my eyes and blowing my nose before the scene was over my brother tom with a kindness which did honour to his heart exchanged his for mine saying with fraternal regard here peter take mine it's as dry as a bone but my father would not wait for a second handkerchief to perform its duty he led me away through the hall when having shaken hands with all the men and kissed all the maids who stood in a row with their aprons to their eyes i quitted the paternal roof the coachman accompanied me to the stage having seen me securely wedged between two fat old women and having put my parcel inside he took his leave and in a few minutes i was on my road to london i was too much depressed to take notice of any thing during my journey when we arrived in london they drove to the blue boar in a street the name of which i have forgotten i had never seen or heard of such an animal and certainly it did appear very formidable its mouth was open and teeth very large the coachman threw his whip to the ostler and the reins upon the horses' back he then dismounted and calling to me now young gentleman i'se waiting he put a ladder up for me to get down by then turning to a porter he said to him bill you must take this here young gem'man and that ere parcel to this here direction please to remember the coachman sir i replied that i certainly would if he wished it and walked off with the porter the coachman observing as i went away well he is a fool that's sartain i arrived quite safe at st clement's lane when the porter received a shilling for his trouble from the maid who let me in and i was shown up into a parlour where i found myself in company with mrs handycock mrs handycock was a little meagre woman who did not speak very good english and who appeared to me to employ the major part of her time in bawling out from the top of the stairs to the servants below i never saw her either read a book or occupy herself with needlework during the whole time i was in the house she had a large grey parrot and i really cannot tell which screamed the worst of the two but she was very civil and kind to me before i had been there ten minutes she told me that she hadored sailors they were the defendiours and preserviours of their kings and countries and that mr handycock would be home by four o'clock and then we should go to dinner as i was very anxious to see mr handycock and very anxious to have my dinner i was not sorry to hear the clock on the stairs strike four when mrs handycock jumped up and put her head over the banisters jemima jemima it's four o'clock i hear it marm replied the cook and she gave the frying pan a twist which made the hissing and the smell come flying up into the parlour and made me more hungry than ever rap tap tap there's your master jemima screamed the lady i hear him marm replied the cook run down my dear and let mr handycock in said his wife he'll be so surprised at seeing you open the door i ran down as mrs handycock desired me and opened the street door who the devil are you in a gruff voice cried mr handycock a man about six feet high dressed in blue cotton net pantaloons and hessian boots with a black coat and waistcoat i was a little rebuffed i must own but i replied that i was mr simple and pray mr simple what would your grandfather say if he saw you now law mr handycock said his wife from the top of the stairs how can you be so cross i told him to open the door to surprise you and you have surprised me replied he with your cursed folly while mr handycock was rubbing his boots on the mat i went upstairs rather mortified i must own as my father had told me that mr handycock was his stock broker and would do all he could to make me comfortable when i returned to the parlour mrs handycock whispered to me never mind my dear it's only because there's something wrong on 'change mr handycock is a bear just now i thought so too but made no answer for mr handycock came upstairs are you ready for your dinner my dear said the lady almost trembling if the dinner is ready for me i believe we usually dine at four answered her husband gruffly jemima jemima dish up do you hear jemima yes marm replied the cook directly i've thickened the butter and mrs handycock resumed her seat with well mr simple and how is your grandfather lord privilege he is quite well ma'am answered i for the fifteenth time at least but dinner put an end to the silence which followed this remark mr handycock walked downstairs leaving his wife and me to follow at our leisure pray ma'am inquired i as soon as he was out of hearing what is the matter with mr handycock that he is so cross to you vy my dear it is one of the misfortunes of matermony that ven the husband's put out the vife is sure to have her share of it are you people coming down to dinner roared mr handycock from below yes my dear replied the lady i thought that you were washing your hands we descended into the dining room where we found that mr handycock had already devoured two of the whitings leaving only one on the dish for his wife and me vould you like a little bit of viting my dear said the lady to me it's not worth halving observed the gentleman in a surly tone taking up the fish with his own knife and fork and putting it on his plate well i'm so glad you like them my dear replied the lady meekly then turning to me there's some nice roast weal coming my dear the veal made its appearance and fortunately for us mr handycock could not devour it all he took the lion's share nevertheless cutting off all the brown and then shoving the dish over to his wife to help herself and me after dinner mr handycock went down to the cellar for a bottle of wine o deary me exclaimed his wife he must have lost a mint of money we had better go upstairs and leave him alone he'll be better after a bottle of port perhaps i was very glad to go away and being very tired i went to bed without any tea for mrs handycock dared not venture to make it before her husband came upstairs chapter two fitting out on the shortest notice fortunately for me this day mr handycock is not a bear and i fare very well i set off for portsmouth behind the coach i meet a man before the mast he is disguised with liquor but is not the only disguise i fall in with in my journey the next morning mr handycock appeared to be in somewhat better humour one of the linendrapers who fitted out cadets etcetera on the shortest notice was sent for and orders given for my equipment which mr handycock insisted should be ready on the day afterwards or the articles would be left on his hands adding that my place was already taken in the portsmouth coach the man made his promise took my measure and departed and soon afterwards mr handycock also quitted the house at four o'clock mr handycock rapped at the door and was let in but not by me he ascended the stairs with three bounds and coming into the parlour cried well nancy my love how are you then stooping over her give me a kiss old girl i'm as hungry as a hunter mr simple how do you do i hope you have passed the morning agreeably i must wash my hands and change my boots my love i am not fit to sit down to table with you in this pickle well polly how are you i'm glad you're hungry my dear i've such a nice dinner for you replied the wife all smiles jemima be quick and dish up mr handycock is so hungry yes marm replied the cook and mrs handycock followed her husband into his bedroom on the same floor to assist him at his toilet by jove nancy the bulls have been nicely taken in said mr handycock as we sat down to dinner o i am so glad replied his wife giggling and so i believe she was but why i did not understand we both had our share to day and i never saw a man more polite than mr handycock he joked with his wife asked me to drink wine with him two or three times talked about my grandfather and in short we had a very pleasant evening the next morning all my clothes came home but mr handycock who still continued in good humour said that he would not allow me to travel by night that i should sleep there and set off the next morning which i did at six o'clock and before eight i had arrived at the elephant and castle where we stopped for a quarter of an hour i observed a crowd assembled at the corner and asking a gentleman who sat by me in a plaid cloak whether there was not something very uncommon to attract so many people he replied not very for it is only a drunken sailor i rose from my seat which was on the hinder part of the coach that i might see him for it was a new sight to me and excited my curiosity when to my astonishment he staggered from the crowd and swore that he'd go to portsmouth he climbed up by the wheel of the coach and sat down by me i believe that i stared at him very much for he said to me what are you gaping at you young sculping do you want to catch flies or did you never see a chap half seas over before i replied that i had never been at sea in my life but that i was going well then you're like a young bear all your sorrows to come that's all my hearty replied he when you get on board you'll find monkey's allowance more kicks than half pence i say you pewter carrier bring us another pint of ale the waiter of the inn who was attending the coach brought out the ale half of which the sailor drank and the other half threw into the waiter's face telling him that was his allowance and now said he what's to pay the waiter who looked very angry but appeared too much afraid of the sailor to say anything answered fourpence and the sailor pulled out a handful of bank notes mixed up with gold silver and coppers and was picking out the money to pay for his beer when the coachman who was impatient drove off there's cut and run cried the sailor thrusting all the money into his breeches pocket that's what you'll learn to do my joker before you have been two cruises to sea in the meantime the gentleman in the plaid cloak who was seated by me smoked his cigar without saying a word i commenced a conversation with him relative to my profession and asked him whether it was not very difficult to learn larn cried the sailor interrupting us no it may be difficult for such chaps as me before the mast to larn but you i presume is a reefer and they an't got much to larn cause why they pipe clays their weekly accounts and walks up and down with their hands in their pockets you must larn to chaw baccy drink grog and call the cat a beggar and then you knows all a midshipman's expected to know now a days arn't i right sir said the sailor appealing to the gentleman in a plaid cloak i axes you because i see you're a sailor by the cut of your jib beg pardon sir continued he touching his hat hope no offence i am afraid that you have nearly hit the mark my good fellow replied the gentleman whenever the coach stopped the sailor called for more ale and always threw the remainder which he could not drink into the face of the man who brought it out for him just as the coach was starting off and then tossed the pewter pot on the ground for him to pick up he became more tipsy every stage and the last from portsmouth when he pulled out his money he could find no silver so he handed down a note and desired the waiter to change it the waiter crumpled it up and put it into his pocket and then returned the sailor the change for a one pound note but the gentleman in the plaid had observed that it was a five pound note which the sailor had given and insisted upon the waiter producing it and giving the proper change the sailor took his money which the waiter handed to him begging pardon for the mistake although he coloured up very much at being detected i really beg your pardon said he again it was quite a mistake whereupon the sailor threw the pewter pot at the waiter saying i really beg your pardon too and with such force that it flattened upon the man's head who fell senseless on the road the coachman drove off and i never heard whether the man was killed or not i inquired of the gentleman how soon we should be at portsmouth he answered that we were passing the lines but i saw no lines and i was ashamed to show my ignorance he asked me what ship i was going to join i could not recollect her name but i told him it was painted on the outside of my chest which was coming down by the waggon all that i could recollect was that it was a french name have you no letter of introduction to the captain said he yes i have replied i and i pulled out my pocketbook in which the letter was captain savage hms diomede continued i reading to him to my surprise he very coolly proceeded to open the letter which when i perceived what he was doing occasioned me immediately to snatch the letter from him stating my opinion at the same time that it was a breach of honour and that in my opinion he was no gentleman just as you please youngster replied he recollect you have told me i am no gentleman he wrapped his plaid around him and said no more and i was not a little pleased at having silenced him by my resolute behaviour chapter three i am made to look very blue at the blue posts find wild spirits around and soon after hot spirits within me at length my spirits overcome me call to pay my respects to the captain and find that i had had the pleasure of meeting him before no sooner out of one scrape than into another when we stopped i enquired of the coachman which was the best inn he answered that it was the blue postesses where the midshipmen leave their chestesses call for tea and toastesses and sometimes forget to pay for their breakfastesses he laughed when he said it and i thought that he was joking with me but he pointed out two large blue posts at the door next the coach office and told me that all the midshipmen resorted to that hotel the coffee room was full of midshipmen and as i was anxious about my chest i enquired of one of them if he knew when the waggon would come in do you expect your mother by it replied he o no but i expect my uniforms i only wear these bottle greens until they come and pray what ship are you going to join the die a maid captain thomas kirkwall savage the diomede i say robinson a'n't that the frigate in which the midshipmen had four dozen apiece for not having pipe clayed their weekly accounts on the saturday to be sure it is replied the other why the captain gave a youngster five dozen the other day for wearing a scarlet watch riband 'pon my soul i pity you you'll be fagged to death for there's only three midshipmen in the ship now all the rest ran away didn't they robinson there's only two left now for poor matthews died of fatigue he was worked all day and kept watch all night for six weeks and one morning he was found dead upon his chest god bless my soul cried i and yet on shore they say he is such a kind man to his midshipmen yes replied robinson he spreads that report everywhere come sit down with us and take a glass of grog it will keep your spirits up i am sorry to state that the midshipmen made me very tipsy that evening i don't recollect being put to bed but i found myself there the next morning with a dreadful head ache and a very confused recollection of what had passed i was very much shocked at my having so soon forgotten the injunctions of my parents and was making vows never to be so foolish again when in came the midshipman who had been so kind to me the night before come mr bottlegreen he bawled out alluding i suppose to the colour of my clothes rouse and bitt there's the captain's coxswain waiting for you below by the powers you're in a pretty scrape for what you did last night did last night replied i astonished why does the captain know that i was tipsy i think you took devilish good care to let him know it when you were at the theatre at the theatre was i at the theatre to be sure you were you would go do all we could to prevent you though you were as drunk as david's sow your captain was there with the admiral's daughters you called him a tyrant and snapped your fingers at him why don't you recollect you told him that you did not care a fig for him o dear o dear what shall i do what shall i do cried i upon my honour i'm sorry very sorry indeed replied the midshipman and he quitted the room looking as grave as if the misfortune had happened to himself i got up with a heavy head and heavier heart and as soon as i was dressed i asked the way to the george inn i took my letter of introduction with me although i was afraid it would be of little service when i arrived i asked with a trembling voice whether captain thomas kirkwall savage of hms diomede was staying there the waiter replied that he was at breakfast with captain courtney but that he would take up my name i give it him and in a minute the waiter returned and desired that i would walk up o how my heart beat i never was so frightened i thought i should have dropped on the stairs twice i attempted to walk into the room and each time my legs failed me at last i wiped the perspiration from my forehead and with a desperate effort i went into the room mr simple i am glad to see you said a voice i had held my head down for i was afraid to look at him but the voice was so kind that i mustered up courage and when i did look up there sat with his uniform and epaulets and his sword by his side the passenger in the plaid cloak who wanted to open my letter and whom i had told to his face that he was no gentleman i thought i should have died as the other midshipman did upon his chest i was just sinking down upon my knees to beg for mercy when the captain perceiving my confusion burst out into a laugh and said so you know me again mr simple well don't be alarmed you did your duty in not permitting me to open the letter i give you credit for your conduct now sit down and take some breakfast captain courtney said he to the other captain who was at the table this is one of my youngsters just entering the service we were passengers yesterday by the same coach he then told him the circumstance which occurred at which they laughed heartily i now recovered my spirits a little but still there was the affair at the theatre and i thought that perhaps he did not recognise me i was however soon relieved from my anxiety by the other captain inquiring were you at the theatre last night savage no i dined at the admiral's there's no getting away from those girls they are so pleasant i rather think you are a little taken in that quarter no on my word i might be if i had time to discover which i liked best but my ship is at present my wife and the only wife i intend to have until i am laid on the shelf well thought i if he was not at the theatre it could not have been him that i insulted pray mr simple how are your father and mother said the captain very well i thank you sir and desire me to present their compliments i am obliged to them now i have a little advice to offer you in the first place obey your superior officers without hesitation it is for me not you to decide whether an order is unjust or not in the next place never swear or drink spirits the first is immoral and ungentleman like the second is a vile habit which will grow upon you i never touch spirit myself and i expect that my young gentlemen will refrain from it also now you may go and as soon as your uniforms arrive you will repair on board good morning i quitted the room with a low bow glad to have surmounted so easily what appeared to be a chaos of difficulty but my mind was confused with the testimony of the midshipman so much at variance with the language and behaviour of the captain when i arrived at the blue posts i found all the midshipmen in the coffee room and i repeated to them all that had passed when i had finished they burst out laughing and said that they had only been joking with me well said i to the one who had called me up in the morning you may call it joking but i call it lying pray mr bottlegreen do you refer to me yes i do replied i then sir as a gentleman i demand satisfaction slugs in a saw pit death before dishonour damn me could not the affair be arranged otherwise interrupted another will not mr bottlegreen retract my name is simple sir and not bottlegreen replied i and as he did tell a falsehood i will not retract then the affair must go on said the midshipman robinson will you oblige me by acting as my second it's an unpleasant business replied the other you are so good a shot but as you request it i shall not refuse mr simple is not i believe provided with a friend yes he is replied another of the midshipmen he is a spunky fellow and i'll be his second it was then arranged that we should meet the next morning with pistols i considered that as an officer and a gentleman i could not well refuse but i was very unhappy i went up into my room and wrote a long letter to my mother enclosing a lock of my hair and having shed a few tears at the idea of how sorry she would be if i were killed i borrowed a bible from the waiter and read it during the remainder of the day chapter four i am taught on a cold morning before breakfast how to stand fire and thus prove my courage after breakfast i also prove my gallantry my proof meets reproof women at the bottom of all mischief by one i lose my liberty and by another my money when i began to wake the next morning i could not think what it was that felt like a weight upon my chest but as i roused and recalled my scattered thoughts i remembered that in an hour or two it would be decided whether i were to exist another day before i was dressed the midshipman who had volunteered to be my second came into my room and informed me that the affair was to be decided in the garden behind the inn and that my adversary was a very good shot i dressed myself and followed my second into the garden where i found all the midshipmen and some of the waiters of the inn they all seemed very merry as if the life of a fellow creature was of no consequence the seconds talked apart for a little while and then measured the ground which was twelve paces we then took our stations i believe that i turned pale for my second came to my side and whispered that i must not be frightened i replied that i was not frightened but that i considered that it was an awful moment the second to my adversary then came up and asked me whether i would make an apology which i refused to do as before they handed a pistol to each of us and my second showed me how i was to pull the trigger it was arranged that at the word given we were to fire at the same time i made sure that i should be wounded if not killed and i shut my eyes as i fired my pistol in the air i felt my head swim and thought i was hurt but fortunately i was not the pistols were loaded again and we fired a second time the seconds then interfered and it was proposed that we should shake hands which i was very glad to do for i considered my life to have been saved by a miracle the next day my chest arrived by the waggon and i threw off my bottle greens and put on my uniform i had no cocked hat or dirk as the warehouse people employed by mr handycock did not supply those articles and it was arranged that i should procure them at portsmouth when i inquired the price i found that they cost more money than i had in my pocket so i tore up the letter i had written to my mother before the duel and wrote another asking for a remittance to purchase my dirk and cocked hat i then walked out in my uniform not a little proud i must confess i had arrived opposite a place called sally port when a young lady very nicely dressed looked at me very hard and said well reefer how are you off for soap i was astonished at the question and more so at the interest which she seemed to take in my affairs i answered thank you i am very well off i have four cakes of windsor and two bars of yellow for washing she laughed at my reply and asked me whether i would walk home and take a bit of dinner with her i was astonished at this polite offer and i said that i should be most happy i thought i might venture to offer my arm which she accepted and we proceeded up high street on our way to her home just as we passed the admiral's house i perceived my captain walking with two of the admiral's daughters i was not a little proud to let him see that i had female acquaintances as well as he had and as i passed him with the young lady under my protection i took off my hat and made him a low bow to my surprise not only did he not return the salute but he looked at me with a very stern countenance i concluded that he was a very proud man and did not wish the admiral's daughters to suppose that he knew midshipmen by sight but i had not exactly made up my mind on the subject when the captain having seen the ladies into the admiral's house sent one of the messengers after me to desire that i would immediately come to him at the george inn which was nearly opposite i apologised to the young lady and promised to return immediately if she would wait for me but she replied if that was my captain it was her idea that i should have a confounded wigging and be sent on board so wishing me good bye she left me and continued her way home i could as little comprehend all this as why the captain looked so black when i passed him but it was soon explained when i went up to him in the parlour at the george inn i am sorry mr simple said the captain when i entered that a lad like you should show such early symptoms of depravity still more so that he should not have the grace which even the most hardened are not wholly destitute of i mean to practise immorality in secret and not degrade themselves and insult their captain by unblushingly avowing i may say glorying in their iniquity by exposing it in broad day and in the most frequented street of the town sir replied i with astonishment o dear what have i done the captain fixed his keen eyes upon me so that they appeared to pierce me through and nail me to the wall do you pretend to say sir that you were not aware of the character of the person with whom you were walking just now no sir replied i except that she was very kind and good natured and then i told him how she had addressed me and what subsequently took place and is it possible mr simple that you are so great a fool i replied that i certainly was considered the greatest fool of our family i should think you were replied he dryly he then explained to me who the person was with whom i was in company and how any association with her would inevitably lead to my ruin and disgrace i cried very much for i was shocked at the narrow escape which i had had and mortified at having fallen in his good opinion he asked me how i had employed my time since i had been at portsmouth and i made an acknowledgment of having been made tipsy related all that the midshipmen had told me and how i had that morning fought a duel when i had finished he said mr simple i can no longer trust you on shore until you are more experienced in the world i shall desire my coxswain not to lose sight of you until you are safe on board of the frigate altogether i did not feel sorry when it was over i saw that the captain believed what i had stated and that he was disposed to be kind to me although he thought me very silly the coxswain in obedience to his orders accompanied me to the blue post i packed up my clothes paid my bill and the porter wheeled my chest down to the sally port where the boat was waiting come heave a head my lads be smart the captain says we are to take the young gentleman on board directly his liberty's stopped for getting drunk and running after the dolly mops i should thank you to be more respectful in your remarks mr coxswain said i with displeasure mister coxswain thanky sir for giving me a handle to my name replied he come be smart with your oars my lads la bill freeman said a young woman on the beach what a nice young gentleman you have there he looks like a sucking nelson i say my pretty young officer could you lend me a shilling i was so pleased at the woman calling me young nelson that i immediately complied with her request i have not a shilling in my pocket said i but here is half a crown and you can change it and bring me back the eighteen pence well you are a nice young man replied she taking the half crown i'll be back directly my dear the men in the boat laughed and the coxswain desired them to shove off no observed i you must wait for my eighteen pence we shall wait a devilish long while then i suspect i know that girl and she has a very bad memory she cannot be so dishonest or ungrateful replied i coxswain i order you to stay i am an officer i know you are sir about six hours old well then i must go up and tell the captain that you have another girl in tow and that you won't go on board o no mr coxswain pray don't shove off as soon as you please and never mind the eighteen pence the boat then shoved off and pulled towards the ship which lay at spithead chapter five i am introduced to the quarter deck and first lieutenant who pronounces me very clever trotted below to mrs trotter connubial bliss in a cock pit mrs trotter takes me in as a messmate on our arrival on board the coxswain gave a note from the captain to the first lieutenant who happened to be on deck he read the note looked at me earnestly and then i overheard him say to another lieutenant the service is going to the devil here's another of the fools of a family made a present of to the country another cub for me to lick into shape well i never saw the one yet i did not make something of where's mr simple i am mr simple sir replied i very much frightened at what i had overheard now mr simple said the first lieutenant observe and pay particular attention to what i say the captain tells me in this note that you have been shamming stupid now sir i am not to be taken in that way i have looked attentively at your face and i see at once that you are very clever and if you do not prove so in a very short time why you had better jump overboard that's all perfectly understand me i know that you are a very clever fellow and having told you so don't you pretend to impose upon me for it won't do i was very much terrified at this speech but at the same time i was pleased to hear that he thought me clever and i determined to do all in my power to keep up such an unexpected reputation quarter master said the first lieutenant tell mr trotter to come on deck the quarter master brought up mr trotter who apologised for being so dirty as he was breaking casks out of the hold he was a short thickset man about thirty years of age with a nose which had a red club to it very dirty teeth and large black whiskers mr trotter said the first lieutenant here is a young gentleman who has joined the ship introduce him into the berth and see his hammock slung you must look after him a little i really have very little time to look after any of them sir replied mr trotter but i will do what i can follow me youngster accordingly i descended the ladder after him then i went down another and then to my surprise i was desired by him to go down a third which when i had done he informed me that i was in the cock pit now youngster said mr trotter seating himself upon a large chest you may do as you please the midshipmen's mess is on the deck above this and if you like to join why you can but this i will tell you as a friend that you will be thrashed all day long and fare very badly the weakest always goes to the wall there but perhaps you do not mind that now that we are in harbour i mess here because mrs trotter is on board she is a very charming woman i can assure you and will be here directly she has just gone up into the galley to look after a net of potatoes in the copper if you like it better i will ask her permission for you to mess with us i had scarcely time to reply when i perceived a pair of legs cased in black cotton stockings on the ladder above us and it proved that they belonged to mrs trotter who came down the ladder with a net full of smoking potatoes upon my word mrs trotter you must be conscious of having a very pretty ankle or you would not venture to display it as you have to mr simple a young gentleman whom i beg to introduce to you and who with your permission will join our mess my dear trotter how cruel of you not to give me warning i thought that nobody was below i declare i'm so ashamed continued the lady simpering and covering her face with the hand which was unemployed it can't be helped now my love neither was there any thing to be ashamed of i trust mr simple and you will be very good friends i believe i mentioned his desire to join our mess i am sure i shall be very happy in his company this is a strange place for me to live in mr simple after the society to which i have been accustomed but affection can make any sacrifice and rather than lose the company of my trotter who has been unfortunate in pecuniary matters but my dear interrupted mr trotter is it not time to look after our dinner yes i am going forward for it now we have skewer pieces today mr simple will you excuse me and then with a great deal of flirtation and laughing about her ankles and requesting me as a favour to turn my face away mrs trotter ascended the ladder as the reader may wish to know what sort of looking personage she was i will take this opportunity to describe her her figure was very good and at one period of her life i thought her face must have been very handsome at the time i was introduced to her it showed the ravages of time or hardship very distinctly in short she might be termed a faded beauty flaunting in her dress and not very clean in her person charming woman mrs trotter is she not mr simple said the master's mate to which of course i immediately acquiesced now mr simple continued he there are a few arrangements which i had better mention while mrs trotter is away for she would be shocked at our talking about such things of course the style of living which we indulge in is rather expensive mrs trotter cannot dispense with her tea and her other little comforts at the same time i must put you to no extra expense i had rather be out of pocket myself i propose that during the time you mess with us you shall only pay one guinea per week and as for entrance money why i think i must not charge you more than a couple of guineas have you any money yes i replied i have three guineas and a half left well then give me the three guineas and the half guinea you can reserve for pocket money you must write to your friends immediately for a further supply i handed him the money which he put in his pocket your chest continued he you shall bring down here for mrs trotter will i am sure if i request it not only keep it in order for you but see that your clothes are properly mended she is a charming woman mrs trotter and very fond of young gentlemen how old are you i replied that i was fifteen no more well i am glad of that for mrs trotter is very particular after a certain age i should recommend you on no account to associate with the other midshipmen they are very angry with me because i would not permit mrs trotter to join their mess and they are sad storytellers that they certainly are replied i but here we were interrupted by mrs trotter coming down with a piece of stick in her hand upon which were skewered about a dozen small pieces of beef and pork which she first laid on a plate and then began to lay the cloth and prepare for dinner we have but a poor dinner to day said mrs trotter for the bum boat woman disappointed me i particularly requested her to bring me off a leg of lamb but she says that there was none in the market it is rather early for it that's true but trotter is very nice in his eating now let us sit down to dinner i felt very sick indeed and could eat nothing our dinner consisted of the pieces of beef and pork the potatoes and a baked pudding in a tin dish mr trotter went up to serve the spirits out to the ship's company and returned with a bottle of rum have you got mr simple's allowance my love inquired mrs trotter yes he is victualled to day as he came on board before twelve o'clock do you drink spirits mr simple no i thank you replied i for i remembered the captain's injunction taking as i do such an interest in your welfare i must earnestly recommend you to abstain from them said mr trotter it is a very bad habit and once acquired not easy to be left off i am obliged to drink them that i may not check the perspiration after working in the hold i have nevertheless a natural abhorrence of them but my champagne and claret days are gone by and i must submit to circumstances my poor trotter said the lady well continued he it's a poor heart that never rejoiceth he then poured out half a tumbler of rum and filled the glass up with water my love will you taste it now trotter you know that i never touch it except when the water is so bad that i must have the taste taken away how is the water to day as usual my dear not drinkable after much persuasion mrs trotter agreed to sip a little out of his glass i thought that she took it pretty often considering that she did not like it but i felt so unwell that i was obliged to go on the main deck i went to bed very tired mr trotter had my hammock hung up in the cock pit separated by a canvas screen from the cot in which he slept with his wife i thought this very odd but they told me it was the general custom on board ship although mrs trotter's delicacy was very much shocked by it i was very sick but mrs trotter was very kind when i was in bed she kissed me and wished me good night and very soon afterwards i fell fast asleep chapter six puzzled with very common words mrs trotter takes care of my wardrobe a matrimonial duet ending con strepito i awoke the next morning at daylight with a noise over my head which sounded like thunder i found it proceeded from holy stoning and washing down the main deck i was very much refreshed nevertheless and did not feel the least sick or giddy mr trotter who had been up at four o'clock came down and directed one of the marines to fetch me some water i washed myself on my chest and then went on the main deck which they were swabbing dry standing by the sentry at the cabin door i met one of the midshipmen with whom i had been in company at the blue posts so master simple old trotter and his faggot of a wife have got hold of you have they said he i replied that i did not know the meaning of faggot but that i considered mrs trotter a very charming woman at which he burst into a loud laugh well said he i'll just give you a caution take care or they'll make a clean sweep has mrs trotter shown you her ankle yet yes i replied and a very pretty one it is ah she's at her old tricks you had much better have joined our mess at once you're not the first greenhorn that they have plucked well said he as he walked away keep the key of your own chest that's all when he left me i went on the quarter deck all the sailors were busy at work and the first lieutenant cried out to the gunner now mr dispart if you're ready we'll breech these guns now my lads said the first lieutenant we must slue the part the breeches cover more forward as i never heard of a gun having breeches i was very anxious to see what was going on and went up close to the first lieutenant who said to me youngster hand me that monkey's tail i saw nothing like a monkey's tail but i was so frightened that i snatched up the first thing that i saw which was a short bar of iron and it so happened that it was the very article which he wanted when i gave it to him the first lieutenant looked at me and said so you know what a monkey's tail is already do you now don't you ever sham stupid after that thought i to myself i'm very lucky but if that's a monkey's tail it's a very stiff one i resolved to learn the names of every thing as fast as i could that i might be prepared so i listened attentively to what was said but i soon became quite confused and despaired of remembering anything mr chucks said the first lieutenant to the boatswain what blocks have we below not on charge let me see sir i've one sister t'other we split in half the other day and i think i have a couple of monkeys down in the store room i say you smith pass that brace through the bull's eye and take the sheepshank out before you come down and mr chucks recollect this afternoon that you bleed all the buoys bleed the boys thought i what can that be for at all events the surgeon appears to be the proper person to perform that operation this last incomprehensible remark drove me off the deck and i retreated to the cock pit where i found mrs trotter o my dear said she i am glad you are come as i wish to put your clothes in order have you a list of them where is your key i replied that i had not a list and i handed her the key although i did not forget the caution of the midshipman yet i considered that there could be no harm in her looking over my clothes when i was present she unlocked my chest and pulled every thing out and then commenced telling me what were likely to be useful and what were not now these worsted stockings she said will be very comfortable in cold weather and in the summer time these brown cotton socks will be delightfully cool and you have enough of each to last you till you outgrow them but as for these fine cotton stockings they are of no use only catch the dirt when the decks are swept and always look untidy i wonder how they could be so foolish as to send them nobody wears them on board ship now a days they are only fit for women i wonder if they would fit me she turned her chair away and put on one of my stockings laughing the whole of the time then she turned round to me and showed me how nicely they fitted her bless you mr simple it's well that trotter is in the hold he'd be so jealous do you know what these stockings cost they are of no use to you and they fit me i will speak to trotter and take them off your hands i replied that i could not think of selling them and as they were of no use to me and fitted her i begged that she would accept of the dozen pairs we had beef steaks and onions for dinner that day but i could not bear the smell of the onions mr trotter came down very cross because the first lieutenant had found fault with him he swore that he would cut the service he drank glass of grog after glass of grog and at each glass became more violent and mrs trotter drank also i observed a great deal more than i thought she ought to have done but she whispered to me that she drank it that trotter might not as he would certainly be tipsy i thought this very devoted on her part but they sat so late that i went to bed and left them he still drinking and vowing vengeance against the first lieutenant i had not been asleep above two or three hours when i was awakened by a great noise and quarrelling and i discovered that mr trotter was drunk and beating his wife very much shocked that such a charming woman should be beaten and ill used i scrambled out of my hammock to see if i could be of any assistance but it was dark although they scuffled as much as before i asked the marine who was sentry at the gun room door above to bring his lantern and was very much shocked at his replying that i had better go to bed and let them fight it out shortly afterwards mrs trotter staggered to my hammock and after several attempts succeeded in getting into it i cannot say that i much liked that but what could i do so i finished dressing myself and went up on the quarter deck the midshipman who had the watch was the one who had cautioned me against the trotters he was very friendly to me well simple said he what brings you on deck i told him how ill mr trotter had behaved to his wife and how she had turned into my hammock the cursed drunken old catamaran cried he i'll go and cut her down by the head but i requested he would not as she was a lady a lady replied he yes there's plenty of ladies of her description and then he informed me that she had many years ago been the mistress of a man of fortune who kept a carriage for her but that he grew tired of her and had given trotter pounds to marry her and that now they did nothing but get drunk together and fight with each other he went to my hammock and lowered it down at one end so that mrs trotter lay with her head on the deck in a very uncomfortable position to my astonishment she swore at him in a dreadful manner but refused to turn out he was abusing her and shaking her in the hammock when mr trotter who had been aroused at the noise rushed from behind the screen you villain what are you doing with my wife cried he pummelling at him as well as he could for he was so tipsy that he could hardly stand mr trotter was soon knocked down when all of a sudden mrs trotter jumped up from the hammock and caught the midshipman by the hair and pulled at him then the sentry thought right to interfere he called out for the master at arms and went down himself to help the midshipman who was faring badly between the two but mrs trotter snatched the lantern out of his hand and smashed it all to pieces and then we were all left in darkness and i could not see what took place although the scuffling continued such was the posture of affairs when the master at arms came up with his light the midshipman and sentry went up the ladder and mr and mrs trotter continued beating each other to this none of them paid any attention saying as the sentry had said before let them fight it out after they had fought some time they retired behind the screen and i followed the advice of the midshipman and got into my hammock which the master at arms hung up again for me i heard mr and mrs trotter both crying and kissing each other cruel cruel mr trotter said she blubbering my life my love i was so jealous replied he damn and blast your jealousy replied the lady i've two nice black eyes for the galley to morrow after about an hour of kissing and scolding they both fell asleep again the next morning before breakfast the midshipman reported to the first lieutenant the conduct of mr trotter and his wife i was sent for and obliged to acknowledge that it was all true he sent for mr trotter who replied that he was not well and could not come on deck upon which the first lieutenant ordered the sergeant of marines to bring him up directly mr trotter made his appearance with one eye closed and his face very much scratched did not i desire you sir said the first lieutenant to introduce this young gentleman into the midshipmen's berth instead of which you have introduced him to that disgraceful wife of yours and have swindled him out of his property i order you immediately to return the three guineas which you received as mess money and also that your wife give back the stockings which she cajoled him out of but then i interposed and told the first lieutenant that the stockings had been a free gift on my part and that although i had been very foolish yet that i considered that i could not in honour demand them back again well youngster replied the first lieutenant perhaps your ideas are correct and if you wish it i will not enforce that part of my order but continued he to mr trotter i desire sir that your wife leave the ship immediately and i trust that when i have reported your conduct to the captain he will serve you in the same manner in the meantime you will consider yourself under an arrest for drunkenness chapter seven scandalum magnatum' clearly proved i prove to the captain that i consider him a gentleman although i had told him the contrary and i prove to the midshipmen that i am a gentleman myself they prove their gratitude by practising upon me because practice makes perfect the captain came on board about twelve o'clock and ordered the discharge of mr trotter to be made out as soon as the first lieutenant had reported what had occurred he then sent for all the midshipmen on the quarter deck gentlemen said the captain to them with a stern countenance i feel very much indebted to some of you for the character which you have been pleased to give of me to mr simple i must now request that you will answer a few questions which i am about to put in his presence did i ever flog the whole starboard watch because the ship would only sail nine knots on a bowline no sir no replied they all very much frightened did i ever give a midshipman four dozen for not having his weekly accounts pipe clayed or another five dozen for wearing a scarlet watch riband no sir replied they all together did any midshipman ever die on his chest from fatigue they again replied in the negative then gentlemen you will oblige me by stating which of you thought proper to assert these falsehoods in a public coffee room and further which of you obliged this youngster to risk his life in a duel they were all silent will you answer me gentlemen with respect to the duel sir replied the midshipman who had fought me i heard say that the pistols were only charged with powder it was a joke well sir we'll allow that the duel was only a joke and i hope and trust that your report is correct is the reputation of your captain only a joke allow me to ask i request to know who of you dared to propagate such injurious slander here there was a dead pause well then gentlemen since you will not confess yourselves i must refer to my authority mr simple have the goodness to point out the person on persons who gave you the information but i thought this would not be fair and as they had all treated me very kindly after the duel i resolved not to tell so i answered if you please sir i consider that i told you all that in confidence confidence sir replied the captain who ever heard of confidence between a post captain and a midshipman no sir replied i not between a post captain and a midshipman but between two gentlemen the captain bit his lip and then turning to the midshipmen said you may thank mr simple gentlemen that i do not press this matter further i do believe that you were not serious when you calumniated me but recollect that what is said in joke is too often repeated in earnest i trust that mr simple's conduct will have its effect and that you will leave off practising upon him who has saved you from a very severe punishment when the midshipmen went down below they all shook hands with me and said that i was a good fellow for not peaching but as for the advice of the captain that they should not practise upon me as he termed it they forgot that for they commenced again immediately and never left off until they found that i was not to be deceived any longer the postman came on board with the letters and put his head into the midshipmen's berth i was very anxious to have one from home but i was disappointed some had letters and some had not those who had not declared that their parents were very undutiful and that they would cut them off with a shilling and those who had letters after they had read them offered them for sale to the others usually at half price i could not imagine why they sold or why the others bought them but they did do so and one that was full of good advice was sold three times from which circumstance i was inclined to form a better opinion of the morals of my companions i mentioned the reason why i was so anxious for a letter viz because i wanted to buy my dirk and cocked hat upon which they told me that there was no occasion for my spending my money as by the regulations of the service the purser's steward served them out to all the officers who applied for them as i knew where the purser's steward's room was having seen it when down in the cock pit with the trotters i went down immediately mr purser's steward said i let me have a cocked hat and a dirk immediately very good sir replied he and he wrote an order upon a slip of paper which he handed to me there is the order for it sir but the cocked hats are kept in the chest up in the main top and as for the dirk you must apply to the butcher who has them under his charge i went up with the order and thought i would first apply for the dirk so i inquired for the butcher whom i found sitting in the sheep pen with the sheep mending his trowsers in reply to my demand he told me that he had not the key of the store room which was under the charge of one of the corporals of marines i inquired who and he said cheeks the marine this celebrated personage is the prototype of mr nobody on board of a man of war i went everywhere about the ship inquiring for cheeks the marine but could not find him some said that they believed he was in the foretop standing sentry over the wind that it might not change others that he was in the galley to prevent the midshipmen from soaking their biscuit in the captain's dripping pan as i could not find the marine i thought i might as well go for my cocked hat and get my dirk afterwards i did not much like going up the rigging because i was afraid of turning giddy and if i fell overboard i could not swim but one of the midshipmen offered to accompany me stating that i need not be afraid if i fell overboard of sinking to the bottom as if i was giddy my head at all events would swim so i determined to venture i climbed up very near to the main top but not without missing the little ropes very often and grazing the skin of my shins then i came to large ropes stretched out from the mast so that you must climb them with your head backwards the midshipman told me these were called the cat harpings because they were so difficult to climb that a cat would expostulate if ordered to go out by them i was afraid to venture and then he proposed that i should go through lubber's hole which he said had been made for people like me i agreed to attempt it as it appeared more easy and at last arrived quite out of breath and very happy to find myself in the main top the captain of the main top was there with two other sailors the midshipman introduced me very politely mr jenkins mr simple midshipman mr simple mr jenkins captain of the main top mr jenkins mr simple has come up with an order for a cocked hat the captain of the top replied that he was very sorry that he had not one in store but the last had been served out to the captain's monkey this was very provoking the captain of the top then asked me if i was ready with my footing i replied not very for i had lost it two or three times when coming up he laughed and replied that i should lose it altogether before i went down and that i must hand it out hand out my footing said i puzzled and appealing to the midshipman what does he mean he means that you must fork out a seven shilling bit i was just as wise as ever and stared very much when mr jenkins desired the other men to get half a dozen foxes and make a spread eagle of me unless he had his parkisite i never should have found out what it all meant had not the midshipman who laughed till he cried at last informed me that it was the custom to give the men something to drink the first time that i came aloft and that if i did not they would tie me up to the rigging having no money in my pocket i promised to pay them as soon as i went below but mr jenkins would not trust me why sir said i do you know who you are speaking to i am an officer and a gentleman do you know who my grandfather is o yes replied he very well then who is he sir replied i very angrily who is he why he's the lord knows who no replied i that's not his name he is lord privilege i was very much surprised that he knew that my grandfather was a lord and do you suppose continued i that i would forfeit the honour of my family for a paltry seven shillings this observation of mine and a promise on the part of the midshipman who said he would be bail for me satisfied mr jenkins and he allowed me to go down the rigging i went to my chest and paid the seven shillings to one of the topmen who followed me and then went up on the main deck to learn as much as i could of my profession chapter eight my messmates show me the folly of running in debt the episode of sholto mcfoy now that i have been on board about a month i find that my life is not disagreeable i don't smell the pitch and tar and i can get into my hammock without tumbling out on the other side my messmates are good tempered although they laugh at me very much but i must say that they are not very nice in their ideas of honour a few days after i came onboard i purchased some tarts of the bumboat woman as she is called i wished to pay for them but she had no change and very civilly told me she would trust me she produced a narrow book and said that she would open an account with me and i could pay her when i thought proper to this arrangement i had no objection and i sent up for different things until i thought that my account must have amounted to eleven or twelve shillings as i promised my father that i never would run in debt i considered that it was then time that it should be settled when i asked for it what was my surprise to find that it amounted to pounds shillings pence i declared that it was impossible and requested that she would allow me to look at the items when i found that i was booked for at least three or four dozen tarts every day ordered by the young gentlemen to be put down to mr simple's account i was very much shocked not only at the sum of money which i had to pay but also at the want of honesty on the part of my messmates but when i complained of it in the berth they all laughed at me at last one of them said peter tell the truth did not your father caution you not to run in debt yes he did replied i i know that very well replied he all fathers do the same when their sons leave them it's a matter of course now observe peter it is out of regard to you that your messmates have been eating tarts at your expense you disobeyed your father's injunctions before you had been a month from home and it is to give you a lesson that may be useful in after life that they have considered it their duty to order the tarts i trust that it will not be thrown away upon you go to the woman pay your bill and never run up another that i certainly shall not replied i but as i could not prove who ordered the tarts and did not think it fair that the woman should lose her money i went up and paid the bill with a determination never to open an account with anybody again but this left my pockets quite empty so i wrote to my father stating the whole transaction and the consequent state of my finances my father in his answer observed that whatever might have been their motives my messmates had done me a friendly act and that as i had lost my money by my own carelessness i must not expect that he would allow me any more pocket money but my mother who added a postscript to his letter slipped in a five pound note and i do believe that it was with my father's sanction although he pretended to be very angry at my forgetting his injunctions a few days before this mr falcon the first lieutenant ordered me to put on my side arms to go away on duty i replied that i had neither dirk nor cocked hat although i had applied for them he laughed at my story and sent me on shore with the master who bought them and the first lieutenant sent up the bill to my father who paid it and wrote to thank him for his trouble that morning the first lieutenant said to me now mr simple we'll take the shine off that cocked hat and dirk of yours you will go in the boat with mr o'brien and take care that none of the men slip away from it and get drunk at the tap this was the first time that i had ever been sent away on duty and i was very proud of being an officer in charge i put on my full uniform and was ready at the gangway a quarter of an hour before the men were piped away we were ordered to the dockyard to draw sea stores when we arrived there i was quite astonished at the piles of timber the ranges of storehouses and the immense anchors which lay on the wharf there was such a bustle everybody appeared to be so busy that i wanted to look every way at once close to where the boat landed they were hauling a large frigate out of what they called the basin and i was so interested with the sight that i am sorry to say i quite forgot all about the boat's crew and my orders to look after them two of the men belonging to the boat slipped away and on my return they were not to be seen i was very much frightened for i knew that i had neglected my duty and that on the first occasion on which i had been entrusted with responsible service what to do i did not know i ran up and down every part of the dock yard until i was quite out of breath asking every body i met whether they had seen my two men many of them said that they had seen plenty of men but did not exactly know mine some laughed and called me a greenhorn at last i met a midshipman who told me that he had seen two men answering to my description on the roof of the coach starting for london and that i must be quick if i wished to catch them but he would not stop to answer any more questions i was proceeding on very disconsolately when as i turned a corner to my great delight i met my two men who touched their hats and said that they had been looking for me i did not believe that they told the truth but i was so glad to recover them that i did not scold but went with them down to the boat which had been waiting some time for us o'brien the master's mate called me a young sculping a word i had never heard before when we arrived on board the first lieutenant asked o'brien why he had remained so long he answered that two of the men had left the boat but that i had found them the first lieutenant appeared to be pleased with me observing as he had said before that i was no fool and i went down below overjoyed at my good fortune and very much obliged to o'brien for not telling the whole truth a day or two afterwards we had a new messmate of the name of mcfoy i was on the quarter deck when he came on board and presented a letter to the captain inquiring first if his name was captain sauvage he was a florid young man nearly six feet high with sandy hair yet very good looking as his career in the service was very short i will tell at once what i did not find out till some time afterwards the captain had agreed to receive him to oblige a brother officer who had retired from the service and lived in the highlands of scotland the first notice which the captain had of the arrival of mr mcfoy was from a letter written to him by the young man's uncle this amused him so much that he gave it to the first lieutenant to read it ran as follows glasgow april th sir our much esteemed and mutual friend captain mcalpine having communicated by letter dated the th inst your kind intentions relative to my nephew sholto mcfoy for which you will be pleased to accept my best thanks i write to acquaint you that he is now on his way to join your ship the diomede and will arrive god willing twenty six hours after the receipt of this letter as i have been given to understand by those who have some acquaintance with the service of the king that his equipment as an officer will be somewhat expensive i have considered it but fair to ease your mind as to any responsibility on that score and have therefore enclosed the half of a bank of england note for ten pounds sterling number the other half of which will be duly forwarded in a frank promised to me the day after to morrow i beg you will make the necessary purchases and apply the balance should there be any to his mess account or any other expenses which you may consider warrantable or justifiable it is at the same time proper to inform you that sholto had ten shillings in his pocket at the time of his leaving glasgow the satisfactory expenditure of which i have no doubt you will inquire into as it is a large sum to be placed at the discretion of a youth only fourteen years and five months old i mention his age as sholto is so tall that you might be deceived by his appearance and be induced to trust to his prudence in affairs of this serious nature should he at any time require further assistance beyond his pay which i am told is extremely handsome to all king's officers i beg you to consider that any draft of yours at ten days' sight to the amount of five pounds sterling english will be duly honoured by the firm of monteith mckillop and company of glasgow sir with many thanks for your kindness and consideration i remain your most obedient walter monteith the letter brought on board by mcfoy was to prove his identity while the captain read it mcfoy stared about him like a wild stag the captain welcomed him to the ship asked him one or two questions introduced him to the first lieutenant and then went on shore the first lieutenant had asked me to dine in the gun room i supposed that he was pleased with me because i had found the men and when the captain pulled on shore he also invited mr mcfoy when the following conversation took place well mr mcfoy you have had a long journey i presume it is the first that you have ever made indeed it is sir replied mcfoy and sorely i've been pestered had i minded all they whispered in my lug as i came along i had need been made of money sax pence here sax pence there sax pence everywhere sich extortion i ne'er dreamt of how did you come from glasgow by the wheel boat or steam boat as they ca'd it to lunnon where they charged me sax pence for taking my baggage on shore a wee boxy nae bigger than yon cocked up hat i would fain carry it mysel' but they wudna let me how much of your ten shillings have you left inquired the first lieutenant smiling hoot sir lieutenant how came you for to ken that eh it's my uncle monteith at glasgow why as i sit here i've but three shillings and a penny of it left but there's a smell here that's no canny so i'll just go up again into the fresh air when mr mcfoy quitted the gun room they all laughed very much after he had been a short time on deck he went down into the midshipman's berth but he made himself very unpleasant quarrelling and wrangling with everybody it did not however last very long for he would not obey any orders that were given him on the third day he quitted the ship without asking the permission of the first lieutenant when he returned on board the following day the first lieutenant put him under an arrest and in charge of the sentry at the cabin door during the afternoon i was under the half deck and perceived that he was sharpening a long clasp knife upon the after truck of the gun i went up to him and asked him why he was doing so and he replied as his eyes flashed fire that it was to avenge the insult offered to the bluid of mcfoy his look told me that he was in earnest i was very much alarmed and thought it my duty to state his murderous intentions or worse might happen so i walked up on deck and told the first lieutenant what mcfoy was intending to do mr falcon laughed and shortly afterwards went down on the main deck mcfoy's eyes glistened and he walked forward to where the first lieutenant was standing but the sentry who had been cautioned by me kept him back with his bayonet the first lieutenant turned round and perceiving what was going on desired the sentry to see if mr mcfoy had a knife in his hands and he had it sure enough open and held behind his back he was disarmed and the first lieutenant perceiving that the lad meant mischief reported his conduct to the captain on his arrival on board the captain sent for mcfoy who was very obstinate and when taxed with his intentions would not deny it or even say that he would not again attempt it so he was sent on shore immediately and returned to his friends in the highlands we never saw any more of him but i heard that he obtained a commission in the army and three months after he had joined his regiment was killed in a duel resenting some fancied affront offered to the bluid of mcfoy chapter nine we post up to portsdown fair consequence of disturbing a lady at supper spontaneous combustion at ranelagh gardens pastry versus piety many are bid to the feast but not the halt the lame or the blind a few days after mcfoy quitted the ship we all had leave from the first lieutenant to go to portsdown fair but he would only allow the oldsters to sleep on shore we anticipated so much pleasure from our excursion that some of us were up early enough to go away in the boat sent for fresh beef we had our breakfast and went up george street where we found all sorts of vehicles ready to take us to the fair we got into one which they called a dilly i asked the man who drove it why it was so called and he replied because he only charged a shilling o'brien who had joined us after breakfasting on board said that this answer reminded him of one given to him by a man who attended the hackney coach stands in london pray said he why are you called waterman waterman replied the man vy sir 'cause we opens the hackney coach doors at last with plenty of whipping and plenty of swearing and a great deal of laughing the old horse whose back curved upwards like a bow from the difficulty of dragging so many arrived at the bottom of portsdown hill where we got out and walked up to the fair there was richardson with a clown and harlequin and such beautiful women dressed in clothes all over gold spangles dancing reels and waltzes and looking so happy there was flint and gyngell with fellows tumbling over head and heels playing such tricks eating fire and drawing yards of tape out of their mouths then there was the royal circus all the horses standing in a line with men and women standing on their backs waving flags while the trumpeters blew their trumpets we walked about for an hour or two seeing the outside of everything we determined to go and see the inside first we went into richardson's where we saw a bloody tragedy with a ghost and thunder and afterwards a pantomime full of tricks and tumbling over one another then we saw one or two other things i forget what but this i know that generally speaking the outside was better than the inside after this feeling very hungry we agreed to go into a booth and have something to eat the tables were ranged all round and in the centre there was a boarded platform for dancing the ladies were there all ready dressed for partners and the music was so lively that i felt very much inclined to dance but we had agreed to go and see the wild beasts fed at mr polito's menagerie and as it was now almost eight o'clock we paid our bill and set off it was a very curious sight and better worth seeing than anything in the fair i never had an idea that there were so many strange animals in existence there was the tapir a great pig with a long nose a variety of the hippopotamus which the keeper said was an amphibilious animal as couldn't live on land and dies in the water however it seemed to live very well in a cage then there was the kangaroo with its young ones peeping out of it a most astonishing animal the keeper said that it brought forth two young ones at a birth and then took them into its stomach again until they arrived at years of discretion then there was the pelican of the wilderness with a large bag under his throat which the man put on his head as a night cap this bird feeds its young with its own blood when fish are scarce there were a young elephant and three lions and several other animals which i forget now so i shall go on to describe the tragical scene which occurred the keeper had poked up all the animals and had commenced feeding them the great lion was growling and snarling over the shin bone of an ox cracking it like a nut when by some mismanagement one end of the pole upon which the chandelier was suspended fell down striking the door of the cage in which the lioness was at supper and bursting it open it was all done in a second the chandelier fell the cage opened and the lioness sprang out i remember to this moment seeing the body of the lioness in the air and then all was dark as pitch what a change not a moment before all of us staring with delight and curiosity and then to be left in darkness horror and dismay there was such screaming and shrieking such crying and fighting and pushing and fainting nobody knew where to go or how to find their way out the people crowded first on one side and then on the other as their fears instigated them i was very soon jammed up with my back against the bars of one of the cages and feeling some beast lay hold of me behind made a desperate effort and succeeded in climbing up to the cage above not however without losing the seat of my trowsers which the laughing hyaena would not let go i hardly knew where i was when i climbed up i was surmising what danger i should next encounter when to my joy i discovered that i had gained the open door from which the lioness had escaped i crawled in and pulled the door to after me thinking myself very fortunate and there i sat very quietly in a corner during the remainder of the noise and confusion i had been there but a few minutes when the beef eaters as they were called who played the music outside came in with torches and loaded muskets no one was seriously hurt as for the lioness she was not to be found and as soon as it was ascertained that she had escaped there was as much terror and scampering away outside as there had been in the menagerie it appeared afterwards that the animal had been as much frightened as we had been and had secreted herself under one of the waggons it was some time before she could be found at last o'brien who was a very brave fellow went a head of the beef eaters and saw her eyes glaring they borrowed a net or two from the carts which had brought calves to the fair and threw them over her when she was fairly entangled they dragged her by the tail into the menagerie all this while i had remained very quietly in the den but when i perceived that its lawful owner had come back to retake possession i thought it was time to come out so i called to my messmates who with o'brien were assisting the beef eaters they had not discovered me and laughed very much when they saw where i was one of the midshipmen shot the bolt of the door so that i could not jump out and then stirred me up with a long pole at last i contrived to unbolt it again and got out when they laughed still more at the seat of my trowsers being torn off it was not exactly a laughing matter to me although i had to congratulate myself upon a very lucky escape and so did my messmates think when i narrated my adventures o'brien lent me a dark silk handkerchief which i tied round my waist and let drop behind so that my misfortunes might not attract any notice we then went to what they called the ranelagh gardens to see the fireworks which were to be let off at ten o'clock it was exactly ten when we paid for our admission and we waited very patiently for a quarter of an hour but there were no signs of the fireworks being displayed the fact was that the man to whom the gardens belonged waited until more company should arrive although the place was already very full of people now the first lieutenant had ordered the boat to wait for us until twelve o'clock and then return on board and as we were seven miles from portsmouth we had not much time to spare we waited another quarter of an hour and then it was agreed that as the fireworks were stated in the handbill to commence precisely at ten o'clock we were fully justified in letting them off ourselves o'brien went out and returned with a dozen penny rattans which he notched in the end the fireworks were on the posts and stages all ready and it was agreed that we should light them all at once and then mix with the crowd the oldsters lighted cigars and fixing them in the notched end of the canes continued to puff them until they were all well lighted they handed one to each of us and at a signal we all applied them to the match papers and as soon as the fire communicated we threw down our canes and ran in among the crowd in about half a minute off they all went in the most beautiful confusion there were silver stars and golden stars blue lights and catherine wheels mines and bombs grecian fires and roman candles chinese trees rockets and illuminated mottoes all firing away cracking popping and fizzing at the same time we all escaped very cleverly and taking another dilly arrived at portsmouth and were down to the boat in good time sunday being a fine day we all went on shore to church with mr falcon the first lieutenant we liked going to church very much not i am sorry to say from religious feelings but for the following reason the first lieutenant sat in a pew below and we were placed in the gallery above where he could not see us nor indeed could we see him we all remained very quiet and i may say very devout during the time of the service but the clergyman who delivered the sermon was so tedious and had such a bad voice that we generally slipped out as soon as he went up into the pulpit and adjourned to a pastrycook's opposite to eat cakes and tarts and drink cherry brandy which we infinitely preferred to hearing a sermon somehow or other the first lieutenant had scented our proceedings we believed that the marine officer informed against us and this sunday he served us a pretty trick we had been at the pastry cook's as usual and as soon as we perceived the people coming out of church we put all our tarts and sweetmeats into our hats which we then slipped on our heads and took our station at the church door as if we had just come down from the gallery and had been waiting for him instead however of appearing at the church door he walked up the street and desired us to follow him to the boat the fact was he had been in the back room at the pastry cook's watching our motions through the green blinds we had no suspicion but thought that he had come out of church a little sooner than usual when we arrived on board and followed him up the side he said to us as we came on deck walk aft young gentlemen we did and he desired us to toe a line which means to stand in a row now mr dixon said he what was the text today as he very often asked us that question we always left one in the church until the text was given out who brought it to us in the pastrycook's shop when we all marked it in our bibles to be ready if he asked us dixon immediately pulled out his bible where he had marked down the leaf and read it o that was it said mr falcon you must have remarkably good ears mr dixon to have heard the clergyman from the pastry cook's shop now gentlemen hats off if you please we all slided off our hats which as he expected were full of pastry really gentlemen said he feeling the different papers of pastry and sweetmeats i am quite delighted to perceive that you have not been to church for nothing few come away with so many good things pressed upon their seat of memory master at arms send all the ship's boys aft the boys all came tumbling up the ladders and the first lieutenant desired each of them to take a seat upon the carronade slides when they were all stationed he ordered us to go round with our hats and request of each his acceptance of a tart which we were obliged to do handing first to one and then to another until the hats were all empty what annoyed me more than all was the grinning of the boys at their being served by us like footmen as well as the ridicule and laughter of the whole ship's company who had assembled at the gangways when all the pastry was devoured the first lieutenant said there gentlemen now that you have had your lesson for the day you may go below we could not help laughing ourselves when we went down into the berth chapter ten a press gang beaten off by one woman dangers at spithead and point a treat for both parties of pulled chicken at my expense also gin for twenty i am made a prisoner escape and rejoin my ship i must now relate what occurred to me a few days before the ship sailed we were reported ready for sea and the admiralty was anxious that we should proceed the only obstacle to our sailing was that we had not yet completed our complement of men the captain applied to the port admiral and obtained permission to send parties on shore to impress seamen the second and third lieutenants and the oldest midshipmen were despatched on shore every night with some of the most trustworthy men and generally brought on board in the morning about half a dozen men whom they had picked up in the different alehouses or grog shops as the sailors call them i had a great wish to be one of the party before the ship sailed and asked o'brien who was very kind to me in general and allowed nobody to thrash me but himself if he would take me with him which he did on the night after i had made the request i put on my dirk that they might know i was an officer as well as for my protection about dusk we rowed on shore and landed on the gosport side the men were all armed with cutlasses and wore pea jackets which are very short great coats made of what they call flushing we did not stop to look at any of the grog shops in the town as it was too early but walked out about three miles in the suburbs and went to a house the door of which was locked but we forced it open in a minute and hastened to enter the passage where we found the landlady standing to defend the entrance the passage was long and narrow and she was a very tall corpulent woman so that her body nearly filled it up and in her hands she held a long spit pointed at us with which she kept us at bay the officers who were the foremost did not like to attack a woman and she made such drives at them with her spit that had they not retreated some of them would soon have been ready for roasting the sailors laughed and stood outside leaving the officers to settle the business how they could at last the landlady called out to her husband be they all out jem yes replied the husband they be all safe gone well then replied she i'll soon have all these gone too and with these words she made such rush forward upon us with her spit that had we not fallen back and tumbled one over another she certainly would have run it through the second lieutenant who commanded the party the passage was cleared in an instant and as soon as we were all in the street she bolted us out so there we were three officers and fifteen armed men fairly beat off by a fat old woman the sailors who had been drinking in the house having made their escape to some other place we then called at other houses where we picked up one or two men but most of them escaped by getting out at the windows or the back doors as we entered the front now there was a grog shop which was a very favourite rendezvous of the seamen belonging to the merchant vessels and to which they were accustomed to retreat when they heard that the press gangs were out our officers were aware of this and were therefore indifferent as to the escape of the men as they knew that they would all go to that place and confide in their numbers for beating us off as it was then one o'clock they thought it time to go there we proceeded without any noise but they had people on the look out and as soon as we turned the corner of the lane the alarm was given i was afraid that they would all run away and we should lose them but on the contrary they mustered very strong on that night and had resolved to give fight the men remained in the house but an advanced guard of about thirty of their wives saluted us with a shower of stones and mud some of our sailors were hurt but they did not appear to mind what the women did they rushed on and then they were attacked by the women with their fists and nails notwithstanding this the sailors only laughed pushing the women on one side and saying be quiet poll don't be foolish molly out of the way sukey we a'n't come to take away your fancy man with expressions of that sort although the blood trickled down many of their faces from the way in which they had been clawed we at length got into the house the seamen of the merchant ships had armed themselves with bludgeons and other weapons and had taken a position on the tables they were more than two to one against us and there was a dreadful fight as their resistance was very desperate our sailors were obliged to use their cutlasses and for a few minutes i was quite bewildered with the shouting and swearing pushing and scuffling collaring and fighting together with the dust raised up which not only blinded but nearly choked me by the time that my breath was nearly squeezed out of my body our sailors got the best of it which the landlady and women of the house perceiving they put out all the lights so that i could not tell where i was but our sailors had every one seized his man and contrived to haul him out of the street door where they were collected together and secured now again i was in great difficulty i had been knocked down and trod upon and when i did contrive to get up again i did not know the direction in which the door lay i felt about by the wall and at last came to a door for the room at that time was nearly empty the women having followed the men out of the house i opened it and found that it was not the right one but led into a little side parlour where there was a fire but no lights i had just discovered my mistake and was about to retreat when i was shoved in from behind and the key turned upon me there i was all alone and i must acknowledge very much frightened as i thought that the vengeance of the women would be wreaked upon me i peeped through the key hole and perceived that the candles were re lighted and that there were only women in the room who were talking all at once and not thinking about me but in a minute or two a women came in from the street with her long black hair hanging about her shoulders and her cap in her hand well cried she they've nabbed my husband but i'll be dished if i hav'n't boxed up the midship mite in that parlour and he shall take his place i thought i should have died when i looked at the woman and perceived her coming up to the door followed by some others to unlock it as the door opened i drew my dirk resolving to die like an officer and as they advanced i retreated to a corner brandishing my dirk without saying a word vell cried the woman who had made me a prisoner i do declare i likes to see a puddle in a storm only look at the little biscuit nibbler showing fight come my lovey you belongs to me never exclaimed i with indignation keep off or i shall do you mischief and i raised my dirk in advance i am an officer and a gentleman sall cried the odious woman fetch a mop and a pail of dirty water and i'll trundle that dirk out of his fist no no replied another rather good looking young woman leave him to me don't hurt him he really is a very nice little man what's your name my dear peter simple is my name replied i and i am a king's officer so he careful what you are about don't be afraid peter nobody shall hurt you but you must not draw your dirk before ladies that's not like an officer and a gentleman so put up your dirk that's a good boy i will not replied i unless you promise me that i shall go away unmolested i do promise you that you shall upon my word but recollect peter that you are an officer and a gentleman you surely would not be so shabby as to go away without treating us what money have you got in your pocket and without giving me time to answer she felt in my pocket and pulled out my purse which she opened why peter you are as rich as a jew said she as they counted thirty shillings on the table now what shall we have anything you please said i provided that you will let me go well then it shall be a gallon of gin sall call mrs flanagan mrs flanagan we want a gallon of gin and clean glasses mrs flanagan received the major part of my money and in a minute returned with the gin and wine glasses now peter my cove let's all draw round the table and make ourselves cosy o no replied i take my money drink the gin but pray let me go but they wouldn't listen to me then i was obliged to sit down with them the gin was poured out and they made me drink a glass which nearly choked me it had however one good effect it gave me courage and in a minute or two i felt as if i could fight them all the door of the room was on the same side as the fire place and i perceived that the poker was between the bars and red hot i complained that it was cold although i was in a burning fever and they allowed me to get up to warm my hands as soon as i reached the fire place i snatched out the red hot poker and brandishing it over my head made for the door they all jumped up to detain me but i made a poke at the foremost which made her run back with a shriek i do believe that i burnt her nose i seized my opportunity and escaped into the street whirling the poker round my head while all the women followed hooting and shouting after me i never stopped running and whirling my poker until i was reeking with perspiration and the poker was quite cold then i looked back and found that i was alone it was very dark every house was shut up and not a light to be seen anywhere i stopped at the corner not knowing where i was or what i was to do i felt very miserable indeed and was reflecting on my wisest plan when who should turn the corner but one of the quarter masters who had been left on shore by accident i knew him by his pea jacket and straw hat to be one of our men and i was delighted to see him i told him what had happened and he replied that he was going to a house where the people knew him and would let him in when we arrived there the people of the house were very civil the landlady made us some purl which the quartermaster ordered and which i thought very good indeed after we had finished the jug we both fell asleep in our chairs i did not awaken until i was roused by the quarter master at past seven o'clock when we took a wherry and went off to the ship chapter eleven o'brien takes me under his protection the ship's company are paid so are the bumboat women the jews and the emancipationist after a fashion we go to sea doctor o'brien's cure for sea sickness one pill of the doctor's more than a dose when we arrived i reported myself to the first lieutenant and told him the whole story of the manner in which i had been treated showing him the poker which i brought on board with me he heard me very patiently and then said mr simple you maybe the greatest fool of your family for all i know to the contrary but never pretend to be a fool with me that poker proves the contrary and if your wit can serve you upon your own emergency i expect that it will be employed for the benefit of the service he then sent for o'brien and gave him a lecture for allowing me to go with the press gang pointing out what was very true that i could have been of no service and might have met with a serious accident at last the frigate was full manned and as we had received drafts of men from other ships we were ordered to be paid previously to our going to sea the people on shore always find out when a ship is to be paid and very early in the morning we were surrounded with wherries laden with jews and other people some requesting admittance to sell their goods others to get paid for what they had allowed the sailors to take up upon credit but the first lieutenant would not allow any of them to come on board until after the ship was paid although they were so urgent that he was forced to place sentries in the chains with cold shot to stave the boats if they came alongside about eleven o'clock the dock yard boat with all the pay clerks and the cashier with his chest of money came on board and was shown into the fore cabin where the captain attended the pay table the men were called in one by one and as the amount and wages due had been previously calculated they were paid very fast the money was always received in their hats after it had been counted out in the presence of the officers and captain outside the cabin door there stood a tall man in black with hair straight combed who had obtained an order from the port admiral to be permitted to come on board he attacked every sailor as he came out with his money in his hat for a subscription to emancipate the slaves in the west indies but the sailors would not give him anything swearing that the niggers were better off than they were for they did not work harder by day and had no watch and watch to keep during the night sarvitude is sarvitude all over the world my old psalm singer replied one they sarve their masters as in duty bound we sarve the king 'cause he can't do without us and he never axes our leave but helps himself then the purser's steward came out he was what they call a bit of a lawyer that is had received more education than the seamen in general i trust sir said the man in black that you will contribute something not i my hearty i owe every farthing of my money and more too i'm afraid still sir a small trifle why what an infernal rascal you must be to ask a man to give away what is not his own property did i not tell you that i owed it all there's an old proverb be just before you're generous now it's my opinion that you are a methodistical good for nothing blackguard and if any one is such a fool as to give you money you will keep it for yourself when the man found that he could obtain nothing at the door he went down on the lower deck and commenced distributing prints of a black man kneeling in chains and saying am not i your brother some of the men laughed and swore that they would paste their brother up in the mess to say prayers for the ship's company but others were very angry and abused him at last one man who was tipsy came up to him do you pretend for to insinivate that this crying black thief is my brother to be sure i do replied the methodist then take that for your infernal lie said the sailor hitting him in the face right and left and knocking the man down into the cable tier from whence he climbed up and made his escape out of the frigate as soon as he was able the ship was now in a state of confusion and uproar there were jews trying to sell clothes or to obtain money for clothes which they had sold bumboat men and bumboat women showing their long bills and demanding or coaxing for payment other people from the shore with hundreds of small debts and the sailors' wives sticking close to them and disputing every bill presented as an extortion or a robbery there were such bawling and threatening laughing and crying for the women were all to quit the ship before sunset at one moment a jew was upset and all his hamper of clothes tossed into the hold at another a sailor was seen hunting everywhere for a jew who had cheated him all squabbling or skylarking and many of them very drunk it appeared to me that the sailors had rather a difficult point to settle they had three claimants upon them the jew for clothes the bumboat men for their mess in harbour and their wives for their support during their absence and the money which they received was generally speaking not more than sufficient to meet one of the demands as it may be supposed the women had the best of it the others were paid a trifle and promised the remainder when they came back from their cruise about five o'clock the orders were given for the ship to be cleared all disputed points were settled by the sergeant of marines with a party who divided their antagonists from the jews and every description of persons not belonging to the ship whether male or female was dismissed over the side the hammocks were piped down those who were intoxicated were put to bed and the ship was once more quiet the next day everything was prepared for sea and no leave was permitted to the officers stock of every kind was brought on board and the large boats hoisted and secured on the morning after at day light a signal from the flag ship in harbour was made for us to unmoor our orders had come down to cruise in the bay of biscay the captain came on board the anchor weighed and we ran through the needles with a fine ne breeze what occurred for the next six days i cannot tell i thought that i should die every moment and lay in my hammock or on the chests for the whole of that time incapable of eating drinking or walking about o'brien came to me on the seventh morning and said that if i did not exert myself i never should get well that he was very fond of me and had taken me under his protection and to prove his regard he would do for me what he would not take the trouble to do for any other youngster in the ship which was to give me a good basting which was a sovereign remedy for sea sickness he suited the action to the word and drubbed me on the ribs without mercy until i thought the breath was out of my body and then he took out a rope's end and thrashed me until i obeyed his orders to go on deck immediately before he came to me i could never have believed it possible that i could have obeyed him but somehow or another i did contrive to crawl up the ladder to the main deck where i sat down on the shot racks and cried bitterly but by degrees i recovered myself and certainly felt a great deal better and that night i slept very soundly the next morning o'brien came to me again it's a nasty slow fever that sea sickness my peter and we must drive it out of you and then he commenced a repetition of yesterday's remedy until i was almost a jelly whether the fear of being thrashed drove away my sea sickness or whatever might be the real cause of it i do not know but this is certain that i felt no more of it after the second beating and the next morning when i awoke i was very hungry i hastened to dress myself before o'brien came to me and did not see him until we met at breakfast pater said he let me feel your pulse o no replied i indeed i'm quite well quite well can you eat biscuit and salt butter yes i can and a piece of fat pork yes that i can it's thanks to me then pater replied he so you'll have no more of my medicine until you fall sick again i hope not replied i for it was not very pleasant pleasant you simple simon when did you ever hear of physic being pleasant unless a man prescribe for himself i suppose you'd be after lollipops for the yellow fever live and larn boy and thank heaven that you've found somebody who loves you well enough to baste you when it's good for your health i held my tongue and ate a very hearty breakfast from that day i returned to my duty and was put into the same watch with o'brien who spoke to the first lieutenant and told him that he had taken me under his charge chapter twelve new theory of mr muddle remarkable for having no end to it novel practice of mr chucks o'brien commences his history i bring up the master's night glass as i have already mentioned sufficient of the captain and the first lieutenant to enable the reader to gain an insight into their characters i shall now mention two very odd personages who were my shipmates the carpenter and the boatswain the carpenter whose name was muddle used to go by the appellation of philosopher chips not that he followed any particular school but had formed a theory of his own from which he was not to be dissuaded this was that the universe had its cycle of events which turned round so that in a certain period of time everything was to happen over again i never could make him explain upon what data his calculations were founded he said that if he explained it i was too young to comprehend it but the fact was this that in years everything that was going on now would be going on again with the same people as were existing at this present time he very seldom ventured to make the remark to captain savage but to the first lieutenant he did very often i've been as close to it as possible sir i do assure you although you find fault but years ago you were first lieutenant of this ship and i was carpenter although we recollect nothing about it and years hence we shall both be standing by this boat talking about the repairs as we are now i do not doubt it mr muddle replied the first lieutenant i dare say that it is all very true but the repairs must be finished this night and years hence you will have the order just as positive as you have it now so let it be done but the boatswain was a more amusing personage he was considered to be the taughtest that is the most active and severe boatswain in the service he went by the name of gentleman chucks the latter was his surname he appeared to have received half an education sometimes his language was for a few sentences remarkably well chosen but all of a sudden he would break down at a hard word but i shall be able to let the reader into more of his history as i go on with my adventures he had a very handsome person inclined to be stout keen eyes and hair curling in ringlets he held his head up and strutted as he walked he declared that an officer should look like an officer and comport himself accordingly in his person he was very clean wore rings on his great fingers and a large frill to his bosom which stuck out like the back fin of a perch and the collar of his shirt was always pulled up to a level with his cheek bones he never appeared on deck without his persuader which was three rattans twisted into one like a cable sometimes he called it his order of the bath or his trio juncto in uno and this persuader was seldom idle he attempted to be very polite even when addressing the common seamen and certainly he always commenced his observations to them in a very gracious manner but as he continued he became less choice in his phraseology as a specimen of them he would say to the man on the forecastle allow me to observe my dear man in the most delicate way in the world that you are spilling that tar upon the deck a deck sir if i may venture to make the observation i had the duty of seeing holystoned this morning you understand me sir you have defiled his majesty's forecastle i must do my duty sir if you neglect yours so take that and that and that thrashing the man with his rattan you damned haymaking son of a seacook do it again damn your eyes and i'll cut your liver out the master was the officer who had charge of the watch to which i was stationed he was a very rough sailor who had been brought up in the merchant service not much of a gentleman in his appearance very good tempered and very fond of grog he always quarrelled with the boatswain and declared that the service was going to the devil now that warrant officers put on white shirts and wore frills to them but the boatswain did not care for him he knew his duty he did his duty and if the captain was satisfied he said that the whole ship's company might grumble the master was very kind to me and used to send me down to my hammock before my watch was half over until that time i walked the deck with o'brien who was a very pleasant companion and taught me everything that he could connected with my profession one night when he had the middle watch i told him i should like very much if he would give me the history of his life that i will my honey replied he all that i can remember of it though i have no doubt but that i've forgotten the best part of it it's now within five minutes of two bells so we'll heave the log and mark the board and then i'll spin you a yarn which will keep us both from going to sleep o'brien reported the rate of sailing to the master marked it down on the log board and then returned so now my boy i'll come to an anchor on the top sail halyard rack and you may squeeze your thread paper little carcass under my lee and then i'll tell you all about it first and foremost you must know that i am descended from the great o'brien borru who was a king in his time but that time's past i suppose as the world turns round my children's children's posterity may be kings again although there seems but little chance of it just now but there's ups and downs on a grand scale as well as in a man's own history and the wheel of fortune keeps turning for the comfort of those who are at the lowest spoke as i may be just now to cut the story a little shorter i skip down to my great grandfather who lived like a real gentleman as he was upon his ten thousand a year at last he died and eight thousand of the ten was buried with him my grandfather followed his father all in good course of time and only left my father about one hundred acres of bog to keep up the dignity of the family i am the youngest of ten and devil a copper have i but my pay or am i likely to have you may talk about descent but a more descending family than mine was never in existence for here am i with twenty five pounds a year and a half pay of nothing a day and find myself' when my great ancestor did just what he pleased with all ireland and everybody in it father mcgrath the priest who lived with my father taught me the elements as they call them i thought i had enough of the elements then but i've seen a deal more of them since terence' says my father to me one day what do you mane to do' to get my dinner sure' replied i for i was not a little hungry and so you shall to day my vourneen' replied my father but in future you must do something to get your own dinner there's not praties enow for the whole of ye will you go to the say' i'll just step down and look at it' says i for we lived but sixteen irish miles from the coast so when i had finished my meal which did not take long for want of ammunition i trotted down to the cove to see what a ship might be like and i happened upon a large one sure enough for there lay a three decker with an admiral's flag at the fore maybe you'll be so civil as to tell me what ship that is' said i to a sailor on the pier it's the queen charlotte' replied he of one hundred and twenty guns' now when i looked at her size and compared her with all the little smacks and hoys lying about her i very naturally asked how old she was he replied that she was no more than three years old but three years old' thought i to myself it's a fine vessel you'll be when you'll come of age if you grow at that rate you'll be as tall as the top of bencrow' that's a mountain we have in our parts i went back to my father and told him all i had seen and he replied that if i liked it i might be a midshipman on board of her with nine hundred men under my command he forgot to say how many i should have over me but i found that out afterwards i agreed and my father ordered his pony and went to the lord lieutenant for he had interest enough for that the lord lieutenant spoke to the admiral who was staying at the palace and i was ordered on board as midshipman my father fitted me out pretty handsomely telling all the tradesmen that their bills should be paid with my first prize money and thus by promises and blarney he got credit for all i wanted at last all was ready father mcgrath gave me his blessing and told me that if i died like an o'brien he would say a power of masses for the good of my soul so after a deal of bother i was fairly on board and i parted company with my chest for i stayed on deck and that went down below i stared about with all my eyes for some time when who should be coming off but the captain and the officers were ordered on deck to receive him i wanted to have a quiet survey of him so i took up my station on one of the guns that i might examine him at my leisure the boatswain whistled the marines presented arms and the officers all took off their hats as the captain came on the deck and then the guard was dismissed and they all walked about the deck as before but i found it very pleasant to be astride on the gun so i remained where i was what do you mane by that you big young scoundrel' says he when he saw me it's nothing at all i mane' replied i but what do you mane by calling an o'brien a scoundrel' who is he' said the captain to the first lieutenant mr o'brien who joined the ship about an hour since' don't you know better than to sit upon a gun' said the captain to be sure i do' replied i when there's anything better to sit upon' he knows no better sir' observed the first lieutenant then he must be taught' replied the captain mr o'brien since you have perched yourself on that gun to please yourself you will now continue there for two hours to please me do you understand sir you'll ride on that gun for two hours' i understand sir' replied i but i am afraid that he won't move without spurs although there's plenty of metal in him' the captain turned away and laughed as he went into his cabin and all the officers laughed and i laughed too for i perceived no great hardship in sitting down an hour or two any more than i do now well i soon found that like a young bear all my troubles were to come i got into a scrape just before we left harbour it was my watch when they piped to dinner and i took the liberty to run below as my messmates had a knack of forgetting absent friends well the captain came on board and there were no side boys no side ropes and no officers to receive him he came on deck foaming with rage for his dignity was hurt and he inquired who was the midshipman of the watch mr o'brien' said they all devil a bit' replied i it was my forenoon watch' who relieved you sir' said the first lieutenant devil a soul sir' replied i for they were all too busy with their pork and beef' then why did you leave the deck without relief' because sir my stomach would have had but little relief if i had remained' the captain who stood by said do you see those cross trees sir' is it those little bits of wood that you mane on the top there captain' yes sir now just go up there and stay until i call you down you must be brought up to your senses young man or you'll have but little prospect in the service' i've an idea that i'll have plenty of prospect when i get up there' replied i but it's all to please you' so up i went as i have many a time since and as you often will peter just to enjoy the fresh air and your own pleasant thoughts all at one and the same time the first time that i put my foot on shore was at minorca several of us went on shore and having dined upon a roast turkey stuffed with plum pudding and having drunk as much wine as would float a jolly boat we ordered donkeys to take a little equestrian exercise some went off tail on end some with their hind quarters uppermost and then the riders went off instead of the donkeys some wouldn't go off at all as for mine he would go and where the devil do you think he went why into the church where all the people were at mass the poor brute was dying with thirst and smelt water as soon as he was in notwithstanding all my tugging and hauling he ran his nose into the holy water font and drank it all up they rose up from their knees and seized me calling upon all the saints in the calendar although i knew what they meant not a word of their lingo could i speak to plead for my life and i was almost torn to pieces before the priest came up perceiving the danger i was in i wiped my finger across the wet nose of the donkey crossed myself and then went down on my knees to the priests crying out culpa mea as all good catholics do though 'twas no fault of mine as i said before for i tried all i could and tugged at the brute till my strength was gone the priests perceived by the manner in which i crossed myself that i was a good catholic and guessed that it was all a mistake of the donkey's they ordered the crowd to be quiet and sent for an interpreter when i explained the whole story they gave me absolution for what the donkey had done and after that as it was very rare to meet an english officer who was a good christian i was in great favour during my stay at minorca and was living in plenty paying for nothing and as happy as a cricket so the jackass proved a very good friend and to reward him i hired him every day and galloped him all over the island but at last it occurred to me that i had broken my leave for i was so happy on shore that i quite forgot that i had only permission for twenty four hours and i should not have remembered it so soon had it not been for a party of marines headed by a sergeant who took me by the collar and dragged me off my donkey i was taken on board and put under an arrest for my misconduct sail on the starboard bow cried the look out man very well replied the master mr o'brien where's mr o'brien is it me you mane sir said o'brien walking up to the master for he had sat down so long in the topsail halyard rack that he was wedged in and could not get out immediately yes sir go forward and see what that vessel is ay ay sir said o'brien and mr simple continued the master go down and bring me up my night glass yes sir replied i i had no idea of a night glass and as i observed that about this time his servant brought him up a glass of grog i thought it very lucky that i knew what he meant take care that you don't break it mr simple o then i'm all right thought i he means the tumbler so down i went called up the gunroom steward and desired him to give me a glass of grog for mr doball the steward tumbled out in his shirt mixed the grog and gave it to me and i carried it up very carefully to the quarter deck during my absence the master had called the captain and in pursuance of his orders o'brien had called the first lieutenant and when i came up the ladder they were both on deck as i was ascending i heard the master say i have sent young simple down for my night glass but he is so long that i suppose he has made some mistake he's but half a fool that i deny replied mr falcon the first lieutenant just as i put my foot on the quarter deck he's no fool perhaps not replied the master o here he is what made you so long mr simple where is my night glass here it is sir replied i handing him the tumbler of grog i told the steward to make it stiff the captain and the first lieutenant burst out into a laugh for mr doball was known to be very fond of grog the former walked aft to conceal his mirth but the latter remained mr doball was in a great rage did i not say that the boy was half a fool cried he to the first lieutenant at all events i'll not allow that he has proved himself so in this instance replied mr falcon for he has hit the right nail on the head then the first lieutenant joined the captain and they both went off laughing put it on the capstan sir said mr doball to me in an angry voice i'll punish you by and by i was very much astonished i hardly knew whether i had done right or wrong at all events thought i to myself i did for the best so i put it on the capstan and walked to my own side of the deck the captain and first lieutenant then went below and o'brien came aft i told him what had occurred and how the master was angry with me o'brien laughed very heartily and told me never to mind but to keep in the lee scuppers and watch him a glass of grog is a bait that he'll play round till he gorges when you see it to his lips go up to him boldly and ask his pardon if you have offended him and then if he's a good christian as i believe him to be he'll not refuse it i thought this was very good advice and i waited under the bulwark on the lee side i observed that the master made shorter and shorter turns every time till at last he stopped at the capstan and looked at the grog he waited about half a minute and then he took up the tumbler and drank about half of it it was very strong and he stopped to take breath i thought that this was the right time and i went up to him the tumbler was again to his lips and before he saw me i said i hope sir you'll forgive me i never heard of a night telescope and knowing that you had walked so long i thought you were tired and wanted something to drink to refresh you well mr simple said he after he had finished the glass with a deep sigh of pleasure as you meant kindly i shall let you off this time but recollect that whenever you bring me a glass of grog again it must not be in the presence of the captain or first lieutenant at last our watch was over and about two bells i was relieved by the midshipman of the next watch it is very unfair not to relieve in time but if i said a word i was certain to be thrashed the next day upon some pretence or another on the other hand the midshipman whom i relieved was also much bigger than i was and if i was not up before one bell i was cut down and thrashed by him so that between the two i kept much more than my share of the watch except when the master sent me to bed before it was over chapter thirteen the first lieutenant prescribes for one of his patients his prescriptions consisting of draughts only o'brien finishes the history of his life in which the proverb of the more the merrier is sadly disproved shipping a new pair of boots causes the unshipping of their owner walking home after a ball o'brien meets with an accident the next morning i was on deck at seven bells to see the hammocks stowed when i was witness to mr falcon the first lieutenant having recourse to one of his remedies to cure a mizen top boy of smoking a practice to which he had a great aversion he never interfered with the men smoking in the galley or chewing tobacco but he prevented the boys that is lads under twenty or thereabouts from indulging in the habit too early the first lieutenant smelt the tobacco as the boy passed him on the quarter deck why neill you have been smoking said the first lieutenant i thought you were aware that i did not permit such lads as you to use tobacco if you please sir replied the mizen top boy touching his hat i'se got worms and they say that smoking be good for them good for them said the first lieutenant yes very good for them but very bad for you why my good fellow they'll thrive upon tobacco until they grow as large as conger eels heat is what the worms are fond of but cold cold will kill them now i'll cure you quarter master come here walk this boy up and down the weather gangway and every time you get forward abreast of the main tack block put his mouth to windward squeeze him sharp by the nape of the neck until he opens his mouth wide and there keep him and let the cold air blow down his throat while you count ten then walk him aft and when you are forward again proceed as before cold kills worms my poor boy not tobacco i wonder that you are not dead by this time a few nights afterwards when we had the middle watch o'brien proceeded with his story where was it that i left off you left off at the time that you were taken out of confinement so i did sure enough and it was with no goodwill that i went to my duty however as there was no help for it i walked up and down the deck as before with my hands in my pockets thinking of old ireland and my great ancestor brien borru and so i went on behaving myself like a real gentleman and getting into no more scrapes until the fleet put into the cove of cork and i found myself within a few miles of my father's house you may suppose that the anchor had hardly kissed the mud before i went to the first lieutenant and asked leave to go on shore now the first lieutenant was not in the sweetest of tempers seeing as how the captain had been hauling him over the coals for not carrying on the duty according to his satisfaction so he answered me very gruffly that i should not leave the ship o bother' said i to myself this will never do' so up i walked to the captain and touching my hat reminded him that i had a father and mother and a pretty sprinkling of brothers and sisters who were dying to see me and that i hoped that he would give me leave' ax the first lieutenant' said he turning away i have sir' replied i and he says that the devil a bit shall i put my foot on shore' have you any fault to find with mr o'brien' said the captain to the first lieutenant as he came aft no more than i have with midshipmen in general but i believe it is not the custom for officers to ask leave to go on shore before the sails are furled and the yards squared' very true' replied the captain therefore mr o'brien you must wait until the watch is called and then if you ask the first lieutenant i have no doubt but you will have leave granted to you to go and see your friends' i thought myself very clever in this business but i was never a greater fool in my life for there was no such hurry to have gone on shore and the first lieutenant never forgave me for appealing to the captain but of that by and bye and all in good time at last i obtained a grumbling assent to my going on shore and off i went like a sky rocket being in a desperate hurry i hired a jaunting car to take me to my father's house is it the o'brien of ballyhinch that you mane' inquired the spalpeen who drove the horse sure it is' replied i and how is he and all the noble family of the o'briens' all well enough bating the boy tim who caught a bit of confusion in his head the other night at the fair and now lies at home in bed quite insensible to mate or drink but the doctors give hopes of his recovery as all the o'briens are known to have such thick heads' what do mane by that bad manners to you' said i but poor tim how did it happen was there a fight' not much of a fight only a bit of a skrummage three crowner's inquests no more' but you are not going the straight road you thief' said i seeing that he had turned off to the left is your honour in a hurry to get home then i'll be thinking they'll not be in such a hurry to see you' and who told you that my name was o'brien you baste and do you dare to say that my friends won't be glad to see me' plase your honour it's all an idea of mine so say no more about it only this i know father mcgrath who gives me absolution tould me the other day that i ought to pay him and not run in debt and then run away like terence o'brien who went to say without paying for his shirts and his shoes and his stockings nor anything else and who would live to be hanged as sure as st patrick swam over the liffey with his head under his arm' bad luck to that father mcgrath' cried i devil burn me but i'll be revenged upon him' by that time we had arrived at the door of my father's house i paid the rapparee and in i popped there was my father and mother and all my brothers and sisters bating tim who was in bed sure enough and died next day and that baste father mcgrath to boot when my mother saw me she ran to me and hugged me as she wept on my neck and then she wiped her eyes and sat down again but nobody else said how d'ye do' or opened their mouths to me i said to myself sure there's some trifling mistake here' but i held my tongue at last they all opened their mouths with a vengeance my father commenced ar'n't you ashamed on yourself terence o'brien' ar'n't you ashamed on yourself terence o'brien' cried father mcgrath ar'n't you ashamed on yourself' cried out all my brothers and sisters in full chorus whilst my poor mother put her apron to her eyes and said nothing the devil a bit for myself but very much ashamed for you all' replied i to treat me in this manner what's the meaning of all this' haven't they seized my two cows to pay for your toggery you spalpeen' cried my father haven't they taken the hay to pay for your shoes and stockings' cried father mcgrath haven't they taken the pig to pay for that ugly hat of yours' cried my eldest sister and haven't they taken my hens to pay for that dirk of yours' cried another and all our best furniture to pay for your white shirts and black cravats' cried murdock my brother and haven't we been starved to death ever since' cried they all och hone' said my mother the devil they have' said i when they'd all done sure i'm sorry enough but it's no fault of mine father didn't you send me to say' yes you rapparee but didn't you promise or didn't i promise for you which is all one and the same thing that you'd pay it all back with your prize money and where is it answer that terence o'brien' where is it father i'll tell you it's where next christmas is coming but not come yet' terence o'brien' said father mcgrath its absolution that you'll be wanting to morrow after all your sins and enormities and the devil a bit shall you have take that now' father mcgrath' replied i very angrily it's no absolution that i'll want from you any how take that now' then you have had your share of heaven for i'll keep you out of it you wicked monster' said father mcgrath take that now' if it's no better than a midshipman's berth' replied i i'd just as soon stay out but i'll creep in in spite of you take that now father mcgrath' and who is to save your soul and send you to heaven if i don't you wicked wretch but i'll see you damned first so take that now terence o'brien' then i'll turn protestant and damn the pope take that now father mcgrath' at this last broadside of mine my father and all my brothers and sisters raised a cry of horror and my mother burst into tears father mcgrath seized hold of the pot of holy water and dipping in the little whisk began to sprinkle the room saying a latin prayer while they all went on squalling at me at last my father seized the stool which he had been seated upon and threw it at my head i dodged and it knocked down father mcgrath who had just walked behind me in full song i knew that it was all over after that so i sprang over his carcase and gained the door good morning to ye all and better manners to you next time we meet' cried i and off i set as fast as i could for the ship i was very sorry for what i had said to the priest for my conscience thumped me very hard at having even pretended that i'd turn protestant which i never intended to do nor never will but live and die a good catholic as all my posterity have done before me and as i trust all my ancestors will for generations to come well i arrived on board and the first lieutenant was very savage i hoped he would get over it but he never did and he continued to treat me so ill that i determined to quit the ship which i did as soon as we arrived in cawsand bay the captain allowed me to go for i told him the whole truth of the matter and he saw that it was true so he recommended me to the captain of a jackass frigate who was in want of midshipmen what do you mean by a jackass frigate inquired i i mean one of your twenty eight gun ships so called because there is as much difference between them and a real frigate like the one we are sailing in as there is between a donkey and a race horse well the ship was no sooner brought down to the dock yard to have her ballast taken in than our captain came down to her a little thin spare man but a man of weight nevertheless for he brought a great pair of scales with him and weighed everything that was put on board i forget his real name but the sailors christened him captain avoirdupois he had a large book and in it he inserted the weight of the ballast and of the shot water provisions coals standing and running rigging cables and everything else but i didn't remain long for one day i brought on board a pair of new boots which i forgot to report that they might be put into the scales which swung on the gangway and whether the captain thought that they would sink his ship or for what i cannot tell but he ordered me to quit her immediately so there i was adrift again one day i was in the dock yard looking at a two decker in the basin just brought forward for service and i inquired who was to be the captain they told me that his name was o'connor then he's a countryman of mine thought i and i'll try my luck so i called at goud's hotel where he was lodging and requested to speak with him i was admitted and told him with my best bow that i had come as a volunteer for his ship and that my name was o'brien as it happened he had some vacancies and liking my brogue he asked me in what ships i had served i told him and also my reason for quitting my last which was because i was turned out of it i explained the story of the boots and he made inquiries and found that it was all true and then he gave me a vacancy as master's mate we were ordered to south america and the trade winds took us there in a jiffy i liked my captain and officers very much and what was better we took some good prizes but somehow or other i never had the luck to remain long in one ship and that by no fault of mine at least not in this instance all went on as smooth as possible until one day the captain took us on shore to a ball at one of the peaceable districts we had a very merry night of it but as luck would have it i had the morning watch to keep and see the decks cleaned and as i never neglected my duty i set off about three o'clock in the morning just at break of day to go on board of the ship i was walking along the sands thinking of the pretty girl i'd been dancing with and had got about half way to the ship when three rapparees of spanish soldiers come from behind a rock and attacked me with their swords and bayonets i had only my dirk but i was not to be run through for nothing so i fought them as long as i could i finished one fellow but at last they finished me for a bayonet passed through my body and i forgot all about it well it appears for i can only say to the best of my knowledge and belief that after they had killed me they stripped me naked and buried me in the sand carrying away with them the body of their comrade so there i was dead and buried but o'brien said i whist hold your tongue you've not heard the end of it well i had been buried about an hour but not very deep it appears for they were in too great a hurry when a fisherman and his daughter came along the beach on their way to the boat and the daughter god bless her did me the favour to tread on my nose it was clear that she had never trod upon an irishman's nose before for it surprised her and she looked down to see what was there and not seeing anything she tried it again with her foot and then she scraped off the sand and discovered my pretty face i was quite warm and still breathing for the sand had stopped the blood and prevented my bleeding to death the fisherman pulled me out and took me on his back to the house where the captain and officers were still dancing when he brought me in there was a great cry from the ladies not because i was murdered for they are used to it in those countries but because i was naked which they considered a much more serious affair i was put to bed and a boat despatched on board for our doctor and in a few hours i was able to speak and tell them how it happened but i was too ill to move when the ship sailed which she was obliged to do in a day or two afterwards so the captain made out my discharge and left me there the family were french and i remained with them for six months before i could obtain a passage home during which i learnt their language and a very fair allowance of spanish to boot when i arrived in england i found that the prizes had been sold and that the money was ready for distribution i produced my certificate and received pounds for my share so it's come at last thought i i had never had such a handful of money in my life i thought of my mother and of the cows and the pig and the furniture all gone and of my brothers and sisters wanting praties and i made a vow that i'd send every farthing of it to them after which father mcgrath would no longer think of not giving me absolution so i sent them every doit only reserving for myself the pay which i had received amounting to about pounds and i never felt more happy in my life than when it was safe in the post office and fairly out of my hands i wrote a bit of a letter to my father at the time which was to this purpose honoured father since our last pleasant meeting at which you threw the stool at my head missing the pigeon and hitting the crow i have been dead and buried but am now quite well thank god and want no absolution from father mcgrath bad luck to him and what's more to the point i have just received a batch of prize money the first i have handled since i have served his majesty and every farthing of which i now send to you that you may get back your old cows and the pig and all the rest of the articles seized to pay for my fitting out i'm a true o'brien tell my mother and don't mane to turn protestant but uphold the religion of my country although the devil may take father mcgrath and his holy water to boot i sha'n't come and see you as perhaps you may have another stool ready for my head and may take better aim next time so no more at present from your affectionate son terence o'brien' about three weeks afterwards i received a letter from my father telling me that i was a real o'brien and that if any one dared hint to the contrary he would break every bone in his body that they had received the money and thanked me for a real gentleman as i was that i should have the best stool in the house next time i came not for my head but for my tail that father mcgrath sent me his blessing and had given me absolution for all i had done or should do for the next ten years to come that my mother had cried with joy at my dutiful behaviour and that all my brothers and sisters bating tim who had died the day after i left them wished me good luck and plenty more prize money to send home to them this was all very pleasant and i had nothing left on my mind but to get another ship so i went to the port admiral and told him how it was that i left my last and he said that being dead and buried was quite sufficient reason for any one leaving his ship and that he would procure me another now that i had come to life again i was sent on board of the guardship where i remained about ten days and then was sent round to join this frigate and so my story's ended and there's eight bells striking so the watch is ended too chapter fourteen the first lieutenant has more patients mr chucks the boatswain lets me into the secret of his gentility before i proceed with my narrative i wish to explain to the reader that my history was not written in after life when i had obtained a greater knowledge of the world when i first went to sea i promised my mother that i would keep a journal of what passed with my reflections upon it to this promise i rigidly adhered and since i have been my own master these journals have remained in my possession in writing therefore the early part of my adventures everything is stated as it was impressed on my mind at the time we had now been cruising for six weeks and i found that my profession was much more agreeable than i had anticipated my desire to please was taken for the deed and although i occasionally made a blunder yet the captain and first lieutenant seemed to think that i was attentive to my duty to the best of my ability and only smiled at my mistakes the first lieutenant was one of the most amusing men i ever knew yet he never relaxed from the discipline of the service or took the least liberty with either his superiors or inferiors his humour was principally shown in his various modes of punishment and however severe the punishment was to the party the manner of inflicting it was invariably a source of amusement to the remainder of the ship's company i often thought that although no individual liked being punished yet that all the ship's company were quite pleased when a punishment took place he was very particular about his decks they were always as white as snow and nothing displeased him so much as their being soiled it was for that reason that he had such an objection to the use of tobacco there were spitting pans placed in different parts of the decks for the use of the men that they might not dirty the planks with the tobacco juice sometimes a man in a hurry forgot to use these pans but as the mess to which the stain might be opposite had their grog stopped if the party were not found out they took good care not only to keep a look out but to inform against the offender now the punishment for the offence was as follows the man's hands were tied behind his back and a large tin spitting box fixed to his chest by a strap over the shoulders all the other boxes on the lower deck were taken away and he was obliged to walk there ready to attend the summons of any man who might wish to empty his mouth of the tobacco juice the other men were so pleased at the fancy that they spat twice as much as before for the pleasure of making him run about i was much amused one morning watch that i kept we were stowing the hammocks in the quarter deck nettings when one of the boys came up with his hammock on his shoulder and as he passed the first lieutenant the latter perceived that he had a quid of tobacco in his cheek what have you got there my good lad a gum boil your cheek is very much swelled no sir replied the boy there's nothing at all the matter oh there must be it is a bad tooth then open your mouth and let me see very reluctantly the boy opened his mouth and discovered a large roll of tobacco leaf i see i see said the first lieutenant your mouth wants overhauling and your teeth cleaning i wish we had a dentist on board but as we have not i will operate as well as i can send the armourer up here with his tongs when the armourer made his appearance the boy was made to open his mouth while the chaw of tobacco was extracted with his rough instrument there now said the first lieutenant i am sure that you must feel better already you never could have had any appetite now captain of the afterguard bring a piece of old canvas and some sand here and clean his teeth nicely the captain of the afterguard came forward and putting the boy's head between his knees scrubbed his teeth well with the sand and canvas for two or three minutes there that will do said the first lieutenant now my little fellow your mouth is nice and clean and you'll enjoy your breakfast it was impossible for you to have eaten anything with your mouth in such a nasty state when it's dirty again come to me and i'll be your dentist one day i was on the forecastle with mr chucks the boatswain who was very kind to me he had been showing me how to make the various knots and bends of rope which are used in our service i am afraid that i was very stupid but he showed me over and over again until i learnt how to make them amongst others he taught me a fisherman's bend which he pronounced to be the king of all knots and mr simple continued he there's a moral in that knot you observe that when the parts are drawn the right way and together the more you pull the faster they hold and the more impossible to untie them but see by hauling them apart how a little difference a pull the other way immediately disunites them and then how easy they cast off in a moment that points out the necessity of pulling together in this world mr simple when we wish to hold on and that's a piece of philosophy worth all the twenty six thousand and odd years of my friend the carpenter which leads to nothing but a brown study when he ought to be attending to his duty very true mr chucks you are the better philosopher of the two i am the better educated mr simple and i trust more of a gentleman i consider a gentleman to be to a certain degree a philosopher for very often he is obliged to support his character as such to put up with what another person may very properly fly in a passion about i think coolness is the great characterstick of a gentleman in the service mr simple one is obliged to appear angry without indulging the sentiment i can assure you that i never lose my temper even when i use my rattan why then mr chucks do you swear so much at the men surely that is not gentlemanly most certainly not sir but i must defend myself by observing the very artificial state in which we live on board of a man of war nothing would afford me more pleasure than to be able to carry on the duty as a gentleman but that's impossible i really cannot see why perhaps then mr simple you will explain to me why the captain and first lieutenant swear that i do not pretend to answer but they only do so upon an emergency exactly so but sir their 'mergency is my daily and hourly duty in the continual working of the ship i am answerable for all that goes amiss the life of a boatswain is a life of 'mergency and therefore i swear i still cannot allow it to be requisite and certainly it is sinful excuse me my dear sir it is absolutely requisite and not at all sinful there is one language for the pulpit and another for on board ship and in either situation a man must make use of those terms most likely to produce the necessary effect upon his listeners certain it is that common parlancy won't do with a common seaman it is not here as in the scriptures do this and he doeth it' by the by that chap must have had his soldiers in tight order but it is do this damn your eyes' and then it is done directly the order to do just carries the weight of a cannon shot but it wants the perpelling power the damn is the gunpowder which sets it flying in the execution of its duty do you comprehend me mr simple i perfectly understand you mr chucks and i cannot help remarking and that without flattery that you are very different from the rest of the warrant officers where did you receive your education mr simple i am here a boatswain with a clean shirt and i say it myself and no one dare gainsay it also with a thorough knowledge of my duty but although i do not say that i ever was better off i can say this that i've been in the best society in the company of lords and ladies i once dined with your grandfather that's more than ever i did for he never asked me nor took the least notice of me replied i what i state is true i did not know that he was your grandfather until yesterday when i was talking with mr o'brien but i perfectly recollect him although i was very young at that time now mr simple if you will promise me as a gentleman and i know you are one that you will not repeat what i tell you then i'll let you into the history of my life mr chucks as i am a gentleman i never will divulge it until you are dead and buried and not then if you do not wish it mr chucks then sat down upon the fore end of the booms by the funnel and i took my place by his side when he commenced as follows my father was a boatswain before me one of the old school rough as a bear and drunken as a gosport fiddler my mother was my mother and i shall say no more my father was invalided for harbour duty after a life of intoxication and died shortly afterwards in the meantime i had been by the kindness of the port admiral's wife educated at a foundation school i was thirteen when my father died and my mother not knowing what to do with me wished to bind me apprentice to a merchant vessel but this i refused and after six months' quarrelling on the subject i decided the point by volunteering in the narcissus frigate i believe that my gentlemanly ideas were innate mr simple i never as a child could bear the idea of the merchant service after i had been a week on board i was appointed servant to the purser where i gave such satisfaction by my alertness and dexterity that the first lieutenant took me away from the purser to attend upon himself it so happened that after i had served the first lieutenant for about a year a young lord i must not mention his name mr simple was sent to sea by his friends or by his own choice i don't know which but i was told that his uncle who was 'zeckative and had an interest in his death persuaded him to go a lord at that period some twenty five years ago was a rarity in the service and they used to salute him when he came on board the consequence was that the young lord must have a servant to himself although all the rest of the midshipmen had but one servant between them the captain inquired who was the best boy in the ship and the purser to whom he appealed recommended me accordingly i was immediately surrendered to his lordship i had a very easy comfortable life of it i did little or nothing we went to the mediterranean because his lordship's mamma wished it and we had been there about a year when his lordship ate so many grapes that he was seized with a dysentery he was ill for three weeks and then he requested to be sent to malta in a transport going to gibraltar or rather to the barbary coast for bullocks he became worse every day and made his will leaving me all his effects on board which i certainly deserved for the kindness with which i had nursed him off malta we fell in with a xebeque bound to civita vecchia and the captain of the transport anxious to proceed advised our going on board of her as the wind was light and contrary and these mediterranean vessels sailed better on a wind than the transport my master who was now sinking fast consented and we changed our ships the next day he died and a gale of wind came on which prevented us from gaining the port for several days and the body of his lordship not only became so offensive but affected the superstition of the catholic sailors so much that it was hove overboard the wind was still against us when a merchant vessel ran down to us that had left civita vecchia for gibraltar i desired the captain of the xebeque to make a signal of distress or rather i did myself and the vessel which proved to be english bore down to us i manned the boat to go on board and the idea came into my head that although they might refuse to take me that they would not refuse a lord i put on the midshipman's uniform belonging to his lordship but then certainly belonging to me and went alongside of the merchant vessel i told them that i had left my ship for the benefit of my health and wanted a passage to gibraltar on my way home my title and immediate acceptance of the terms demanded for my passage was sufficient my property was brought from the xebeque and of course as they could not speak english they could not contradict even if they suspected during my passage to gibraltar i had plenty of time for arranging my plans i hardly need say that my lord's kit was valuable and what was better they exactly fitted me i also had his watches and trinkets and many other things besides a bag of dollars however they were honestly mine the only thing that i took was his name which he had no further occasion for poor fellow but it's no use defending what was wrong it was dishonest and there's an end of it now observe mr simple how one thing leads to another i declare to you that my first idea of making use of his lordship's name was to procure a passage to gibraltar i then was undecided how to act but as i had charge of his papers and letters to his mother and guardian i think indeed i am almost sure that i should have laid aside my dignity and midshipman's dress and applied for a passage home to the commissioner of the yard but it was fated to be otherwise for the master of the transport went on shore to report and obtain pratique and he told them everywhere that the young lord a was a passenger with him going to england for the benefit of his health in less than half an hour off came the commissioner's boat and another boat from the governor requesting the honour of my company and that i would take a bed at their houses during my stay what could i do i began to be frightened but i was more afraid to confess that i was an impostor for i am sure the master of the transport alone would have kicked me overboard if i had let him know that he had been so confounded polite to a ship's boy so i blushed half from modesty and half from guilt and accepted the invitation of the governor sending a polite verbal refusal to the commissioner upon the plea of there being no paper or pens on board well mr simple i dressed myself very carefully put on my chains and rings and a little perfume on my handkerchief and accompanied the aide de camp to the governor's where i was asked after my mother lady and my uncle my guardian and a hundred other questions at first i was much confused which was attributed to bashfulness and so it was but not of the right sort but before the day was over i had been so accustomed to be called my lord' and to my situation that i was quite at my ease and began to watch the motions and behaviour of the company that i might regulate my comportment by that of good society i remained at gibraltar for a fortnight and then was offered a passage in a transport ordered to portsmouth being on officer of course it was free to a certain extent on my passage to england i again made up my mind that i would put off my dress and title as soon as i could escape from observation but i was prevented as before the port admiral sent off to request the pleasure of my company to dinner i dared not refuse and there i was my lord as before courted and feasted by everybody my bill at the hotel was very extravagant and more than i could pay but the master said it was not of the least consequence that of course his lordship had not provided himself with cash just coming from foreign parts and offered to supply me with money if i required it this i will say i was honest enough to refuse i left my cards ppc as they do mr simple in all well regulated society and set off in the mail for london where i fully resolved to drop my title and to proceed to scotland to his lordship's mother with the mournful intelligence of his death for you see mr simple no one knew that his lordship was dead when i arrived in london i still wore my midshipman's uniform i went to an hotel recommended to me as i afterwards found out the most fashionable in town my title still following me i now determined to put off my uniform and dress in plain clothes my farce was over i went to bed that night and the next morning made my appearance in a suit of mufti making inquiry of the waiter which was the best conveyance to scotland post chay and four my lord at what time shall i order it' oh' replied i i am not sure that i shall go to morrow' just at this moment in came the master of the hotel with the morning post in his hand making me a low bow and pointing to the insertion of my arrival at his hotel among the fashionables this annoyed me and now that i found how difficult it was to get rid of my title i became particularly anxious to be william chucks as before before twelve o'clock three or four gentlemen were ushered into my sitting room who observing my arrival in that damn'd morning post came to pay their respects and before the day was over i was invited and re invited by a dozen people at last the play was over i had been enticed by some young men into a gambling house where they intended to fleece me but for the first night they allowed me to win i think about pounds i was quite delighted with my success and had agreed to meet them the next evening but when i was at breakfast with my legs crossed reading the morning post who should come to see me but my guardian uncle he knew his nephew's features too well to be deceived and my not recognising him proved at once that i was an impostor you must allow me to hasten over the scene which took place the wrath of the uncle the confusion in the hotel the abuse of the waiters the police officer and being dragged into a hackney coach to bow street there i was examined and confessed all the uncle was so glad to find that his nephew was really dead that he felt no resentment towards me and as after all i had only assumed a name but had cheated nobody except the landlord at portsmouth i was sent on board the tender off the tower to be drafted into a man of war as for my pounds my clothes etc i never heard any more of them they were seized i presume by the landlord of the hotel for my bill and very handsomely he must have paid himself you found some difference i should think in your situation yes i did mr simple but i was much happier i could not forget the ladies and the dinners and the opera and all the delights of london beside the respect paid to my title and i often sighed for them but the police officer and bow street also came to my recollection and i shuddered at the remembrance it had however one good effect i determined to be an officer if i could and learnt my duty and worked my way up to quarter master and thence to boatswain and i know my duty mr simple but i've been punished for my folly ever since i formed ideas above my station in life and cannot help longing to be a gentleman it's a bad thing for a man to have ideas above his station you certainly must find some difference between the company in london and that of the warrant officers it's many years back now sir but i can't get over the feeling i can't 'sociate with them at all chapter fifteen i go on service and am made prisoner by an old lady who not able to obtain my hand takes part of my finger as a token o'brien rescues me a lee shore and narrow escape two or three days after this conversation with mr chucks the captain ran the frigate in shore and when within five miles we discovered two vessels under the land we made all sail in chase and cut them off from escaping round a sandy point which they attempted to weather finding that they could not effect their purpose they ran on shore under a small battery of two guns which commenced firing upon us the first shot which whizzed between the masts had to me a most terrific sound but the officers and men laughed at it so of course i pretended to do the same but in reality i could see nothing to laugh at the captain ordered the starboard watch to be piped to quarters and the boats to be cleared ready for hoisting out we then anchored within a mile of the battery and returned the fire in the meantime the remainder of the ship's company hoisted out and lowered down four boats which were manned and armed to storm the battery i was very anxious to go on service and o'brien who had command of the first cutter allowed me to go with him on condition that i stowed myself away under the fore sheets that the captain might not see me before the boats had shoved off this i did and was not discovered we pulled in abreast towards the battery and in less than ten minutes the boats were run on the beach and we jumped out the frenchmen fired a gun at us as we pulled close to the shore and then ran away there were a few fishermen's huts close to the battery and while two of the boats went on board of the vessels to see if they could be got off and others were spiking the guns and destroying the carriages i went with o'brien to examine them they were deserted by the people as might have been supposed but there was a great quantity of fish in them apparently caught that morning o'brien pointed to a very large skate murder in irish cried he it's the very ghost of of my grandmother we'll have her if it's only for the family likeness peter put your finger into the gills and drag her down to the boat i could not force my finger into the gills and as the animal appeared quite dead i hooked my finger into his mouth but i made a sad mistake for the animal was alive and immediately closed its jaws nipping my finger to the bone and holding it so tight that i could not withdraw it and the pain was too great to allow me to pull it away by main force and tear my finger which it held so fast there i was caught in a trap and made a prisoner by a flatfish fortunately i hallooed loud enough to make o'brien who was close down to the boats with a large cod fish under each arm turn round and come to my assistance at first he could not help me from laughing so much but at last he forced open the jaw of the fish with his cutlass and i got my finger out but very badly torn indeed i then took off my garter tied it round the tail of the skate and dragged it to the boat which was all ready to shove off my finger was very bad for three weeks and the officers laughed at me very much saying that i narrowly escaped being made a prisoner of by an old maid we continued our cruise along the coast until we had run down into the bay of arcason where we captured two or three vessels and obliged many more to run on shore we had chased a convoy of vessels to the bottom of the bay the wind was very fresh when we hauled off after running them on shore and the surf on the beach even at that time was so great that they were certain to go to pieces before they could be got afloat again we were obliged to double reef the topsails as soon as we hauled to the wind and the weather looked very threatening in an hour afterwards the whole sky was covered with one black cloud which sank so low as nearly to touch our mast heads and a tremendous sea which appeared to have risen up almost by magic rolled in upon us setting the vessel on a dead lee shore as the night closed in it blew a dreadful gale and the ship was nearly buried with the press of canvas which she was obliged to carry for had we sea room we should have been lying to under storm staysails but we were forced to carry on at all risks that we might claw off shore the sea broke over as we lay in the trough deluging us with water from the forecastle aft to the binnacles and very often as the ship descended with a plunge it was with such force that i really thought she would divide in half with the violence of the shock double breechings were rove on the guns and they were further secured with tackles and strong cleats nailed behind the trunnions for we heeled over so much when we lurched that the guns were wholly supported by the breechings and tackles and had one of them broken loose it must have burst right through the lee side of the ship and she must have foundered the captain first lieutenant and most of the officers remained on deck during the whole of the night what made it more appalling was that we were on a lee shore and the consultations of the captain and officers and the eagerness with which they looked out for daylight told us that we had other dangers to encounter besides the storm at last the morning broke and the look out man upon the gangway called out land on the lee beam i perceived the master dash his feet against the hammock rails as if with vexation and walk away without saying a word and looking very grave up there mr wilson said the captain to the second lieutenant and see how far the land trends forward and whether you can distinguish the point the second lieutenant went up the main rigging and pointed with his hand to about two points before the beam do you see two hillocks inland yes sir replied the second lieutenant then it is so observed the captain to the master and if we weather it we shall have more sea room keep her full and let her go through the water do you hear quarter master ay ay sir thus and no nearer my man ease her with a spoke or two when she sends but be careful or she'll take the wheel out of your hands it really was a very awful sight when the ship was in the trough of the sea you could distinguish nothing but a waste of tumultuous water but when she was borne up on the summit of the enormous waves you then looked down as it were upon a low sandy coast close to you and covered with foam and breakers she behaves nobly observed the captain stepping aft to the binnacle and looking at the compass if the wind does not baffle us we shall weather the captain had scarcely time to make the observation when the sails shivered and flapped like thunder up with the helm what are you about quarter master the wind has headed us sir replied the quarter master coolly the captain and master remained at the binnacle watching the compass and when the sails were again full she had broken off two points and the point of land was only a little on the lee bow we must wear her round mr falcon hands wear ship ready oh ready she has come up again cried the master who was at the binnacle hold fast there a minute how's her head now nne as she was before she broke off sir pipe belay said the captain falcon continued he if she breaks off again we may have no room to wear indeed there is so little room now that i must run the risk which cable was ranged last night the best bower yes sir jump down then and see it double bitted and stoppered at thirty fathoms see it well done our lives may depend upon it the ship continued to hold her course good and we were within half a mile of the point and fully expected to weather it when again the wet and heavy sails flapped in the wind and the ship broke off two points as before the officers and seamen were aghast for the ship's head was right on to the breakers luff now all you can quarter master cried the captain send the men aft directly my lads there is no time for words i am going to club haul the ship for there is no room to wear the only chance you have of safety is to be cool watch my eye and execute my orders with precision away to your stations for tacking ship hands by the best bower anchor mr wilson attend below with the carpenter and his mates ready to cut away the cable at the moment that i give the order silence there fore and aft quarter master keep her full again for stays mind you ease the helm down when i tell you about a minute passed before the captain gave any further orders the ship had closed to within a quarter of a mile of the beach and the waves curled and topped around us bearing us down upon the shore which presented one continued surface of foam extending to within half a cable's length of our position at which distance the enormous waves culminated and fell with the report of thunder the captain waved his hand in silence to the quarter master at the wheel and the helm was put down the ship turned slowly to the wind pitching and chopping as the sails were spinning she had lost her way the captain gave the order let go the anchor we will haul all at once mr falcon said the captain not a word was spoken the men went to the fore brace which had not been manned most of them knew although i did not that if the ship's head did not go round the other way we should be on shore and among the breakers in half a minute at last the ship was head to wind and the captain gave the signal the yards flew round with such a creaking noise that i thought the masts had gone over the side and the next moment the wind had caught the sails and the ship which for a moment or two had been on an even keel careened over to her gunnel with its force the captain who stood upon the weather hammock rails holding by the main rigging ordered the helm amidships looked full at the sails and then at the cable which grew broad upon the weather bow and held the ship from nearing the shore at last he cried cut away the cable a few strokes of the axes were heard and then the cable flew out of the hawse hole in a blaze of fire from the violence of the friction and disappeared under a huge wave which struck us on the chess tree and deluged us with water fore and aft but we were now on the other tack and the ship regained her way and we had evidently increased our distance from the land my lads said the captain to the ship's company you have behaved well and i thank you but i must tell you honestly that we have more difficulties to get through we have to weather a point of the bay on this tack mr falcon splice the main brace and call the watch how's her head quarter master sw by s southerly sir very well let her go through the water and the captain beckoning to the master to follow him went down into the cabin as our immediate danger was over i went down into the berth to see if i could get anything for breakfast where i found o'brien and two or three more by the powers it was as nate a thing as ever i saw done observed o'brien the slightest mistake as to time or management and at this moment the flatfish would have been dubbing at our ugly carcasses peter you're not fond of flatfish are you my boy we may thank heaven and the captain i can tell you that my lads but now where's the chart robinson hand me down the parallel rules and compasses peter they are in the corner of the shelf here we are now a devilish sight too near this infernal point who knows how her head is i do o'brien i heard the quarter master tell the captain sw by s southerly let me see continued o'brien variation two and a quarter lee way rather too large an allowance of that i'm afraid but however we'll give her two and a half points the diomede would blush to make any more under any circumstances here the compass now we'll see and o'brien advanced the parallel rule from the compass to the spot where the ship was placed on the chart bother you see it's as much as she'll do to weather the other point now on this tack and that's what the captain meant when he told us we had more difficulty i could have taken my bible oath that we were clear of everything if the wind held see what the distance is o'brien said robinson it was measured and proved to be thirteen miles only thirteen miles and if we do weather we shall do very well for the bay is deep beyond it's a rocky point you see just by way of variety well my lads i've a piece of comfort for you anyhow it's not long that you'll be kept in suspense for by one o'clock this day you'll either be congratulating each other upon your good luck or you'll be past praying for come put up the chart for i hate to look at melancholy prospects and steward see what you can find in the way of comfort some bread and cheese with the remains of yesterday's boiled pork were put on the table with a bottle of rum procured at the time they spliced the main brace but we were all too anxious to eat much and one by one returned on deck to see how the weather was and if the wind at all favoured us on deck the superior officers were in conversation with the captain who had expressed the same fear that o'brien had in our berth the men who knew what they had to expect for this sort of intelligence is soon communicated through a ship were assembled in knots looking very grave but at the same time not wanting in confidence they knew that they could trust to the captain as far as skill or courage could avail them and sailors are too sanguine to despair even at the last moment before twelve o'clock the rocky point which we so much dreaded was in sight broad on the lee bow and if the low sandy coast appeared terrible how much more did this even at a distance the black masses of rock covered with foam which each minute dashed up in the air higher than our lower mast heads the captain eyed it for some minutes in silence as if in calculation mr falcon said he at last we must put the mainsail on her she never can bear it sir she must bear it was the reply send the men aft to the mainsheet see that careful men attend the buntlines the mainsail was set and the effect of it upon the ship was tremendous she careened over so that her lee channels were under the water and when pressed by a sea the lee side of the quarter deck and gangway were afloat she now reminded me of a goaded and fiery horse mad with the stimulus applied not rising as before but forcing herself through whole seas and dividing the waves which poured in one continual torrent from the forecastle down upon the decks below four men were secured to the wheel the sailors were obliged to cling to prevent being washed away the ropes were thrown in confusion to leeward the shot rolled out of the lockers and every eye was fixed aloft watching the masts which were expected every moment to go over the side a heavy sea struck us on the broadside and it was some moments before the ship appeared to recover herself she reeled trembled and stopped her way as if it had stupefied her the first lieutenant looked at the captain as if to say this will not do it is our only chance answered the captain to the appeal that the ship went faster through the water and held a better wind was certain but just before we arrived at the point the gale increased in force if any thing starts we are lost sir observed the first lieutenant again i am perfectly aware of it replied the captain in a calm tone but as i said before and you must now be aware it is our only chance the consequence of any carelessness or neglect in the fitting and securing of the rigging will be felt now and this danger if we escape it ought to remind us how much we have to answer for if we neglect our duty the lives of a whole ship's company may be sacrificed by the neglect or incompetence of an officer when in harbour the ship was now within two cables' lengths of the rocky point some few of the men i observed to clasp their hands but most of them were silently taking off their jackets and kicking off their shoes that they might not lose a chance of escape provided the ship struck 'twill be touch and go indeed falcon observed the captain for i had clung to the belaying pins close to them for the last half hour that the mainsail had been set come aft you and i must take the helm we shall want nerve there and only there now the captain and first lieutenant went aft and took the forespokes of the wheel and o'brien at a sign made by the captain laid hold of the spokes behind him an old quarter master kept his station at the fourth the roaring of the sea on the rocks with the howling of the wind were dreadful but the sight was more dreadful than the noise for a few moments i shut my eyes but anxiety forced me to open them again as near as i could judge we were not twenty yards from the rocks at the time that the ship passed abreast of them we were in the midst of the foam which boiled around us and as the ship was driven nearer to them and careened with the wave i thought that our main yard arm would have touched the rock and at this moment a gust of wind came on which laid the ship on her beam ends and checked her progress through the water while the accumulated noise was deafening a few moments more the ship dragged on another wave dashed over her and spent itself upon the rocks while the spray was dashed back from them and returned upon the decks the main rock was within ten yards of her counter when another gust of wind laid us on our beam ends the foresail and mainsail split and were blown clean out of the bolt ropes the ship righted trembling fore and aft i looked astern the rocks were to windward on our quarter and we were safe i thought at the time that the ship relieved of her courses and again lifting over the waves was not a bad similitude of the relief felt by us all at that moment and like her we trembled as we panted with the sudden reaction and felt the removal of the intense anxiety which oppressed our breasts the captain resigned the helm and walked aft to look at the point which was now broad on the weather quarter in a minute or two he desired mr falcon to get new sails up and bend them and then went below to his cabin i am sure it was to thank god for our deliverance i did most fervently not only then but when i went to my hammock at night we were now comparatively safe in a few hours completely so for strange to say immediately after we had weathered the rocks the gale abated and before morning we had a reef out of the topsails chapter sixteen news from home a fatigue party employed at gibraltar more particulars in the life of mr chucks a brush with the enemy a court martial and a lasting impression a few days afterwards a cutter joined us from plymouth with orders for the frigate to proceed forthwith to gibraltar where we should learn our destination we were all very glad of this for we had had quite enough of cruising in the bay of biscay and as we understood that we were to be stationed in the mediterranean we hoped to exchange gales of wind and severe weather for fine breezes and a bright sky the cutter brought out our letters and newspapers i never felt more happy than i did when i found one put into my hands it is necessary to be far from home and friends to feel the real delight of receiving a letter i went down into the most solitary place in the steerage that i might enjoy it without interruption i cried with pleasure before i opened it but i cried a great deal more with grief after i had read the contents for my eldest brother tom was dead of a typhus fever poor tom when i called to mind what tricks he used to play me how he used to borrow my money and never pay me and how he used to thrash me and make me obey him because he was my elder brother i shed a torrent of tears at his loss and then i reflected how miserable my poor mother must be and i cried still more i was very melancholy for a few days but it was so delightful running down the portuguese and spanish coasts the weather was so warm and the sea so smooth that i am afraid i forgot my brother's death sooner than i ought to have done but my spirits were cheered up and the novelty of the scene prevented me from thinking every one too was so gay and happy that i could not well be otherwise in a fortnight we anchored in gibraltar bay and the ship was stripped to refit there was so much duty to be done that i did not like to go on shore indeed mr falcon had refused some of my messmates and i thought it better not to ask although i was very anxious to see a place which was considered so extraordinary one afternoon i was looking over the gangway as the people were at supper and mr falcon came up to me and said well mr simple what are you thinking of i replied touching my hat that i was wondering how they had cut out the solid rocks into galleries and that they must be very curious that is to say that you are very curious to see them well then since you have been very attentive to your duty and have not asked to go on shore i will give you leave to go to morrow morning and stay till gun fire i was very much pleased at this as the officers had a general invitation to dine with the mess and all who could obtain leave being requested to come i was enabled to join the party the first lieutenant had excused himself on the plea of there being so much to attend to on board but most of the gun room officers and some of the midshipmen obtained leave we walked about the town and fortifications until dinner time and then we proceeded to the barracks the dinner was very good and we were all very merry but after the dessert had been brought in i slipped away with a young ensign who took me all over the galleries and explained everything to me which was a much better way of employing my time than doing as the others did which the reader will acknowledge i was at the sally port before gun fire the boat was there but no officers made their appearance the gun fired the drawbridge was hauled up and i was afraid that i should be blamed but the boat was not ordered to shove off as it was waiting for commissioned officers about an hour afterwards when it was quite dark the sentry pointed his arms and challenged a person advancing with who comes there naval officer drunk on a wheelbarrow was the reply in a loud singing voice upon which the sentry recovered his arms singing in return pass naval officer drunk on a wheelbarrow and all's well and then appeared a soldier in his fatigue dress wheeling down the third lieutenant in a wheelbarrow so tipsy that he could not stand or speak then the sentry challenged again and the answer was another naval officer drunk on a wheelbarrow upon which the sentry replied as before pass another naval officer drunk on a wheelbarrow and all's well this was my friend o'brien almost as bad as the third lieutenant and so they continued for ten minutes challenging and passing until they wheeled down the remainder of the party with the exception of the second lieutenant who walked arm in arm with the officer who brought down the order for lowering the drawbridge they were all safely put into the boat and i am glad to say the first lieutenant was in bed and did not see them the ship remained at gibraltar bay about three weeks during which time we had refitted the rigging fore and aft restowed and cleaned the hold and painted the outside she never looked more beautiful than she did when in obedience to our orders we made sail to join the admiral we had very light winds and a day or two afterwards we were off valencia nearly becalmed i was on the gangway looking through a telescope at the houses and gardens round the city when mr chucks the boatswain came up to me mr simple oblige me with that glass a moment i wish to see if a building remains there which i have some reason to remember what were you ever on shore there yes i was mr simple and nearly stranded but i got off again without much damage how do you mean were you wrecked then not my ship mr simple but my peace of mind was for some time but it's many years ago when i was first made boatswain of a corvette during this conversation he was looking through the telescope yes there it is said he i have it in the field look mr simple do you see a small church with a spire of glazed tiles shining like a needle yes i do well then just above it a little to the right there is a long white house with four small windows below the grove of orange trees i see it replied i but what about that house mr chucks why thereby hangs a tale replied he giving a sigh which raised and then lowered the frill of his shirt at least six inches why what is the mystery mr chucks i'll tell you mr simple with one who lived in that house i was for the first and for the last time in love indeed i should like very much to hear the story so you shall mr simple one evening i was walking in the plaza when i saw a female a head who appeared to be the prettiest moulded little vessel that i ever cast my eyes on i followed in her wake and examined her such a clean run i never beheld so neat too in all her rigging everything so nicely stowed under hatches and then she sailed along in such a style at one moment lifting so lightly just like a frigate with her topsails on the caps that can't help going along at another time as she turned a corner sharp up in the wind wake as straight as an arrow no leeway i made all sail to sheer alongside of her and when under quarter examined her close never saw such a fine swell in the counter and all so trim no ropes towing overboard well mr simple i said to myself damnt it if her figure head and bows be finished off by the same builder she's perfect' so i shot ahead and yawed a little caught a peep at her through her veil and saw two black eyes as bright as beads and as large as damsons i saw quite enough and not wishing to frighten her i dropped astern shortly afterwards she altered her course steering for that white house just as she was abreast of it and i playing about the weather quarter the priests came by in procession taking the host to somebody who was dying my little frigate lowered her top gallant sails out of respect as other nations used to do and ought now and be damned to them whenever they pass the flag of old england how do you mean inquired i i mean that she spread her white handkerchief which fluttered in her hand as she went along and knelt down upon it on one knee i did the same because i was obliged to heave to to keep my station and i thought that if she saw me it would please her when she got up i was on my legs also but in my hurry i had not chosen a very clean place and i found out when i got up again that my white jean trowsers were in a shocking mess the young lady turned round and seeing my misfortune laughed and then went into the white house while i stood there like a fool first looking at the door of the house and then at my trowsers however i thought that i might make it the means of being acquainted with her so i went to the door and knocked an old gentleman in a large cloak who was her father came out i pointed to my trowsers and requested him in spanish to allow me a little water to clean them the daughter then came from within and told her father how the accident had happened the old gentleman was surprised that an english officer was so good a christian and appeared to be pleased he asked me very politely to come in and sent an old woman for some water i observed that he was smoking a bit of paper and having very fortunately about a couple of dozen of real havannahs in my pocket for i never smoke anything else mr simple it being my opinion that no gentleman can i took them out and begged his acceptance of them his eyes glistened at the sight of them but he refused to take more than one however i insisted upon his taking the whole bundle telling him that i had plenty more on board reserving one for myself that i might smoke it with him he then requested me to sit down and the old woman brought some sour wine which i declared was very good although it made me quite ill afterwards he inquired of me whether i was a good christian i replied that i was i knew that he meant a catholic for they call us heretics mr simple the daughter then came in without her veil and she was perfection but i did not look at her or pay her any attention after the first salutation i was so afraid of making the old gentleman suspicious he then asked what i was what sort of officer was i captain i replied that i was not was i 'tenente which means lieutenant i answered that i was not again but with an air of contempt as if i was something better what was i then i did not know the spanish for boatswain and to tell the truth i was ashamed of my condition i knew that there was an officer in spain called corregidor which means a corrector in english or one who punishes now i thought that quite near enough for my purpose and i replied that i was the corregidor now mr simple a corregidor in spain is a person of rank and consequence so they imagined that i must be the same and they appeared to be pleased the young lady then inquired if i was of good family whether i was a gentleman or not i replied that i hoped so i remained with them for half an hour more when my cigar was finished i then rose and thanking the old gentleman for his civility begged that i might be allowed to bring him a few more cigars and took my leave the daughter opened the street door and i could not refrain from taking her hand and kissing it where's mr chucks call the boatswain there forward hallooed out the lieutenant here i am sir replied mr chucks hastening aft and leaving me and his story the captain of the maintop reports the breast backstay much chafed in the serving go up and examine it said the first lieutenant yes sir replied the boatswain who immediately went up the rigging and mr simple attend to the men scraping the spots off the quarterdeck yes sir replied i and thus our conversation was broken up the weather changed that night and we had a succession of rain and baffling winds for six or seven days during which i had no opportunity of hearing the remainder of the boatswain's history we joined the fleet off toulon closed the admiral's ship and the captain went on board to pay his respects when he returned we found out through the first lieutenant that we were to remain with the fleet until the arrival of another frigate expected in about a fortnight and then the admiral had promised that we should have a cruise the second day after we had joined we were ordered to form part of the in shore squadron consisting of two line of battle ships and four frigates the french fleet used to come out and manoeuvre within range of their batteries or if they proceeded further from the shore they took good care that they had a leading wind to return again into port we had been in shore about a week every day running close in and counting the french fleet in the harbour to see that they were all safe and reporting it to the admiral by signal when one fine morning the whole of the french vessels were perceived to hoist their topsails and in less than an hour they were under weigh and came out of the harbour we were always prepared for action night and day and indeed often exchanged a shot or two with the batteries when we reconnoitred the in shore squadron could not of course cope with the whole french fleet and our own was about twelve miles in the offing but the captain of the line of battle ship who commanded us hove to as if in defiance hoping to entice them further out four of the french frigates made sail towards us and hove to when within four miles three or four line of battle ships followed them as if to support them our captain made signal for permission to close the enemy which was granted with our pennants and those of another frigate we immediately made all sail beat to quarters put out the fires and opened the magazines the french line of battle ships perceiving that only two of our frigates were sent against their four hove to at about the same distance from their frigates as our line of battle ships and other frigates were from us in the meantime our main fleet continued to work in shore under a press of sail and the french main fleet also gradually approached the detached ships in about an hour we closed so near that the french frigates made sail and commenced firing we reserved our fire until within a quarter of a mile when we poured our broadside into the headmost frigate exchanging with her on opposite tacks the sea horse who followed also gave her a broadside in this way we exchanged broadsides with the whole four and we had the best of it they could not load so fast as we could we were both ready again for the frigates as they passed us but they were not ready with their broadside for the sea horse who followed us very closely so that they had two broadsides each and we had only four in the diomede the sea horse not having one our rigging was cut up a great deal and we had six or seven men wounded but none killed the french frigates suffered more and their admiral perceiving that they were cut up a good deal made a signal of recall in the meantime we had both tacked and were ranging up on the weather quarter of the sternmost frigate the line of battle ships perceiving this ran down with the wind two points free to support their frigates and our in shore squadron made all sail to support us nearly laying up for where we were but the wind was what is called at sea a soldier's wind that is blowing so that the ships could lie either way so as to run out or into the harbour and the french frigates in obedience to their orders made sail for their fleet in shore the line of battle ships coming out to support them but our captain would not give it up although we all continued to near the french line of battle ships every minute we ran in with the frigates exchanging broadsides with them as fast as we could one of them lost her fore topmast and dropped astern and we hoped to cut her off but the others shortened sail to support her this continued for about twenty minutes when the french line of battle ships were not more than a mile from us and our own commodore had made the signal of our recall for he thought that we should be overpowered and taken but the sea horse who saw the recall up did not repeat it and our captain was determined not to see it and ordered the signal man not to look that way the action continued two of the french frigates were cut to pieces and complete wrecks when the french line of battle ships commenced firing it was then high time to be off we each of us poured in another broadside and then wore round for our own squadron which were about four miles off and rather to leeward standing in to our assistance as we wore round our main topmast which had been badly wounded fell over the side and the french perceiving this made all sail with the hope of capturing us but the sea horse remained with us and we threw up in the wind and raked them until they were within two cables' length of us then we stood on for our own ships at last one of the line of battle ships which sailed as well as the frigates came abreast of us and poured in a broadside which brought every thing about our ears and i thought we must be taken but on the contrary although we lost several men the captain said to the first lieutenant now if they only wait a little longer they are nabbed as sure as fate just at this moment our own line of battle ships opened their fire and then the tables were turned the french tacked and stood in as fast as they could followed by the in shore squadron with the exception of our ship which was too much crippled to chase them one of their frigates had taken in tow the other who had lost her topmast and our squadron came up with her very fast the english fleet were also within three miles standing in and the french fleet standing out to the assistance of the other ships which had been engaged i thought and so did everybody that there would be a general action but we were disappointed the frigate which towed the other finding that she could not escape cast her off and left her to her fate which was to haul down her colours to the commodore of the in shore squadron the chase was continued until the whole of the french vessels were close under their batteries and then our fleet returned to its station with the prize which proved to be the narcisse of thirty six guns captain le pelleteon our captain obtained a great deal of credit for his gallant behaviour we had three men killed and robinson the midshipman and ten men wounded some of them severely about the time she was expected the frigate joined and we had permission to part company but before i proceed with the history of our cruise i shall mention the circumstances attending a court martial which took place during the time that we were with the fleet our captain having been recalled from the in shore squadron to sit as one of the members i was the midshipman appointed to the captain's gig and remained on board of the admiral's ship during the whole of the time that the court was sitting two seamen one an englishman and the other a frenchman were tried for desertion from one of our frigates they had left their ship about three months when the frigate captured a french privateer and found them on board as part of her crew for the englishman of course there was no defence he merited the punishment of death to which he was immediately sentenced there may be some excuse for desertion when we consider that the seamen are taken into the service by force but there could be none for fighting against his country but the case of the frenchman was different he was born and bred in france had been one of the crew of the french gun boats at cadiz where he had been made a prisoner by the spaniards and expecting his throat to be cut every day had contrived to escape on board of the frigate lying in the harbour and entered into our service i really believe to save his life he was nearly two years in the frigate before he could find an opportunity of deserting from her and returning to france when he joined the french privateer during the time that he was in the frigate he bore an excellent character the greatest point against him was that on his arrival at gibraltar he had been offered and had received the bounty when the englishman was asked what he had to say in his defence he replied that he had been pressed out of an american ship that he was american born and that he had never taken the bounty but this was not true both the men were condemned to death and the day after the morrow was fixed for their execution i was ordered to attend the punishment on the day appointed the sun shone so brightly and the sky was so clear and the wind so gentle and mild that it appeared hardly possible that it was to be a day of such awe and misery to the two poor men or of such melancholy to the fleet in general i pulled up my boat with the others belonging to the ships of the fleet in obedience to the orders of the officer superintending close to the fore chains of the ship in about half an hour afterwards the prisoners made their appearance on the scaffold the caps were pulled over their eyes and the gun fired underneath them when the smoke rolled away the englishman was swinging at the yard arm but the frenchman was not he had made a spring when the gun fired hoping to break his neck at once and put an end to his misery but he fell on the edge of the scaffold where he lay we thought that his rope had given way and it appeared that he did the same for he made an inquiry but they returned him no answer he was kept on the scaffold during the whole hour that the englishman remained suspended his cap had been removed and he looked occasionally at his fellow sufferer when the body was lowered down he considered that his time was come and attempted to leap overboard he was restrained and led aft where his reprieve was read to him and his arms were unbound but the effect of the shock was too much for his mind he fell down in a swoon and when he recovered his senses had left him and i heard that he never recovered them but was sent home to be confined as a maniac i thought and the result proved that it was carried too far it is not the custom when a man is reprieved to tell him so until after he is on the scaffold with the intention that his awful situation at the time may make a lasting impression upon him during the remainder of his life but as a foreigner he was not aware of our customs and the hour of intense feeling which he underwent was too much for his reason i must say that this circumstance was always a source of deep regret in the whole fleet and that his being a frenchman instead of an englishman increased the feeling of commiseration chapter seventeen mr chucks' opinion of proper names he finishes his spanish talk march of intellect among the warrant officers we were all delighted when our signal was hoisted to part company as we anticipated plenty of prize money under such an enterprising captain we steered for the french coast near to its junction with spain the captain having orders to intercept any convoys sent to supply the french army with stores and provisions the day after we parted company with the fleet mr chucks finished his story where was i mr simple when i left off said he as we took a seat upon the long eighteen you had just left the house after having told them that you were a corregidor and had kissed the lady's hand very true well mr simple i did not call there for two or three days afterwards i did not like to go too soon especially as i saw the young lady every day in the plaza she would not speak to me but to make use of their expression she gave me her eyes' and sometimes a sweet smile i recollect i was so busy looking at her one day that i tripped over my sword and nearly fell on my nose at which she burst out a laughing your sword mr chucks i thought boatswains never wore swords mr simple a boatswain is an officer and is entitled to a sword as well as the captain although we have been laughed out of it by a set of midshipman monkeys i always wore my sword at that time but now a days a boatswain is counted as nobody unless there is hard work to do and then it's mr chucks this and mr chucks that but i'll explain to you how it is mr simple that we boatswains have lost so much of consequence and dignity the first lieutenants are made to do the boatswains' duty now a days and if they could only wind the call they might scratch the boatswain's name off half the ships' books in his majesty's service but to go on with my yarn on the fourth day i called with my handkerchief full of cigars for the father but he was at siesta as they called it the old serving woman would not let me in at first but i shoved a dollar between her skinny old fingers and that altered her note she put her old head out and looked round to see if there was anybody in the street to watch us and then she let me in and shut the door i walked into the room and found myself alone with seraphina seraphina what a fine name no name can be too fine for a pretty girl or a good frigate mr simple i was three hours with seraphina before her father came home and during that time i never was quietly at an anchor for above a minute i was on my knees vowing and swearing kissing her feet and kissing her hand till at last i got to her lips working my way up as regularly as one who gets in at the hawsehole and crawls aft to the cabin windows she was very kind and she smiled and sighed and pushed me off and squeezed my hand and was angry frowning till i was in despair and then making me happy again with her melting dark eyes beaming kindly till at last she said that she would try to love me and asked me whether i would marry her and live in spain i replied that i would and indeed i felt as if i could only at the time the thought occurred to me where the rhino was to come from for i could not live as her father did upon a paper cigar and a piece of melon per day at all events as far as words went it was a settled thing when her father came home the old servant told him that i had just at that moment arrived and that his daughter was in her own room so she was for she ran away as soon as she heard her father knock i made my bow to the old gentleman and gave him the cigars he was serious at first but the sight of them put him into good humour and in a few minutes donna seraphina they call a lady a donna in spain came in saluting me ceremoniously as if we had not been kissing for the hour together i did not remain long as it was getting late so i took a glass of the old gentleman's sour wine and walked off with a request from him to call again well mr simple i met her again and again until i was madly in love and the father appeared to be aware of what was going on and to have no objection however he sent for a priest to talk with me and i again said that i was a good catholic the priest asked me whether i had confessed lately i knew what he meant and answered that i had not he motioned me down on my knees but as i could not speak spanish enough for that i mumble jumbled something or another half spanish and half english and ended with putting four dollars in his hand for carita which means charity he was satisfied at the end of my confession whatever he might have been at the beginning and gave me absolution and now sir comes the winding up of this business seraphina told me that she was going to the opera with some of her relations and asked me if i would be there that the captain of the frigate and all the other officers were going and that she wished me to go with her you see mr simple although seraphina's father was so poor that a mouse would have starved in his house still he was of good family and connected with those who were much better off he was a don himself and had fourteen or fifteen long names which i forget now i refused to go with her as i knew that the service would not permit a boatswain to sit in an opera box when the captain and first lieutenant were there i told her that i had promised to go on board to hook after the men while the captain went on shore thus as you'll see mr simple making myself a man of consequence only to be mortified in the end after she had gone to the opera i was very uncomfortable i was afraid that the captain would see her and take a fancy to her i walked up and down outside until i was so full of love and jealousy that i determined to go into the pit and see what she was about i soon discovered her in a box with some other ladies and with them were my captain and first lieutenant the captain who spoke the language well was leaning over her talking and laughing and she was smiling at what he said i resolved to leave immediately lest she should see me and discover that i had told her a falsehood but they appeared so intimate that i became so jealous i could not quit the theatre at last she perceived me and beckoned her hand i looked very angry and left the theatre cursing like a madman it appeared that she pointed me out to the captain and asked him who i was he told her my real situation on board and spoke of me with contempt she asked whether i was not a man of family at this the captain and first lieutenant both burst out laughing and said that i was a common sailor who had been promoted to a higher rank for good behaviour not exactly an officer and anything but a gentleman in short mr simple i was blown upon and although the captain said more than was correct as i learnt afterwards through the officers still i deserved it determined to know the worst i remained outside till the opera was over when i saw her come out the captain and first lieutenant walking with the party so that i could not speak with her i walked to a posada that's an inn and drank seven bottles of rosolio to keep myself quiet then i went on board and the second lieutenant who was commanding officer put me under arrest for being intoxicated it was a week before i was released and you can't imagine what i suffered mr simple at last i obtained leave to go on shore and i went to the house to decide my fate the old woman opened the door and then calling me a thief slammed it in my face as i retreated donna seraphina came to the window and waving her hand with a contemptuous look said go and god be with you mr gentleman' i returned on board in such a rage and if i could have persuaded the gunner to have given me a ball cartridge i should have shot myself through the head what made the matter worse i was laughed at by everybody in the ship for the captain and first lieutenant had made the story public well mr chucks replied i i cannot help being sorry for you although you certainly deserved to be punished for your dishonesty was that the end of the affair as far as i was concerned it was mr simple but not as respected others the captain took my place but without the knowledge of the father after all they neither had great reason to rejoice at the exchange how so mr chucks what do you mean why mr simple the captain did not make an honest woman of her as i would have done and the father discovered what was going on and one night the captain was brought on board run through the body we sailed immediately for gibraltar and it was a long while before he got round again did you ever hear any more of the young lady yes about a year afterwards i returned there in another ship she had been shut up in a convent and forced to take the veil oh mr simple if you knew how i loved that girl i have never been more than polite to a woman since and shall die a bachelor you can't think how i was capsized the other day when i looked at the house i have hardly touched beef or pork since and am in debt two quarts of rum more than my allowance we gained our station off the coast of perpignan and as soon as we made the land we were most provokingly driven off by a severe gale i am not about to make any remarks about the gale for one storm is so like another but i mention it to account for a conversation which took place and with which i was very much amused i was near to the captain when he sent for mr muddle the carpenter who had been up to examine the main topsail yard which had been reported as sprung well mr muddle said the captain sprung sir most decidedly but i think we'll be able to mitigate it will you be able to secure it for the present mr muddle replied the captain rather sharply we'll mitigate it sir in half an hour i wish that you would use common phrases when you speak to me mr muddle i presume by mitigate you mean to say that you can secure it do you mean so sir or do you not yes sir that is what i mean most decidedly i hope no offence captain savage but i did not intend to displease you by my language very good mr muddle replied the captain it's the first time that i have spoken to you on the subject recollect that it will be the last the first time replied the carpenter who could not forget his philosophy i beg your pardon captain savage you found just the same fault with me on this quarter deck years ago and if i did mr muddle interrupted the captain very angrily depend upon it that at the same time i ordered you to go aloft and attend to your duty instead of talking nonsense on the quarter deck and although as you say you and i cannot recollect it if you did not obey that order instantaneously i also put you in confinement and obliged you to leave the ship as soon as she returned to port do you understand me sir i rather think sir replied the carpenter humbly touching his hat and walking to the main rigging that no such thing took place for i went up immediately as i do now and continued the carpenter who was incurable as he ascended the rigging as i shall again in another years that man is incorrigible with his confounded nonsense observed the captain to the first lieutenant every mast in the ship would go over the side provided he could get any one to listen to his ridiculous theory he is not a bad carpenter sir replied the first lieutenant he is not rejoined the captain but there is a time for all things mr simple what are you about sir i was listening to what you said replied i touching my hat i admire your candour sir replied he but advise you to discontinue the practice walk over to leeward sir and attend to your duty when i was on the other side of the deck i looked round and saw the captain and first lieutenant both laughing chapter eighteen i go away on service am wounded and taken prisoner with o'brien diamond cut diamond between the o'briens get into comfortable quarters my first interview with celeste and now i have to relate an event which young as i was at the time will be found to have seriously affected me in after life how little do we know what to morrow may bring forth we had regained our station and for some days had been standing off and on the coast when one morning at daybreak we found ourselves about four miles from the town of cette and a large convoy of vessels coming round a point we made all sail in chase and they anchored close in shore under a battery which we did not discover until it opened fire upon us the shot struck the frigate two or three times for the water was smooth and the battery nearly level with it the captain tacked the ship and stood out again until the boats were hoisted out and all ready to pull on shore and storm the battery o'brien who was the officer commanding the first cutter on service was in his boat and i again obtained permission from him to smuggle myself into it we ran on shore amidst the fire of the gun boats which protected the convoy by which we lost three men and made for the battery which we took without opposition the french artillerymen running out as we ran in the first lieutenant who commanded desired o'brien to remain with the first cutter and after the armourer had spiked the guns as officer of the boat he was to shove off immediately o'brien and i remained in the battery with the armourer the boat's crew being ordered down to the boat to keep her afloat and ready to shove off at a moment's warning we had spiked all the guns but one when all of a sudden a volley of musketry was poured upon us which killed the armourer and wounded me in the leg above the knee i fell down by o'brien who cried out by the powers here they are and one gun not spiked he jumped down wrenched the hammer from the armourer's hand and seizing a nail from the bag in a few moments he had spiked the gun at this time i heard the tramping of the french soldiers advancing when o'brien threw away the hammer and lifting me upon his shoulders cried come along peter my boy and made for the boat as fast as he could but he was too late he had not got half way to the boat before he was collared by two french soldiers and dragged back into the battery the french troops then advanced and kept up a smart fire our cutter escaped and joined the other boat who had captured the gun boats and convoy with little opposition our large boats had carronades mounted in their bows and soon returned the fire with round and grape which drove the french troops back into the battery where they remained popping at our men under cover until most of the vessels were taken out those which they could not man were burnt in the meantime o'brien had been taken into the battery with me on his back but as soon as he was there he laid me gently down saying peter my boy as long as you were under my charge i'd carry you through thick and thin but now that you are under the charge of these french beggars why let them carry you every man his own bundle peter that's fair play so if they think you're worth the carrying let them bear the weight of ye as soon as our boats were clear of their musketry the commanding officer of the french troops examined the guns in the battery with the hope of reaching them and was very much annoyed to find that every one of them was spiked he'll look sharper than a magpie before he finds a clear touch hole i expect said o'brien as he watched the officer and here i must observe that o'brien showed great presence of mind in spiking the last gun for had they had one gun to fire at our boats towing out the prizes they must have done a great deal of mischief to them and we should have lost a great many men but in so doing and in the attempt to save me he sacrificed himself and was taken prisoner when the troops ceased firing the commanding officer came up to o'brien and looking at him said officer to which o'brien nodded his head he then pointed to me officer o'brien nodded his head again at which the french troops laughed as o'brien told me afterwards because i was what they called an enfant which means an infant i was very stiff and faint and could not walk the officer who commanded the troops left a detachment in the battery and prepared to return to cette from whence they came o'brien walked and i was carried on three muskets by six of the french soldiers not a very pleasant conveyance at any time but in my state excessively painful however i must say that they were very kind to me and put a great coat or something under my wounded leg for i was in an agony and fainted several times at last they brought me some water to drink o how delicious it was in about an hour and a half which appeared to me to be five days at the least we arrived at the town of cette and i was taken up to the house of the officer who commanded the troops and who had often looked at me as i was carried there from the battery saying pauvre enfant i was put on a bed where i again fainted away when i came to my senses i found a surgeon had bandaged my leg and that i had been undressed o'brien was standing by me and i believe that he had been crying for he thought that i was dead when i looked him in the face he said pater you baste how you frightened me bad luck to me if ever i take charge of another youngster what did you sham dead for i am better now o'brien replied i how much i am indebted to you you have been made prisoner in trying to save me i have been made prisoner in doing my duty in one shape or another i squeezed the offered hand of o'brien and looked round me the surgeon stood at one side of the bed and the officer who commanded the troops at the other at the head of the bed was a little girl about twelve years old who held a cup in her hand out of which something had been poured down my throat i looked at her and she had such pity in her face which was remarkably handsome that she appeared to me as an angel and i turned round as well as i could that i might look at her alone she offered me the cup which i should have refused from any one but her and i drank a little another person then came into the room and a conversation took place in french i wonder what they mean to do with us said i to o'brien whist hold your tongue replied he and then he leaned over me and said in a whisper i understand all they say don't you recollect i told you that i learnt the language after i was kilt and buried in the sand in south america after a little more conversation the officer and the others retired leaving nobody but the little girl and o'brien in the room it's a message from the governor said o'brien as soon as they were gone wishing the prisoners to be sent to the gaol in the citadel to be examined and the officer says and he's a real gentleman as far as i can judge that you're but a baby and badly wounded in the bargain and that it would be a shame not to leave you to die in peace so i presume that i'll part company from you very soon i hope not o'brien replied i if you go to prison i will go also for i will not leave you who are my best friend to remain with strangers i should not be half so happy although i might have more comforts in my present situation pater my boy i am glad to see that your heart is in the right place as i always thought it was or i wouldn't have taken you under my protection we'll go together to prison my jewel and i'll fish at the bars with a bag and a long string just by way of recreation and to pick up a little money to buy you all manner of nice things and when you get well you shall do it yourself mayhap you'll have better luck as peter your namesake had who was a fisherman before you but somehow or another i think we mayn't be parted yet for i heard the officer who appears to be a real gentleman and worthy to have been an irishman born say to the other that he'd ask the governor for me to stay with you on parole until you are well again the little girl handed me the lemonade of which i drank a little and then i felt very faint again i laid my head on the pillow and o'brien having left off talking i was soon in a comfortable sleep in an hour i was awakened by the return of the officer who was accompanied by the surgeon the officer addressed o'brien in french who shook his head as before two other persons then came into the room one of them addressed o'brien in very bad english saying that he was interpreter and would beg him to answer a few questions he then inquired the name of our ship number of guns and how long we had been cruising after that the force of the english fleet and a great many other questions relative to them all of which were put in french by the person who came with him and the answers translated and taken down in a book some of the questions o'brien answered correctly to others he pleaded ignorance and to some he asserted what was not true but i did not blame him for that as it was his duty not to give information to the enemy at last they asked my name and rank which o'brien told them was i noble yes replied o'brien don't say so o'brien interrupted i peter you know nothing about it you are grandson to a lord i know that but still i am not noble myself although descended from him therefore pray don't say so bother pater i have said it and i won't unsay it besides pater recollect it's a french question and in france you would be considered noble at all events it can do no harm i feel too ill to talk o'brien but i wish you had not said so they then inquired o'brien's name which he told them his rank in the service and also whether he was noble i am an o'brien replied he and pray what's the meaning of the o before my name if i'm not noble however mr interpreter you may add that we have dropped our title because it's not convanient the french officer burst out into a loud laugh which surprised us very much the interpreter had great difficulty in explaining what o'brien said but as o'brien told me afterwards the answer was put down doubtful they all left the room except the officer who then to our astonishment addressed us in good english gentlemen i have obtained permission from the governor for you to remain in my house until mr simple is recovered mr o'brien it is necessary that i should receive your parole of honour that you will not attempt to escape are you willing to give it o'brien was quite amazed murder an' irish cried he so you speak english colonel i'm of irish descent replied the officer and my name as well as yours is o'brien i was brought up in this country not being permitted to serve my own and retain the religion of my forefathers but to the question mr o'brien will you give your parole the word of an irishman and the hand to boot replied o'brien shaking the colonel by the hand and you are more than doubly sure for i'll never go away and leave little peter here and as for carrying him on my back i've had enough of that already it is sufficient replied the colonel mr o'brien i will make you as comfortable as i can and when you are tired of attending your friend my little daughter shall take your place you'll find her a kind little nurse mr simple i could not refrain from tears at the colonel's kindness he shook me by the hand and telling o'brien that dinner was ready he called up his daughter the little girl who had attended me before and desired her to remain in the room celeste said he you understand a little english quite enough to find out what he is in want of go and fetch your work to amuse yourself when he is asleep celeste went out and returning with her embroidery sat down by the head of the bed the colonel and o'brien then quitted the room celeste then commenced her embroidery and as her eyes were cast down upon her work i was able to look at her without her observing it as i said before she was a very beautiful little girl her hair was light brown eyes very large and eyebrows drawn as with a pair of compasses her nose and mouth was also very pretty but it was not so much her features as the expression of her countenance which was so beautiful so modest so sweet and so intelligent when she smiled which she almost always did when she spoke her teeth were like two rows of little pearls i had not looked at her long before she raised her eyes from her work and perceiving that i was looking at her said you want something want drink i speak very little english nothing i thank ye replied i i only want to go to sleep then shut your eye replied she smiling and she went to the window and drew down the blinds to darken the room in the evening the surgeon called again he felt my pulse and directing cold applications to my leg which had swelled considerably and was becoming very painful told colonel o'brien that although i had considerable fever i was doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances but i shall not dwell upon my severe sufferings for a fortnight after which the ball was extracted nor upon how carefully i was watched by o'brien the colonel and little celeste during my peevishness and irritation arising from pain and fever chapter nineteen we remove to very unpleasant quarters birds of a feather won't always flock together o'brien cuts a cutter midshipman and gets a taste of french steel altogether flat work as soon as i was well enough to attend to my little nurse we became very intimate as might be expected in five weeks i was out of bed and could limp about the room and before two months were over i was quite recovered the colonel however would not report me to the governor i remained on a sofa during the day but at dusk i stole out of the house and walked about with celeste i never passed such a happy time as the last fortnight the only drawback was the remembrance that i should soon have to exchange it for a prison i was more easy about my father and mother as o'brien had written to them assuring them that i was doing well and besides a few days after our capture the frigate had run in and sent a flag of truce to inquire if we were alive or made prisoners at the same time captain savage sent on shore all our clothes and two hundred dollars in cash for our use i knew that even if o'brien's letter did not reach them they were sure to hear from captain savage that i was doing well at the end of twelve weeks the surgeon could no longer withhold his report and we were ordered to be ready in two days to march to toulon where we were to join another party of prisoners to proceed with them into the interior i must pass over our parting which the reader may imagine was very painful i promised to write to celeste and she promised that she would answer my letters if it were permitted we shook hands with colonel o'brien thanking him for his kindness and much to his regret we were taken in charge by two french cuirassiers who were waiting at the door as we preferred being continued on parole until our arrival at toulon the soldiers were not at all particular about watching us and we set off on horseback o'brien and i going first and the french cuirassiers following us in the rear the evening of the second day we arrived in toulon and as soon as we entered the gates we were delivered into the custody of an officer with a very sinister cast of countenance who after some conversation with the cuirassiers told us in a surly tone that our parole was at an end and gave us in charge of a corporal's guard with directions to conduct us to the prison near the arsenal we presented the cuirassiers with four dollars each for their civility and were then hurried away to our place of captivity i observed to o'brien that i was afraid that we must now bid farewell to anything like pleasure you're right there peter replied he but there's a certain jewel called hope that somebody found at the bottom of his chest when it was clean empty and so we must not lose sight of it but try and escape as soon as we can but the less we talk about it the better in a few minutes we arrived at our destination the door was opened ourselves and our bundles for we had only selected a few things for our march the colonel promising to forward the remainder as soon as we wrote to inform him to which depot we were consigned were rudely shoved in and as the doors again closed and the heavy bolts were shot i felt a creeping chill sensation pass through my whole body as soon as we could see for although the prison was not very dark yet so suddenly thrown in after the glare of a bright sunshiny day at first we could distinguish nothing we found ourselves in company with about thirty english sailors one man who was playing at cards looked up for a moment as we came in and cried out hurrah my lads the more the merrier as if he really were pleased to find that there were others who were as unfortunate as himself we stood looking at the groups for about ten minutes when o'brien observed that we might as well come to an anchor foul ground being better than no bottom so we sat down in a corner upon our bundles where we remained for more than an hour surveying the scene without speaking a word to each other i could not speak i felt so very miserable we had been in the prison about two hours when a lad in a very greasy ragged jacket with a pale emaciated face came up to us and said i perceive by your uniforms that you are both officers as well as myself o'brien stared at him for a little while and then answered upon my soul and honour then you've the advantage of us for it's more than i could perceive in you but i'll take your word for it pray what ship may have had the misfortune of losing such a credit to the service why i belong to the snapper cutter replied the young lad i was taken in a prixe which the commanding officer had given in my charge to take to gibraltar but they won't believe that i'm an officer i have applied for officer's allowance and rations and they won't give them to me well but they know that we are officers replied o'brien why do they shove us in here with the common seamen i suppose you are only put in here for the present replied the cutter's midshipman but why i cannot tell nor could we until afterwards when we found out as our narrative will show that the officer who received us from the cuirassiers had once quarrelled with colonel o'brien who first pulled his nose and afterwards ran him through the body being told by the cuirassiers that we were much esteemed by colonel o'brien he resolved to annoy us as much as he could and when he sent up the document announcing our arrival he left out the word officers and put us in confinement with the common seamen fortunately we were not destined to remain long in this detestable hole after a night of misery during which we remained sitting on our bundles and sleeping how we could leaning with our backs against the damp wall we were roused at daybreak by the unbarring of the prison doors followed up with an order to go into the prison yard we were huddled out like a flock of sheep by a file of soldiers with loaded muskets and as we went into the yard were ranged two and two the same officer who ordered us into prison commanded the detachment of soldiers who had us in charge o'brien stepped out of the ranks and addressing them stated that we are officers and had no right to be treated like common sailors the french officer replied that he had better information and that we wore coats which did not belong to us upon which o'brien was in a great rage calling the officer a liar and demanded satisfaction for the insult appealing to the french soldiers and stating that colonel o'brien who was at cette was his countryman and had received him for two months into his house upon parole which was quite sufficient to establish his being an officer the french soldiers appeared to side with o'brien after they had heard this explanation stating that no common english sailor could speak such good french and that they were present when we were sent in on parole and they asked the officer whether he intended to give satisfaction the officer stormed and drawing his sword out of the scabbard struck o'brien with the flat of the blade looking at him with contempt and ordering him into the ranks i could not help observing that during this scene the men of war sailors who were among the prisoners were very indignant while on the contrary those captured in merchant vessels appeared to be pleased with the insult offered to o'brien one of the french soldiers then made a sarcastic remark that the french officer did not much like the name of o'brien this so enraged the officer that he flew at o'brien pushed him back into the ranks and taking out a pistol threatened to shoot him through the head i must do the justice to the french soldiers that they all called out shame when o'brien returned to the ranks he looked defiance at the officer telling him that he would pocket the affront very carefully as he intended to bring it out again upon a future and more suitable occasion we were then marched out in ranks two and two being met in the street by two drummers and a crowd of people who had gathered to witness our departure the drums beat and away we went the officer who had charge of us mounted a small horse galloping up and down from one end of the ranks to the other with his sword drawn bullying swearing and striking with the flat of the blade at any one of the prisoners who was not in his proper place when we were close to the gates we were joined by another detachment of prisoners we were then ordered to halt and were informed through an interpreter that any one attempting to escape would immediately be shot after which information we once more proceeded on our route chapter twenty o'brien fights a duel with a french officer and proves that the great art of fencing is knowing nothing about it we arrive at our new quarters which we find very secure at night we arrived at a small town the name of which i forget here we were all put into an old church for the night and a very bad night we passed we were afraid to lie down anywhere as like all ruined buildings in france the ground was covered with filth and the smell was shocking at daybreak the door of the church was again opened by the french soldiers and we were conducted to the square of the town where we found the troops quartered as the french officers walked along our ranks to look at us i perceived among them a captain whom we had known very intimately when we were living at cette with colonel o'brien i cried out his name immediately he turned round and seeing o'brien and me he came up to us shaking us by the hand and expressing his surprise at finding us in such a situation o'brien explained to him how we had been treated at which he expressed his indignation as did the other officers who had collected round us the major who commanded the troops in the town turned to the french officer he was only a lieutenant who had conducted us from toulon and demanded of him his reason for behaving to us in such an unworthy manner he denied having treated us ill and said that he had been informed that we had put on officers' dresses which did not belong to us at this o'brien declared that he was a liar and a cowardly foutre that he had struck him with the back of his sabre which he dared not have done if he had not been a prisoner adding that all he requested was satisfaction for the insult offered to him and appealed to the officers whether if it were refused the lieutenant's epaulets ought not to be cut off his shoulders the major commandant and the officers retired to consult and after a few minutes they agreed that the lieutenant was bound to give the satisfaction required the lieutenant replied that he was ready but at the same time did not appear to be very willing the prisoners were left in charge of the soldiers under a junior officer while the others accompanied by o'brien myself and the lieutenant walked to a short distance outside of the town as we proceeded there i asked o'brien with what weapons they would fight i take it for granted replied he that it will be with the small sword but said i do you know anything about fencing devil a bit peter but that's all in my favour how can that be replied i i'll tell you peter if one man fences well and another is but an indifferent hand at it it is clear that the first will run the other through the body but if the other knows nothing at all about it why then peter the case is not quite so clear because the good fencer is almost as much puzzled by your ignorance as you are by his skill and you become on more equal terms now peter i've made up my mind that i'll run that fellow through the body and so i will as sure as i am an o'brien well i hope you will but pray do not be too sure it's feeling sure that will make me able to do it peter by the blood of the o'briens didn't he slap me with his sword as if i were a clown in the pantomime peter i'll kill the harlequin scoundrel and my word's as good as my bond by this time we had arrived at the ground the french lieutenant stripped to his shirt and trowsers o'brien did the same kicking his boots off and standing upon the wet grass in his stockings the swords were measured and handed to them they took their distance and set to i must say that i was breathless with anxiety the idea of losing o'brien struck me with grief and terror i then felt the value of all his kindness to me and would have taken his place and have been run through the body rather than he should have been hurt at first o'brien put himself in the correct attitude of defence in imitation of the lieutenant but this was for a very few seconds he suddenly made a spring and rushed on his adversary stabbing at him with a velocity quite astonishing the lieutenant parrying in his defence until at last he had an opportunity of lounging at o'brien o'brien who no longer kept his left arm raised in equipoise caught the sword of the lieutenant at within six inches of the point and directing it under his left arm as he rushed in passed his own through the lieutenant's body it was all over in less than a minute the lieutenant did not live half an hour afterwards the french officers were very much surprised at the result for they perceived at once that o'brien knew nothing of fencing o'brien gathered a tuft of grass wiped the sword which he presented to the officer to whom it belonged and thanking the major and the whole of them for their impartiality and gentlemanlike conduct led the way to the square where he again took his station in the ranks of the prisoners shortly after the major commandant came up to us and asked whether we would accept of our parole as in that case we might travel as we pleased we consented with many thanks for his civility and kindness but i could not help thinking at the time that the french officers were a little mortified at o'brien's success although they were too honourable to express the feeling i had almost forgot to say that on our return after the duel the cutter's midshipman called out to o'brien requesting him to state to the commandant that he was also an officer but o'brien replied that there was no evidence for it but his bare word if he were an officer he must prove it himself as everything in his appearance flatly contradicted his assertion it's very hard replied the midshipman that because my jacket's a little tarry or so i must lose my rank my dear fellow replied o'brien it's not because your jacket's a little tarry it is because what the frenchman call your tout ensemble is quite disgraceful in an officer look at your face in the first puddle and you'll find that it would dirty the water you look into well it's very hard replied the midshipman that i must go on eating this black rye bread and very unkind of you it's very kind of me you spalpeen of the snapper prison will be a paradise to you when you get into good commons how you'll relish your grub by and by so now shut your pan or by the tail of jonah's whale i'll swear you're a spaniard i could not help thinking that o'brien was very severe upon the poor lad and i expostulated with him afterwards he replied peter if as a cutter's midshipman he is a bit of an officer the devil a bit is he of a gentleman either born or bred and i'm not bound to bail every blackguard looking chap that i meet by the head of st peter i would blush to be seen in his company if i were in the wildest bog in ireland with nothing but an old crow as spectator we were now again permitted to be on our parole and received every attention and kindness from the different officers who commanded the detachments which passed the prisoners from one town to the other in a few days we arrived at montpelier where we had orders to remain a short time until directions were received from government as to the depots for prisoners to which we were to be sent at this delightful town we had unlimited parole not even a gendarme accompanying us we lived at the table d'hote were permitted to walk about where we pleased and amused ourselves every evening at the theatre during our stay there we wrote to colonel o'brien at cette thanking him for his kindness and narrating what had occurred since we parted i also wrote to celeste enclosing my letter unsealed in the one to colonel o'brien i told her the history of o'brien's duel and all i could think would interest her how sorry i was to have parted from her that i never would forget her and trusted that some day as she was only half a frenchwoman that we should meet again before we left montpelier we had the pleasure of receiving answers to our letters the colonel's letters were very kind particularly the one to me in which he called me his dear boy and hoped that i should soon rejoin my friends and prove an ornament to my country in his letter to o'brien he requested him not to run me into useless danger to recollect that i was not so well able to undergo extreme hardship the answer from celeste was written in english but she must have had assistance from her father or she could not have succeeded so well it was like herself very kind and affectionate and also ended with wishing me a speedy return to my friends who must she said be so fond of me that she despaired of ever seeing me more but that she consoled herself as well as she could with the assurance that i should be happy i forgot to say that colonel o'brien in his letter to me stated that he expected immediate orders to leave cette and take the command of some military post in the interior or join the army but which he could not tell that they had packed up everything and he was afraid that our correspondence must cease as he could not state to what place we should direct our letters i must here acquaint the reader with a circumstance which i forgot to mention which was that when captain savage sent in a flag of truce with our clothes and money i thought that it was but justice to o'brien that they should know on board of the frigate the gallant manner in which he had behaved i knew that he never would tell himself so ill as i was at the time i sent for colonel o'brien and requested him to write down my statement of the affair in which i mentioned how o'brien had spiked the last gun and had been taken prisoner by so doing together with his attempting to save me when the colonel had written all down i requested that he would send for the major who first entered the fort with the troops and translate it to him in french this he did in my presence and the major declared every word to be true will he attest it colonel as it may be of great service to o'brien the major immediately assented colonel o'brien then enclosed my letter with a short note from himself to captain savage in ten days we received an order to march on the following morning the sailors among whom was our poor friend the midshipman of the snapper cutter were ordered to verdun o'brien and i with eight masters of merchant vessels who joined us at montpelier were directed by the government to be sent to givet a fortified town in the department of ardennes but at the same time orders arrived from government to treat the prisoners with great strictness and not to allow any parole it was exactly four months from the time of our capture that we arrived at our destined prison at givet peter said o'brien as he looked hastily at the fortifications and the river which divided the two towns i see no reason either english or french that we should not eat our christmas dinner in england i've a bird's eye view of the outside and now have only to find out whereabouts we may be in the inside i must say that when i looked at the ditches and high ramparts i had a different opinion so had a gendarme who was walking by our side and who had observed o'brien's scrutiny and who quietly said to him in french vous le croyez possible everything is possible to a brave man the french armies have proved that answered o'brien you are right replied the gendarme pleased with the compliment to his nation i wish you success you will deserve it but and he shook his head if i could obtain a plan of the fortress said o'brien i would give five napoleons for one and he looked at the gendarme i cannot see any objection to an officer although a prisoner studying fortification replied the gendarme in two hours you will be within the walls and now i recollect in the map of the two towns the fortress is laid down sufficiently accurately to give you an idea of it but we have conversed too long so saying the gendarme dropped into the rear in a quarter of an hour we arrived at the place d'armes where we were met as usual by another detachment of troops and drummers who paraded us through the town previous to our being drawn up before the governor's house as we stopped at the governor's house the gendarme who had left us in the square made a sign to o'brien as much as to say i have it o'brien took out five napoleons which he wrapped in paper and held in his hand in a minute or two the gendarme came up and presented o'brien with an old silk handkerchief saying votre mouchoir monsieur merci replied o'brien putting the handkerchief which contained the map into his pocket voici a boire mon ami and he slipped the paper with the five napoleons into the hand of the gendarme who immediately retreated this was very fortunate for us as we afterwards discovered that a mark had been put against o'brien's and my name not to allow parole or permission to leave the fortress even under surveillance chapter twenty one o'brien receives his commission as lieutenant and then we take french leave of givet if i doubted the practicability of escape when i examined the exterior when we were ushered into the interior of the fortress i felt that it was impossible and i stated my opinion to o'brien we were conducted into a yard surrounded by a high wall the buildings appropriated for the prisoners were built with lean to roofs on one side and at each side of the square was a sentry looking down upon us it was very much like the dens which they now build for bears only so much larger o'brien answered me with a pish peter it's the very security of the place which will enable us to get out of it but don't talk as there are always spies about who understand english we were shown into a room allotted to six of us our baggage was examined and then delivered over to us better and better peter observed o'brien they've not found it out what inquired i oh only a little selection of articles which might be useful to us by and by he then showed me what i never before was aware of that he had a false bottom to his trunk but it was papered over like the rest and very ingeniously concealed and what is there o'brien inquired i never mind i had them made at montpelier you'll see by and by the others who were lodged in the same room then came in and after staying a quarter of an hour went away at the sound of the dinner bell now peter said o'brien i must get rid of my load turn the key o'brien then undressed himself and then he threw off his shirt and drawers showed me a rope of silk with a knot at every two feet about half an inch in size wound round and round his body there were about sixty feet of it altogether as i unwound it he turning round and round observed peter i've worn this rope ever since i left montpelier and you've no idea of the pain i have suffered but we must go to england that's decided upon for some days o'brien who really was not very well kept to his room during this time he often examined the map given him by the gendarme one day he said to me peter can you swim no replied i but never mind that but i must mind it peter for observe we shall have to cross the river meuse and boats are not always to be had you observe that this fortress is washed by the river on one side and as it is the strongest side it is the least guarded we must escape by it are you then determined to escape o'brien i cannot perceive how we are even to get up this wall with four sentries staring us in the face never do you mind that peter mind your own business and first tell me do you intend to try your luck with me yes replied i most certainly if you have sufficient confidence in me to take me as your companion to tell you the truth peter i would not give a farthing to escape without you the prison was by all accounts very different from verdun and some others we had no parole and but little communication with the townspeople some were permitted to come in and supply us with various articles but their baskets were searched to see that they contained nothing that might lead to an escape on the part of the prisoners without the precautions that o'brien had taken any attempt would have been useless now peter said he one day i want nothing more than an umbrella for you why an umbrella for me to keep you from being drowned with too much water that's all rain won't drown me no no peter but buy a new one as soon as you can i did so o'brien boiled up a quantity of bees' wax and oil and gave it several coats of this preparation he then put it carefully away in the ticking of his bed we had been now about two months in givet when a steel's list was sent to a lieutenant who was confined there the lieutenant came up to o'brien and asked him his christian name terence to be sure replied o'brien then answered the lieutenant i may congratulate you on your promotion for here you are upon the list of august sure there must be some trifling mistake let me look at it terence o'brien sure enough but now the question is has any other fellow robbed me of my name and promotion at the same time bother what can it mane i won't belave it not a word of it i've no more interest than a dog who drags cats' meat i then told o'brien how i had written to captain savage and had had the fact attested by the major who had made us prisoners well peter said o'brien after a pause there is a fable about a lion and a mouse if by your means i have obtained my promotion why then the mouse is a finer baste than the lion for a few days after this o'brien was very uneasy but fortunately letters arrived by that time one to me from my father in which he requested me to draw for whatever money i might require saying that the whole family would retrench in every way to give me all the comfort which might be obtained in my unfortunate situation i wept at this kindness and more than ever longed to throw myself in his arms and thank him he also told me that my uncle william was dead and that there was only one between him and the title but that my grandfather was in good health and had been very kind to him lately my mother was much afflicted at my having been made a prisoner and requested i would write as often as i could o'brien's letter was from captain savage the frigate had been sent home with despatches and o'brien's conduct represented to the admiralty which had in consequence promoted him to the rank of lieutenant o'brien came to me with the letter his countenance radiant with joy as he put it into my hands in return i put mine into his and he read it over peter my boy i'm under great obligations to you when you were wounded and feverish you thought of me at a time when you had quite enough to think of yourself but i never thank in words i see your uncle william is dead how many more uncles have you my uncle john who is married and has already two daughters blessings on him may he stick to the female line of business peter my boy you shall be a lord before you die nonsense o'brien i have no chance don't put such foolish ideas in my head what chance had i of being a lieutenant and am i not one but peter do me one favour as i am really a lieutenant just touch your hat to me only once that's all but i wish the compliment just to see how it looks lieutenant o'brien said i touching my hat have you any further orders yes sir replied he that you never presume to touch your hat to me again unless we sail together and then that's a different sort of thing about a week afterwards o'brien came to me and said the new moon's quartered in with foul weather if it holds prepare for a start i have put what is necessary in your little haversack it may be tonight go to bed now and sleep for a week if you can for you'll get but little sleep if we succeed for the week to come this was about eight o'clock i went to bed and about twelve i was roused by o'brien who told me to dress myself carefully and come down to him in the yard it was some time before i could find o'brien who was hard at work and as i had already been made acquainted with all his plans i will now explain them at montpelier he had procured six large pieces of iron about eighteen inches long with a gimlet at one end of each and a square at the other which fitted to a handle which unshipped for precaution he had a spare handle but each handle fitted to all the irons o'brien had screwed one of these pieces of iron between the interstices of the stones of which the wall was built and sitting astride on that was fixing another about three feet above when he had accomplished this he stood upon the lower iron and supporting himself by the second which about met his hip he screwed in a third always fixing them about six inches on one side of the other and not one above the other when he had screwed in his six irons he was about half up the wall and then he fastened his rope which he had carried round his neck to the upper iron and lowering himself down unscrewed the four lower irons then ascending by the rope he stood upon the fifth iron and supporting himself by the upper iron recommenced his task by these means he arrived in the course of an hour and a half at the top of the wall where he fixed his last iron and making his rope fast he came down again now peter said he there is no fear of the sentries seeing us if they had the eyes of cats they could not until we are on the top of the wall but then we arrive at the glacis and we must creep to the ramparts on our bellies i am going up with all the materials give me your haversack you will go up lighter and recollect should any accident happen to me you run to bed again if on the contrary i pull the rope up and down three or four times you may sheer up it as fast as you can o'brien then loaded himself with the other rope the two knapsacks iron crows and other implements he had procured and last of all with the umbrella peter if the rope bears me with all this it is clear it will bear such a creature as you are therefore don't be afraid so whispering he commenced his ascent in about three minutes he was up and the rope pulled i immediately followed him and found the rope very easy to climb from the knots at every two feet which gave me a hold for my feet and i was up in as short a time as he was he caught me by the collar putting his wet hand on my mouth and i lay down beside him while he pulled up the rope we then crawled on our stomachs across the glacis till we arrived at the rampart it was some time before o'brien could find out the point exactly above the drawbridge of the first ditch at last he did he fixed his crow bar in and lowered down the rope now peter i had better go first again when i shake the rope from below all's right o'brien descended and in a few minutes the rope again shook i followed him and found myself received in his arms upon the meeting of the drawbridge but the drawbridge itself was up o'brien led the way across the chains and i followed him when we had crossed the moat we found a barrier gate locked this puzzled us o'brien pulled out his picklocks to pick it but without success here we were fast we must undermine the gate o'brien we must pull up the pavement until we can creep under peter you are a fine fellow i never thought of that we worked very hard until the hole was large enough using the crowbar which was left and a little wrench which o'brien had with him by these means we got under the gate in the course of an hour or more this gate led to the lower rampart but we had a covered way to pass through before we arrived at it we proceeded very cautiously when we heard a noise we stopped and found it was a sentry who was fast asleep and snoring o'brien thought for a moment peter said he now is the time for you to prove yourself a man he is fast asleep but his noise must be stopped i will stop his mouth but at the very moment that i do so you must throw open the pan of his musket and then he cannot fire it i will o'brien don't fear me we crept cautiously up to him and o'brien motioning to me to put my thumb upon the pan i did so and the moment that o'brien put his hand upon the soldier's mouth i threw open the pan the fellow struggled and snapped his lock as a signal but of course without discharging his musket and in a minute he was not only gagged but bound by o'brien with my assistance leaving him there we proceeded to the rampart and fixing the crow bar again o'brien descended i followed him and found him in the river hanging on to the rope the umbrella was opened and turned upwards the preparation made it resist the water and as previously explained to me by o'brien i had only to hold on at arm's length to two beckets which he had affixed to the point of the umbrella which was under water to the same part o'brien had a tow line which taking in his teeth he towed me down the stream to about a hundred yards clear of the fortress where we landed o'brien was so exhausted that for a few minutes he remained quite motionless i also was benumbed with the cold peter said he thank god we have succeeded so far now we must push on as far as we can for we shall have daylight in two hours o'brien took out his flask of spirits and we both drank a half tumbler at least but we should not in our state have been affected with a bottle we now walked along the riverside till we fell in with a small craft with a boat towing astern o'brien swam to it and cutting the painter without getting in towed it on shore the oars were fortunately in the boat i got in we shoved off and rowed away down the stream till the dawn of day all's right peter now we'll land this is the forest of ardennes we landed replaced the oars in the boat and pushed her off into the stream to induce people to suppose that she had broken adrift and then hastened into the thickest of the wood it rained hard i shivered and my teeth chattered with the cold but there was no help for it we again took a dram of spirits and worn out with fatigue and excitement soon fell last asleep upon a bed of leaves which we had collected together chapter twenty two grave consequences of gravitation o'brien enlists himself as a gendarme and takes charge of me we are discovered and obliged to run for it the pleasures of a winter bivouac it was not until noon that i awoke when i found that o'brien had covered me more than a foot deep with leaves to protect me from the weather i felt quite warm and comfortable my clothes had dried on me but without giving me cold how very kind of you o'brien said i not a bit peter you have hard work to go through yet and i must take care of you you're but a bud and i'm a full blown rose so saying he put the spirit flask to his mouth and then handed it to me now peter we must make a start for depend upon it they will scour the country for us but this is a large wood and they may as well attempt to find a needle in a bundle of hay if we once get into the heart of it we set off forcing our way through the thicket for about three hours o'brien looking occasionally at his pocket compass it then was again nearly dark and o'brien proposed a halt we made up a bed of leaves for the night and slept much more comfortably than we had the night before all our bread was wet but as we had no water it was rather a relief the meat we had with us was sufficient for a week once more we laid down and fell fast asleep about five o'clock in the morning i was roused by o'brien who at the same time put his hand gently over my mouth i sat up and perceived a large fire not far from us the philistines are upon us peter said he i have reconnoitred and they are the gendarmes i am fearful of going away as we may stumble upon some more of them i've been thinking what's best before i waked you and it appears to me that we had better get up the tree and lie there at that time we were hidden in a copse of underwood with a large oak in the centre covered with ivy i think so too o'brien shall we go up now or wait a little now to be sure that they're eating their prog mount you peter and i'll help you o'brien shoved me up the tree and then waiting a little while to bury our haversacks among the leaves he followed me he desired me to remain in a very snug position on the first fork of the tree while he took another amongst a bunch of ivy on the largest bough there we remained for about an hour when day dawned we observed the gendarmes mustered at the break of day by the corporal and then they all separated in different directions to scour the wood we were delighted to perceive this as we hoped soon to be able to get away but there was one gendarme who remained he walked round the tree looking up into every part but we were well concealed and he did not discover us for some time at last he saw me and ordered me to come down i paid no attention to him as i had no signal from o'brien he walked round a little farther until he was directly under the branch on which o'brien lay taking up this position he had a fairer aim at me and levelled his musket saying descendez ou je tire still i continued immovable for i knew not what to do i shut my eyes however the musket shortly afterwards was discharged and whether from fear or not i can hardly tell i lost my hold of a sudden and down i came i was stunned with the fall and thought that i must have been wounded and was very much surprised when instead of the gendarme o'brien came up to me and asked whether i was hurt i answered i believed not and got up on my legs when i found the gendarme lying on the ground breathing heavily but insensible when o'brien perceived the gendarme level his musket at me he immediately dropped from the bough right upon his head this occasioned the musket to go off without hitting me and at the same time the weight of o'brien's body from such a height killed the gendarme for he expired before we left him now peter said o'brien this is the most fortunate thing in the world and will take us half through the country but we have no time to lose he then stripped the gendarme who still breathed heavily and dragging him to our bed of leaves covered him up threw off his own clothes which he tied up in a bundle and gave to me to carry and put on those of the gendarme i could not help laughing at the metamorphosis and asked o'brien what he intended sure i'm a gendarme bringing with me a prisoner who has escaped when we stopped at night my youth excited a great deal of commiseration especially from the females and in one instance i was offered assistance to escape i consented to it but at the same time informed o'brien of the plan proposed o'brien kept watch i dressed myself and was at the open window when he rushed in seizing me and declaring that he would inform the government of the conduct of the parties their confusion and distress was very great they offered o'brien twenty thirty forty napoleons if he would hush it up for they were aware of the penalty and imprisonment o'brien replied that he would not accept of any money in compromise of his duty that after he had given me into the charge of the gendarme of the next post his business was at an end and he must return to flushing where he was stationed i have a sister there replied the hostess who keeps an inn you'll want good quarters and a friendly cup do not denounce us and i'll give you a letter to her which if it does not prove of service you can then return and give the information o'brien consented the letter was delivered and read to him in which the sister was requested by the love she bore to the writer to do all she could for the bearer who had the power of making the whole family miserable but had refused so to do o'brien pocketed the letter filled his brandy flask and saluting all the women left the cabaret dragging me after him with a cord we were following our route avoiding malines which was a fortified town and at the time were in a narrow lane with wide ditches full of water on each side at the turning of a sharp corner we met the gendarme who had supplied o'brien with a map of the town of givet good morning comrade said he to o'brien looking earnestly at him whom have we here a young englishman whom i picked up close by escaped from prison where from he will not say but i suspect from givet there are two who have escaped from givet replied he how they escaped no one can imagine but continued he again looking at o'brien avec les braves il n'y a rien d'impossible that is true replied o'brien i have taken one the other cannot be far off you had better look for him i should like to find him replied the gendarme for you know that to retake a runaway prisoner is certain promotion you will be made a corporal so much the better replied o'brien adieu mon ami nay i merely came for a walk and will return with you to malines where of course you are bound we shall not get there to night said o'brien my prisoner is too much fatigued well then we will go as far as we can and i will assist you perhaps we may find the second who i understand obtained a map of the fortress by some means or another o'brien observed that the english prisoners were very liberal that he knew that a hundred napoleons were often paid for assistance and he thought that no corporal's rank was equal to a sum that would in france made a man happy and independent for life very true replied the gendarme and let me only look upon that sum and i will guarantee a positive safety out of france then we understand each other replied o'brien this boy will give two hundred one half shall be yours if you will assist i will think of it replied the gendarme who then talked about indifferent subjects until we arrived at a small town called acarchot when we proceeded to a cabaret the usual curiosity passed over we were left alone o'brien telling the gendarme that he would expect his reply that night or to morrow morning the gendarme said to morrow morning o'brien requesting him to take charge of me he called the woman of the cabaret to show him a room she showed him one or two which he refused as not sufficiently safe for the prisoner the woman laughed at the idea observing what had he to fear from a pauvre enfant like me yet this pauvre enfant escaped from givet replied o'brien these englishmen are devils from their birth the last room showed to o'brien suited him and he chose it the woman not presuming to contradict a gendarme as soon as they came down again o'brien ordered me to bed and went upstairs with me he bolted the door and pulling me to the large chimney we put our heads up and whispered that our conversation should not be heard this man is not to be trusted said o'brien and we must give him the slip i know my way out of the inn and we must return the way we came and then strike off in another direction but will he permit us not if he can help it but i shall soon find out his manoeuvres o'brien then went and stopped the key hole by hanging his handkerchief across it and stripping himself of his gendarme uniform put on his own clothes then stuffed the blankets and pillows into the gendarme's dress and laid it down on the outside of the bed as if it were a man sleeping in his clothes indeed it was an admirable deception he laid his musket by the side of the image and then did the same to my bed making it appear as if there was a person asleep in it of my size and putting my cap on the pillow now peter we'll see if he is watching us he will wait till he thinks we are asleep the light still remained in the room and about an hour afterwards we heard a noise of one treading on the stairs upon which as agreed we crept under the bed the latch of our door was tried and finding it open which he did not expect the gendarme entered and looking at both beds went away now said i after the gendarme had gone down stairs o'brien ought we not to escape i've been thinking of it peter and i have come to a resolution that we can manage it better he is certain to come again in an hour or two it is only eleven now i'll play him a trick o'brien then took one of the blankets made it fast to the window which he left wide open and at the same time dissarranged the images he had made up so as to let the gendarme perceive that they were counterfeit we again crept under the bed and as o'brien foretold in about an hour more the gendarme returned our lamp was still burning but he had a light of his own he looked at the beds perceived at once that he had been duped went to the open window and then exclaimed sacre dieu ils m'ont eschappes et je ne ne suis plus corporal foutre a la chasse he rushed out of the room and in a few minutes afterwards we heard him open the street door and go away that will do peter said o'brien laughing now we'll be off also although there's no great hurry o'brien then resumed his dress of a gendarme and about an hour afterwards we went down and wishing the hostess all happiness quitted the cabaret returning the same road by which we had come now peter said o'brien we're in a bit of a puzzle this dress won't do any more still there's a respectability about it which will not allow me to put it off till the last moment we walked on till daylight when we hid ourselves in a copse of trees our money was not exhausted as i had drawn upon my father for pounds which with the disadvantageous exchange had given me fifty napoleons on the fifth day being then six days from the forest of ardennes we hid ourselves in a small wood about a quarter of a mile from the road i remained there while o'brien as a gendarme went to obtain provisions as usual i looked out for the best shelter during his absence and what was my horror at falling in with a man and woman who lay dead in the snow having evidently perished from the inclemency of the weather just as i discovered them o'brien returned and i told him he went with me to view the bodies they were dressed in a strange attire ribands pinned upon their clothes and two pairs of very high stilts lying by their sides o'brien surveyed them and then said peter this is the very best thing that could have happened to us we may now walk through france without soiling our feet with the cursed country how do you mean i mean said he that these are the people that we met near montpelier who came from the landes walking about on their stilts for the amusement of others to obtain money in their own country they are obliged to walk so now peter it appears to me that the man's clothes will fit me and the girl's poor creature how pretty she looks cold in death will fit you all we have to do is to practise a little and then away we start o'brien then with some difficulty pulled off the man's jacket and trowsers and having so done buried him in the snow the poor girl was despoiled of her gown and upper petticoat with every decency and also buried we collected the clothes and stilts and removed to another quarter where we pitched upon a hovel and took our meal peter said o'brien lie down and sleep and i'll keep the watch not a word i will have it down at once i did so and in a very few minutes was fast asleep for i was worn out with cold and fatigue just as the day broke o'brien roused me he had stood sentry all night and looked very haggard o'brien you are ill said i not a bit but i've emptied the brandy flask and that's a bad job however it is to be remedied i did not go to sleep again for some time i was so anxious to see o'brien fast asleep he went in and out several times during which i pretended to be fast asleep at last it rained in torrents and then he laid down and in a few minutes overpowered by nature he fell fast asleep snoring so loudly that i was afraid some one would hear us i then got up and watched occasionally lying down and slumbering awhile and then going down to the door chapter twenty three exalted with our success we march through france without touching the ground i become feminine we are voluntary conscripts at day break i called o'brien who jumped up in a great hurry sure i've been asleep peter yes you have replied i and i thank heaven that you have for no one could stand such fatigue as you have much longer and if you fall ill what will become of me this was touching him on the right point well peter since there's no harm come of it there's no harm done i've had sleep enough for the next week that's certain we returned to the wood the snow had disappeared and the rain ceased the sun shone out from between the clouds and we felt warm don't pass so near that way said o'brien we shall see the poor creatures now that the sun is gone peter we must shift our quarters to night for i have been to every cabaret in the village and i cannot go there any more without suspicion although i am a gendarme we remained there till the evening and then set off still returning toward givet about an hour before daylight we arrived at a copse of trees close to the road side and surrounded by a ditch not above a quarter of a mile from a village it appears to me said o'brien that this will do i will now put you there and then go boldly to the village and see what i can get for here we must stay at least a week we walked to the copse and the ditch being rather too wide for me to leap o'brien laid the four stilts together so as to form a bridge over which i contrived to walk tossing to me all the bundles and desiring me to leave the stilts as a bridge for him on his return he set off to the village with his musket on his shoulder he was away two hours when he returned with a large supply of provisions the best we had ever had there said he we have enough for a good week and look here peter this is better than all and he showed me two large horse rugs excellent replied i now we shall be comfortable i paid honestly for all but these rugs observed o'brien i was afraid to buy them so i stole them however we'll leave them here for those they belong to it's only borrowing after all we now prepared a very comfortable shelter with branches which we wove together and laying the leaves in the sun to dry soon obtained a soft bed to put our horse rug on while we covered ourselves up with the other our bridge of stilts we had removed so that we felt ourselves quite secure from surprise at dark to bed we went and slept soundly i never felt more refreshed during our wanderings at daylight o'brien got up now peter a little practice before breakfast what practice do you mean mean why on the stilts i expect in a week that you'll be able to dance a gavotte at least for mind me peter you travel out of france upon these stilts depend upon it o'brien then took the stilts belonging to the man giving me those of the woman we strapped them to our thighs and by fixing our backs to a tree contrived to get upright upon them but at the first attempt to walk o'brien fell to the right and i fell to the left o'brien fell against a tree but i fell on my nose and made it bleed very much however we laughed and got up again and although we had several falls at last we made a better hand of them o'brien then dressed me in the poor girl's clothes and himself in the man's they fitted very well peter you make a very pretty girl said o'brien but o'brien replied i as these petticoats are not very warm i mean to cut off my trousers up to my knees and wear them underneath that's all right said o'brien the next morning we made use of our stilts to cross the ditch and carrying them in our hands we boldly set off on the high road to malines we met several people gendarmes and others but with the exception of some remarks upon my good looks we passed unnoticed towards the evening we arrived at the village where we had slept in the outhouse and as soon as we entered it we put on our stilts and commenced a march when the crowd had gathered we held out our caps and receiving nine or ten sous we entered a cabaret many questions were asked us as to where we came from and o'brien answered telling lies innumerable i played the modest girl and o'brien who stated i was his sister appeared very careful and jealous of my attention we slept well and the next morning continued our route to malines as we entered the barriers we put on our stilts and marched boldly on the guard at the gate stopped us not from suspicion but to amuse themselves and i was forced to submit to several kisses from their garlic lips before we were allowed to enter the town we again mounted on our stilts for the guard had forced us to dismount or they could not have kissed me every now and then imitating a dance until we arrived at the grande place where we stopped opposite the hotel and commenced a sort of waltz which we had practised the people in the hotel looked out of the window to see our exhibition and when we had finished i went up to the windows with o'brien's cap to collect money what was my surprise to perceive colonel o'brien looking full in my face and staring very hard at me what was my greater astonishment at seeing celeste who immediately recognised me and ran back to the sofa in the room putting her hands up to her eyes and crying out c'est lui c'est lui fortunately o'brien was close to me or i should have fallen but he supported me peter ask the crowd for money or you are lost i did so and collecting some pence then asked him what i should do go back to the window you can then judge of what will happen i returned to the window colonel o'brien had disappeared but celeste was there as if waiting for me i held out the cap to her and she thrust her hand into it the cap sunk with the weight i took out a purse which i kept closed in my hand and put it into my bosom celeste then retired from the window and when she had gone to the back of the room kissed her hand to me and went out at the door i remained stupefied for a moment but o'brien roused me and we quitted the grande place taking up our quarters at a little cabaret on examining the purse i found fifty napoleons in it they must have been obtained from her father at the cabaret where we stopped we were informed that the officer who was at the hotel had been appointed to the command of the strong fort of bergen op zoom and was proceeding thither we walked out of the town early in the morning after o'brien had made purchases of some of the clothes usually worn by the peasantry when within a few miles of st nicholas we threw away our stilts and the clothes which we had on and dressed ourselves in those o'brien had purchased o'brien had not forgot to provide us with two large brown coloured blankets which we strapped on to our shoulders as the soldiers do their coats it was bitter cold weather and the snow had fallen heavily during the whole day but although nearly dusk there was a bright moon ready for us we walked very fast and soon observed persons ahead of us let us overtake them we may obtain some information as we came up with them one of them they were both lads of seventeen to eighteen said to o'brien i thought we were the last but i was mistaken how far is it now to st nicholas how should i know replied o'brien i am a stranger in these parts as well as yourself from what part of france do you come demanded the other his teeth chattering with the cold for he was badly clothed and with little defence from the inclement weather from montpelier replied o'brien and i from toulouse a sad change comrades from olives and vines to such a climate as this curse the conscription i intended to have taken a little wife next year o'brien gave me a push as if to say here's something that will do and then continued and curse the conscription i say too for i had just married and now my wife is left to be annoyed by the attention of the fermier general but it can't be helped c'est pour la france et pour la gloire we shall be too late to get a billet replied the other and not a sou have i in my pockets i doubt if i get up with the main body till they are at flushing by our route they are at axel to day if we arrive at st nicholas we shall do well replied o'brien but i have a little money left and i'll not see a comrade want a supper or a bed who is going to serve his country you can repay me when we meet at flushing that i will with thanks replied the frenchman and so will jaques here if you will trust him with pleasure replied o'brien who then entered into along conversation by which he drew out from the frenchmen that a party of conscripts had been ordered to flushing and that they had dropped behind the main body in about an hour we arrived at st nicholas and after some difficulty obtained entrance into a cabaret vive la france said o'brien going up to the fire and throwing the snow off his hat in a short time we were seated to a good supper and very tolerable wine the hostess sitting down by us and listening to the true narratives of the real conscripts and the false one of o'brien after supper the conscript who first addressed us pulled out his printed paper with the route laid down and observed that we were two days behind the others o'brien read it over and laid it on the table at the same time calling for more wine having already pushed it round very freely we did not drink much ourselves but plied them hard and at last the conscript commenced the whole history of his intended marriage and his disappointment tearing his hair and crying now and then never mind interrupted o'brien every two or three minutes buvons un autre coup pour la gloire and thus he continued to make them both drink until they reeled away to bed forgetting their printed paper which o'brien had some time before slipped away from the table we also retired to our room when o'brien observed to me peter this description is as much like me as i am to old nick but that's of no consequence as nobody goes willingly as a conscript and therefore they will never have a doubt but that it is all right we must be off early to morrow while these good people are in bed and steal a long march upon them i consider that we are now safe as far as flushing chapter twenty four what occurred at flushing and what occurred when we got out of flushing an hour before day break we started the snow was thick on the ground but the sky was clear and without any difficulty or interruption was passed through the towns of axel and haist arrived at terneuse on the fourth day and went over to flushing in company with about a dozen more stragglers from the main body as we landed the guard asked us whether we were conscripts o'brien replied that he was and held out his paper they took his name or rather that of the person it belonged to down in a book and told him that he must apply to the etat major before three o'clock we passed on delighted with our success and then o'brien pulled out the letter which had been given to him by the woman of the cabaret who had offered to assist me to escape when o'brien passed off as a gendarme and reading the address demanded his way to the street we soon found out the house and entered conscripts said the woman of the house looking at o'brien i am billeted full already it must be a mistake where is your order read said o'brien handing her the letter she read the letter and putting it into her neckerchief desired him to follow her o'brien beckoned me to come and we went into a small room what can i do for you said the woman i will do all in my power but alas you will march from here in two or three days never mind replied o'brien we will talk the matter over by and by but at present only oblige us by letting us remain in this little room we do not wish to be seen comment donc you a conscript and not wish to be seen are you then intending to desert answer me one question you have read that letter do you intend to act up to its purport as your sister requests as i hope for mercy i will if i suffer everything she is a dear sister and would not write so earnestly if she had not strong reasons my house and everything you command are yours can i say more what is your name inquired o'brien louise eustache you might have read it on the letter are you married o yes these six years my husband is seldom at home he is a flushing pilot a hard life harder even that that of a soldier who is this lad he is my brother who if i go as a soldier intends to volunteer as a drummer pauvre enfant c'est dommage the cabaret was full of conscripts and other people so that the hostess had enough to do at night we were shown by her into a small bedroom adjoining the room we occupied you are quite alone here the conscripts are to muster to morrow i find in the place d'armes at two o'clock do you intend to go no replied o'brien they will think that i am behind it is of no consequence well replied the woman do as you please you may trust me but i am so busy without anyone to assist me that until they leave the town i can hardly find time to speak to you that will be soon enough my good hostess replied o'brien au revoir the next evening the woman came in in some alarm stating that a conscript had arrived whose name had been given in before and that the person who had given it in had not mustered at the place that the conscript had declared that his pass had been stolen from him by a person with whom he had stopped at st nicholas and that there were orders for a strict search to be made through the town as it was known that some english officers had escaped and it was supposed that one of them had obtained the pass surely you're not english inquired the woman looking earnestly at o'brien indeed but i am my dear replied o'brien and so is this lad with me and the favour which your sister requires is that you help us over the water for which service there are one hundred louis ready to be paid upon delivery of us oh mon dieu mais c'est impossible impossible replied o'brien was that the answer i gave your sister in her trouble au moins c'est difficile that's quite another concern but with your husband a pilot i should think a great part of the difficulty removed my husband i've no power over him replied the woman putting her apron up to her eyes but one hundred louis may have replied o'brien there is truth in that observed the woman after a pause but what am i to do if they come to search the house send us out of it until you can find an opportunity to send us to england i leave it all to you your sister expects it from you and she shall not be disappointed if god helps us replied the woman after a short pause but i fear you must leave this house and the town also to night how are we to leave the town i will arrange that be ready at four o'clock for the gates are shut at dusk i must go now for there is no time to be lost we are in a nice mess now o'brien observed i after the woman had quitted the room devil a bit peter i feel no anxiety whatever except at leaving such good quarters we packed up all our effects not forgetting our two blankets and waited the return of the hostess in about an hour she entered the room i have spoken to my husband's sister who lives about two miles on the road to middleburg she is in town now for it is market day and you will be safe where she hides you i told her it was by my husband's request or she would not have consented here boy put on these clothes i will assist you once more i was dressed as a girl and when my clothes were on o'brien burst out into laughter at my blue stockings and short petticoats il n'est pas mal observed the hostess as she fixed a small cap on my head and then tied a kerchief under my chin which partly hid my face o'brien put on a great coat which the woman handed to him with a wide brimmed hat now follow me she led us into the street which was thronged till we arrived at the market place when she met another women who joined her at the end of the marketplace stood a small horse and cart into which the strange woman and i mounted while o'brien by the directions of the landlady led the horse through the crowd until we arrived at the barriers when she wished us good day in a loud voice before the guard the guard took no notice of us and we passed safely through and found ourselves upon a neatly paved road as straight as an arrow and lined on each side with high trees and a ditch in about an hour we stopped near to the farm house of the woman who was in charge of us do you observe that wood said she to o'brien pointing to one about half a mile from the road i dare not take you into the house my husband is so violent against the english who captured his schuyt and made him a poor man that he would inform against you immediately but go you there make yourselves as comfortable as you can to night and to morrow i will send you what you want adieu je vous plains pauvre enfant said she looking at me as she drove off in the cart towards her own house peter said o'brien i think that her kicking us out of her house is a proof of her sincerity and therefore i say no more about it we have the brandy flask to keep up our spirits now then for the wood though by the powers i shall have no relish for any of your pic nic parties as they call them for the next twelve years but o'brien how can i get over this ditch in petticoats i could hardly leap it in my clothes you must tie your petticoats round your waist and make a good run get over as far as you can and i will drag you through the rest but you forget that we are to sleep in the wood and that it's no laughing matter to get wet through freezing so hard as it does now very true peter but as the snow lies so deep upon the ditch perhaps the ice may bear i'll try if it bears me it will not condescend to bend at your shrimp of carcass o'brien tried the ice which was firm and we both walked over and making all the haste we could arrived at the wood as the woman called it but which was not more than a clump of trees of about half an acre we cleared away the snow for about six feet round a very hollow part and then o'brien cut stakes and fixed them in the earth to which we stretched one blanket the snow being about two feet deep there was plenty of room to creep underneath the blanket we then collected all the leaves we could beating the snow off them and laid them at the bottom of the hole over the leaves we spread the other blanket and taking our bundles in we then stopped up with snow every side of the upper blanket except the hole to creep in at it was quite astonishing what a warm place this became in a short time after we had remained in it it was almost too warm although the weather outside was piercingly cold after a good meal and a dose of brandy we both fell fast asleep but not until i had taken off my woman's attire and resumed my own clothes we never slept better or more warmly than we did in this hole which we had made on the ground covered with ice and snow chapter twenty five o'brien parts company to hunt for provisions and i have other company in consequence of another hunt o'brien pathetically mourns my death and finds me alive we escape the ensuing morning we looked out anxiously for the promised assistance for we were not very rich in provisions although what we had were of a very good quality it was not until three o'clock in the afternoon that we perceived a little girl coming towards us escorted by a large mastiff when she arrived at the copse of trees where we lay concealed she cried out to the dog in dutch who immediately scoured the wood until he came to our hiding place when he crouched down at the entrance barking furiously and putting us in no small dread lest he should attack us but the little girl spoke to him again and he remained in the same position looking at us wagging his tail with his under jaw lying on the snow she soon came up and looking underneath put a basket in and nodded her head we emptied the basket o'brien took out a napoleon and offered it to her she refused it but o'brien forced it into her hand upon which she again spoke to the dog who commenced barking so furiously at us that we expected every moment he would fly upon us the girl at the same time presenting the napoleon and pointing to the dog i went forward and took the napoleon from her at which she immediately silenced the enormous brute and laughing at us hastened away by the powers that's a fine little girl said o'brien i'll back her and her dog against any man well i never had a dog set at me for giving money before but we live and learn peter and now let's see what she's brought in the basket we found half boiled eggs bread and a smoked mutton ham with a large bottle of gin what a nice little girl i hope she will often favour us with her company i've been thinking peter that we're quite as well off here as in a midshipman's berth you forget that you are a lieutenant well so i did peter and that's the truth but it's the force of habit now let's make our dinner it's a new fashioned way though of making a meal lying down but however it's economical for it must take longer to swallow the victuals the romans used to eat their meals lying down so i have read o'brien i can't say that i ever heard it mentioned in ireland but that don't prove that it was not the case so peter i'll take your word for it murder how fast it snows again i wonder what my father's thinking on just at this moment this observation of o'brien induced us to talk about our friends and relations in england and after much conversation we fell fast asleep the next morning we found the snow had fallen about eight inches and weighing down our upper blanket so much that we were obliged to go out and cut stakes to support it up from the inside while we were thus employed we heard a loud noise and shouting and perceived several men apparently armed and accompanied with dogs running straight in the direction of the wood where we were encamped we were much alarmed thinking that they were in search of us but on a sudden they turned off in another direction continuing with the same speed as before what could it be said i to o'brien i can't exactly say peter but i should think that they were hunting something and the only game that i think likely to be in such a place as this are otters i was of the same opinion we expected the little girl but she did not come and after looking out for her till dark we crawled into our hole and supped upon the remainder of our provisions the next day as may be supposed we were very anxious for her arrival but she did not appear at the time expected night again came on and we went to bed without having any sustenance except a small piece of bread that was left and some gin which was remaining in the flask peter said o'brien if she don't come again to morrow i'll try what i can do for i've no idea of our dying of hunger here like the two babes in the wood and being found covered up with dead leaves if she does not appear at three o'clock i'm off for provisions and i don't see much danger for in this dress i look as much of a boor as any man in holland we passed an uneasy night as we felt convinced either that the danger was so great that they dare not venture to assist us or that being over ruled they had betrayed us and left us to manage how we could the next morning i climbed up the only large tree in the copse and looked round especially in the direction of the farm house belonging to the woman who had pointed out to us our place of concealment but nothing was to be seen but one vast tract of flat country covered with snow and now and then a vehicle passing at a distance on the middleburg road i descended and found o'brien preparing for a start he was very melancholy and said to me peter if i am taken you must at all risks put on your girl's clothes and go to flushing to the cabaret the women there i am sure will protect you and send you back to england i only want two napoleons take all the rest you will require them if i am not back by to night set off for flushing to morrow morning o'brien waited some time longer talking with me and it then being past four o'clock he shook me by the hand and without speaking left the wood i never felt miserable during the whole time since we were first put into prison at toulon till that moment and when he was a hundred yards off i knelt down and prayed he had been absent two hours and it was quite dusk when i heard a noise at a distance it advanced every moment nearer and nearer on a sudden i heard a rustling of the bushes and hastened under the blanket which was covered with snow in hopes that they might not perceive the entrance but i was hardly there before in dashed after me an enormous wolf i cried out expecting to be torn to pieces every moment but the creature lay on his belly his mouth wide open his eyes glaring and his long tongue hanging out of his mouth and although he touched me he was so exhausted that he did not attack me the noise increased and i immediately perceived that it was the hunters in pursuit of him i had crawled in feet first the wolf ran in head foremost so that we lay head and tail i crept out as fast as i could and perceived men and dogs not two hundred yards off in full chase i hastened to the large tree and had not ascended six feet when they came up the dogs flew to the hole and in a very short time the wolf was killed the hunters being too busy to observe me i had in the meantime climbed up the trunk of the tree and hid myself as well as i could being not fifteen yards from them i heard their expressions of surprise as they lifted up the blanket and dragged out the dead wolf which they carried away with them their conversation being in dutch i could not understand it but i was certain that they made use of the word english the hunters and dogs quitted the copse and i was about to descend when one of them returned and pulling up the blankets rolled them together and walked away with them fortunately he did not perceive our bundles by the little light given by the moon i waited a short time and then came down what to do i knew not if i did not remain and o'brien returned what would he think if i did i should be dead with cold before the morning i looked for our bundles and found that in the conflict between the dogs and the wolf they had been buried among the leaves i recollected o'brien's advice and dressed myself in the girl's clothes but i could not make up my mind to go to flushing so i resolved to walk towards the farm house which being close to the road would give me a chance of meeting with o'brien i soon arrived there and prowled round it for some time but the doors and windows were all fast and i dared not knock after what the woman had said about her husband's inveteracy to the english at last as i looked round and round quite at a loss what to do i thought i saw a figure at a distance proceeding in the direction of the copse i hastened after it and saw it enter i then advanced very cautiously for although i thought it might be o'brien yet it was possible that it was one of the men who chased the wolf in search of more plunder but i soon heard o'brien's voice and i hastened towards him i was close to him without his perceiving me and found him sitting down with his face covered up in his two hands at last he cried o pater my poor pater are you taken at last could i not leave you for one hour in safety ochone why did i leave you my poor poor pater simple you were sure enough and that's why i loved you but pater i would have made a man of you for you'd all the materials that's the truth and a fine man too where am i to look for you pater where am i to find you pater you're fast locked up by this time and all my trouble's gone for nothing but i'll be locked up too pater where you are will i be and if we can't go to england together why then we'll go back to that blackguard hole at givet together ochone ochone o'brien spoke no more but burst into tears i was much affected with this proof of o'brien's sincere regard and i came to his side and clasped him in my arms o'brien stared at me who are you you ugly dutch frow for he had quite forgotten the woman's dress at the moment but recollecting himself he hugged me in his arms pater you come as near to an angel's shape as you can for you come in that of a woman to comfort me for to tell the truth i was very much distressed at not finding you here and all the blankets gone to boot what has been the matter i explained in as few words as i could well peter i'm happy to find you all safe and much happier to find that you can be trusted when i leave you for you could not have behaved more prudently now i'll tell you what i did which was not much as it happened i knew that there was no cabaret between us and flushing for i took particular notice as i came along so i took the road to middleburg and found but one which was full of soldiers i passed it and found no other as i came back past the same cabaret one of the soldiers came out to me but i walked along the road he quickened his pace and so did i mine for i expected mischief at last he came up to me and spoke to me in dutch to which i gave him no answer he collared me and then i thought it convenient to pretend that i was deaf and dumb i pointed to my mouth with an au au and then to my ears and shook my head but he would not be convinced and i heard him say something about english i then knew that there was no time to be lost so i first burst out into a loud laugh and stopped and on his attempting to force me i kicked up his heels and he fell on the ice with such a rap on the pate that i doubt if he has recovered it by this time there i left him and have run back as hard as i could without any thing for peter to fill his little hungry inside with now peter what's your opinion for they say that out of the mouth of babes there is wisdom and although i never saw anything come out of their mouths but sour milk yet perhaps i may be more fortunate this time for peter you're but a baby not a small one o'brien although not quite so large as fingal's babby that you told me the story of my idea is this let us at all hazards go to the farmhouse they have assisted us and may be inclined to do so again if they refuse we must push on to flushing and take our chance well observed o'brien after a pause i think we can do no better so let's be off we went to the farm house and as we approached the door were met by the great mastiff i started back o'brien boldly advanced he's a clever dog and may know us again i'll go up said o'brien not stopping while he spoke and pat his head if he flies at me i shall be no worse than i was before for depend upon it he will not allow us to go back again o'brien by this time had advanced to the dog who looked earnestly and angrily at him he patted his head the dog growled but o'brien put his arm round his neck and patting him again whistled to him and went to the door of the farm house the dog followed him silently but closely o'brien knocked and the door was opened by the little girl the mastiff advanced to the girl and then turned round facing o'brien as much as to say is he to come in the girl spoke to the dog and went in doors during her absence the mastiff laid down at the threshold in a few seconds the woman who had brought us from flushing came out and desired us to enter she spoke very good french and told us that fortunately her husband was absent that the reason why we had not been supplied was that a wolf had met her little girl returning the other day but had been beaten off by the mastiff and that she was afraid to allow her to go again that she heard the wolf had been killed this evening and had intended her girl to have gone to us early to morrow morning that wolves were hardly known in that country but that the severe winter had brought them down to the lowlands a very rare circumstance occurring perhaps not once in twenty years but how did you pass the mastiff said she that has surprised my daughter and me o'brien told her upon which she said that the english were really des braves' no other man had ever done the same so i thought for nothing would have induced me to do it o'brien then told the history of the death of the wolf with all particulars and our intention if we could not do better of returning to flushing i heard that pierre eustache came home yesterday said the woman and i do think that you will be safer at flushing than here for they will never think of looking for you among the casernes which join their cabaret will you lend us your assistance to get in i will see what i can do but are you not hungry about as hungry as men who have eaten nothing for two days mon dieu c'est vrai i never thought it was so long but those whose stomachs are filled forget those who are empty god make us better and more charitable she spoke to the little girl in dutch who hastened to load the table which we hastened to empty the little girl stared at our voracity but at last she laughed out and clapped her hands at every fresh mouthful which we took and pressed us to eat more she allowed me to kiss her until her mother told her that i was not a woman when she pouted at me and beat me off before midnight we were fast asleep upon the benches before the kitchen fire and at day break were roused up by the woman who offered us some bread and spirits and then we went out to the door where we found the horse and cart all ready and loaded with vegetables for the market the woman the little girl and myself got in o'brien leading as before and the mastiff following we had learnt the dog's name which was achille and he seemed to be quite fond of us we passed the dreaded barriers without interruption and in ten minutes entered the cabaret of eustache and immediately walked into the little room through a crowd of soldiers two of whom chucked me under the chin who should we find there but eustache the pilot himself in conversation with his wife and it appeared that they were talking about us she insisting and he unwilling to have any hand in the business well here they are themselves eustache the soldiers who have seen them come in will never believe that this is their first entry if you give them up i leave them to make their own bargain but mark me eustache i have slaved night and day in this cabaret for your profit if you do not oblige me and my family i no longer keep a cabaret for you madame eustache then quitted the room with her husband's sister and little girl and o'brien immediately accosted him i promise you said he to eustache one hundred louis if you put us on shore at any part of england or on board of any english man of war and if you do it within a week i will make it twenty louis more o'brien then pulled out the fifty napoleons given us by celeste for our own were not yet expended and laid them on the table here is this in advance to prove my sincerity say is it a bargain or not i never yet heard of a poor man who could withstand his wife's arguments backed with one hundred and twenty louis said eustache smiling and sweeping the money off the table i presume you have no objection to start to night that will be ten louis more in your favour replied o'brien i shall earn them replied eustache the sooner i am off the better for i could not long conceal you here the young frow with you is i suppose your companion that my wife mentioned he has begun to suffer hardships early come now sit down and talk for nothing can be done till dark o'brien narrated the adventures attending our escape at which eustache laughed heartily the more so at the mistake which his wife was under as to the obligations of the family if i did not feel inclined to assist you before i do now just for the laugh i shall have at her when i come back and if she wants any more assistance for the sake of her relations i shall remind her of this anecdote but she's a good woman and a good wife to boot only too fond of her sisters at dusk he equipped us both in sailor's jackets and trowsers and desired us to follow him boldly he passed the guard who knew him well what to sea already said one you have quarrelled with your wife at which they all laughed and we joined we gained the beach jumped into his little boat pulled off to his vessel and in a few minutes were under weigh with a strong tide and a fair wind we were soon clear of the scheldt and the next morning a cutter hove in sight we steered for her ran under her lee o'brien hailed for a boat and eustache receiving my bill for the remainder of his money wished us success we shook hands and in a few minutes found ourselves once more under the british pennant chapter twenty six adventures at home i am introduced to my grandfather he obtains employment for o'brien and myself and we join a frigate as soon as we were on the deck of the cutter the lieutenant commanding her inquired of us in a consequential manner who we were o'brien replied that we were english prisoners who had escaped oh midshipmen i presume replied the lieutenant i heard that some had contrived to get away my name sir said o'brien is lieutenant o'brien and if you'll send for a steel's list i will have the honour of pointing it out to you this young gentleman is mr peter simple midshipman and grandson to the right honourable lord viscount privilege the lieutenant who was a little snubnosed man with a pimply face then altered his manner towards us and begged we would step down into the cabin where he offered what perhaps was the greatest of all luxuries to us some english cheese and bottled porter pray said he did you see anything of one of my officers who was taken prisoner when i was sent with despatches to the mediterranean fleet may i first ask the name of your lively little craft said o'brien the snapper replied the lieutenant och murder sure enough we met him he was sent to verdun but we had the pleasure of his company en route as far as montpelier a remarkably genteel well dressed young man was he not why i can't say much about his gentility indeed i am not much of a judge as for his dress he ought to have dressed well but he never did when on board of me his father is my tailor and i took him as midshipman just to square an account between us that's exactly what i thought replied o'brien he did not say any more which i was glad of as the lieutenant might not have been pleased at what had occurred when do you expect to run into port demanded o'brien for we were rather anxious to put our feet ashore again in old england the lieutenant replied that his cruise was nearly up and he considered our arrival quite sufficient reason for him to run in directly and that he intended to put his helm up after the people had had their dinner we were much delighted with this intelligence and still more to see the intention put into execution half an hour afterwards in three days we anchored at spithead and went on shore with the lieutenant to report ourselves to the admiral oh with what joy did i first put my foot on the shingle beach at sally port and then hasten to the post office to put in a long letter which i had written to my mother we did not go to the admiral's but merely reported ourselves at the admiral's office for we had no clothes fit to appear in but we called at meredith the tailor's and he promised that by the next morning we should be fitted complete we then ordered new hats and everything we required and went to the fountain inn o'brien refused to go to the blue posts as being only a receptacle for midshipmen by eleven o'clock the next morning we were fit to appear before the admiral who received us very kindly and requested our company to dinner as i did not intend setting off for home until i had received an answer from my mother we of course accepted the invitation there was a large party of naval officers and ladies and o'brien amused them very much during dinner when the ladies left the room the admiral's wife told me to come up with them and when we arrived at the drawing room the ladies all gathered round me and i had to narrate the whole of my adventures which very much entertained and interested them the next morning i received a letter from my mother such a kind one entreating me to come home as fast as i could and bring my preserver o'brien with me i showed it to o'brien and asked him whether he would accompany me why peter my boy i have a little business of some importance to transact which is to obtain my arrears of pay and some prize money which i find due when i have settled that point i will go to town to pay my respects to the first lord of the admiralty and then i think i will go and see your father and mother for until i know how matters stand and whether i shall be able to go with spare cash in my pocket i do not wish to see my own family so write down your address here and you'll be sure i'll come if it is only to square my accounts with you for i am not a little in your debt i cashed a check sent by my father and set off in the mail that night the next evening i arrived safe home but i shall leave the reader to imagine the scene to my mother i was always dear and circumstances had rendered me of some importance to my father for i was now an only son and his prospects were very different from what they were when i left home about a week afterwards o'brien joined us having got through all his business his first act was to account with my father for his share of the expenses and he even insisted upon paying his half of the fifty napoleons given me by celeste which had been remitted to a banker at paris before o'brien's arrival with a guarded letter of thanks from my father to colonel o'brien and another from me to dear little celeste o'brien had remained with us about a week he told me that he had about one hundred and sixty pounds in his pocket and that he intended to go and see his friends as he was sure that he would be welcome even to father mcgrath i mean to stay with them about a fortnight and shall then return and apply for employment now peter will you like to be again under my protection o'brien i will never quit you or your ship if i can help it spoken like a sensible peter well then i was promised immediate employment and i will let you know as soon as the promise is performed o'brien took his leave of my family who were already very partial to him and left that afternoon for holyhead my father no longer treated me as a child indeed it would have been an injustice if he had i do not mean to say that i was a clever boy but i had seen much of the world in a short time and could act and think for myself he often talked to me about his prospects which were very different from what they were when i left him my two uncles his elder brothers had died the third was married and had two daughters if he had no son my father would succeed to the title the death of my elder brother tom had brought me next in succession my grandfather lord privilege who had taken no more notice of my father than occasionally sending him a basket of game had latterly often invited him to the house and had even requested some day or another to see his wife and family he had also made a handsome addition to my father's income which the death of my two uncles had enabled him to do against all this my uncle's wife was reported to be again in the family way i cannot say that i was pleased when my father used to speculate upon these chance so often as he did i thought not only as a man but more particularly as a clergyman he was much to blame but i did not then know so much of the world we had not heard from o'brien for two months when a letter arrived stating that he had seen his family and had bought a few acres of land which had made them all quite happy and had quitted with father mcgrath's double blessing with unlimited absolution that he had now been a month in town trying for employment but found that he could not obtain it although one promise was backed up by another a few days after this my father received a note from lord privilege requesting he would come and spend a few days with him and bring his son peter who had escaped from the french prison of course this was an invitation not to be neglected and we accepted it forthwith i must say i felt rather in awe of my grandfather he had kept the family at such a distance that i had always heard his name mentioned more with reverence than with any feeling of kindred but i was a little wiser now we arrived at eagle park a splendid estate where he resided and were received by a dozen servants in and out of livery and ushered into his presence he was in his library a large room surrounded with handsome bookcases sitting on an easy chair a more venerable placid old gentleman i never beheld his grey hairs hung down on each side of his temples and were collected in a small queue behind he rose and bowed as we were announced to my father he held out two fingers in salutation to me only one but there was an elegance in the manner in which it was done which was indescribable he waved his hand to chairs placed by the gentleman out of livery and requested we would be seated i could not at the time help thinking of mr chucks the boatswain and his remarks upon high breeding which were so true and i laughed to myself when i recollected that mr chucks had once dined with him as soon as the servants had quitted the room the distance on the part of my grand father appeared to wear off he interrogated me on several points and seemed pleased with my replies but he always called me child after a conversation of half an hour my father rose saying that his lordship must be busy and that he would go over the grounds till dinner time my grandfather rose and we took a sort of formal leave but it was not a formal leave after all it was high breeding respecting yourself and respecting others for my part i was pleased with the first interview and so i told my father after we had left the room my dear peter replied he your grandfather has one idea which absorbs most others the peerage the estate and the descent of it in the right line as long as your uncles were alive we were not thought of as not being in the line of descent nor should we now but that your uncle william has only daughters still we are not looked upon as actual but only contingent inheritors of the title were your uncle to die to morrow the difference in his behaviour would be manifested immediately that is to say instead of two fingers you would receive the whole hand and instead of one i should obtain promotion to two at this my father laughed heartily saying peter you have exactly hit the mark i cannot imagine how we ever could have been so blind as to call you the fool of the family to this i made no reply for it was difficult so to do without depreciating others or depreciating myself but i changed the subject by commenting on the beauties of the park and the splendid timber with which it was adorned yes peter replied my father with a sigh thirty five thousand a year in land money in the funds and timber worth at least forty thousand more are not to be despised but god wills everything after this remark my father appeared to be in deep thought and i did not interrupt him we stayed ten days with my grandfather during which he would often detain me for two hours after breakfast listening to my adventures and i really believe was very partial to me the day before i went away he said child you are going to morrow now tell me what you would like as i wish to give you a token of regard don't be afraid what shall it be a watch and seals or anything you most fancy my lord replied i if you wish to do me a favour it is that you will apply to the first lord of the admiralty to appoint lieutenant o'brien to a fine frigate and at the same time ask for a vacancy as midshipman for me o'brien replied his lordship i recollect it was he who accompanied you from france and appears by your account to have been a true friend i am pleased with your request my child and it shall be granted his lordship then desired me to hand him the paper and ink standish wrote by my directions sealed the letter and told me he would send me the answer the next day we quitted eagle park his lordship wishing my father good bye with two fingers and to me extending one as before but he said i am pleased with you child you may write occasionally when we were on our route home my father observed that i had made more progress with my grandfather than he had known any one to do since he could recollect his saying that you might write to him is at least ten thousand pounds to you in his will for he never deceives any one or changes his mind my reply was that i should like to see the ten thousand pounds but that i was not so sanguine a few days after our return home i received a letter and enclosure from lord privilege the contents of which were as follows my dear child i send you lord 's answer which i trust will prove satisfactory my compliments to your family yours etc privilege the enclosure was a handsome letter from the first lord stating that he had appointed o'brien to the sanglier frigate and had ordered me to be received on board as midshipman i was delighted to forward this letter to o'brien's address who in a few days sent me an answer thanking me and stating that he had received his appointment and that i need not join for a month which was quite time enough as the ship was refitting but that if my family were tired of me which was sometimes the case in the best regulated families why then i should learn some thing of my duty by coming to portsmouth he concluded by sending his kind regards to all the family and his love to my grandmother which last i certainly did not forward in my letter of thanks about a month afterwards i received a letter from o'brien stating that the ship was ready to go out of harbour and would be anchored off spithead in a few days chapter twenty seven captain and mrs to pork we go to plymouth and fall in with our old captain i immediately took leave of my family and set off for portsmouth and in two days arrived at the fountain inn where o'brien was waiting to receive me peter my boy i feel so much obliged to you that if your uncle won't go out of the world by fair means i'll pick a quarrel with him and shoot him on purpose that you may be a lord as i am determined that you shall be now come up into my room where we'll be all alone and i'll tell you all about the ship and our new captain in the first place we'll begin with the ship as the most important personage of the two she's a beauty i forget her name before she was taken but the french know how to build ships better than keep them she's now called the sanglier which means a wild pig and by the powers a pig ship she is as you will hear directly the captain's name is a very short one and wouldn't please mr chucks consisting only of two letters t and o which makes to his whole title is captain john to it would almost appear as if somebody had broken off the better half of his name and only left him the commencement of it but however it's a handy name to sign when he pays off his ship and now i'll tell you what sort of a looking craft he is he's built like a dutch schuyt great breadth of beam and very square tuck he applied to have the quarter galleries enlarged in the two last ships he commanded he weighs about eighteen stone rather more than less he is a good natured sort of a chap amazingly ungenteel not much of an officer not much of a sailor but a devilish good hand at the trencher but he's only a part of the concern he has his wife on board who is a red herring sort of a lady and very troublesome to boot what makes her still more annoying is that she has a piano on board very much out of tune on which she plays very much out of time holystoning is music compared with her playing even the captain's spaniel howls when she comes to the high notes but she affects the fine lady and always treats the officers with music when they dine in the cabin which makes them very glad to get out of it but o'brien i thought wives were not permitted on board very true but there's the worst part in the man's character he knows that he is not allowed to take his wife to sea and in consequence he never says she is his wife or presents her on shore to anybody if any of the other captains ask how mrs to is to day why' he replies pretty well i thank you' but at the same time he gives a kind of smirk as if to say she is not my wife' and although everybody knows that she is yet he prefers that they should think otherwise rather than be at the expense of keeping her on shore for you know peter that although there are regulations about wives there are none with regard to other women but does his wife know this inquired i i believe from my heart that she is a party to the whole transaction for report says that she would skin a flint if she could she's always trying for presents from the officers and in fact she commands the ship really o'brien this is not a very pleasant prospect whist wait a little now i come to the wind up this captain to is very partial to pig's mate and we have as many live pigs on board as we have pigs of ballast the first lieutenant is right mad about them at the same time he allows no pigs but his own on board that there may be no confusion the manger is full of pigs there are two cow pens between the main deck guns drawn from the dock yard and converted into pig pens the two sheep pens amidships are full of pigs and the geese and turkey coops are divided off into apartments for four sows in the family way now peter you see there's little or no expense in keeping pigs on board of a large frigate with so much pay soup and whole peas for them to eat and this is the reason why he keeps them for the devil a bit of any other stock has he on board i presume he means to milk one of the old sows for breakfast when the ship sails the first thing that he does in the morning is to go round to his pigs with the butcher feeling one scratching the dirty ears of another and then he classes them his bacon pigs his porkers his breeding sows and so on the old boar is still at the stables of this inn but i hear he is to come on board with the sailing orders but he is very savage and is therefore left on shore to the very last moment now really peter what with the squealing of the pigs and his wife's piano we are almost driven mad i don't know which is the worst of the two if you go aft you hear the one if you go forward you hear the other by way of variety and that they say is charming but is it not shocking that such a beautiful frigate should be turned into a pig sty and that her main deck should smell worse than a muck heap but how does his wife like the idea of living only upon hog's flesh she lord bless you peter why she looks as spare as a shark and she has just the appetite of one for she'll boil a four pound piece of pork before it's well put on her plate have you any more such pleasant intelligence to communicate o'brien no peter you have the worst of it the lieutenants are good officers and pleasant messmates the doctor is a little queer and the purser thinks himself a wag the master an old north countryman who knows his duty and takes his glass of grog the midshipmen are a very genteel set of young men and full of fun and frolic i'll bet a wager there'll be a bobbery in the pig sty before long for they are ripe for mischief now peter i hardly need say that my cabin and everything i have is at your service and i think if we could only have a devil of a gale of wind or a hard fought action to send the pigs over board and smash the piano we should do very well the next day i went on board and was shown down into the cabin to report my having joined mrs to a tall thin woman was at her piano she rose and asked me several questions who my friends were how much they allowed me a year and many other questions which i thought impertinent but a captain's wife is allowed to take liberties she then asked me if i was fond of music that was a difficult question as if i said that i was i should in all probability be obliged to hear it if i said that i was not i might have created a dislike in her so i replied that i was very fond of music on shore when it was not interrupted by other noises ah then i perceive you are a real amateur mr simple replied the lady captain to then came out of the after cabin half dressed well youngster so you've joined at last come and dine with us to day and as you go down to your berth desire the sentry to pass the word for the butcher i want to speak with him i bowed and retired i was met in the most friendly manner by the officers and by my own messmates who had been prepossessed in my favour by o'brien previous to my arrival in our service you always find young men of the best families on board large frigates they being considered the most eligible class of vessels i found my messmates to be gentlemen with one or two exceptions but i never met so many wild young lads together i sat down and ate some dinner with them although i was to dine in the cabin for the sea air made me hungry don't you dine in the cabin simple said the caterer yes replied i then don't eat any pork my boy now for you'll have plenty there come gentlemen fill your glasses we'll drink happiness to our new messmate and pledging him we pledge ourselves to try to promote it i'll just join you in that toast said o'brien walking into the midshipmen's berth what is it you're drinking it in some of collier's port sir boy bring a glass for mr o'brien here's your health peter and wishing you may keep out of a french prison this cruise mr montague as caterer i beg you will order another candle that i may see what's on the table and then perhaps i may find something i should like to pick a bit off here's the fag end of a leg of mutton mr o'brien and there's a piece of boiled pork then i'll just trouble you for a bit close to the knuckle peter you dine in the cabin so do i the doctor refused have you heard when we sail mr o'brien inquired one of my messmates i heard at the admiral's office that we were expected to be ordered round to plymouth and receive our orders there either for the east or west indies they thought and indeed the stores we have taken on board indicates that we are going foreign but the captain's signal is just made and probably the admiral has intelligence to communicate in about an hour afterwards the captain returned looking very red and hot he called the first lieutenant aside from the rest of the officers who were on deck to receive him and told him that we were to start for plymouth the next morning and the admiral had told him confidentially that we were to proceed to the west indies with a convoy which was then collecting he appeared to be very much alarmed at the idea of going to make a feast for the land crabs and certainly his gross habit of body rendered him very unfit for the climate this news was soon spread through the ship and there was of course no little bustle and preparation the doctor who had refused to dine in the cabin upon plea of being unwell sent up to say that he felt himself so much better that he should have great pleasure in attending the summons and he joined the first lieutenant o'brien and me as we walked in we sat down to table the covers were removed and as the midshipmen prophesied there was plenty of pork mock turtle soup made out of a pig's head a boiled leg of pork and peas pudding a roast spare rib with the crackling on sausages and potatoes and pig's pettitoes i cannot say that i disliked my dinner and i ate very heartily but a roast sucking pig came on as a second course which rather surprised me but what surprised me more was the quantity devoured by mrs to she handed her plate from the boiled pork to the roast asked for some pettitoes tried the sausages and finished with a whole plateful of sucking pig and stuffing we had an apple pie at the end but as we had already eaten apple sauce with the roast pork we did not care for it the doctor who abominated pork ate pretty well and was excessively attentive to mrs to will you not take a piece of the roast pig doctor said the captain why really captain to as we are bound by all reports to a station where we must not venture upon pork i think i will not refuse to take a piece for i am very fond of it how do you mean inquired the captain and his lady both in a breath perhaps i may be wrongly informed replied the doctor but i have heard that we were ordered to the west indies now if so every one knows that although you may eat salt pork there occasionally without danger in all tropical climates and especially the west indies two or three days' living upon this meat will immediately produce dysentery which is always fatal in that climate indeed exclaimed the captain you don't say so rejoined the lady i do indeed and have always avoided the west indies for that very reason i am so fond of pork the doctor then proceeded to give nearly one hundred instances of messmates and shipmen who had been attacked with dysentery from the eating of fresh pork in the west indies and o'brien perceiving the doctor's drift joined him telling some most astonishing accounts of the dreadful effects of pork in a hot country i think he said that when the french were blockaded previous to the surrender of martinique that having nothing but pigs to eat thirteen hundred out of seventeen hundred soldiers and officers died in the course of three weeks and the others were so reduced by disease that they were obliged to capitulate the doctor then changed the subject and talked about the yellow fever and other diseases of the climate so that by his account the west india islands were but hospitals to die in those most likely to be attacked were men in full strong health the spare men stood a better chance this conversation was carried on until it was time to leave mrs to at last quite silent and the captain gulping down his wine with a sigh when we rose from table mrs to did not ask us as usual to stay and hear a little music she was like her piano not a little out of tune by the powers doctor you did that nately said o'brien as we left the cabin o'brien said the doctor oblige me and you mr simple oblige me also by not saying a word in the ship about what i have said if it once gets wind i shall have done no good but if you both hold your tongues for a short time i think i may promise you to get rid of captain to his wife and his pigs we perceived the justice of his observation and promised secrecy the next day the ship sailed for plymouth and mrs to sent for the doctor not being very well the doctor prescribed for her and i believe on my conscience made her worse on purpose the illness of his wife and his own fears brought captain to more than usual in contact with the doctor of whom he frequently asked his candid opinion as to his own chance in a hot country captain to said the doctor i never would have given my opinion if you had not asked it for i am aware that as an officer you would never flinch from your duty to whatever quarter of the globe you may be ordered but as you have asked the question i must say with your full habit of body i think you would not stand a chance of living for more than two months at the same time sir i may be mistaken but at all events i must point out that mrs to is of a very bilious habit and i trust you will not do such an injustice to an amiable women as to permit her to accompany you thanky doctor i am much obliged to you replied the captain turning round and going down the ladder to his cabin we were then beating down the channel for although we ran through the needles with a fair wind it fell calm and shifted to the westward when we were abreast of portland the next day the captain gave an order for a very fine pig to be killed for he was out of provisions mrs to still kept her bed and he therefore directed that a part should be salted as he could have no company i was in the midshipmen's berth when some of them proposed that we should get possession of the pig and the plan they agreed upon was as follows they were to go to the pen that night and with a needle stuck in a piece of wood to prick the pig all over and then rub gunpowder into the parts wounded this was done and although the butcher was up a dozen times during the night to ascertain what made the pigs so uneasy the midshipmen passed the needle from watch to watch until the pig was well tattooed in all parts in the morning watch it was killed and when it had been scalded in the tub and the hair taken off it appeared covered with blue spots the midshipman of the morning watch who was on the main deck took care to point out to the butcher that the pork was measly to which the man unwilling assented stating at the same time that he could not imagine how it could be for a finer pig he had never put a knife into the circumstance was reported to the captain who was much astonished the doctor came in to visit mrs to and the captain requested the doctor to examine the pig and give his opinion although this was not the doctor's province yet as he had great reason for keeping intimate with the captain he immediately consented going forward he met me and i told him the secret that will do replied he it all tends to what we wish the doctor returned to the captain and said that there was no doubt but that the pig was measly which was a complaint very frequent on board ships particularly in hot climates where all pork became measly one great reason for its there proving so unwholesome the captain sent for the first lieutenant and with a deep sigh ordered him to throw the pig overboard but the first lieutenant who knew what had been done from o'brien ordered the master's mate to throw it overboard the master's mate touching his hat said ay ay sir and took it down into the berth where we cut it up salted one half and the other we finished before we arrived at plymouth which was six days from the time we left portsmouth on our arrival we found part of the convoy lying there but no orders for us and to my great delight on the following day the diomede arrived from a cruise off the western islands i obtained permission to go on board with o'brien and we once more greeted our messmates mr falcon the first lieutenant went down to captain savage to say we were on board and he requested us to come into the cabin he greeted us warmly and gave us great credit for the manner in which we had effected our escape when we left the cabin i found mr chucks the boatswain waiting outside my dear mr simple extend your flapper to me for i'm delighted to see you i long to have a long talk with you and i should like it also mr chucks but i am afraid we have not time i dine with captain savage to day and it only wants an hour of dinner time well mr simple i've been looking at your frigate and she's a beauty much larger than the diomede and she behaves quite as well replied i i think we are two hundred tons larger you've no idea of her size until you are on her decks i should like to be boatswain of her mr simple that is with captain savage for i will not part with him i had some more conversation with mr chucks but i was obliged to attend to others who interrupted us we had a very pleasant dinner with our old captain to whom we gave a history of our adventures and then we returned on board chapter twenty eight we get rid of the pigs and pianoforte the last boat on shore before sailing the first lieutenant too hasty and the consequences to me we waited three days at the expiration of which we heard that captain to was about to exchange with captain savage we could not believe such good news to be true and we could not ascertain the truth of the report as the captain had gone on shore with mrs to who recovered fast after she was out of our doctor's hands so fast indeed that a week afterwards on questioning the steward upon his return on board how mrs to was he replied o charming well again sir she has eaten a whole pig since she left the ship but the report was true captain to afraid to go to the west indies had effected an exchange with captain savage captain savage was permitted as was the custom of the service to bring his first lieutenant his boatswain and his barge's crew with him he joined a day or two before we sailed and never was there more joy on board the only people miserable were the first lieutenant and those belonging to the sanglier who were obliged to follow captain to who with his wife his pigs and her piano were all got rid of in the course of one forenoon i have already described pay day on board of a man of war but i think that the two days before sailing are even more unpleasant although generally speaking all our money being spent we are not sorry when we once are fairly out of harbour and find ourselves in blue water the men never work well on those days they are thinking of their wives and sweethearts of the pleasure they had when at liberty on shore where they might get drunk without punishment and many of them are either half drunk at the time or suffering from the effects of previous intoxication the ship is in disorder and crowded with the variety of stock and spare stores which are obliged to be taken on board in a hurry and have not yet been properly secured in their places the first lieutenant is cross the officers are grave and the poor midshipmen with all their own little comforts to attend to are harassed and drive about like posthorses mr simple inquired the first lieutenant where do you come from from the gun wharf sir with the gunner's spare blocks and breechings very well send the marines aft to clear the boat and pipe away the first cutter mr simple jump into the first cutter and go to mount wise for the officers be careful that none of your men leave the boat come be smart now i had been away the whole morning and it was then half past one and i had had no dinner but i said nothing and went into the boat as soon as i was off o'brien who stood by mr falcon said peter was thinking of his dinner poor fellow i really quite forgot it replied the first lieutenant there is so much to do he is a willing boy and he shall dine in the gun room when he comes back and so i did so i lost nothing by not expostulating and gained more of the favour of the first lieutenant who never forgot what he called zeal but the hardest trial of the whole is to the midshipman who is sent to the boat to purchase the supplies for the cabin and gun room on the day before the ship's sailing it was my misfortune to be ordered upon that service this time and that very unexpectedly i had been ordered to dress myself to take the gig on shore for the captain's orders and was walking the deck with my very best uniform and sidearms when the marine officer who was the gun room caterer came up to the first lieutenant and asked him for a boat the boat was manned and a midshipman ordered to take charge of it but when he came up the first lieutenant recollecting that he had come off two days before with only half his boat's crew would not trust him and calling out to me here mr simple i must send you in this boat mind you are careful that none of the men leave it and bring off the serjeant of marines who is on shore looking for the men who have broken their liberty although i could not but feel proud of the compliment yet i did not much like going in my very best uniform and would have run down and changed it but the marine officer and all the people were in the boat and i could not keep it waiting so down the side i went and we shoved off we had besides the boat's crew the marine officer the purser the gun room steward the captain's steward and the pursers steward so that we were pretty full it blew hard from the se and there was a sea running but as the tide was flowing into the harbour there was not much bubble we hoisted the foresail flew before the wind and tide and in quarter of an hour we were at mutton cove when the marine officer expressed his wish to land the landing place was crowded with boats and it was not without sundry exchanges of foul words and oaths and the bow men dashing the points of their boat hooks into the shore boats to make them keep clear of us that we forced our way to the beach the marine officer and all the stewards then left the boat and i had to look after the men i had not been there three minutes before the bowman said that his wife was on the wharf with his clothes from the wash and begged leave to go and fetch them i refused telling him that she could bring them to him vy now mr simple said the woman ar'n't you a nice lady's man to go for to ax me to muddle my way through all the dead dogs cabbage stalks and stinking hakes' heads with my bran new shoes and clean stockings i looked at her and sure enough she was as they say in france bien chaussee come mr simple let him out to come for his clothes and you'll see that he's back in a moment i did not like to refuse her as it was very dirty and wet and the shingle was strewed with all that she had mentioned the bow man made a spring out with his boat hook threw it back went up to his wife and commenced talking with her while i watched him if you please sir there's my young woman come down mayn't i speak to her said another of the men i turned round and refused him he expostulated and begged very hard but i was resolute however when i again turned my eyes to watch the bowman he and his wife were gone there says i to the coxswain i knew it would be so you see hickman is off only gone to take a parting glass sir replied the coxswain he'll be here directly i hope so but i'm afraid not after this i refused all the solicitations of the men to be allowed to leave the boat but i permitted them to have some beer brought down to them the gun boat steward then came back with a basket of soft tack ie loaves of bread and told me that the marine officer requested i would allow two of the men to go up with him to glencross' shop to bring down some of the stores of course i sent two of the men and told the steward if he saw hickman to bring him down to the boat by this time many of the women belonging to the ship had assembled and commenced a noisy conversation with the boat's crew one brought one article for jim another some clothes for bill some of them climbed into the boat and sat with the men others came and went bringing beer and tobacco which the men desired them to purchase the crowd the noise and confusion were so great that it was with the utmost difficulty that i could keep my eyes on all my men who one after another made an attempt to leave the boat just at that time came down the sergeant of marines with three of our men whom he had picked up roaring drunk they were tumbled into the boat and increased the difficulty as in looking after those who were riotous and would try to leave the boat by force i was not so well able to keep my eyes on those who were sober the sergeant then went up after another man and i told him also about hickman about half an hour afterwards the steward came down with the two men loaded with cabbages baskets of eggs strings of onions crockery of all descriptions paper parcels of groceries legs and shoulders of mutton which were crowded in until not only the stern sheets but all under the thwarts of the boat was also crammed full they told me that they had a few more things to bring down and that the marine officer had gone to stonehouse to see his wife so that they should be down long before him in half an hour more during which i had the greatest difficulty to manage the boat's crew they returned with a dozen geese and two ducks tied by the legs but without the two men who had given them the slip so that there were now three men gone and i knew mr falcon would be very angry for they were three of the smartest men in the ship i was now determined not to run the risk of losing more men and i ordered the boat's crew to shove off that i might lie at the wharf where they could not climb up they were very mutinous grumbled very much and would hardly obey me the fact is they had drunk a great deal and some of them were more than half tipsy however at last i was obeyed but not without being saluted with a shower of invectives from the women and the execrations of the men belonging to the wherries and shore boats which were washed against our sides by the swell the weather had become much worse and looked very threatening i waited an hour more when the sergeant of marines came down with two more men one of whom to my great joy was hickman this made me more comfortable as i was not answerable for the other two still i was in great trouble from the riotous and insolent behaviour of the boat's crew and the other men brought down by the sergeant of marines one of them fell back into a basket of eggs and smashed them all to atoms still the marine officer did not come down and it was getting late the tide being now at the ebb running out against the wind there was a very heavy sea and i had to go off to the ship with a boat deeply laden and most of the people in her in a state of intoxication the coxswain who was the only one who was sober recommended our shoving off as it would soon be dark and some accident would happen i reflected a minute and agreeing with him i ordered the oars to be got out and we shoved off the sergeant of marines and the gun room steward perched up in the bows drunken men ducks and geese lying together at the bottom of the boat the stern sheets loaded up to the gunwale and the other passengers and myself sitting how we could among the crockery and a variety of other articles with which the boat was crowded it was a scene of much confusion the half drunken boat's crew catching crabs and falling forward upon the others those who were quite drunk swearing they would pull lay on your oar sullivan you were doing more harm than good you drunken rascal i'll report you as soon as we get on board how the devil can i pull your honour when there's that fellow jones breaking the very back o' me with his oar and he never touching the water all the while you lie cried jones i'm pulling the boat by myself against the whole of the larboard oars he's rowing dry your honour only making bilave do you call this rowing dry cried another as a sea swept over the boat fore and aft wetting every body to the skin now your honour just look and see if i a'n't pulling the very arms off me cried sullivan is there water enough to cross the bridge swinburne said i to the coxswain plenty mr simple it is but quarter ebb and the sooner we are on board the better we were now past devil's point and the sea was very heavy the boat plunged in the trough so that i was afraid that we should break her back she was soon half full of water and the two after oars were laid in for the men to bale plase your honour hadn't i better cut free the legs of them ducks and geese and allow them to swim for their lives cried sullivan resting on his oar the poor birds will be drowned else in their own iliment no no pull away as hard as you can by this time the drunken men in the bottom of the boat began to be very uneasy from the quantity of water which washed about them and made several staggering attempts to get on their legs they fell down again upon the ducks and geese the major part of which were saved from being drowned by being suffocated the sea on the bridge was very heavy and although the tide swept us out we were nearly swamped soft bread was washing about the bottom of the boat the parcels of sugar pepper and salt were wet through with the salt water and a sudden jerk threw the captain's steward who was seated upon the gunwale close to the after oar right upon the whole of the crockery and eggs which added to the mass of destruction a few more seas shipped completed the job and the gun room steward was in despair that's a darling cried sullivan the politest boat in the whole fleet she makes more bows and curtsys than the finest couple in the land give way my lads and work the crater stuff out of your elbows and the first lieutenant will see us all so sober and so wet in the bargain and think we're all so dry that perhaps he'll be after giving us a raw nip when we get on board in a quarter of an hour we were nearly alongside but the men pulled so badly and the sea was so great that we missed the ship and went astern they veered out a buoy with a line which we got hold of and were hauled up by the marines and after guard the boat plunging bows under and drenching us through and through at last we got under the counter and i climbed up by the stern ladder mr falcon was on deck and very angry at the boat not coming alongside properly i thought mr simple that you knew by this time how to bring a boat alongside so i do sir i hope replied i but the boat was so full of water and the men would not give way what men has the sergeant brought on board three sir replied i shivering with the cold and unhappy at my very best uniform being spoiled are all your boat's crew with you sir no sir there are two left on shore they not a word sir up to the mast head and stay there till i call you down if it were not so late i would send you on shore and not receive you on board again without the men up sir immediately i did not venture to explain but up i went it was very cold blowing hard from the se with heavy squalls i was so wet that the wind appeared to blow through me and it was now nearly dark i reached the cross trees and when i was seated there i felt that i had done my duty and had not been fairly treated during this time the boat had been hauled up alongside to clear and a pretty clearance there was all the ducks and geese were dead the eggs and crockery all broken the grocery almost washed away in short as o'brien observed there was a very pretty general average mr falcon was still very angry who are the men missing inquired he of swinburne the coxswain as he came up by the side williams and sweetman sir two of the smartest topmen i am told it really is too provoking there is not a midshipman in the ship i can trust i must work all day and get no assistance the service is really going to the devil now with the young men who are sent on board to be brought up as officers and who are above doing their duty what made you so late swinburne waiting for the marine officer who went to stonehouse to see his wife but mr simple would not wait any longer as it was getting dark and we had so many drunken men in the boat mr simple did right i wish mr harrison would stay on shore with his wife altogether it's really trifling with the service pray mr swinburne why had not you your eyes about you if mr simple was so careless how came you to allow these men to leave the boat the men were ordered up by the marine officer to bring down your stores sir and they gave the steward the slip it was no fault of mr simple's nor of mine either we laid off at the wharf for two hours before we started or we should have lost more for what can a poor lad do when he has charge of drunken men who will not obey orders and the coxswain looked up at the mast head as much as to say why is he sent there i'll take my oath sir continued swinburne that mr simple never put his foot out of the boat from the time that he went over the side until be came on board and that no young gentleman could have done his duty more strictly mr falcon looked very angry at first at the coxswain speaking so freely but said nothing he took one or two turns on the deck and then hailing the mast head desired me to come down but i could not my limbs were so cramped with the wind blowing upon my wet clothes that i could not move he bailed again i heard him but was not able to answer one of the top men then came up and perceiving my condition hailed the deck and said he believed i was dying for i could not move and that he dared not leave for fear i should fall o'brien who had been on deck all the while jumped up the rigging and was soon at the cross trees where i was he sent the topman down into the top for a sail block and the studding sail haulyards made a whip and lowered me on deck i was immediately put into my hammock and the surgeon ordering me some hot brandy and water and plenty of blankets in a few hours i was quite restored o'brien who was at my bedside said never mind peter and don't be angry with mr falcon for he is very sorry i am not angry o'brien for mr falcon has been too kind to me not to make me forgive him for being once hasty the surgeon came to my hammock gave me some more hot drink desired me to go to sleep and i woke the next morning quite well when i came into the berth my messmates asked me how i was and many of them railed against the tyranny of mr falcon but i took his part saying that he was hasty in this instance perhaps but that generally speaking he was an excellent and very just officer some agreed with me but others did not one of them who was always in disgrace sneered at me and said peter reads the bible and knows that if you smite one cheek he must offer the other now i'll answer for it if i pull his right ear he will offer me his left so saying he lugged me by the ear upon which i knocked him down for his trouble the berth was then cleared away for a fight and in a quarter of an hour my opponent gave in but i suffered a little and had a very black eye i had hardly time to wash myself and change my shirt which was bloody when i was summoned on the quarter deck i arrived i found mr falcon walking up and down he looked very hard at me but did not ask me any questions as to the cause of my unusual appearance mr simple said he i sent for you to beg your pardon for my behaviour to you last night which was not only very hasty but very unjust i find that you were not to blame for the loss of the men i felt very sorry for him when i heard him speak so handsomely and to make his mind more easy i told him that although i certainly was not to blame for the loss of those two men still i had done wrong in permitting hickman to leave the boat and that had not the sergeant picked him up i should have come off without him and therefore i did deserve the punishment which i had received mr simple replied mr falcon i respect you and admire your feelings still i was to blame and it is my duty to apologise now go down below i would have requested the pleasure of your company to dinner but i perceive that something else has occurred which under any other circumstances i would have inquired into but at present i shall not i touched my hat and went below in the meantime o'brien had been made acquainted with the occasion of the quarrel which he did not fail to explain to mr falcon who o'brien declared was not the least bit in the world angry with me for what had occurred indeed after that mr falcon always treated me with the greatest kindness and employed me on every duty which he considered of consequence he was a sincere friend for he did not allow me to neglect my duty but at the same time treated me with consideration and confidence the marine officer came on board very angry at being left behind and talked about a court martial on me for disrespect and neglect of stores intrusted to my charge but o'brien told me not to mind him or what he said it's my opinion peter that the gentleman has eaten no small quantity of flapdoodle in his lifetime what's that o'brien replied i i never heard of it why peter rejoined he it's the stuff they feed fools on chapter twenty nine a long conversation with mr chucks the advantages of having a prayer book in your pocket we run down the trades swinburne the quarter master and his yarns the captain falls sick the next day the captain came on board with sealed orders with directions not to open them until off ushant in the afternoon we weighed and made sail it was a fine northerly wind and the bay of biscay was smooth we bore up set all the studding sails and ran along at the rate of eleven miles an hour as i could not appear on the quarter deck i was put down on the sick list captain savage who was very particular asked what was the matter with me the surgeon replied an inflamed eye the captain asked no more questions and i took care to keep out of his way i walked in the evening on the forecastle when i renewed my intimacy with mr chucks the boatswain to whom i gave a full narrative of all my adventures in france i have been ruminating mr simple said he how such a stripling as you could have gone through so much fatigue and now i know how it is it is blood mr simple all blood you are descended from good blood and there's as much difference between nobility and the lower classes as there is between a racer and a cart horse i cannot agree with you mr chucks common people are quite as brave as those who are well born you do not mean to say that you are not brave that the seamen on board this ship are not brave no no mr simple but as i observed about myself my mother was a woman who could not be trusted and there is no saying who was my father and she was a very pretty woman to boot which levels all distinctions for the moment as for the seamen god knows i should do them an injustice if i did not acknowledge that they were as brave as lions but there are two kinds of bravery mr simple the bravery of the moment and the courage of bearing up for a long while do you understand me i think i do but still do not agree with you who will bear more fatigue than our sailors yes yes mr simple that is because they are endured to it from their hard life but if the common sailors were all such little thread papers as you and had been brought up so carefully they would not have gone through all you have that's my opinion mr simple there's nothing like blood i think mr chucks you carry your ideas on that subject too far i do not mr simple and i think moreover that he who has more to lose than another will always strive more but a common man only fights for his own credit but when a man is descended from a long line of people famous in history and has a coat in arms criss crossed and stuck all over with lions and unicorns to support the dignity of why has he not to fight for the credit of all his ancestors whose names would be disgraced if he didn't behave well i agree with you mr chucks in the latter remark to a certain extent mr simple we never know the value of good descent when we have it but it's when we cannot get it that we can 'preciate it i wish i had been born a nobleman i do by heavens and mr chucks slapped his fist against the funnel so as to make it ring again well mr simple continued he after a pause it is however a great comfort to me that i have parted company with that fool mr muddle with his twenty six thousand and odd years and that old woman dispart the gunner you don't know how those two men used to fret me it was very silly but i couldn't help it now the warrant officers of this ship appear to be very respectable quiet men who know their duty and attend to it and are not too familiar which i hate and detest you went home mr simple to your friends of course when you arrived in england i did mr chucks and spent some days with my grandfather lord privilege whom you say you met at dinner well and how was the old gentleman inquired the boatswain with a sigh very well considering his age now do pray mr simple tell me all about it from the time that the servants met you at the door until you went away describe to me the house and all the rooms for i like to hear of all these things although i can never see them again to please mr chucks i entered into a full detail which he listened to very attentively until it was late and then with difficulty would he permit me to leave off and go down to my hammock the next day rather a singular circumstance occurred one of the midshipmen was mast headed by the second lieutenant for not waiting on deck until he was relieved he was down below when he was sent for and expecting to be punished from what the head master told him he thrust the first book into his jacket pocket which he could lay his hand on to amuse himself at the mast head and then ran on deck as he surmised he was immediately ordered aloft he had not been there more than five minutes when a sudden squall carried away the main topgallant mast and away he went flying over to leeward for the wind had shifted and the yards were now braced up had he gone overboard as he could not swim he would in all probability have been drowned but the book in his pocket brought him up in the jaws of the fore brace block where he hung until taken out by the main topmen now it so happened that it was a prayer book which he had laid hold of in his hurry and those who were superstitious declared it was all owing to his having taken a religious book with him i did not think so as any other book would have answered the purpose quite as well still the midshipman himself thought so and it was productive of good as he was a sad scamp and behaved much better afterwards but i had nearly forgotten to mention a circumstance which occurred on the day of our sailing which will be eventually found to have had a great influence upon my after life it was this i received a letter from my father evidently written in great vexation and annoyance informing me that my uncle whose wife i have already mentioned had two daughters and was again expected to be confined had suddenly broke up his housekeeping discharged every servant and proceeded to ireland under an assumed name no reason had been given for this unaccountable proceeding and not even my grandfather or any of the members of the family had had notice of his intention indeed it was by mere accident that his departure was discovered about a fortnight after it had taken place my father had taken a great deal of pains to find out where he was residing but although my uncle was traced to cork from that town all clue was lost but still it was supposed from inquiries that he was not very far from thence now observed my father in his letter i cannot help surmising that my brother in his anxiety to retain the advantages of a title to his own family has resolved to produce to the world a spurious child as his own by some contrivance or another his wife's health is very bad and she is not likely to have a large family should the one now expected prove a daughter there is little chance of his ever having another and i have no hesitation in declaring it my conviction that the measure has been taken with a view of defrauding you of your chance of eventually being called to the house of lords i showed this letter to o'brien who after reading it over two or three times gave his opinion that my father was right in his conjectures depend upon it peter there's foul play intended that is if foul play is rendered necessary but o'brien i cannot imagine why if my uncle has no son of his own he should prefer acknowledging a son of any other person's instead of his own nephew but i can peter your uncle is not a man likely to live very long as you know the doctor says that with his short neck his life is not worth two years' purchase now if he had a son consider that his daughters would be much better off and much more likely to get married besides there are many reasons which i won't talk about now because it's no use making you think your uncle to be a scoundrel but i'll tell you what i'll do i'll go down to my cabin directly and write to father mcgrath telling him the whole affair and desiring him to ferret him out and watch him narrowly and i'll bet you a dozen of claret that in less than a week he'll find him out and will dog him to the last he'll get hold of his irish servants and you little know the power that a priest has in our country now give the description as well as you can of your uncle's appearance also of that of his wife and the number of their family and their ages father mcgrath must have all particulars and then let him alone for doing what is needful i complied with o'brien's directions as well as i could and he wrote a very long letter to father mcgrath which was sent on shore by a careful hand i answered my father's letter and then thought no more about the matter our sealed orders were opened and proved our destination to be the west indies as we expected we touched at madeira to take in some wine for the ship's company but as we only remained one day we were not permitted to go on shore fortunate indeed would it have been if we had never gone there for the day after our captain who had dined with the consul was taken alarmingly ill from the symptoms the surgeon dreaded that he had been poisoned by something which he had eaten and which most probably had been cooked in a copper vessel not properly tinned we were all very anxious that he should recover but on the contrary he appeared to grow worse and worse every day wasting away and dying as they say by inches at last he was put in his cot and never rose from it again this melancholy circumstance added to the knowledge that we were proceeding to an unhealthy climate caused a gloom throughout the ship and although the trade wind carried us along bounding over the bright blue sea although the weather was now warm yet not too warm although the sun rose in splendour and all was beautiful and cheering the state of the captain's health was a check to all mirth every one trod the deck softly and spoke in a low voice that he might not be disturbed all were anxious to have the morning report of the surgeon and our conversation was generally upon the sickly climate the yellow fever of death and the palisades where they buried us swinburne the quarter master was in my watch and as he had been long in the west indies i used to obtain all the information from him that i could the old fellow had a secret pleasure in frightening me as much as he could really mr simple you ax so many questions he would say as i accosted him while he was at his station at the conn i wish you wouldn't ax so many questions and make yourself uncomfortable steady so' steady it is' with regard to yellow jack as we calls the yellow fever it's a devil incarnate that's sartain you're well and able to take your allowance in the morning and dead as a herring 'fore night first comes a bit of a headache you goes to the doctor who bleeds you like a pig then you go out of your senses then up comes the black vomit and then it's all over with you and you go to the land crabs who pick your bones as clean and as white as a sea elephant's tooth but there be one thing to be said in favour of yellow jack a'ter all you dies straight like a gentleman not cribbled up like a snow fish chucked out on the ice of the river st lawrence with your knees up to your nose or your toes stuck into your arm pits as does take place in some of your foreign complaints but straight quite straight and limber like a gentleman still jack is a little mischievous that's sartain in the euridiscy we had as fine a ship's company as was ever piped aloft steady starboard my man you're half a pint off your course' we dropped our anchor in port royal and we thought that there was mischief brewing for thirty eight sharks followed the ship into the harbour and played about us day and night i used to watch them during the night watch as their fins above water skimmed along leaving a trail of light behind them and the second night i said to the sentry abaft as i was looking at them smelling under the counter soldier' says i them sharks are mustering under the orders of yellow jack' and i no sooner mentioned yellow jack than the sharks gave a frisky plunge every one of them as much as to say yes so we are damn your eyes' the soldier was so frightened that he would have fallen overboard if i hadn't caught him by the scruff of the neck for he was standing on the top of the taffrail as it was he dropped his musket over the stern which the sharks dashed at from every quarter making the sea look like fire and he had it charged to his wages pound shillings i think however the fate of his musket gave him an idea of what would have happened to him if he had fallen instead of it and he never got on the taffrail again steady port mind your helm smith you can listen to my yarn all the same' well mr simple yellow jack came sure enough first the purser was called to account for all his roguery we didn't care much about the land crabs eating him who made so many poor dead men chew tobacco cheating their wives and relations or greenwich hospital as it might happen then went two of the middies just about your age mr simple they poor fellows went off in a sad hurry then went the master and so it went on till at last we had no more nor sixty men left in the ship the captain died last and then yellow jack had filled his maw and left the rest of us alone as soon as the captain died all the sharks left the ship and we never saw any more of them such were the yarns told to me and the other midshipmen during the night watches and i can assure the reader that they gave us no small alarm every day that we worked our day's work and found ourselves so much nearer to the islands did we feel as if we were so much nearer to our graves i once spoke to o'brien about it and he laughed peter says he fear kills more people than the yellow fever or any other complaint of the west indies swinburne is an old rogue and only laughing at you the devil's not half so black as he's painted nor the yellow fever half so yellow i presume we were now fast nearing the island of barbadoes the weather was beautiful the wind always fair the flying fish rose in shoals startled by the foaming seas which rolled away and roared from the bows as our swift frigate cleaved through the water the porpoises played about us in thousands the bonetas and dolphins at one time chased the flying fish and at others appeared to be delighted in keeping company with the rapid vessel everything was beautiful and we all should have been happy had it not been for the state of captain savage in the first place who daily became worse and worse and from the dread of the hell which we were about to enter through such a watery paradise mr falcon who was in command was grave and thoughtful he appeared indeed to be quite miserable at the chance which would insure his own promotion in every attention and every care that could be taken to insure quiet and afford relief to the captain he was unremitting the offence of making a noise was now with him a greater crime than drunkenness or even mutiny when within three days' sail of barbadoes it fell almost calm and the captain became much worse and now for the first time did we behold the great white shark of the atlantic there are several kinds of sharks but the most dangerous are the great white shark and the ground shark the former grows to an enormous length the latter is seldom very long not more than twelve feet but spreads to a great breadth we could not hook the sharks as they played around us for mr falcon would not permit it lest the noise of hauling them on board should disturb the captain a breeze again sprang up in two days we were close to the island and the men were desired to look out for the land chapter thirty death of captain savage his funeral specimen of true barbadian born sucking the monkey effects of a hurricane the next morning having hove to part of the night land was discovered on the bow and was reported by the mast head man at the same moment that the surgeon came up and announced the death of our noble captain although it had been expected for the last two or three days the intelligence created a heavy gloom throughout the ship the men worked in silence and spoke to one another in whispers mr falcon was deeply affected and so were we all in the course of the morning we ran into the island and unhappy as i was i never can forget the sensation of admiration which i felt on closing with needham point to enter carlisle bay the beach of such a pure dazzling white backed by the tall green cocoa nut trees waving their spreading heads to the fresh breeze the dark blue of the sky and the deeper blue of the transparent sea occasionally varied into green as we passed by the coral rocks which threw their branches out from the bottom the town opening to our view by degrees houses after houses so neat with their green jalousies dotting the landscape the fort with the colours flying troops of officers riding down a busy population of all colours relieved by the whiteness of their dress altogether the scene realised my first ideas of fairy land for i thought i had never witnessed anything so beautiful and can this be such a dreadful place as it is described thought i the sails were clewed up the anchor was dropped to the bottom and a salute from the ship was answered by the forts adding to the effect of the scene the sails were furled the boats lowered down the boatswain squared the yards from the jolly boat ahead mr falcon dressed and his boat being manned went on shore with the despatches then as soon as the work was over a new scene of delight presented itself to the sight of midshipmen who had been so long upon his majesty's allowance these were the boats which crowded round the ship loaded with baskets of bananas oranges shaddocks soursops and every other kind of tropical fruit fried flying fish eggs fowls milk and everything which could tempt a poor boy after a long sea voyage the watch being called down we all hastened into the boats and returned loaded with treasures which we soon contrived to make disappear after stowing away as much fruit as would have sufficed for a dessert to a dinner given to twenty people in england i returned on deck there was no other man of war in the bay but my attention was directed to a beautiful little vessel a schooner whose fairy form contrasted strongly with a west india trader which lay close to her all of a sudden as i was looking at her beautiful outline a yell rose from her which quite startled me and immediately afterwards her deck was covered with nearly two hundred naked figures with woolly heads chattering and grinning at each other she was a spanish slaver which had been captured and had arrived the evening before the slaves were still on board waiting the orders of the governor they had been on deck about ten minutes when three or four men with large panama straw hats on their heads and long rattans in their hands jumped upon the gunnel and in a few seconds drove them all down below i then turned round and observed a black woman who had just climbed up the side of the frigate o'brien was on deck and she walked up to him in the most consequential manner how do you do sar very happy you come back again said she to o'brien i'm very well i thank you ma'am replied o'brien and i hope to go back the same but never having put my foot into this bay before you have the advantage of me nebber here before so help me gad me tink i know you me tink i recollect your handsome face i lady rodney sar ah piccaninny buccra how you do said she turning round to me me hope to hab the honour to wash for you sar curtsying to o'brien what do you charge in this place all the same price one bit a piece what do you call a bit inquired i a bit lilly massa what you call um bit dem four sharp shins to a pictareen our deck was now enlivened by several army officers besides gentlemen residents who came off to hear the news invitations to the mess and to the houses of the gentlemen followed and as they departed mr falcon returned on board he told o'brien and the other officers that the admiral and squadron were expected in a few days and that we were to remain in carlisle bay and refit immediately but although the fright about the yellow fever had considerably subsided in our breasts the remembrance that our poor captain was lying dead in the cabin was constantly obtruding all that night the carpenters were up making his coffin for he was to be buried the next day the body is never allowed to remain many hours unburied in the tropical climates where putrefaction is so rapid the following morning the men were up at daylight washing the decks and putting the ship in order they worked willingly and yet with a silent decorum which showed what their feelings were never were the decks better cleaned never were the ropes more carefully flemished down the hammocks were stowed in their white cloths the yards carefully squared and the ropes hauled taut at eight o'clock the colours and pennant were hoisted half mast high the men were then ordered down to breakfast and to clean themselves during the time that the men were at breakfast all the officers went into the cabin to take a last farewell look at our gallant captain he appeared to have died without pain and there was a beautiful tranquillity in his face but even already a change had taken place and we perceived the necessity of his being buried so soon we saw him placed in his coffin and then quitted the cabin without speaking to each other when the coffin was nailed down it was brought up by the barge's crew to the quarter deck and laid upon the gratings amidships covered over with the union jack the men came up from below without waiting for the pipe and a solemnity appeared to pervade every motion order and quiet were universal out of respect to the deceased when the boats were ordered to be manned the men almost appeared to steal into them the barge received the coffin which was placed in the stern sheets the other boats then hauled up and received the officers marines and sailors who were to follow the procession when all was ready the barge was shoved off by the bow men the crew dropped their oars into the water without a splash and pulled the minute stroke the other boats followed and as soon as they were clear of the ship the minute guns boomed along the smooth service of the bay from the opposite side of the ship while the yards were topped to starboard and to port the ropes were slackened and hung in bights so as to give the idea of distress and neglect at the same time a dozen or more of the men who had been ready dropped over the sides of the ship in different parts and with their cans of paint and brushes in a few minutes effaced the whole of the broad white riband which marked the beautiful run of the frigate and left her all black and in deep mourning the guns from the forts now responded to our own the merchant ships lowered their colours and the men stood up respectfully with their hats off as the procession moved slowly to the landing place the coffin was borne to the burial ground by the crew of the barge followed by mr falcon as chief mourner all the officers of the ship who could be spared one hundred of the seamen walking two and two and the marines with their arms reversed the cortege was joined by the army officers while the troops lined the streets and the bands played the dead march the service was read the volleys were fired over the grave and with oppressed feelings we returned to the boats and pulled on board it then appeared to me and to a certain degree i was correct that as soon as we had paid our last respects to his remains we had also forgotten our grief the yards were again squared the ropes hauled taut working dresses resumed and all was activity and bustle the fact is that sailors and soldiers have no time for lamentation and running as they do from clime to clime so does scene follow scene in the same variety and quickness in a day or two the captain appeared to be although he was not forgotten our first business was to water the ship by rafting and towing off the casks i was in charge of the boat again with swinburne as coxswain as we pulled in there were a number of negroes bathing in the surf bobbing their woolly heads under it as it rolled into the beach now mr simple said swinburne see how i'll make them niggers scamper he then stood up in the stern sheets and pointing with his finger roared out a shark a shark for the beach puffing and blowing from their dreaded enemy nor did they stop to look for him until they were high and dry out of his reach then when we all laughed they called us all the hangman tiefs' and every other opprobrious name which they could select from their vocabulary i was very much amused with this scene and as much afterwards with the negroes who crowded round us when we landed they appeared such merry fellows always laughing chattering singing and showing their white teeth one fellow danced round us snapping his fingers and singing songs without beginning or end eh massa what you say now me no slave true barbadian born sir eh nebba see de day dat rodney run away nebba see um night dat rodney cannot fight massa me free man sar suppose you give me pictareen drink massa health nebba see de day boy pompey lickum de caesar and you nebba see de day dat de grasshopper run on de warrington

war buccra gib pictareen to me at this moment my attention was directed to another negro who lay on the beach rolling and foaming at the mouth apparently in a fit what's the matter with that fellow said i to the same negro who continued close to me notwithstanding swinburne's stick eh call him sam slack massa he ab um tic tic fit and such was apparently the case stop me cure him and he snatched the stick out of swinburne's hand and running up to the man who continued to roll on the beach commenced belabouring him without mercy eh sambo cried he at last quite out of breath you no better yet try again he recommenced until at last the man got up and ran away as fast as he could now whether the man was shamming or whether it was real tic tic or epileptic fit i know not but i never heard of such a cure for it before i threw the fellow half a pictareen as much for the amusement he had offered me as to get rid of him tanky massa now man of war man here de tick for you again to keep off all de dam niggers so saying he handed the stick to swinburne made a polite bow and departed we were however soon surrounded by others particularly some dingy ladies with baskets of fruit and who as they said sell ebery ting i perceived that my sailors were very fond of cocoa nut milk which being a harmless beverage i did not object to their purchasing from these ladies who had chiefly cocoa nuts in their baskets as i had never tasted it i asked them what it was and bought a cocoa nut i selected the largest no massa dat not good for you better one for buccra officer i then selected another but the same objection was made no massa dis very fine milk very good for de 'tomac i drank off the milk from the holes on the top of the cocoa nut and found it very refreshing as for the sailors they appeared very fond of it indeed but i very soon found that if good for de 'tomac it was not very good for the head as my men instead of rolling the casks began to roll themselves in all directions and when it was time to go off to dinner most of them were dead drunk at the bottom of the boat they insisted that it was the sun which affected them very hot it certainly was and i believed them at first when they were only giddy but i was convinced to the contrary when i found that they became insensible yet how they had procured the liquor was to me a mystery when i came on board mr falcon who although acting captain continued his duties as first lieutenant almost as punctually as before asked how it was that i had allowed my men to get so tipsy i assured him that i could not tell that i had never allowed one to leave the watering place or to buy any liquor the only thing that they had had to drink was a little cocoa nut milk which as it was so very hot i thought there could be no objection to mr falcon smiled and said mr simple i'm an old stager in the west indies and i'll let you into a secret do you know what sucking the monkey' means no sir well then i'll tell you it is a term used among seamen for drinking rum out of cocoa nuts the milk having been poured out and the liquor substituted now do you comprehend why your men are tipsy i stared with all my eyes for it never would have entered into my head and i then perceived why it was that the black woman would not give me the first cocoa nuts which i selected i told mr falcon of this circumstance who replied well it was not your fault only you must not forget it another time it was my first watch that night and swinburne was quarter master on deck swinburne said i you have often been in the indies before why did you not tell me that the men were sucking the monkey' when i thought that they were only drinking cocoa nut milk swinburne chuckled and answered why mr simple d'ye see it didn't become me as a shipmate to peach it's but seldom that a poor fellow has an opportunity of making himself a little happy' and it would not be fair to take away the chance i suppose you'll never let them have cocoa nut milk again no that i will not but i cannot imagine what pleasure they can find in getting so tipsy it's merely because they are not allowed to be so sir that's the whole story in few words i think i could cure them if i were permitted to try i should like to hear how you'd manage that mr simple why i would oblige a man to drink off a half pint of liquor and then put him by himself i would not allow him companions to make merry with so as to make a pleasure of intoxication i would then wait until next morning when he was sober and leave him alone with a racking headache until the evening when i would give him another dose and so on forcing him to get drunk until he hated the smell of liquor well mr simple it might do with some but many of our chaps would require the dose you mention to be repeated pretty often before it would effect a cure and what's more they'd be very willing patients and make no wry faces at their physic well that may be but it would cure them at last but tell me swinburne were you ever in a hurricane i've been in everything mr simple i believe except a school and i never had no time to go there did you see that battery at needham point well in the hurricane of ' them same guns were whirled away by the wind right over to this point here on the opposite side the sentries in their sentry boxes after them some of the soldiers who faced the wind had their teeth blown down their throats like broken 'baccy pipes others had their heads turned round like dog vanes 'cause they waited for orders to the right about face' and the whole air was full of young niggers blowing about like peelings of ingons you don't suppose i believe all this swinburne that's as may be mr simple but i've told the story so often that believe it myself what ship were you in in the blanche captain faulkner who was as fine a fellow as poor captain savage whom we buried yesterday there could not be a finer than either of them i was at the taking of the pique and carried him down below after he had received his mortal wound we did a pretty thing out here when we took fort royal by a coup de main which means boarding from the main yard of the frigate and dropping from it into the fort but what's that under the moon that a sail in the offing swinburne fetched the glass and directed it to the spot one two three four it's the admiral sir and the squadron hove to for the night one's a line of battle ship i'll swear i examined the vessels and agreeing with swinburne reported them to mr falcon my watch was then over and as soon as i was released i went to my hammock chapter thirty one captain kearney the dignity ball the next morning at daylight we exchanged numbers and saluted the flag and by eight o'clock they all anchored mr falcon went on board the admiral's ship with despatches and to report the death of captain savage in about half an hour he returned and we were glad to perceive with a smile upon his face from which we argued that he would receive his acting order as commander which was a question of some doubt as the admiral had the power to give the vacancy to whom he pleased although it would not have been fair if he had not given it to mr falcon not that mr falcon would not have received his commission as captain savage dying when the ship was under no admiral's command he made himself but still the admiral might have sent him home and not have given him a ship but this he did the captain of the minerve being appointed to the sanglier the captain of the opossum to the minerve and captain falcon taking the command of the opossum he received his commission that evening and the next day the exchanges were made captain falcon would have taken me with him and offered so to do but i could not leave o'brien so i preferred remaining in the sanglier we were all anxious to know what sort of a person our new captain was whose name was kearney but we had no time to ask the midshipmen except when they came in charge of the boats which brought his luggage they replied generally that he was a very good sort of fellow and there was no harm in him but when i had the night watch with swinburne he came up to me and said well mr simple so we have a new captain i sailed with him for two years in a brig and pray swinburne what sort of a person is he why i'll tell you mr simple he's a good tempered kind fellow enough but but what such a bouncer how do you mean he's not a very stout man bless you mr simple why you don't understand english i mean that he's the greatest liar that ever walked a deck now mr simple you know i can spin a yarn occasionally yes that you can witness the hurricane the other night well mr simple i cannot hold a candle to him it a'n't that i might not stretch now and again just for fun as far as he can but damn it he's always on the stretch in fact mr simple he never tells the truth except by mistake he's as poor as a rat and has nothing but his pay yet to believe him he is worth at least as much as greenwich hospital but you'll soon find him out and he'll sarve to laugh at behind his back you know mr simple for that's no go before his face captain kearney made his appearance on board the next day the men were mustered to receive him and all the officers were on the quarter deck you've a fine set of marines here captain falcon observed he those i left on board of the minerve were only fit to be hung and you have a good show of reefers too those i left in the minerve were not worth hanging if you please i'll read my commission if you'll order the men aft his commission was read all hands with their hats off from respect to the authority from which it proceeded now my lads said captain kearney addressing the ship's company i've but a few words to say to you i am appointed to command this ship and you appear to have a very good character from your late first lieutenant all i request of you is this be smart keep sober and always tell the truth that's enough pipe down gentlemen continued he addressing the officers i trust that we shall be good friends and i see no reason that it should be otherwise he then turned away with a bow and called his coxswain william you'll go on board and tell my steward that i have promised to dine with the governor to day and that he must come to dress me and coxswain recollect to put the sheepskin mat on the stern gratings of my gig not the one i used to have when i was on shore in my carriage but the blue one which was used for the chariot you know which i mean i happened to look swinburne in the face who cocked his eye at me as much as to say there he goes we afterwards met the officers of the minerve who corroborated all that swinburne had said although it was quite unnecessary as we had the captain's own words every minute to satisfy us of the fact dinner parties were now very numerous and the hospitality of the island is but too well known the invitations extended to the midshipmen and many was the good dinner and kind reception which i had during my stay there was however one thing i had heard so much of that i was anxious to witness it which was a dignity ball but i must enter a little into explanation or my readers will not understand me the coloured people of barbadoes for reasons best known to themselves are immoderately proud and look upon all the negroes who are born on other islands as niggers they have also an extraordinary idea of their own bravery although i never heard that it has ever been put to the proof the free barbadians are most of them very rich and hold up their heads as they walk with an air quite ridiculous they ape the manners of the europeans at the same time that they appear to consider them as almost their inferiors now a dignity ball is a ball given by the most consequential of their coloured people and from the amusement and various other reasons is generally well attended by the officers both on shore and afloat the price of the tickets of admission was high i think they were a joe or eight dollars each the governor sent out cards for a grand ball and supper for the ensuing week and miss betsy austin a quadroon woman ascertaining the fact sent out her cards for the same evening this was not altogether in rivalry but for another reason which was that she was aware that most of the officers and midshipmen of the ships would obtain permission to go to the governor's ball and preferring hers would slip away and join the party by which means she insured a full attendance on the day of invitation our captain came on board and told our new first lieutenant of whom i shall say more hereafter that the governor insisted that all his officers should go that he would take no denial and therefore he presumed go they must that the fact was that the governor was a relation of his wife and under some trifling obligations to him in obtaining for him his present command he certainly had spoken to the prime minister and he thought it not impossible considering the intimate terms which the minister and he had been on from childhood that his solicitation might have had some effect at all events it was pleasant to find that there was some little gratitude left in this world after this of course every officer went with the exception of the master who said that he'd as soon have two round turns in his hawse as go to see people kick their legs about like fools and that he'd take care of the ship the governor's ball was very splendid but the ladies were rather sallow from the effects of the climate however there were exceptions and on the whole it was a very gay affair but we were all anxious to go to the dignity ball of miss betsy austin i slipped away with three other midshipmen and we soon arrived there a crowd of negroes were outside of the house but the ball had not yet commenced from the want of gentlemen the ball being very correct nothing under mulatto in colour being admitted perhaps i ought to say here that the progeny of a white and a negro is a mulatto or half and half of a white and mulatto a quadroon or one quarter black and of this class the company were chiefly composed i believe a quadroon and white make the mustee or one eighth black and the mustee and white the mustafina or one sixteenth black after that they are white washed and considered as europeans the pride of colour is very great in the west indies and they have as many quarterings as a german prince in his coat of arms a quadroon looks down upon a mulatto while a mulatto looks down upon a sambo that is half mulatto half negro while a sambo in his turn looks down upon a nigger the quadroons are certainly the handsomest race of the whole some of the women are really beautiful their hair is long and perfectly straight their eyes large and black their figures perfection and you can see the colour mantle in their cheeks quite as plainly and with as much effect as in those of an european we found the door of miss austin's house open and ornamented with orange branches and on our presenting ourselves were accosted by a mulatto gentleman who was we presumed usher of the black rod his head was well powdered he was dressed in white jean trowsers a waistcoat not six inches long and a half worn post captain's coat on as a livery with a low bow he took de liberty to trouble de gentlemen for de card for de ball which being produced we were ushered on by him to the ball room at the door of which miss austin was waiting to receive her company she made us a low curtsy observing she really happy to see de gentlemen of de ship but hoped to see de officers also at her dignity this remark touched our dignity and one of my companions replied that we midshipmen considered ourselves officers and no small ones either and that if she waited for the lieutenants she must wait until they were tired of the governor's ball we having given the preference to hers this remark set all to rights sangaree was handed about and i looked around at the company i must acknowledge at the risk of losing the good opinion of my fair countrywomen that i never saw before so many pretty figures and faces the officers not having yet arrived we received all the attention and i was successively presented to miss eurydice miss minerva miss sylvia miss aspasia miss euterpe and many other evidently borrowed from the different men of war which had been on the station all these young ladies gave themselves all the airs of almack's their dresses i cannot pretend to describe jewels of value were not wanting but their drapery was slight they appeared neither to wear nor to require stays and on the whole their figures were so perfect that they could only be ill dressed by having on too much dress a few more midshipmen and some lieutenants o'brien among the number having made their appearance miss austin directed that the ball should commence i requested the honour of miss eurydice's hand in a cotillon which was to open the ball at this moment stepped forth the premier violin master of the ceremonies and ballet master massa johnson really a very smart man who gave lessons in dancing to all the 'badian ladies he was a dark quadroon his hair slightly powdered dressed in a light blue coat thrown well back to show his lily white waistcoat only one button of which he could afford to button to make full room for the pride of his heart the frill of his shirt which really was un jabot superb four inches wide and extending from his collar to the waist band of his nankeen tights which were finished off at his knees with huge bunches of riband his legs were encased in silk stockings which however was not very good taste on his part as they showed the manifest advantage which an european has over a coloured man in the formation of the leg instead of being straight his shins curved like a cheese knife and moreover his leg was planted into his foot like the handle into a broom or scrubbing brush there being quite as much of the foot on the heel side as on the toe side such was the appearance of mr apollo johnson whom the ladies considered as the ne plus ultra of fashion and the arbiter elegantiarum his bow tick or fiddle stick was his wand whose magic rap on the fiddle produced immediate obedience to his mandates ladies and gentle take your seats all started up miss eurydice you open de ball miss eurydice had but a sorry partner but she undertook to instruct me o'brien was our vis a vis with miss euterpe the other gentlemen were officers from the ships and we stood up twelve checkered brown and white like a chess board all eyes were fixed upon mr apollo johnson who first looked at the couples then at his fiddle and lastly at the other musicians to see if all was right and then with a wave of his bow tick the music began massa lieutenant cried apollo to o'brien cross over to opposite lady right hand and left den figure to miss eurydice dat right now four hand round you lily midshipman set your partner sir den twist her round dat do now stop first figure all over at this time i thought i might venture to talk a little with my partner and i ventured a remark to my surprise she answered very sharply i come here for dance sar and not for chatter look massa johnson he tap um bow tick the second figure commenced and i made a sad bungle so i did of the third and fourth and fifth for i never had danced a cotillon when i handed my partner to her place who certainly was the prettiest girl in the room she looked rather contemptuously at me and observed to a neighbour i really pity de gentleman as come from england dat no know how to dance nor nothing at all until em hab instruction at barbadoes a country dance was now called for which was more acceptable to all parties as none of mr apollo johnson's pupils were very perfect in their cotillon and none of the officers except o'brien knew anything about them o'brien's superior education on this point added to his lieutenant's epaulet and handsome person made him much courted but he took up with miss eurydice after i had left her and remained with her the whole evening thereby exciting the jealousy of mr apollo johnson who it appears was amorous in that direction our party increased every minute all the officers of the garrison and finally as soon as they could get away the governor's aides de camp all dressed in mufti ie plain clothes the dancing continued until three o'clock in the morning when it was quite a squeeze from the constant arrival of fresh recruits from all the houses in barbadoes i must say that a few bottles of eau de cologne thrown about the room would have improved the atmosphere by this time the heat was terrible and the mopping of the ladies' faces everlasting i would recommend a dignity ball to all stout gentlemen who wish to be reduced a stone or two supper was now announced and having danced the last country dance with miss minerva i of course had the pleasure of handing her into the supper room it was my fate to sit opposite to a fine turkey and i asked my partner if i should have the pleasure of helping her to a piece of the breast she looked at me very indignantly and said curse your impudence sir i wonder where you larn manners sar i take a lily turkey bosom if you please talk of breast to a lady sar really quite horrid i made two or three more barbarous mistakes before the supper was finished at last the eating was over and i must say a better supper i never sat down to silence gentlemen and ladies cried mr apollo johnson wid de permission of our amiable hostess i will purpose a toast gentlemen and ladies you all know and if be so you don't i say there no place in de world like barbadoes all de world fight again england but england nebber fear king george nebber fear while barbadoes 'tand 'tiff 'badian fight for king george to last drop of him blood nebber see the day 'badian run away you all know dem french mans at san lucee give up morne fortunee when he hear de 'badi volunteer come against him i hope no 'fence present company but um sorry to say english come here too jealous of 'badians gentlemen and lady barbadian born ab only one fault he really too brave i purpose health of island of barbadoes' acclamations from all quarters follow this truly modest speech and the toast was drunk with rapture the ladies were delighted with mr apollo's eloquence and the lead which he took in the company o'brien then rose and addressed the company as follows ladies an gentlemen mr poll has spoken better than the best parrot i ever met with in this country but as he has thought proper to drink the island of barbadoes' i mean to be a little more particular i wish with him all good health to the island but there is a charm without which the island would be a desert that is the society of the lovely girls who now surround us and take our hearts by storm here o'brien put his arm gently round miss eurydice's waist and mr apollo ground his teeth so as to be heard at the furthest end of the room therefore gentlemen with your permission i will propose the health of the 'badian ladies' this speech of o'brien's was declared by the females at least to be infinitely superior to mr apollo johnson's miss eurydice was even more gracious and the other ladies were more envious many other toasts and much more wine was drunk until the male part of the company appeared to be rather riotous mr apollo however had to regain his superiority and after some hems and hahs begged permission to give a sentiment gentlemen and ladies i beg then to say here's to de cock who make lub to de hen crow till he hoarse and make lub again the sentiment was received with rapture and after silence was obtained miss betsy austin rose and said unaccustomed as she was to public 'peaking she must not sit 'till and not tank de gentleman for his very fine toast and in de name of de ladies she begged leave to propose another sentimen which was here to de hen what nebber refuses let cock pay compliment whenebber he chooses if the first toast was received with applause this was with enthusiasm but we received a damper after it was subsided by the lady of the house getting up and saying now gentlemen and ladies me tink it right to say dat it time to go home i nebber allow people get drunk or kick up bobbery in my house so now i tink we better take parting glass and very much obliged to you for your company as o'brien said this was a broad hint to be off so we all now took our parting glass in compliance with her request and our own wishes and proceeded to escort our partners on their way home while i was assisting miss minerva to her red crape shawl a storm was brewing in another quarter to wit between mr apollo johnson and o'brien o'brien was assiduously attending to miss eurydice whispering what he called soft blarney in her ear when mr apollo who was above spirit boiling heat with jealousy came up and told miss eurydice that he would have the honour of escorting her home you may save yourself the trouble you dingy gut scraper replied o'brien the lady is under my protection so take your ugly black face out of the way or i'll show you how i treat a 'badian who is really too brave' so 'elp me gad massa lieutenant 'pose you put a finger on me i show you what 'badian can do apollo then attempted to insert himself between o'brien and his lady upon which o'brien shoved him back with great violence and continued his course towards the door they were in the passage when i came up for hearing o'brien's voice in anger i left miss minerva to shift for herself miss eurydice had now left o'brien's arm at his request and he and mr apollo were standing in the passage o'brien close to the door which was shut and apollo swaggering up to him o'brien who knew the tender part of a black saluted apollo with a kick on the shins which would have broken my leg massa johnson roared with pain and recoiled two or three paces parting the crowd away behind him the blacks never fight with fists but butt with their heads like rams and with quite as much force when mr apollo had retreated he gave his shin one more rub uttered a loud yell and started at o'brien with his head aimed at o'brien's chest like a battering ram o'brien who was aware of this plan of fighting stepped dexterously on one side and allowed mr apollo to pass by him which he did with such force that his head went clean through the panel of the door behind o'brien and there he stuck as fast as if in a pillory squealing like a pig for assistance and foaming with rage after some difficulty he was released and presented a very melancholy figure his face was much cut and his superb jabot all in tatters he appeared however to have had quite enough of it as he retreated to the supper room followed by some of his admirers without asking or looking after o'brien but if mr apollo had had enough of it his friends were too indignant to allow us to go off scot free a large mob was collected in the street vowing vengeance on us for our treatment of their flash man and a row was to be expected miss eurydice had escaped so that o'brien had his hands free cam out you hangman tiefs cam out only wish had rock stones to mash your heads with cried the mob of negroes the officers now sallied out in a body and were saluted with every variety of missile such as rotten oranges cabbage stalks mud and cocoa nut shells we fought our way manfully but as we neared the beach the mob increased to hundreds and at last we could proceed no further being completely jammed up by the niggers upon whose heads we could make no more impression than upon blocks of marble we must draw our swords observed an officer no no replied o'brien that will not do if once we shed blood they will never let us get on board with our lives the boat's crew by this time must be aware that there is a row o'brien was right he had hardly spoken before a lane was observed to be made through the crowd in the distance which in two minutes was open to us swinburne appeared in the middle of it followed by the rest of the boat's crew armed with the boat's stretchers which they did not aim at the heads of the blacks but swept them like scythes against their shins this they continued to do right and left of us as we walked through and went down to the boats the seamen closing up the rear with their stretchers with which they ever and anon made a sweep at the black fellows if they approached too near it was now broad daylight and in a few minutes we were again safely on board the frigate thus ended the first and last dignity ball that i attended chapter thirty two i am claimed by captain kearney as a relation trial of skill between first lieutenant and captain with the long bow the shark the pug dog and the will a quarter deck picture as the admiral was not one who would permit the ships under his command to lie idle in port in a very few days after the dignity hall which i have described all the squadron sailed on their various destinations i was not sorry to leave the bay for one soon becomes tired of profusion and i cared nothing for either oranges bananas or shaddocks nor even for the good dinners and claret at the tables of the army mess and gentlemen of the island the sea breeze soon became more precious to us than anything else and if we could have bathed without the fear of a shark we should have equally appreciated that most refreshing of all luxuries under the torrid zone it was therefore with pleasure that we received the information that we were to sail the next day to cruise off the french island of martinique captain kearney had been so much on shore that we saw but little of him and the ship was entirely under the control of the first lieutenant of whom i have hitherto not spoken he was a very short pock marked man with red hair and whiskers a good sailor and not a bad officer that is he was a practical sailor and could show any foremast man his duty in any department and this seamen very much appreciate as it is not very common but i never yet knew an officer who prided himself upon his practical knowledge who was at the same time a good navigator and too often by assuming the jack tar they lower the respect due to them and become coarse and vulgar in their manners and language this was the case with mr phillott who prided himself upon his slang and who was at one time hail fellow well met with the seamen talking to them and being answered as familiarly as if they were equals and at another knocking the very same men down with a handspike if he were displeased he was not bad tempered but very hasty and his language to the officers was occasionally very incorrect to the midshipmen invariably so however on the whole he was not disliked although he was certainly not respected as a first lieutenant should have been it is but fair to say that he was the same to his superiors as he was to his inferiors and the bluntness with which he used to contradict and assert his disbelief of captain kearney's narratives often produced a coolness between them for some days the day after we sailed from carlisle bay i was asked to dine in the cabin the dinner was served upon plated dishes which looked very grand but there was not much in them this plate observed the captain was presented to me by some merchants for my exertions in saving their property from the danes when i was cruising off heligoland why that lying steward of yours told me that you bought it at portsmouth replied the first lieutenant i asked him in the galley this morning how came you to assert such a confounded falsehood sir said the captain to the man who stood behind his chair i only said that i thought so replied the steward why didn't you say that the bill had been sent in through you seven or eight times and that the captain had paid it with a flowing sheet did you dare say that sir interrogated the captain very angrily mr phillott mistook me sir replied the steward he was so busy damning the sweepers that he did not hear me right i said the midshipmen had paid their crockery bill with the fore topsail ay ay replied the captain that's much more likely well mr steward replied mr phillott i'll be damned if you ar'n't as big a liar as your master he was going to plump out but fortunately the first lieutenant checked himself and added as your father was before you the captain changed the conversation by asking me whether i would take a slice of ham it's real westphalia mr simple i have them sent me direct by count troningsken an intimate friend of mine who kills his own wild boars in the hartz mountains how the devil do you get them over captain kearney there are ways and means of doing everything mr phillott and the first consul is not quite so bad as he is represented the first batch was sent over with a very handsome letter to me written in his own hand which i will show you some of these days i wrote to him in return and sent to him two cheshire cheeses by a smuggler and since that they came regularly did you ever eat westphalia ham mr simple yes sir replied i once i partook of one at lord privilege's lord privilege why he's a distant relation of mine a sort of fifth cousin replied captain kearney indeed sir replied i then you must allow me to introduce you to a relation captain kearney said the first lieutenant for mr simple is his grandson is it possible i can only say mr simple that i shall be most happy to show you every attention and am very glad that i have you as one of my officers now although this was all false for captain kearney was not in the remotest manner connected with my family yet having once asserted it he could not retract and the consequence was that i was much the gainer by his falsehood as he treated me very kindly afterwards always calling me cousin the first lieutenant smiled and gave me a wink when the captain had finished his speech to me as much as to say you're in luck and then the conversation changed captain kearney certainly dealt in the marvellous to admiration and really told his stories with such earnestness that i actually believe that he thought he was telling the truth never was there such an instance of confirmed habit telling a story of a cutting out expedition he said the french captain would have fallen by my hand but just as i levelled my musket a ball came and cut off the cock of the lock as clean as if it was done with a knife a very remarkable instance observed he not equal to what occurred in a ship i was in replied the first lieutenant when the second lieutenant was grazed by a grape shot which cut off one of his whiskers and turning round his head to ascertain what was the matter another grape shot came and took off the other now that's what i call a close shave yes replied captain kearney very close indeed if it were true but you'll excuse me mr phillott but you sometimes tell strange stories i do not mind it myself but the example is not good to my young relation here mr simple captain kearney replied the first lieutenant laughing very immoderately do you know what the pot called the kettle no sir i do not retorted the captain with offended dignity mr simple will you take a glass of wine i thought that this little brouillerie would have checked the captain it did so but only for a few minutes when he again commenced the first lieutenant observed that it would be necessary to let water into the ship every morning and pump it out to avoid the smell of the bilge water there are worse smells than bilge water replied the captain what do you think of a whole ship's company being nearly poisoned with otto of roses yet that occurred to me when in the mediterranean i was off smyrna cruising for a french ship that was to sail to france with a pacha on board as an ambassador i knew she would be a good prize and was looking sharp out when one morning we discovered her on the lee bow we made all sail but she walked away from us bearing away gradually till we were both before the wind and at night we lost sight of her as i knew that she was bound to marseilles i made all sail to fall in with her again the wind was light and variable but five days afterwards as i lay in my cot just before daylight i smelt a very strong smell blowing in at the weather port and coming down the skylight which was open and after sniffing at it two or three times i knew it to be otto of roses i sent for the officer of the watch and asked him if there were anything in sight he replied that there was not' and i ordered him to sweep the horizon with his glass and look well out to windward as the wind freshened the smell became more powerful i ordered him to get the royal yards across and all ready to make sail for i knew that the turk must be near us at daylight there he was just three miles ahead in the wind's eye but although he beat us going free he was no match for us on a wind and before noon we had possession of him and all his harem by the bye i could tell you a good story about the ladies she was a very valuable prize and among other things she had a puncheon of otto of roses on board whew cried the first lieutenant what a whole puncheon yes replied the captain a turkish puncheon not quite so large perhaps as ours on board their weights and measures are different i took out most of the valuables into the brig i commanded about sequins carpets and among the rest this cask of otto of roses which we had smelt three miles off we had it safe on board when the mate of the hold not slinging it properly it fell into the spirit room with a run and was stove to pieces never was such a scene my first lieutenant and several men on deck fainted and the men in the hold were brought up lifeless it was some time before they were recovered we let the water into the brig and pumped it out but nothing would take away the smell which was so overpowering that before i could get to malta i had forty men on the sick list when i arrived there i turned the mate out of the service for his carelessness it was not until after having smoked the brig and finding that of little use after having sunk her for three weeks that the smell was at all bearable but even then it could never be eradicated and the admiral sent the brig home and she was sold out of the service they could do nothing with her at the dock yards she was broken up and bought by the people at brighton and tunbridge wells who used her timbers for turning fancy articles which smelling as they did so strongly of otto of roses proved very profitable were you ever at brighton mr simple never sir just at this moment the officer of the watch came down to say that there was a very large shark under the counter and wished to know if the captain had any objection to the officers attempting to catch it by no means replied captain kearney i hate sharks as i do the devil i nearly lost pounds by one when i was in the mediterranean may i inquire how captain kearney said the first lieutenant with a demure face i'm very anxious to know why the story is simply this replied the captain i had an old relation at malta whom i found out by accident an old maid of sixty who had lived all her life on the island it was by mere accident that i knew of her existence i was walking upon strada reale when i saw a large baboon that was kept there who had a little fat pug dog by the tail which he was pulling away with him while an old lady was screaming out for help or whenever she ran to assist her dog the baboon made at her as if he would have ravished her and caught her by the petticoats with one hand while he had the pug dog fast by the other i owed that brute a spite for having attacked me one night when i passed him and perceiving what was going on i drew my sword and gave mr jacko such a clip as sent him away howling and bleeding like a pig leaving me in possession of the little pug which i took up and handed to his mistress the old lady trembled very much and begged me to see her safe home she had a very fine house and after she was seated on the sofa thanked me very much for my gallant assistance as she termed it and told me her name was kearney upon this i very soon proved my relationship with her at which she was much delighted requesting me to consider her house as my home i was for two years afterwards on that station and played my cards very well and the old lady gave me a hint that i should be her heir as she had no other relations that she knew anything of at last i was ordered home and not wishing to leave her i begged her to accompany me offering her my cabin she was taken very ill a fortnight before we sailed and made a will leaving me her sole heir but she recovered and got as fat as ever mr simple the wine stands with you i doubt if lord privilege gave you better claret than there is in that bottle i imported it myself ten years ago when i commanded the coquette very odd observed the first lieutenant we bought some at barbadoes with the same mark on the bottles and cork that may be replied the captain old established houses all keep up the same marks but i doubt if your wine can be compared to this you have never tasted older wine i think mr phillott i beg you pardon sir but i can prove to you that i have for when noah paid off the ark my ancestor bought his sea stock and it's been handed down to my father there may be three dozen left really mr phillott you are almost too facetious will you take some macaroni it is one of the best things we can have at sea i wish you had seen my kitchen at walcot abbey i have no doubt but it was excellent replied mr phillott but i should have preferred eating what came from it i wish that i had a knowledge of the art which a friend of mine has a new science i may say pray what may that be they call it fumography fumography never heard of it it is the art of knowing precisely by examination of the smoke which comes out of the chimney what your neighbour has for dinner upon my soul if one could send an excuse at a late hour that might be useful my friend is quite an adept he can tell first and second course entremets and even if the different articles to be put on the table are done to a turn or not now mr simple what do you think of that inquired the captain i think sir that it's all smoke bravo mr simple you've said a very good thing so i thought too but as i wasn't quite sure i would not laugh till all the rest of the company did as mr phillott wished to hear the end of the captain's story he would not contradict him about the wine by stating what he knew to be the case that the captain had sent it on board at barbadoes and the captain proceeded well i gave up my cabin to the old lady and hung up my cot in the gun room during the passage home we were becalmed abreast of ceuta for two days the old lady was very particular about her pug dog and i superintended the washing of the little brute twice a week but at last i was tired of it and gave him to my coxswain to bathe my coxswain who was a lazy fellow without my knowledge used to put the little beast into the bight of a rope and tow him overboard for a minute or so it was during this calm that he had him overboard in this way when a confounded shark rose from under the counter and took in the pug dog at one mouthful the coxswain reported the loss as a thing of no consequence but i knew better and put the fellow in irons i then went down and broke the melancholy fact to miss kearney stating that i had put the man in irons and would flog him well the old lady broke out into a most violent passion at the intelligence declared that it was my fault that i was jealous of the dog and had done it on purpose the more i protested the more she raved and at last i was obliged to go off deck to avoid her abuse and keep my temper i had not been on deck five minutes before she came up that is was shoved up for she was so heavy that she could not get up without assistance you know how elephants in india push the cannon through a morass with their heads from behind well my steward used to shove her up the companion ladder just in the same way with his head completely buried in her petticoats as soon as she was up he used to pull his head out looking as red and hot as a fresh boiled lobster well up she came with her will in her hand and looking at me very fiercely she said since the shark has taken my dear dog he may have my will also' and throwing it over board she plunged down on the carronade slide it's very well madam' said i but you'll be cool by and bye and then you'll make another will' i swear by all the hopes that i have of going to heaven that i never will' replied she yes you will madam' replied i never so help me god captain kearney my money may now go to my next heir and that you know will not be you' now as i knew very well that the old lady was very positive and as good as her word my object was to recover the will which was floating about fifty yards astern without her knowledge i thought a moment and then i called the boatswain's mate to pipe all hands to bathe you'll excuse me miss kearney' said i but the men are going to bathe and i do not think you would like to see them all naked if you would you can stay on deck' she looked daggers at me and rising from the carronade slide hobbled to the ladder saying that the insult was another proof of how little i deserved any kindness from her' as soon as she was below the quarter boats were lowered down and i went in one of them and picked up the will which still floated brigs having no stern windows of course she could not see my manoeuvre but thought that the will was lost for ever we had very bad weather after that owing to which with the loss of her favourite pug and constant quarrelling with me for i did all i could to annoy her afterwards she fell ill and was buried a fortnight after she was landed at plymouth the old lady kept her word she never made another will i proved the one i had recovered at doctor's commons and touched the whole of her money as neither the first lieutenant nor i could prove whether the story was true or not of course we expressed our congratulations at his good fortune and soon afterwards left the cabin to report the marvellous story to our messmates i went on deck i found that the shark had just been hooked and was being hauled on board mr phillott had also come on deck the officers were all eager about the shark and were looking over the side calling to each other and giving directions to the men now although certainly there was a want of decorum on the quarter deck still the captain having given permission it was to be excused but mr phillott thought otherwise and commenced in his usual style beginning with the marine officer mr westley i'll trouble you not to be getting upon the hammocks you'll get off directly sir if one of your fellows were to do so i'd stop his grog for a month and i don't see why you are to set a bad example you've been too long in barracks sir by half who is that mr williams and mr moore both on the hammocks too up to the fore topmast head both of you directly mr thomas up to the main and i say you youngster stealing off perch yourself upon the spanker boom and let me know when you've rode to london by god the service is going to hell i don't know what officers are made of now a days i'll marry some of you young gentlemen to the gunner's daughter before long quarter deck's no better than a bear garden no wonder when lieutenants set the example this latter remark could only be applied to o'brien who stood in the quarter boat giving directions before the tirade of mr phillott stopped the amusement of the party o'brien immediately stepped out of the boat and going up to mr phillott touched his hat and said mr phillott we had the captain's permission to catch the shark and a shark is not to be got on board by walking up and down on the quarter deck as regards myself as long as the captain is on board i hold myself responsible to him alone for my conduct and if you think i have done wrong forward your complaint but if you pretend to use such language to me as you have to others i shall hold you responsible i am here sir as an officer and a gentleman and will be treated as such and allow me to observe that i consider the quarter deck more disgraced by foul and ungentlemanly language than i do by an officer accidentally standing upon the hammocks however as you have thought proper to interfere you may now get the shark on board yourself mr phillott turned very red for he never had come in contact in this way with o'brien all the other officers had submitted quietly to his unpleasant manner of speaking to them very well mr o'brien i shall hold you answerable for this language replied he and shall most certainly report your conduct to the captain i will save you the trouble captain kearney is now coming up and i will report it myself this o'brien did upon the captain's putting his foot on the quarter deck well observed the captain to mr phillott what is it you complain of mr o'brien's language sir am i to be addressed on the quarter deck in that manner i really must say mr phillott replied captain kearney that i do not perceive anything in what mr o'brien said but what is correct i command here and if an officer so nearly equal in rank to yourself has committed himself you are not to take the law into your own hands the fact is mr phillott your language is not quite so correct as i could wish it i overheard every word that passed and i consider that you have treated your superior officer with disrespect that is me i gave permission that the shark should be caught and with that permission i consequently allowed those little deviations from the discipline of the service which must inevitably take place yet you have thought proper to interfere with my permission which is tantamount to an order and have made use of harsh language and punished the young gentlemen for obeying my injunctions you will oblige me sir by calling them all down and in restraining your petulance for the future i will always support your authority when you are correct but i regret that in this instance you have necessitated me to weaken it this was a most severe check to mr phillott who immediately went below after hailing the mast heads and calling down the midshipmen as soon as he was gone we were all on the hammocks again the shark was hauled forward hoisted on board and every frying pan in the ship was in requisition we were all much pleased with captain kearney's conduct on this occasion and as o'brien observed to me he really is a good fellow and clever officer what a thousand pities it is that he is such a confounded liar i must do mr phillott the justice to say that he bore no malice on this occasion but treated us as before which is saying a great deal in his favour when it is considered what power a first lieutenant has of annoying and punishing his inferiors chapter thirty three another set to between the captain and first lieutenant cutting out expedition mr chucks mistaken he dies like a gentleman swinburne begins his account of the battle of st vincent we had not been more than a week under the danish island of st thomas when we discovered a brig close in shore we made all sail in chase and soon came within a mile and a half of the shore when she anchored under a battery which opened its fire upon us their elevation was too great and several shots passed over us and between our masts i once met with a very remarkable circumstance observed captain kearney three guns were fired at a frigate i was on board of from a battery all at the same time the three shots cut away the three topsail ties and down came all our topsail yards upon the cap at the same time that the frenchmen might not suppose that they had taken such good aim we turned up our hands to reef topsails and by the time that the men were off the yards the ties were spliced and the topsails run up again mr phillott could not stand this most enormous fib and he replied very odd indeed captain kearney but i have known a stranger circumstance we had put in the powder to the four guns on the main deck when we were fighting the danish gun boats in a frigate i was in and as the men withdrew the rammer a shot from the enemy entered the muzzle and completed the loading of each gun we fired their own shot back upon them and this occurred three times running upon my word replied captain kearney who had his glass upon the battery i think you must have dreamt that circumstance mr phillott not more than you did about the topsail ties captain kearney captain kearney at that time had the long glass in his hand holding it up over his shoulder a shot from the battery whizzed over his head and took the glass out of his hand shivering it to pieces that's once said captain kearney very coolly but will you pretend that that could ever happen three times running they might take my head off or my arm next time but not another glass whereas the topsail ties might be cut by three different shot but give me another glass mr simple i am certain that this vessel is a privateer what think you mr o'brien i am every bit of your opinion captain kearney replied o'brien and i think it would be a very pretty bit of practice to the ship's company to take her out from under that footy battery starboard the helm mr phillott keep away four points and then we will think of it to night the frigate was now kept away and ran out of the fire of the battery it was then about an hour before sunset and in the west indies the sun does not set as it does in the northern latitudes there is no twilight he descends in glory surrounded with clouds of gold and rubies in their gorgeous tints and once below the horizon all is dark as soon as it was dark we hauled our wind off shore and a consultation being held between the captain mr phillott and o'brien the captain at last decided that the attempt should be made indeed although cutting out is a very serious affair as you combat under every disadvantage still the mischief done to our trade by the fast sailing privateers was so great in the west indies that almost every sacrifice was warrantable for the interests of the country still captain kearney although a brave and prudent officer one who calculated chances and who would not risk his men without he deemed that necessity imperiously demanded that such should be done was averse to this attack from his knowledge of the hay in which the brig was anchored and although mr phillott and o'brien both were of opinion that it should be a night attack captain kearney decided otherwise he considered that although the risk might be greater yet the force employed would be more consolidated and that those who would hold back in the night dare not do so during the day moreover that the people on shore in the battery as well as those in the privateer would be on the alert all night and not expecting an attack during the day would be taken off their guard it was therefore directed that everything should be in preparation during the night and that the boats should shove off before daylight and row in shore concealing themselves behind some rocks under the cliffs which formed the cape upon one side of the harbour and if not discovered remain there till noon at which time it was probable that the privateer's men would be on shore and the vessel might be captured without difficulty it is always a scene of much interest on board a man of war when preparations are made for an expedition of this description and as the reader may not have been witness to them it may perhaps be interesting to describe them the boats of men of war have generally two crews the common boats' crew which are selected so as not to take away the most useful men from the ship and the service or fighting boats' crew which are selected from the very best men on board the coxswains of the boats are the most trustworthy men in the ship and on this occasion have to see that their boats are properly equipped the launch yawl first and second cutters were the boats appointed for the expedition they all carried guns mounted upon slides which ran fore and aft between the men after the boats were hoisted out the guns were lowered down into them and shipped in the bows of the boats the arm chests were next handed in which contained the cartridges and ammunition the shut were put into the bottom of the boats and so far they were all ready the oars of the boats were fitted to pull with grummets upon iron thole pins that they might make little noise and might swing fore and aft without falling overboard when the boats pulled alongside the privateer a breaker or two that is small casks holding about seven gallons each of water was put into each boat and also the men's allowance of spirits in case they should be detained by any unforeseen circumstances the men belonging to the boats were fully employed in looking after their arms some fitting their flints to their pistols others and the major part of them sharpening their cutlasses at the grindstone or with a file borrowed from the armourer all were busy and all merry the very idea of going into action is a source of joy to an english sailor and more jokes are made more merriment excited at that time than any other then as it often happens that one or two of the service boats' crews may be on the sick list urgent solicitations are made by others that they may supply their places the only parties who appear at all grave are those who are to remain in the frigate and not share in the expedition there is no occasion to order the boats to be manned for the men are generally in long before they are piped away indeed one would think that it was a party of pleasure instead of danger and of death upon which they were about to proceed captain kearney selected the officers who were to have the charge of the boats he would not trust any of the midshipmen on so dangerous a service he said that he had known so many occasions in which their rashness and foolhardiness had spoilt an expedition he therefore appointed mr phillott the first lieutenant to the launch o'brien to the yawl the master to the first and mr chucks the boatswain to the second cutter mr chucks was much pleased with the idea of having the command of a boat and asked me to come with him to which i consented although i had intended as usual to have gone with o'brien about an hour before daylight we ran the frigate to within a mile and a half of the shore and the boats shoved off the frigate then wore round and stood out in the offing that she might at daylight be at such a distance as not to excite any suspicion that our boats were sent away while we in the boats pulled quietly in shore we were not a quarter of an hour before we arrived at the cape forming one side of the bay and were well secreted among the cluster of rocks which was underneath our oars were laid in the boats' painters made fast and orders given for the strictest silence the rocks were very high and the boats were not to be seen without any one should come to the edge of the precipice and even then they would in all probability have been supposed to have been rocks the water was as smooth as glass and when it was broad daylight the men hung listlessly over the sides of the boats looking at the corals below and watching the fish as they glided between i can't say mr simple said mr chucks to me in an undertone that i think well of this expedition and i have an idea that some of us will lose the number of our mess after a calm comes a storm and how quiet is everything now but i'll take off my great coat for the sun is hot already coxswain give me my jacket mr chucks had put on his great coat but not his jacket underneath which he had left on one of the guns on the main deck all ready to change as soon as the heavy dew had gone off the coxswain handed him the jacket and mr chucks threw off his great coat to put it on but when it was opened it proved that by mistake he had taken away the jacket surmounted by two small epaulets belonging to captain kearney which the captain's steward who had taken it out to brush had also laid upon the same gun by all the nobility of england cried mr chucks i have taken away the captain's jacket by mistake here's a pretty mess if i put on my great coat i shall be dead with sweating if i put on no jacket i shall be roasted brown but if i put on the captain's jacket i shall be considered disrespectful the men in the boats tittered and mr phillot who was in the launch next to us turned round to see what was the matter o'brien was sitting in the stern sheets of the launch with the first lieutenant and i leaned over and told them by the powers i don't see why the captain's jacket will be at all hurt by mr chucks putting it on replied o'brien unless indeed a bullet were to go through it and then it won't be any fault of mr chucks no replied the first lieutenant and if one did the captain might keep the jacket and swear that the bullet went round his body without wounding him he'll have a good yarn to spin so put it on mr chucks you'll make a good mark for the enemy that i will stand the risk of with pleasure observed the boatswain to me for the sake of being considered a gentleman so here's on with it there was a general laugh when mr chucks pulled on the captain's jacket and sank down in the stern sheets of the cutter with great complacency of countenance one of the men in the boat that we were in thought proper however to continue his laugh a little longer than mr chucks considered necessary who leaning forward thus addressed him i say mr webber i beg leave to observe to you in the most delicate manner in the world just to hint to you that it is not the custom to laugh at your superior officer i mean just to insinuate that you are a damned impudent son of a sea cook and if we both live and do well i will prove to you that if i am to be laughed at in a boat with the captain's jacket on that i am not to be laughed at on board the frigate with the boatswain's rattan in my fist and so look out my hearty for squalls when you come on the forecastle for i'll be damned if i don't make you see more stars than god almighty ever made and cut more capers than all the dancing masters in france mark my words you burgoo eating pea soup swilling trowsers scrubbing son of a bitch mr chucks having at the end of this oration raised his voice above the pitch required by the exigency of the service was called to order by the first lieutenant and again sank back into the stern sheets with all the importance and authoritative show peculiarly appertaining to a pair of epaulets we waited behind the rocks until noonday without being discovered by the enemy so well were we concealed we had already sent an officer who carefully hiding himself by lying down on the rocks had several times reconnoitred the enemy boats were passing and repassing continualhy from the privateer to the shore and it appeared that they went on shore full of men and returned with only one or two so that we were in great hopes that we should find but few men to defend the vessel mr phillott looked at his watch held it up to o'brien to prove that he had complied exactly with the orders he had received from the captain and then gave the word to get the boats under weigh the painters were cast off by the bowmen the guns were loaded and primed the men seized their oars and in two minutes we were clear of the rocks and drawn up in a line within a quarter of a mile from the harbour's mouth and not half a mile from the privateer brig we rowed as quickly as possible but we did not cheer until the enemy fired the first gun which he did from a quarter unexpected as we entered the mouth of the harbour with our union jack trailing in the water over our stern for it was a dead calm it appeared that at the low point under the cliffs at each side of the little bay they had raised a water battery of two guns each one of these guns laden with grape shot was now fired at the boats but the elevation was too low and although the water was ploughed up to within five yards of the launch no injury was received we were equally fortunate in the discharge of the other three guns two of which we passed so quickly that they were not aimed sufficiently forward so that their shot fell astern and the other although the shot fell among us did no further injury than cutting in half two of the oars of the first cutter in the meantime we had observed that the boats had shoved off from the privateer as soon as they had perceived us and had returned to her laden with men the boats had been despatched a second time but had not yet returned they were now about the same distance from the privateer as were our boats and it was quite undecided which of us would be first on board o'brien perceiving this pointed out to mr phillott that we should first attack the boats and afterwards board on the side to which they pulled as in all probability there would be an opening left in the boarding nettings which were tied up to the yard arms and presented a formidable obstacle to our success mr phillott agreed with o'brien he ordered the bowmen to lay in their oars and keep the guns pointed ready to fire at the word given and desiring the other men to pull their best every nerve every muscle was brought into play by our anxious and intrepid seamen when within about twenty yards of the vessel and also of the boats the orders were given to fire the carronade of the launch poured out round and grape so well directed that one of the french boats sank immediately and the musket balls with which our other smaller guns were loaded did great execution among their men in one minute more with three cheers from our sailors we were all alongside together english and french boats pellmell and a most determined close conflict took place the french fought desperately and as they were overpowered they were reinforced by those from the privateer who could not look on and behold their companions requiring their assistance without coming to their aid some jumped down into our boats from the chains into the midst of our men others darted cold shot at us either to kill us or to sink our boats and thus did one of the most desperate hand to hand conflicts take place that ever was witnessed but it was soon decided in our favour for we were the stronger party and the better armed and when all opposition was over we jumped into the privateer and found not a man left on board only a large dog who flew at o'brien's throat as he entered the port don't kill him said o'brien as the sailors hastened to his assistance only take away his gripe the sailors disengaged the dog and o'brien led him up to a gun saying by jasus my boy you are my prisoner but although we had possession of the privateer our difficulties as it will prove were by no means over we were now exposed not only to the fire of the two batteries at the harbour mouth which we had to pass but also to that of the battery at the bottom of the bay which had fired at the frigate in the meantime we were very busy in cutting the cable lowering the topsails and taking the wounded men on board the privateer from out of the boats all this was however but the work of a few minutes most of the frenchmen were killed our own wounded amounted to only nine seamen and mr chucks the boatswain who was shot through the body apparently with little chance of surviving as mr phillott observed the captain's epaulets had made him a mark for the enemy and he had fallen in his borrowed plumes as soon as they were all on board and laid on the deck for there were as near as i can recollect about fourteen wounded frenchmen as well as our own two ropes were got out forwards the boats were manned and we proceeded to tow the brig out of the harbour it was a dead calm and we made but little way but our boat's crew flushed with victory cheered and rallied and pulled with all their strength the enemy perceiving that the privateer was taken and the french boats drifting empty up the harbour now opened their fire upon us and with great effect before we had towed abreast of the two water batteries we had received three shots between wind and water from the other batteries and the sea was pouring fast into the vessel i had been attending to poor mr chucks who lay on the starboard side near the wheel the blood flowing from his wound and tracing its course down the planks of the deck to a distance of some feet from where he lay he appeared very faint and i tied my handkerchief round his body so as to stop the effusion of blood and brought him some water with which i bathed his face and poured some into his mouth he opened his eyes wide and looked at me ah mr simple said he faintly is it you it's all over with me but it could not be better could it how do you mean inquired i why have i not fallen dressed like an officer and a gentleman said he referring to the captain's jacket and epaulets i'd sooner die now with this dress on than to recover to put on the boatswain's uniform i feel quite happy he pressed my hand and then closed his eyes again from weakness we were now nearly abreast of the two batteries on the points the guns of which had been trained so as to bear upon our boats that were towing out the brig the first shot went through the bottom of the launch and sank her fortunately all the men were saved but as she was the boat that towed next to the brig great delay occurred in getting the others clear of her and taking the brig again in tow the shot now poured in thick and the grape became very annoying still our men gave way cheering at every shot fired and we had nearly passed the batteries with trifling loss when we perceived that the brig was so full of water that she could not swim many minutes longer and that it would be impossible to tow her alongside of the frigate mr phillott under these circumstances decided that it would be useless to risk more lives and that the wounded should be taken out of the brig and the boats should pull away from the ship he desired me to get the wounded men into the cutter which he sent alongside and then to follow the other boats i made all the haste i could not wishing to be left behind and as soon as all our wounded men were in the boats i went to mr chucks to remove him he appeared somewhat revived but would not allow us to remove him my dear mr simple said he it is of no use i can never recover it and i prefer dying here i entreat you not to move me if the enemy take possession of the brig before she sinks i shall be buried with military honours if they do not i shall at least die in the dress of a gentleman hasten away as fast as you can before you lose more men here i stay that's decided i expostulated with him but at that time two boats full of men appeared pulling out of the harbour to the brig the enemy had perceived that our boats had deserted her and were coming to take possession i had therefore no time to urge mr chucks to change his resolution and not wishing to force a dying man i shook his hand and left him it was with some difficulty i escaped for the boats had come up close to the brig they chased me a little while but the yawl and the cutter turning back to my assistance they gave up the pursuit on the whole this was a very well arranged and well conducted expedition the only man lost was mr chucks for the wounds of the others were none of them mortal captain kearney was quite satisfied with our conduct and so was the admiral when it was reported to him captain kearney did indeed grumble a little about his jacket and sent for me to inquire why i had not taken it off mr chucks and brought it on board as i did not choose to tell him the exact truth i replied that i could not disturb a dying man and that the jacket was so saturated with blood that he never could have worn it again which was the case at all events you might have brought away my epaulets replied he but you youngsters think of nothing but gormandising i had the first watch that night when swinburne the quarter master came up to me and asked me all the particulars of the affair for he was not in the boats well said he that mr chucks appeared to be a very good boatswain in his way if he could only have kept his rattan a little quiet he was a smart fellow and knew his duty we had just such another killed in our ship in the action off cape st vincent what were you in that action replied i yes i was and belonged to the captain lord nelson's ship well then suppose you tell me all about it why mr simple d'ye see i've no objection to spin you a yarn now and then replied swinburne but as mr chucks used to say allow me to observe in the most delicate manner in the world that i perceive that the man who has charge of your hammock and slings you a clean one now and then has very often a good glass of grog for his yarns and i do not see but that mine are as well worth a glass of grog as his so they are swinburne and better too and i promise you a good stiff one to morrow evening that will do sir now then i'll tell you all about it and more about it too than most can for i know how the action was brought about i hove the log marked the board and then sat down abaft on the signal chest with swinburne who commenced his narrative as follows you must know mr simple that when the english fleet came down the mediterranean after the 'vackyation of corsica they did not muster more than seventeen sail of the line while the spanish fleet from ferrol and carthagena had joined company at cadiz and mounted to near thirty sir john jervis had the command of our fleet at the time but as the dons did not seem at all inclined to come out and have a brush with us almost two to one sir john left sir w parker with six sail of the line to watch the spanish beggars while he went into lisbon with the remainder of the fleet to water and refit now you see mr simple portugal was at that time what they calls neutral that is to say she didn't meddle at all in the affair being friends with both parties and just as willing to supply fresh beef and water to the spaniards as to the english if so be the spaniards had come out to ax for it which they dar'n't the portuguese and the english have always been the best of friends because we can't get no port wine anywhere else and they can't get nobody else to buy it of them so the portuguese gave up their arsenal at lisbon for the use of the english and there we kept all our stores under the charge of that old dare devil sir isaac coffin now it so happened that one of the clerks in old sir isaac's office a portuguese chap had been some time before that in the office of the spanish ambassador he was a very smart sort of a chap and sarved as interpreter and the commissioner put great faith in him but how did you learn all this swinburne why i'll tell you mr simple i steered the yawl as coxswain and when admirals and captains talk in the stern sheets they very often forget that the coxswain is close behind them i only learnt half of it that way the rest i put together when i compared logs with the admiral's steward who of course heard a great deal now and then the first i heard of it was when old sir john called out to sir isaac after the second bottle i say sir isaac who killed the spanish messenger' not i by god' replied sir isaac i only left him for dead' and then they both laughed and so did nelson who was sitting with them well mr simple it was reported to sir isaac that his clerk was often seen taking memorandums of the different orders given to the fleet particularly those as to there being no wasteful expenditure of his majesty's stores upon which sir isaac goes to the admiral and requests that the man might be discharged now old sir john was a sly old fox and he answered not so commissioner perhaps we may catch them in their own trap' so the admiral sits down and calls for pen and ink and he flourishes out a long letter to the commissioner stating that all the stores of the fleet were expended representing as how it would be impossible to go to sea without a supply and wishing to know when the commissioner expected more transports from england he also said that if the spanish fleet were now to come out from cadiz it would be impossible for him to protect sir w parker with his six sail of the line who was watching the spanish fleet as he could not quit the port in his present condition to this letter the commissioner answered that from the last accounts he thought that in the course of six weeks or two months they might receive supplies from england but that sooner than that was impossible these letters were put in the way of the damned portuguese spy clerk who copied them and was seen that evening to go into the house of the spanish ambassador sir john then sent a message to ferro that's a small town on the portuguese coast to the southward with a despatch to sir william parker desiring him to run away to cape st vincent and decoy the spanish fleet there in case they should come out after him well mr simple so far d'ye see the train was well laid the next thing to do was to watch the spanish ambassador's house and see if he sent away any despatches two days after the letters had been taken to him by this rascal of a clerk the spanish ambassador sent away two messengers one for cadiz and the other for madrid which is the town where the king of spain lives the one to cadiz was permitted to go but the one to madrid was stopped by the directions of the admiral and this job was confided to the commissioner sir isaac who settled it some how or another and this was the reason why the admiral called out to him i say sir isaac who killed the messenger' they brought back his despatches by which they found out that advice had been sent to the spanish admiral i forget his name something like magazine informing him of the supposed crippled state of our squadron sir john taking it for granted that the spaniards would not lose an opportunity of taking six sail of the line more english ships than they had ever taken in their lives waited a few days to give them time and then sailed from lisbon for cape st vincent where he joined sir w parker and fell in with the spaniards sure enough and a pretty drubbing we gave them now it's not everybody that could tell you all that mr simple well but now for the action swinburne lord bless you mr simple it's now past seven bells and i can't fight the battle of st vincent in half an hour besides which it's well worth another glass of grog to hear all about that battle well you shall have one swinburne only don't forget to tell it to me swinburne and i then separated and in less than an hour afterwards i was dreaming of despatches sir john jervis sir isaac coffin and spanish messengers chapter thirty four o'brien's good advice captain kearney again deals in the marvellous i do not remember any circumstance in my life which at that time lay so heavily on my mind as the loss of poor mr chucks the boatswain whom of course i took it for granted i should never see again i believe that the chief cause was that at the time i entered the service and every one considered me to be the fool of the family mr chucks and o'brien were the only two who thought of and treated me differently and it was their conduct which induced me to apply myself and encouraged me to exertion i believe that many a boy who if properly patronised would turn out well is by the injudicious system of brow beating and ridicule forced into the wrong path and in his despair throws away all self confidence and allows himself to be carried away by the stream to perdition o'brien was not very partial to reading himself he played the german flute remarkably well and had a very good voice his chief amusement was practising or rather playing which is a very different thing but although he did not study himself he always made me come into his cabin for an hour or two every day and after i had read repeat to him the contents of the book by this method he not only instructed me but gained a great deal of information himself for he made so many remarks upon what i had read that it was impressed upon both our memories well peter he would say as became into the cabin what have you to tell me this morning sure it's you that's the schoolmaster and not me for i learn from you every day i have not read much o'brien to day for i have been thinking of poor mr chucks very right for you so to do peter never forget your friends in a hurry you'll not find too many of them as you trot along the highway of life i wonder whether he is dead why that's a question i cannot answer a bullet through the chest don't lengthen a man's days that's certain but this i know that he'll not die if he can help it now that he's got the captain's jacket on yes he always aspired to be a gentleman which was absurd enough in a boatswain not at all absurd peter but very absurd of you to talk without thinking when did any one of his shipmates ever know mr chucks to do an unhandsome or mean action never and why because he aspired to be a gentleman and that feeling kept him above it vanity's a confounded donkey very apt to put his head between his legs and chuck us over but pride's a fine horse who will carry us over the ground and enable us to distance our fellow travellers mr chucks had pride and that's always commendable even in a boatswain how often have you read of people rising from nothing and becoming great men this was from talent sure enough but it was talent with pride to force it onward not talent with vanity to cheek it you are very right o'brien i spoke foolishly never mind peter nobody heard you but me so it's of no consequence don't you dine in the cabin to day yes so do i the captain is in a most marvellous humour this morning he told me one or two yarns that quite staggered my politeness and my respect for him on the quarter deck what a pity it is that a man should have gained such a bad habit he's quite incurable i'm afraid replied i but certainly his fibs do no harm they are what they call white lies i do not think he would really tell a lie that is a lie which would be considered to disgrace a gentleman peter all lies disgrace a gentleman white or black although i grant there is a difference to say the least of it it is a dangerous habit for white lies are but the gentlemen ushers to black ones i know but of one point on which a lie is excusable and that is when you wish to deceive the enemy then your duty to your country warrants your lying till you're black in the face and for the very reason that it goes against your grain it becomes as if were a sort of virtue what was the difference between the marine officer and mr phillott that occurred this morning nothing at all in itself the marine officer is a bit of a gaby and takes offence where none is meant mr phillott has a foul tongue but he has a good heart what a pity it is it is a pity for he's a smart officer but the fact is peter that junior officers are too apt to copy their superiors and that makes it very important that a young gentleman should sail with a captain who is a gentleman now phillott served the best of his time with captain ballover who is notorious in the service for foul and abusive language what is the consequence that phillott and many others who have served under him have learnt his bad habit i should think o'brien that the very circumstance of having had your feelings so often wounded by such language when you were a junior officer would make you doubly careful not to make use of it to others when you had advanced in the service peter that's just the first feeling which wears away after a time but at last your own sense of indignation becomes blunted and becoming indifferent to it you forget also that you wound the feelings of others and carry the habit with you to the great injury and disgrace of the service but it's time to dress for dinner so you'd better make yourself scarce peter while i tidivate myself off a little according to the rules and regulations of his majesty's service when you are asked to dine with the skipper we met at the captain's table where we found as usual a great display of plate but very little else except the ship's allowance we certainly had now been cruising some time and there was some excuse for it but still few captains would have been so unprovided i'm afraid gentlemen you will not have a very grand dinner observed the captain as the steward removed the plated covers off the dishes but when on service we must rough it out how we can mr o'brien pea soup i recollect faring harder than this through one cruise in a flush vessel we were thirteen weeks up to our knees in water and living the whole time upon raw pork not being able to light a fire during the cruise pray captain kearney may i ask where this happened to be sure it was off bermudas we cruised for seven weeks before we could find the islands and began verily to think that the bermudas were themselves on a cruise i presume sir you were not sorry to have a fire to cook your provisions when you came to an anchor said o'brien i beg your pardon replied captain kearney we had become so accustomed to raw provisions and wet feet that we could not eat our meals cooked or help dipping our legs over the side for a long while afterwards i saw one of the boat keepers astern catch a large barracouta and eat it alive indeed if i had not given the strictest orders and flogged half a dozen of them i doubt whether they would not have eaten their victuals raw to this day the force of habit is tremendous it is indeed observed mr phillott dryly and winking to us referring to the captain's incredible stories it is indeed repeated o'brien we see the ditch in our neighbour's eye and cannot observe the log of wood in our own and o'brien winked at me referring to phillott's habit of bad language i once knew a married man observed the captain who had been always accustomed to go to sleep with his hand upon his wife's head and would not allow her to wear a night cap in consequence well she caught cold and died and he never could sleep at night until he took a clothes brush to bed with him and laid his hand upon that which answered the purpose such was the force of habit i once saw a dead body galvanised observed mr phillott it was the body of a man who had taken a great deal of snuff during his lifetime and as soon as the battery was applied to his spine the body very gently raised its arm and put its fingers to its nose as if it were taking a pinch you saw that yourself mr phillott observed the captain looking the first lieutenant earnestly in the face yes sir replied mr phillott coolly have you told that story often very often sir because i know that some people by constantly telling a story at last believe it to be true not that i refer to you mr phillott but still i should recommend you not to tell that story where you are not well known or people may doubt your credibility i make it a rule to believe everything myself observed mr phillott out of politeness and i expect the same courtesy from others then upon my soul when you tell that story you trespass very much upon our good manners talking of courtesy you might meet a friend of mine who has been a courtier all his life he cannot help bowing i have seen him bow to his horse and thank him after he had dismounted beg pardon of a puppy for treading on his tail and one day when he fell over a scraper he took off his hat and made it a thousand apologies for his inattention force of habit again said o'brien exactly so mr simple will you take a slice of this pork and perhaps you'll do me the honour to take a glass of wine lord privilege would not much admire your dinner to day would he mr simple as a variety he might sir but not for a continuance very truly said variety is charming the negroes here get so tired of salt fish and occra broth that they eat dirt by way of a relish mr o'brien how remarkably well you played that sonata of pleydel's this morning i am happy that i did not annoy you captain kearney at all events replied o'brien on the contrary i am very partial to good music my mother was a great performer i recollect once she was performing a piece on the piano in which she had to imitate a thunder storm so admirably did she hit it off that when we went to tea all the cream was turned sour as well as three casks of beer in the cellar at this assertion mr phillott could contain himself no longer he burst out into a loud laugh and having a glass of wine to his lips spattered it all over the table and over me who unfortunately was opposite to him i really beg pardon captain kearney but the idea of such an expensive talent was too amusing will you permit me to ask you a question as there could not have been thunder without lightning were any people killed at the same time by the electric fluid of the piano no sir replied captain kearney very angrily but her performance electrified us which was something like it perhaps mr phillott as you lost your last glass of wine you will allow me to take another with you with great pleasure replied the first lieutenant who perceived that he had gone far enough well gentlemen said the captain we shall soon be in the land of plenty i shall cruise a fortnight more and then join the admiral at jamaica we must make out our despatch relative to the cutting out of the sylvia that was the name of the privateer brig and i am happy to say that i shall feel it my duty to make honourable mention of all the party present steward coffee the first lieutenant o'brien and i bowed to this flattering avowal on the part of the captain as for myself i felt delighted the idea of my name being mentioned in the gazette and the pleasure that it would give to my father and mother mantled the blood in my cheeks till i was as red as a turkey cock cousin simple said the captain good naturedly you have no occasion to blush your conduct deserves it and you are indebted to mr phillott for having made me acquainted with your gallantry coffee was soon over and i was glad to leave the cabin and be alone that i might compose my perturbed mind i felt too happy i did not however say a word to my messmates as it might have created feelings of envy or ill will o'brien gave me a caution not to do so when i met him afterwards so that i was very glad that i had been so circumspect chapter thirty five swinburne continues his narrative of the battle off cape st vincent the second night after this we had the middle watch and i claimed swinburne's promise that he would spin his yarn relative to the battle of st vincent well mr simple so i will but i require a little priming or i shall never go off will you have your glass of grog before or after before by all means if you please sir run down and get it and i'll heave the log for you in the meantime when we shall have a good hour without interruption for the sea breeze will be steady and we are under easy sail i brought up a stiff glass of grog which swinburne tossed off and as he finished it sighed deeply as if in sorrow that there was no more having stowed away the tumbler in one of the cap stern holes for the present we sat down upon a coil of ropes under the weather bulwarks and swinburne replacing his quid of tobacco commenced as follows well mr simple as i told you before old jervis started with all his fleet for cape st vincent we lost one of our fleet and a three decker too the st george she took the ground and was obliged to go back to lisbon but we soon afterwards were joined by five sail of the line sent out from england so that we mustered fifteen sail in all we had like to lose another of our mess for d'ye see the old culloden and colossus fell foul of each other and the culloden had the worst on it but troubridge who commanded her was not a man to shy his work and ax to go in to refit when there was a chance of meeting the enemy so he patched her up somehow or another and reported himself ready for action the very next day ready for action he always was that's sure enough but whether his ship was in a fit state to go into action is quite another thing but as the sailors used to say in joking he was a true bridge and you might trust to him which meant as much as to say that he knew how to take his ship into action and how to fight her when he was fairly in it i think it was the next day that cockburn joined us in the minerve and he brought nelson along with him with the intelligence that the dons had chased him and that the whole spanish fleet was out in pursuit of us well mr simple you may guess we were not a little happy in the captain when nelson joined us as we knew that if we fell in with the spaniards our ship would cut a figure and so she did sure enough that was on the morning of the th and old jervis made the signal to prepare for action and keep close order which means to have your flying jib boom in at the starn windows of the ship ahead of you and we did keep close order for a man might have walked right round from one ship to the other either lee or weather line of the fleet i shan't forget that night mr simple as long as i live and breathe every now and then we heard the signal guns of the spanish fleet booming at a distance to windward of us and you may guess how our hearts leaped at the sound and how we watched with all our ears for the next gun that was fired trying to make out their bearings and distance as we assembled in little knots upon the booms and weather gangway it was my middle watch and i was signalman at the time so of course i had no time to take a caulk if i was inclined when my watch was over i could not go down to my hammock so i kept the morning watch too as did most of the men on board as for nelson he walked the deck the whole night quite in a fever at daylight it was thick and hazy weather and we could not make them out but about five bells the old culloden who if she had broke her nose had not lost the use of her eyes made the signal for a part of the spanish fleet in sight old jervis repeated the signal to prepare for action but he might have saved the wear and tear of the bunting for we were all ready bulkheads down screens up guns shotted tackles rove yards slung powder filled shot on deck and fire out and what's more mr simple i'll be damned if we wer'n't all willing too about six bells in the forenoon the fog and haze all cleared away at once just like the rising of the foresail that they lower down at the portsmouth theatre and discovered the whole of the spanish fleet i counted them all how many swinburne' cries nelson twenty six sail sir' answered i nelson walked the quarterdeck backwards and forwards rubbing his hands and laughing to himself and then he called for his glass and went to the gangway with captain miller swinburne keep a good look upon the admiral' says he ay ay sir' says i now you see mr simple twenty six sail against fifteen were great odds upon paper but we didn't think so because we know'd the difference between the two fleets there was our fifteen sail of the line all in apple pie order packed up as close as dominoes and every man on board of them longing to come to the scratch while there was their twenty six all somehow nohow two lines here and no line there with a great gap of water in the middle of them for this gap between their ships we all steered with all the sail we could carry because d'ye see mr simple by getting them on both sides of us we had the advantage of fighting both broadsides which is just as easy as fighting one and makes shorter work of it just as it struck seven bells troubridge opened the ball setting to half a dozen of the spaniards and making them reel tom collins' whether or no bang bang bang bang oh mr simple it's a beautiful sight to see the first guns fired that are to bring on a general action he's the luckiest dog that troubridge' said nelson stamping with impatience our ships were soon hard at it hammer and tongs my eyes how they did pelt it in and old sir john in the victory smashed the cabin windows of the spanish admiral with such a hell of a raking broadside that the fellow bore up as if the devil kicked him lord a mercy you might have drove a portsmouth waggon into his starn the broadside of the victory had made room enough however they were soon all smothered up in smoke and we could not make out how things were going on but we made a pretty good guess well mr simple as they say at the play that was act the first scene the first and now we had to make our appearance and i'll leave you to judge after i've told my tale whether the old captain wasn't principal performer and top sawyer over them all but stop a moment i'll just look at the binnacle for that young topman's nodding at the wheel i say mr smith are you shutting your eyes to keep them warm and letting the ship run half a point out of her course take care i don't send for another helmsman that's all and give the reason why you'll make a wry face upon six water grog to morrow at seven bells damn your eyes keep them open can't you swinburne after this genteel admonition to the man at the wheel reseated himself and continued his narrative all this while mr simple we in the captain had not fired a gun but were ranging up as fast as we could to where the enemy lay in a heap there were plenty to pick and choose from and nelson looked out sharp for a big one as little boys do when they have to choose an apple and by the piper that played before moses it was a big one that he ordered the master to put him alongside of she was a four decker called the santissima trinidad we had to pass some whoppers which would have satisfied any reasonable man for there was the san josef and salvador del mondo and san nicolas but nothing would suit nelson but this four decked ship so we crossed the hawse of about six of them and as soon as we were abreast of her and at the word fire' every gun went off at once slap into her and the old captain reeled at the discharge as if she was drunk i wish you'd only seen how we pitched it into this holy trinity she was holy enough before we had done with her riddled like a sieve several of her ports knocked into one and every scupper of her running blood and water not but what she stood to it as bold as brass and gave us nearly gun for gun and made a very pretty general average in our ship's company many of the old captains went to kingdom come in that business and many more were obliged to bear up for greenwich hospital fire away my lads steady aim' cries nelson jump down there mr thomas pass the word to reduce the cartridges the shot go clean through her double shot the guns there fore and aft' so we were at it for about half an hour when our guns became so hot from quick firing that they bounced up to the beams overhead tearing away their ringbolts and snapping the breechings like rope yarns by this time we were almost as much unrigged as if we had been two days paying off in portsmouth harbour the four decker forged ahead and troubridge in the jolly old culloden came between us and two other spanish ships who were playing into us she was as fresh as a daisy and gave them a dose which quite astonished them they shook their ears and fell astern when the blenheim laid hold of them and mauled them so that they went astern again but it was out of the frying pan into the fire for the orion prince george and one or two others were coming up and knocked the very guts out of them i'll be damned if they forgot the th of april and sarve them right too wasn't a four decker enough for any two decker without any more coming on us and couldn't the beggars have matched themselves like gentlemen well mr simple this gave us a minute or two to fetch our breath let the guns cool and repair damages and swab the blood from the decks but we lost our four decker for we could not get near her again what odd names the spaniards give to their ships swinburne why yes they do it would almost appear wicked to belabour the holy trinity as we did but why they should call a four decked ship the holy trinity i can't tell bill saunders said that the fourth deck was for the pope who was as great a parsonage as the others but i can't understand how that can be well mr simple as i was head signalman i was perched on the poop and didn't serve at a gun i had to report all i could see which was not much the smoke was so thick but now and then i could get a peep as it were through the holes in the blanket of course i was obliged to keep my eye as much as possible upon the admiral not to make out his signals for commodore nelson wouldn't thank me for that i knew he hated a signal when in action so i never took no notice of the bunting but just watched to see what he was about so while we are repairing damages i'll just tell you what i saw of the rest of the fleet as soon as old jervis had done for the spanish admiral he hauled his wind on the larboard tack and followed by four or five other ships weathered the spanish line and joined collingwood in the excellent then they all dashed through the line the excellent was the leading ship and she first took the shine out of the salvador del mondo and then left her to be picked up by the other ships while she attacked a two decker who hauled down her colours i forget her name just now as soon as the victory ran alongside of the salvador del mondo down went her colours and excellent reasons had she for striking her flag and now mr simple the old captain comes into play again having parted company with the four decker we had recommenced action with the san nicolas a spanish eighty and while we were hard at it old collingwood comes up in the excellent the san nicolas knowing that the excellent's broadside would send her to old nick put her helm up to avoid being raked in so doing she fell foul of the san josef a spanish three decker and we being all cut to pieces and unmanageable all of us indeed reeling about like drunken men nelson ordered his helm a star board and in a jiffy there we were all three hugging each other running in one another's guns smashing our chain plates and poking our yard arms through each other's canvas all hands to board' roared nelson leaping on the hammocks and waving his sword hurrah hurrah' echoed through the decks and up flew the men like as men angry bees out of a bee hive in a moment pikes tomahawks cutlasses and pistols were seized for it was quite unexpected mr simple and our men poured into the eighty gun ship and in two minutes the decks were cleared and all the dons pitched below i joined the boarders and was on the main deck when captain miller came down and cried out on deck again immediately' up we went and what do you think it was for mr simple why to board a second time for nelson having taken the two decker swore that he'd have the three decker as well so away we went again clambering up her lofty sides how we could and dropping down on her decks like hailstones we all made for the quarter deck beat down every spanish beggar that showed fight and in five minutes more we had hauled down the colours of two of the finest ships in the spanish navy if that wasn't taking the shine out of the dons i should like to know what is and didn't the old captains cheer and shake hands as commodore nelson stood on the deck of the san josef and received the swords of the spanish officers there was enough of them to go right round the capstern and plenty to spare now mr simple what do you think of that for a spree why swinburne i can only say that i wish i had been there so did every man in the fleet mr simple i can tell you but what became of the santissima trinidad upon my word she behaved one deck better than all the others she held out against four of our ships for a long while and then hauled down her colours and no disgrace to her considering what a precious hammering she had taken first but the lee division of the spanish weather fleet if i may so call it consisting of eleven sail of the line came up to her assistance and surrounded her so that they got her off our ships were too much cut up to commence a new action and the admiral made the signal to secure the prizes the spanish fleet then did what they should have done before got into line and we lost no time in doing the same but we both had had fighting enough but do you think swinburne that the spaniards fought well they'd have fought better if they'd only have known how there's no want of courage in the dons mr simple but they did not support each other only observe how troubridge supported us by god mr simple he was the real fellow and nelson knew it well he was nelson's right hand man but you know there wasn't room for two nelsons their ships engaged held out well it must be acknowledged but why wer'n't they all in their proper berths had they kept close order of sailing and had all fought as well as those who were captured it would not have been a very easy matter for fifteen ships to gain a victory over twenty six that's long odds even when backed by british seamen well how did you separate why the next morning the spaniards had the weather gauge so they had the option whether to fight or not at one time they had half a mind for they bore down to us upon which we hauled our wind to show them we were all ready to meet them and then they thought better of it and rounded to again so as they wouldn't fight and we didn't wish it we parted company in the night and two days afterwards we anchored with our four prizes in lagos bay so now you have the whole of it mr simple and i've talked till i'm quite hoarse you havn't by chance another drop of the stuff left to clear my throat it would be quite a charity i think i have swinburne and as you deserve it i will go and fetch it chapter thirty six a letter from father mcgrath who diplomatises when priest meets priest then comes the tug of war father o'toole not to be made a tool of we continued our cruise for a fortnight and then made sail for jamaica where we found the admiral at anchor at port royal but our signal was made to keep under weigh and captain kearney having paid his respects to the admiral received orders to carry despatches to halifax water and provisions were sent on board by the boats of the admiral's ships and to our great disappointment as the evening closed in we were again standing out to sea instead of as we had anticipated enjoying ourselves on shore but the fact was that orders had arrived from england to send a frigate immediately up to the admiral at halifax to be at his disposal i had however the satisfaction to know that captain kearney had been true to his word in making mention of my name in the despatch for the clerk showed me a copy of it nothing occurred worth mentioning during our passage except that captain kearney was very unwell nearly the whole of the time and seldom quitted his cabin it was in october that we anchored in halifax harbour and the admiralty expecting our arrival there had forwarded our letters there were none for me but there was one for o'brien from father mcgrath the contents of which were as follows my dear son and a good son you are and that's the truth on it or devil a bit should you be a son of mine you've made your family quite contented and peaceable and they never fight for the praties now good reason why they shouldn't seeing that there's a plenty for all of them and the pig craturs into the bargain your father and your mother and your brother and your three sisters send their duty to you and their blessings too and you may add my blessing terence which is worth them all for won't i get you out of purgatory in the twinkling of a bed post make yourself quite asy on that score and lave it all to me only just say a pater now and then that when st peter lets you in he mayn't throw it in your teeth that you've saved your soul by contract which is the only way by which emperors and kings ever get to heaven your letter from plymouth came safe to hand barney the post boy having dropped it under foot close to our door the big pig took it into his mouth and ran away with it but i caught sight of him and speaking to him he let it go knowing the 'cute cratur that i could read it better than him as soon as i had digested the contents which it was lucky the pig did not instead of me i just took my meal and my big stick and then set off for ballycleuch now you know terence if you haven't forgot and if you have i'll just remind you that there's a flaunty sort of young woman at the poteen shop there who calls herself mrs o'rourke wife to a corporal o'rourke who was kilt or died one day i don't know which but that's not of much consequence the devil a bit do i think the priest ever gave the marriage blessing to that same although she swears that she was married on the rock of gibraltar it may be a strong rock fore i know but it's not the rock of salvation like the seven sacraments of which marriage is one benedicite mrs o'rourke is a little too apt to fleer and jeer at the priests and if it were not that she softens down her pertinent remarks with a glass or two of the real poteen which proves some respect for the church i'd excommunicate her body and soul and everybody and every soul that put their lips to the cratur at her door but she must leave that off as i tell her when she gets old and ugly for then all the whisky in the world shan't save her but she's a fine woman now and it goes agin my conscience to help the devil to a fine woman now this mrs o'rourke knows everybody and everything that's going on in the country about and she has a tongue which has never had a holyday since it was let loose good morning to ye mrs o'rourke' says i an' the top of the morning to you father mcgrath' says she with a smile what brings you here is it a journey that you're taking to buy the true wood of the cross or is it a purty girl that you wish to confess father mcgrath or is it only that you're come for a drop of poteen and a little bit of chat with mrs o'rourke' sure it's i who'd be glad to find the same true wood of the cross mrs o'rourke but it's not grown i suspect at your town of ballycleuch and it's no objection i'd have to confess a purty girl like yourself mrs o'rourke who'll only tell me half her sins and give me no trouble but it's the truth that i'm here for nothing else but to have a bit of chat with yourself dainty dear and taste your poteen just by way of keeping my mouth nate and clane' so mrs o'rourke poured out the real stuff which i drank to her health and then says i putting down the bit of a glass so you've a stranger come i find in your parts mrs o'rourke' i've heard the same' replied she so you observe terence i came to the fact all at once by a guess i'm tould' says i that he's a scotchman and spakes what nobody can understand' devil a bit' says she he's an englishman and speaks plain enough' but what can a man mane to come here and sit down all alone' says i all alone father mcgrath' replied she is a man all alone when he's got his wife and childer and more coming with the blessing of god' but those boys are not his own childer i believe' says i there again you're all in a mistake father mcgrath' rejoins she the childer are all his own and all girls to boot it appears that it's just as well that you come down now and then for information to our town of ballycleuch' very true mrs o'rourke' says i and who is it that knows everything so well as yourself' you observe terence that i just said everything contrary and vice versa as they call it to the contents of your letter for always recollect my son that if you would worm a secret out of a woman you'll do more by contradiction than you ever will by coaxing so i went on anyhow i think it's a burning shame mrs o'rourke for a gentleman to bring over with him here from england a parcel of lazy english servants when there's so many nice boys and girls here to attind upon them' now there you're all wrong again father mcgrath' says she devil a soul has he brought from the other country but has hired them all here ain't there ella flanagan for one maid and terence driscol for a footman and it's well that he looks in his new uniform when he comes down for the newspapers and ar'n't moggy cala there to cook the dinner and pretty mary sullivan for a nurse for the babby as soon as it comes into the world' is it mary sullivan you mane' says i she that was married about three months back and is so quick in child getting that she's all but ready to fall to pieces in this same time' it's exactly she' says mrs o'rourke and do you know the reason' devil a bit' says i how should i' then it's just that she may send her own child away and give her milk to the english babby that's coming because the lady is too much of a lady to have a child hanging to her breast' but suppose mary sullivan's child ar'n't born till afterwards how then' says i speak mrs o'rourke for you're a sensible woman' how then' says she och that's all arranged for mary says that she'll be in bed a week before the lady so that's all right you'll perceive father mcgrath' but don't you perceive sensible woman as you are that a young woman who is so much out of her reckoning as to have a child three months after her marriage may make a little mistake in her lying in arithmetic mrs o'rourke' never fear father mcgrath mary sullivan will keep her word and sooner than disappoint the lady and lose her place she'll just tumble downstairs and won't that put her to bed fast enough' well that's what i call a faithful good servant that earns her wages' says i so now i'll just take another glass mrs o'rourke and thank you too sure you're the woman that knows everything and a mighty pretty woman into the bargain' let me alone now father mcgrath and don't be pinching me that way anyhow' it was only a big flea that i perceived hopping on your gown my darling devil anything else' many thanks to you father for that same but the next time you'd kill my fleas just wait until they're in a more dacent situation' fleas are fleas mrs o'rourke and we must catch 'em when we can and how we can and as we can so no offence a good night's rest to you mrs o'rourke when do you mean to confess' i've an idea that i've too many fleas about me to confess to you just now father mcgrath and that's the truth on it so a pleasant walk back to you' so you'll perceive my son that having got all the information from mrs o'rourke it's back i went to ballyhinch till i heard it whispered that there were doings down at the old house at ballycleuch off i set and went to the house itself as priests always ought to be welcomed at births and marriages and deaths being as you know of great use on such occasions when who should open the door but father o'toole the biggest rapparee of a priest in the whole of ireland didn't he steal a horse and only save his neck by benefit of clergy and did he ever give absolution to any young woman without making her sin over again what may be your pleasure here father mcgrath' says he holding the door with his hand only just to call and hear what's going on' for the matter of that' says he i'll just tell you that we're all going on very well but ar'n't you ashamed of yourself father mcgrath to come here and interfere with my flock knowing that i confess the house altogether' that's as may be' says i but i only wanted to know what the lady had brought into the world' it's a child' says he indeed' says i many thanks for the information and pray what is it that mary sullivan has brought into the world' that's a child too' says he and now that you know all about it good evening to you father mcgrath' and the ugly brute slarnmed the door right in my face who stole a horse' cries i but he didn't hear me more's the pity so you'll perceive my dear boy that i have found out something at all events but not so much as i intended for i'll prove to father o'toole that he's no match for father mcgrath but what i find out must be reserved for another letter seeing that it's not possible to tell it to you in this same praties look well but somehow or another clothes don't grow upon trees in ould ireland and one of your half quarterly bills or a little prize money if it found its way here would add not a little to the respectability of the family appearance even my cassock is becoming too holy for a parish priest not that i care about it so much only father o'toole the baste had on a bran new one not that i believe that he ever came honestly by it as i have by mine but get it how you may a new gown always looks better than an ould one that's certain so no more at present from your loving friend and confessor urtagh mcgrath now you'll observe peter said o'brien after i had read the letter that as i supposed your uncle meant mischief when he went over to ireland whether the children are both girls or both boys or your uncle's is a boy and the other is a girl there's no knowledge at present if an exchange was required it's made that's certain but i will write again to father mcgrath and insist upon his finding out the truth if possible have you any letter from your father none i am sorry to say i wish i had for he would not have failed to speak on the subject well never mind it's no use dreaming over the matter we must do our best when we get to england ourselves and in the meantime trust to father mcgrath i'll go and write to him while my mind's full of it o'brien wrote his letter and the subject was not started again chapter thirty seven captain kearney's illness he makes his will and devises sundry chateaux en espagne for the benefit of those concerned the legacy duty in this instance not ruinous he signs seals and dies the captain as was his custom went on shore and took up his quarters at a friend's house that is to say the house of an acquaintance or any polite gentleman who would ask him to take a dinner and a bed this was quite sufficient for captain kearney who would fill his portmanteau and take up his quarters without thinking of leaving them until the ship sailed or some more advantageous invitation was given this conduct in england would have very much trespassed upon our ideas of hospitality but in our foreign settlements and colonies where the society is confined and novelty is desirable a person who could amuse like captain kearney was generally welcome let him stay as long as he pleased all sailors agree in asserting that halifax is one of the most delightful ports in which a ship can anchor everybody is hospitable cheerful and willing to amuse and be amused it is therefore a very bad place to send a ship to if you wish her to refit in a hurry unless indeed the admiral is there to watch over your daily progress and a sharp commissioner to expedite your motions in the dock yard the admiral was there when we arrived and we should not have lain there long had not the health of captain kearney by the time that we were ready for sea been so seriously affected that the doctor was of opinion that he could not sail another frigate was sent to our intended cruising ground and we lay idle in port but we consoled ourselves if we did not make prize money at all events we were very happy and the major part of the officers very much in love we had remained in halifax harbour about three weeks when a very great change for the worse took place in captain kearney's disease disease indeed it could hardly be called he had been long suffering from the insidious attacks of a hot climate and though repeatedly advised to invalid he never would consent his constitution appeared now to be breaking up in a few days he was so ill that at the request of the naval surgeons he consented to be removed to the hospital where he could command more comforts than in any private house he had not been in the hospital more than two days when he sent for me and stated his wish that i should remain with him you know peter that you are a cousin of mine and one likes to have one's relations near one when we are sick so bring your traps on shore the doctor has promised me a nice little room for yourself and you shall come and sit with me all day i certainly had no objection to remain with him because i considered it my duty so to do and i must say that there was no occasion for me to make any efforts to entertain him as he always entertained me but i could not help seriously reflecting and feeling much shocked at a man lying in so dangerous a state for the doctors had pronounced his recovery to be impossible still continuing a system of falsehood during the whole day without intermission but it really appeared to him to be innate and as swinburne said if he told truth it was entirely by mistake peter said he one day there's a great draught shut the door and put on some more coals the fire does not draw well sir replied i without the door is open it's astonishing how little people understand the nature of these things when i built my house called welcot abbey there was not a chimney would draw i sent for the architect and abused him but he could not manage it i was obliged to do it myself did you manage it sir manage it i think i did the first time i lighted the fire i opened the door and the draught was so great that my little boy william who was standing in the current of air would have gone right up the chimney if i had not caught him by the petticoats as it was his frock was on fire why sir it must have been as bad as a hurricane no no not quite so bad but it showed what a little knowledge of philosophical arrangement could effect we have no hurricanes in england peter but i have seen a very pretty whirlwind when i was at welcot abbey indeed sir yes it cut four square haystacks quite round and i lost twenty tons of hay it twisted the iron lamppost at the entrance just as a porpoise twists a harpoon and took up a sow and her litter of pigs that were about a hundred yards from the back of the house and landed them safe over the house to the front with the exception of the old sow putting her shoulder out indeed sir yes but what was strange there were a great many rats in the hayrick and up they went with the hay now peter by the laws of gravitation they naturally came down before the hay and i was walking with my greyhound or rather terrier and after one coming down close to her which she killed it was quite ridiculous to notice her looking up in the air and watching for the others a greyhound did you say sir or a terrier both peter the fact is she had been a greyhound but breaking her fore leg against a stump when coursing i had the other three amputated as well and then she made a capital terrier she was a great favourite of mine well observed i i have read something like that in baron munchausen mr simple said the captain turning on his elbow and looking me severely in the face what do you mean to imply o nothing sir but i have read a story of that kind most probably the great art of invention is to found it upon facts there are some people who out of a mole hill will make a mountain and facts and fiction become so blended now a days that even truth becomes a matter of doubt very true sir replied i and as he did not speak for some minutes i ventured to bring my bible to his bedside as if i were reading it to myself what are you reading peter said he only a chapter in the bible sir said i would you like that i should read aloud yes i'm very fond of the bible it's the book of truth peter read me about jacob and his weathering esau with a mess of pottage and obtaining his father's blessing i could not help thinking it singular that he should select a portion in which for divine reasons a lie was crowned with such success and reward when i had finished it he asked me to read something more i turned over to the acts of the apostles and commenced the chapter in which ananias and sapphira were struck dead when i had finished he observed very seriously that is a very good lesson for young people peter and points out that you never should swerve from the truth recollect as your motto peter to tell truth and shame the devil' after this observation i laid down the book as it appeared to me that he was quite unaware of his propensity and without a sense of your fault how can repentance and amendment be expected he became more feeble and exhausted every day and at last was so weak that he could scarcely raise himself in his bed one afternoon he said peter i shall make my will not that i am going to kick the bucket just yet but still it is every man's duty to set his house in order and it will amuse me so fetch pen and paper and come and sit down by me i did as he requested write peter that i anthony george william charles huskisson kearney my father's name was anthony peter i was christened george after the present regent william and charles after mr pitt and mr fox who were my sponsors huskisson is the name of my great uncle whose property devolves to me he's eighty three now so he can't last long have you written down that yes sir being in sound mind do hereby make my last will and testament revoking all former wills yes sir i bequeath to my dearly beloved wife augusta charlotte kearney she was named after the queen and princess augusta who held her at the baptismal font all my household furniture books pictures plate and houses for her own free use and will and to dispose of at her pleasure upon her demise is that down yes sir also the interest of all my money in the three per cents reduced and in the long annuities and the balance in my agent's hands for her natural life at her death to be divided into equal portions between my two children william mohamed potemkin kearney and caroline anastasia kearney is that down yes sir well then peter now for my real property my estate in kent let me see what is the name of it walcot abbey my three farms in the vale of aylesbury and the marsh lands in norfolk i bequeath to my two children aforenamed the proceeds of the same to be laid up deducting all necessary expenses for their education for their sole use and benefit is that down not yet sir use and benefit' now it is sir until they come to the age of twenty one years or in case of my daughter until she marries with the consent of my executors then to be equally and fairly valued and divided between them you observe peter i never make any difference between girls and boys a good father will leave one child as much as another now i'll take my breath a little i was really astonished it was well known that captain kearney had nothing but his pay and that it was the hopes of prize money to support his family which had induced him to stay out so long in the west indies it was laughable yet i could not laugh there was a melancholy feeling at such a specimen of insanity which prevented me now peter we'll go on said captain kearney after a pause of a few minutes i have a few legacies to bequeath first to all my servants pounds each and two suits of mourning to my nephew thomas kearney of kearney hall yorkshire i bequeath the sword presented me by the grand sultan i promised it to him and although we have quarrelled and not spoken for years i always keep my word the plate presented me by the merchants and under writers of lloyd's i leave to my worthy friend the duke of newcastle is that down yes sir well my snuff box presented me by prince potemkin i bequeath to admiral sir isaac coffin and also i release him from the mortgage which i hold over his property of the madeline islands in north america by the bye say and further i bequeath to him the bag of snuff presented to me by the dey of algiers he may as well have the snuff as he has the snuff box is that down yes sir well then now peter i must leave you something o never mind me replied i no no peter i must not forget my cousin let me see you shall have my fighting sword a real good one i can tell you i once fought a duel with it at palermo and ran a sicilian prince so clean through the body and it held so tight that we were obliged to send for a pair of post horses to pull it out again put that down as a legacy for my cousin peter simple i believe that is all now for my executors and i request my particular friends the earl of londonderry the marquis of chandos and mr john lubbock banker to be my executors and leave each of them the sum of one thousand pounds for their trouble and in token of regard that will do peter now as i have left so much real property it is necessary that there should be three witnesses so call in two more and let me sign in your presence this order was obeyed and this strange will duly attested for i hardly need say that even the presents he had pretended to receive were purchased by himself at different times but such was the force of his ruling passion even to the last mr phillott and o'brien used to come and see him as did occasionally some of the other officers and he was always cheerful and merry and seemed to be quite indifferent about his situation although fully aware of it his stories if anything became more marvellous as no one ventured to express a doubt as to their credibility i had remained in the hospital about a week when captain kearney was evidently dying the doctor came felt his pulse and gave it as his opinion that he could not outlive the day this was on a friday and there certainly was every symptom of dissolution he was so exhausted that he could scarcely articulate his feet were cold and his eyes appeared glazed and turning upwards the doctor remained an hour felt his pulse again shook his head and said to me in a low voice he is quite gone as soon as the doctor quitted the room captain kearney opened his eyes and beckoned me to him he's a confounded fool peter said he he thinks i am slipping my wind now but i know better going i am 'tis true but i sha'n't die till next thursday strange to say from that moment he rallied and although it was reported that he was dead and the admiral had signed the acting order for his successor the next morning to the astonishment of everybody captain kearney was still alive he continued in this state between life and death until the thursday next the day on which he asserted that he would die and on that morning he was evidently sinking fast towards noon his breathing became much oppressed and irregular and he was evidently dying the rattle in his throat commenced and i watched at his bedside waiting for his last grasp when he again opened his eyes and beckoning me with an effort to put my head close to him to hear what he had to say he contrived in a sort of gurgling whisper and with much difficulty to utter peter i'm going now not that the rattle in my throat is a sign of death for i once knew a man to live with the rattle in his throat for six weeks he fell back and expired having perhaps at his last gasp told the greatest lie of his whole life thus died this most extraordinary character who in most other points commanded respect he was a kind man and a good officer but from the idiosyncrasy of his disposition whether from habit or from nature could not speak the truth i say from nature because i have witnessed the vice of stealing equally strong and never to the eradicated it was in a young messmate of good family and who was supplied with money to almost any extent he was one of the most generous open hearted lads that i ever knew he would offer his purse or the contents of his chest to any of his messmates and at the same time would steal everything that he could lay his hands upon i have known him watch for hours to steal what could be of no use to him as for instance an odd shoe and that much too small for his foot what he stole he would give away the very next day but to check it was impossible it was so well known that if anything were missed we used first to apply to his chest to see if it were there and usually found the article in question he appeared to be wholly insensible to shame upon this subject though in every other he showed no want of feeling or of honour and strange to say he never covered his theft with a lie after vain attempts to cure him of this propensity he was dismissed the service as incorrigible captain kearney was buried in the churchyard with the usual military honours in his desk we found directions in his own hand relative to his funeral and the engraving on his tombstone in these he states his age to be thirty one years if this were correct captain kearney from the time that he had been in the service of his country must have entered the navy just four months before he was born it was unfortunate that he commenced the inscription with here lies captain kearney etcetera etcetera his tombstone had not been set up twenty four hours before somebody who knew his character put a dash under one word as emphatic as it was true of the living man here lies captain kearney chapter thirty eight captain horton gloomy news from home get over head and ears in the water and find myself afterwards growing one way and my clothes another though neither as rich as a jew or as large as a camel i pass through my examination which my brother candidates think passing strange the day after captain kearney's decease his acting successor made his appearance on board the character of captain horton was well known to us from the complaints made by the officers belonging to his ship of his apathy and indolence indeed he went by the sobriquet of the sloth it certainly was very annoying to his officers to witness so many opportunities of prize money and distinction thrown away through the indolence of his disposition captain horton was a young man of family who had advanced rapidly in the service from interest and from occasionally distinguishing himself in the several cutting out expeditions on which he had not volunteered but had been ordered he had shown not only courage but a remarkable degree of coolness in danger and difficulty which had gained him much approbation but it was said that this coolness arose from his very fault an unaccountable laziness he would walk away as it were from the enemy's fire when others would hasten merely because he was so apathetic that he would not exert himself to run in one cutting out expedition in which he distinguished himself it is said that having to board a very high vessel and that in a shower of grape and musketry when the boat dashed alongside and the men were springing up he looked up at the height of the vessel's sides and exclaimed with a look of despair my god must we really climb up that vessel's decks when he had gained the deck and became excited he then proved how little fear had to do with the remark the captain of the ship falling by his hand as he fought in advance of his own men but this peculiarity which in a junior officer was of little consequence and a subject of mirth in a captain became of a very serious nature the admiral was aware how often he had neglected to annoy or capture the enemy when he might have done it and by such neglect captain horton infringed one of the articles of war the punishment awarded to which infringement is death his appointment therefore to the sanglier was as annoying to us as his quitting his former ship was agreeable to those on board of her as it happened it proved of little consequence the admiral had instructions from home to advance captain horton to the first vacancy which of course he was obliged to comply with but not wishing to keep on the station an officer who would not exert himself he resolved to send her to england with despatches and retain the other frigate which had been ordered home and which we had been sent up to replace we therefore heard it announced with feelings of joy mingled with regret that we were immediately to proceed to england for my part i was glad of it i had now served my time as midshipman to within five months and i thought that i had a better chance of being made in england than abroad i was also very anxious to go home for family reasons which i have already explained in a fortnight we sailed with several vessels and directions to take charge of a large convoy from quebec which was to meet us off the island of st john's in a few days we joined our convoy and with a fair wind bore up for england the weather soon became very bad and we were scudding before a heavy gale under bare poles our captain seldom quitted the cabin but remained there on a sofa stretched at his length reading a novel or dozing as he found most agreeable i recollect a circumstance which occurred which will prove the apathy of his disposition and how unfit he was to command so fine a frigate we had been scudding three days when the weather became much worse o'brien who had the middle watch went down to report that it blew very hard very well said the captain let me know if it blow harder in about an hour more the gale increased and o'brien went down again it blows much harder captain horton very well answered captain horton turning in his cot you may call me again when it blows harder at about six bells the gale was at its height and the wind roared in its fury down went o'brien again it blows tremendous hard now captain horton well well if the weather becomes worse it can't be worse interrupted o'brien it's impossible to blow harder indeed well then replied the captain let me know when it lulls in the morning watch a similar circumstance took place mr phillott went down and said that several of the convoy were out of sight astern shall we heave to captain horton o no replied he she will be so uneasy let me know if you lose sight of any more in another hour the first lieutenant reported that there were very few to be seen very well mr phillott replied the captain turning round to sleep let me know if you lose any more some time elapsed and the first lieutenant reported that they were all out of sight very well then said the captain call me when you see them again this was not very likely to take place as we were going twelve knots an hour and running away from them as fast as we could so the captain remained undisturbed until he thought proper to get up to breakfast indeed we never saw any more of our convoy but taking the gale with us in fifteen days anchored in plymouth sound the orders came down for the frigate to be paid off all standing and re commissioned i received letters from my father in which he congratulated me at my name being mentioned in captain kearney's despatches and requested me to come home as soon as i could the admiral allowed my name to be put down on the books of the guard ship that i might not lose my time and then gave me two month's leave of absence i bade farewell to my shipmates shook hands with o'brien who proposed to go over to ireland previous to his applying for another ship and with my pay in my pocket set off in the plymouth mail and in three days was once more in the arms of my affectionate mother and warmly greeted by my father and the remainder of my family once more with my family i must acquaint the reader with what had occurred since my departure my eldest sister lucy had married an officer in the army a captain fielding and his regiment having been ordered out to india had accompanied her husband and letters had been received just before my return announcing their safe arrival at ceylon my second sister mary had also been engaged to be married and from her infancy was of extremely delicate health she was very handsome and much admired her intended husband was a baronet of good family but unfortunately she caught a cold at the assize ball and went off in a decline she died about two months before my arrival and the family were in deep mourning my third sister ellen was still unmarried she also was a very beautiful girl and now seventeen my mother's constitution was much shaken by the loss of my sister mary and the separation from her eldest child as for my father even the loss of his daughter appeared to be wholly forgotten in the unwelcome intelligence which he had received that my uncle's wife had been delivered of a son which threw him out of the anticipated titles and estates of my grandfather it was indeed a house of mourning my mother's grief i respected and tried all i could to console her that of my father was so evidently worldly and so at variance with his clerical profession that i must acknowledge i felt more of anger at it than sorrow he had become morose and sullen harsh to those around him and not so kind to my mother as her state of mind and health made it his duty to be even if inclination were wanted he seldom passed any portion of the day with her and in the evening she went to bed very early so that there was little communication between them my sister was a great consolation to her and so i hope was i she often said so as she embraced me and the tears rolled down her cheeks and i could not help surmising that those tears were doubled from the coolness and indifference if not unkindness with which my father behaved to her as for my sister she was an angel and as i witnessed her considerate attentions to my mother and the total forgetfulness of self which she displayed so different from my father who was all self i often thought what a treasure she would prove to any man who was fortunate enough to win her love such was the state of my family when i returned to it i had been at home about a week when one evening after dinner i submitted to my father the propriety of trying to obtain my promotion i can do nothing for you peter i have no interest whatever replied he moodily i do not think that much is required sir replied i my time will be served on the th of next month if i pass which i trust i shall be able to do my name having been mentioned in the public despatches will render it a point of no very great difficulty to obtain my commission at the request of my grandfather yes your grandfather might succeed i have no doubt but i think you have little chance now in that quarter my brother has a son and we are thrown out you are not aware peter how selfish people are and how little they will exert themselves for their relations your grandfather has never invited me since the announcement of my brother's increase to his family indeed i have never been near him for i know that it is of no use i must think otherwise of lord privilege my dear father until your opinion is confirmed by his own conduct that i am not so much an object of interest i grant but still he was very kind and appeared to be partial to me well well you can try all you can but you'll soon see of what stuff this world is made i am sure i hope it will be so for what is to become of you children if i die i do not know i have saved little or nothing and now all my prospects are blasted by this and my father dashed his fist upon the table in a manner by no means clerical and with a look very unworthy of an apostle i am sorry that i must thus speak of my father but i must not disguise the truth still i must say there was much in extenuation of his conduct he had always a dislike to the profession of the church his ambition as a young man had been to enter the army for which service he was much better qualified but as it has been the custom for centuries to entail all the property of the aristocracy upon the eldest son and leave the other brothers to be supported by the state or rather by the people who are taxed for their provision my father was not permitted to follow the bent of his own inclination an elder brother had already selected the army as his profession and it was therefore decided that my father should enter the church and thus it is that we have had and still have so many people in that profession who are not only totally unfit for but who actually disgrace their calling the law of primogeniture is beset with evils and injustice yet without it the aristocracy of a country must sink into insignificance it appears to me that as long as the people of a country are content to support the younger sons of the nobility it is well that the aristocracy should be held up as a third estate and a link between the sovereign and the people but that if the people are either too poor or are unwilling to be so taxed they have a right to refuse taxation for such purposes and to demand that the law of primogeniture should be abolished i remained at home until my time was complete and then set off for plymouth to undergo my examination the passing day had been fixed by the admiral for the friday and as i arrived on wednesday i amused myself during the day walking about the dock yard and trying all i could to obtain further information in my profession on the thursday a party of soldiers from the depot were embarking at the landing place in men of war boats and as i understood were about to proceed to india i witnessed the embarkation and waited till they shoved off and then walked to the anchor wharf to ascertain the weights of the respective anchors of the different classes of vessels in the king's service i had not been there long when i was attracted by the squabbling created by a soldier who it appeared had quitted the ranks to run up to the tap in the dock yard to obtain liquor he was very drunk and was followed by a young woman with a child in her arms who was endeavouring to pacify him now be quiet patrick jewel said she clinging to him sure it's enough that you've left the ranks and will come to disgrace when you get on board now be quiet patrick and let us ask for a boat and then perhaps the officer will think it was all a mistake and let you off aisy and sure i'll spake to mr o'rourke and he's a kind man out wid you you cratur it is mr o'rourke you'd be having a conversation wid and he be chucking you under that chin of yours out wid you mary and lave me to find my way on board is it a boat i want when i can swim like st patrick wid my head under my arm if it wasn't on my shoulders at all events i can wid my nappersack and musket to boot the young woman cried and tried to restrain him but he broke from her and running down to the wharf dashed off into the water the young woman ran to the edge of the wharf perceived him sinking and shrieking with despair threw up her arms in her agony the child fell struck on the edge of the piles turned over and before i could catch hold of it sank into the sea the child the child burst forth in another wild scream and the poor creature lay at my feet in violent fits i looked over the child had disappeared but the soldier was still struggling with his head above water he sank and rose again a boat was pulling towards him but he was quite exhausted he threw back his arms as if in despair and was about disappearing under the wave when no longer able to restrain myself i leaped off the high wharf and swam to his assistance just in time to lay hold of him as he was sinking for the last time i had not been in the water a quarter of a minute before the boat came up to us and dragged us on board the soldier was exhausted and speechless i of course was only very wet the boat rowed to the landing place at my request and we were both put on shore the knapsack which was fixed on the soldiers back and his regimentals indicated that he belonged to the regiment just embarked and i stated my opinion that as soon as he was a little recovered he had better be taken on board as the boat which picked us up was one of the men of war boats the officer who had been embarking the troops and had been sent on shore again to know if there were any yet left behind consented in a few minutes the soldier recovered and was able to sit up and speak and i only waited to ascertain the state of the poor young woman whom i had left on the wharf in a few minutes she was led to us by the warder and the scene between her and her husband was most affecting when she had become a little composed she turned round to me where i stood dripping wet and intermingled with lamentation for the child showering down emphatic blessings on my head inquired my name give it to me she cried give it to me on paper in writing that i may wear it next my heart read and kiss it every day of my life and never forget to pray for you and to bless you i'll tell it you my name nay write it down for me write it down sure you'll not refuse me all the saints bless you dear young man for saving a poor woman from despair the officer commanding the boat handed me a pencil and a card i wrote my name and gave it to the poor woman she took my hand as i gave it her kissed the card repeatedly and put it into her bosom the officer impatient to shove off ordered her husband into the boat she followed clinging to him wet as he was the boat shoved off and i hastened up to the inn to dry my clothes i could not help observing at the time how the fear of a greater evil will absorb all consideration for a minor satisfied that her husband had not perished she had hardly once appeared to remember that she had lost her child i had only brought one suit of clothes with me they were in very good condition when i arrived but salt water plays the devil with a uniform i lay in bed until they were dry but when i put them on again not being before too large for me for i grew very fast they were now shrunk and shrivelled up so as to be much too small my wrists appeared below the sleeves of my coat my trowsers had shrunk halfway up to my knees the buttons were all tarnished and altogether i certainly did not wear the appearance of a gentlemanly smart midshipman i would have ordered another suit but the examination was to take place at ten o'clock the next morning and there was no time i was therefore obliged to appear as i was on the quarter deck of the line of battle ship on board of which the passing was to take place many others were there to undergo the same ordeal all strangers to me as i perceived by their nods and winks to each other as they walked up and down in their smart clothes not at all inclined to make my acquaintance there were many before me on the list and our hearts beat every time that a name was called and the owner of it walked aft into the cabin some returned with jocund faces and our hopes mounted with the anticipation of similar good fortune others came out melancholy and crest fallen and then the expression of their countenances was communicated to our own and we quailed with fear and apprehension i have no hesitation in asserting that although passing may be a proof of being qualified not passing is certainly no proof to the contrary i have known many of the cleverest young men turned back while others of inferior abilities have succeeded merely from the feeling of awe occasioned by the peculiarity of the situation and it is not to be wondered at when it is considered that all the labour and exertion of six years are at stake at this appalling moment at last my name was called and almost breathless from anxiety i entered the cabin where i found myself in presence of the three captains who was to decide whether i were fit to hold a commission in his majesty's service my logs and certificates were examined and approved my time calculated and allowed to be correct the questions in navigation which were put to me were very few for the best of all possible reasons that most captains in his majesty's service knew little or nothing of navigation during their servitude of midshipmen they learn it by rote without being aware of the principles upon which the calculations they use are founded as lieutenants their services as to navigation are seldom required and they rapidly forget all about it as captains their whole remnant of mathematical knowledge consists in being able to set down the ship's position on the chart as for navigating the ship the master is answerable and the captains not being responsible themselves they trust entirely to his reckoning of course there are exceptions but what i state is the fact and if an order from the admiralty were given that all captains should pass again although they might acquit themselves very well in seamanship nineteen out of twenty would be turned back when they were questioned in navigation it is from the knowledge of this fact that i think the service is injured by the present system and the captain should be held wholly responsible for the navigation of his ship it has been long known that the officers of every other maritime state are more scientific than our own which is easily explained from the responsibility not being invested in our captains the origin of masters in our service in singular when england first became a maritime power ships for the king's service were found by the cinque ports and other parties the fighting part of the crew was composed of soldiers sent on board all the vessels at that time had a crew of sailors with a master to navigate the vessel during our bloody naval engagements with the dutch the same system was acted upon i think it was the earl of sandwich of whom it is stated that his ship being in a sinking state he took a boat to hoist his flag on board of another vessel in the fleet but a shot cutting the boat in two and the weight of his armour bearing him down the earl of sandwich perished but to proceed as soon as i had answered several questions satisfactorily i was desired to stand up the captain who had interrogated me on navigation was very grave in his demeanour towards me but at the same time not uncivil during his examination he was not interfered with by the other two who only undertook the examination in seamanship the captain who now desired me to stand up spoke in a very harsh tone and quite frightened me i stood up pale and trembling for i augured no good from this commencement several questions in seamanship were put to me which i have no doubt i answered in a very lame way for i cannot even now recollect what i said i thought so observed the captain i judged as much from your appearance an officer who is so careless of his dress as not even to put on a decent coat when he appears at his examination generally turns out an idle fellow and no seaman one would think you had served all your time in a cutter or a ten gun brig instead of dashing frigates come sir i'll give you one more chance i was so hurt at what the captain said that i could not control my feelings i replied with a quivering lip that i had had no time to order another uniform and i burst into tears indeed burrows you are rather too harsh said the third captain the lad is frightened let him sit down and compose himself for a little while sit down mr simple and we will try you again directly i sat down checking my grief and trying to recall my scattered senses the captains in the meantime turning over the logs to pass away the time the one who had questioned me in navigation reading the plymouth newspaper which had a few minutes before been brought on board and sent into the cabin heh what's this i say burrows keats look here and he pointed to a paragraph mr simple may i ask whether it was you who saved the soldier who leaped off the wharf yesterday yes sir replied i and that's the reason why my uniforms are so shabby i spoilt them then and had no time to order others i did not like to say why they were spoilt i saw a change in the countenances of all the three and it gave me courage indeed now that my feelings had found vent i was no longer under any apprehension come mr simple stand up again said the captain kindly that is if you feel sufficiently composed if not we will wait a little longer don't be afraid we wish to pass you i was not afraid and stood up immediately i answered every question satisfactorily and finding that i did so they put more difficult ones very good very good indeed mr simple now let me ask you one more it's seldom done in the service and perhaps you may not be able to answer it do you know how to club haul a ship yes sir replied i having as the reader may recollect witnessed the manoeuvre when serving under poor captain savage and i immediately stated how it was to be done that is sufficient mr simple i wish to ask you no more questions i thought at first you were a careless officer and no seaman i now find you are a good seaman and a gallant young man do you wish to ask any more questions continued he turning to the two others they replied in the negative my passing certificate was signed and the captain did me the honour to shake hands with me and wish me speedy promotion thus ended happily this severe trial to my poor nerves and as i came out of the cabin no one could have imagined that i had been in such distress within when they beheld the joy that irradiated my countenance chapter thirty nine is a chapter of plots catholic casuistry in a new cassock plotting promotes promotion a peasant's love and a peer's peevishness prospects of prosperity as soon as i arrived at the hotel i sent for a plymouth paper and cut out the paragraph which had been of such importance to me in my emergency and the next morning returned home to receive the congratulations of my family i found a letter from o'brien which had arrived the day before it was as follows my dear peter some people they say are lucky to have a father born before them' because they are helped on in the world upon which principle mine was born after me that's certain however that can't be helped i found all my family well and hearty but they all shook a cloth in the wind with respect to toggery as for father mcgrath's cassock he didn't complain of it without reason it was the ghost of a garment but however with the blessing of god my last quarterly bill and the help of a tailor we have had a regular refit and the ancient family of the o'briens of ballyhinch are now rigged from stem to stern my two sisters are both to be spliced to young squireens in the neighbourhood it appears that they only waited for a dacent town gown to go to the church in they will be turned off next friday and i only wish peter you were here to dance at the weddings never mind i'll dance for you and for myself too in the meantime i'll just tell you what father mcgrath and i have been doing all about and consarning that thief of an uncle of yours it's very little or nothing at all that father mcgrath did before i came back seeing as how father o'toole had a new cassock and father mcgrath's was so shabby that he couldn't face him under such a disadvantage but still father mcgrath spied about him and had several hints from here and from there all of which when i came to add them up amounted to nothing at all but since i came home we have been busy father mcgrath went down to ballycleuch as bold as a lion in his new clothing swearing that he'd lead father o'toole by the nose for slamming the door in his face and so he would have done if he could have found him but as he wasn't to be found father mcgrath came back again just as wise and quite as brave as he went out so peter i just took a walk that way myself and as i surrounded the old house where your uncle had taken up his quarters who should i meet but the little girl ella flanagan who was in his service and i said to myself there's two ways of obtaining things in this world one is for love and the other is for money' the o'briens are better off in the first article than in the last as most of their countrymen are so i've been spending it very freely in your service peter sure' says i you are the little girl that my eyes were ever looking upon when last i was this way' and who are you' says she lieutenant o'brien of his majesty's service just come home for a minute to look out for a wife' says i and it's one about your make and shape and discretion that would please my fancy' and then i praised her eyes and her nose and her forehead and so downwards until i came to the soles of her feet and asked her leave to see her again and when she would meet me in the wood and tell me her mind at first she thought sure enough that i couldn't be in earnest but i swore by all the saints that she was the prettiest girl in the parts and so she is altogether and then she listened to my blarney the devil a word did i say about your uncle or your aunt or father mcgrath that she might not suspect for i've an idea that they're all in the story i only talked about my love for her pretty self and that blinded her as it will all women 'cute as they may be and now peter it's three weeks last sunday that i've been bespeaking this poor girl for your sake and my conscience tells me that it's not right to make a poor cratur fond of me seeing as how that i don't care a fig for her in the way of a wife and in any other way it would be the ruin of the poor thing i have spoken to father mcgrath on the subject who says that we may do evil that good may come and that if she had been a party to the deceit it's nothing but proper that she should be punished in this world and that will perhaps save her in the next' still i don't like it peter and it's only for you among the living that i'd do such a thing for the poor creature now hangs upon me so fondly and talks about the wedding day and tells me long stories about the connections which have taken place between the o'flanagans and the o'briens times gone by when they were all in their glory yesterday as we sat in the wood with her arm round my waist ella dear' says i who are these people that you stay with' and then she told me all she knew about their history and how mary sullivan was a nurse to the baby and what is the baby' says i a boy sure' says she and sullivan's baby' that's a girl' and is mary sullivan there now' no' says she it's yestreen she left with her husband and baby to join the regiment that's going out to ingy' yesterday she left' says i starting up yes' replies she and what do you care about them' it's very much i care' replied i for a little bird has whispered a secret to me' and what may that be' says she only that the childer were changed and you know it as well as i do' but she swore that she knew nothing about it and that she was not there when either of the children were born and i believe that she told the truth well' says i who tended the lady' my own mother' says ella and if it were so who can know but she' then' says i ella jewel i've made a vow that i'll never marry till i find out the truth of this matter so the sooner you get it out of your mother the better' then she cried very much and i was almost ready to cry too to see how the poor thing was vexed at the idea of not being married after a while she swabbed up her cheeks and kissing me wished me good bye swearing by all the saints that the truth should come out somehow or another it's this morning that i saw her again as agreed upon yesterday and red her eyes were with weeping poor thing and she clung to me and begged me to forgive her and not to leave her and then she told me that her mother was startled when she put the question to her and chewed it and cursed her when she insisted upon the truth and how she had fallen on her knees and begged her mother not to stand in the way of her happiness as she would die if she did i leave you to guess if my heart didn't smite me when she said that peter but the mischief was done and how her mother had talked about her oath and father o'toole and said that she would speak to him now peter i'm sure that the childer have been changed and that the nurse has been sent to the indies to be out of the way they say they were to go to plymouth the husband's name is of course o'sullivan so i'd recommend you to take a coach and see what you can do in that quarter in the meantime i'll try all i can for the truth in this and will write again as soon as i can find out any thing more all i want to do is to get father mcgrath to go to the old devil of a mother and i'll answer for it he'll frighten her into swearing anything god bless you peter and give my love to all the family yours ever terence o'brien this letter of o'brien was the subject of much meditation the advice to go to plymouth was too late the troops having sailed some time and i had no doubt but that mary sullivan and her husband were among those who had embarked at the time that i was at the port to pass my examination show the letter to my father i would not as it would only have put him in a fever and his interference would in all probability have done more harm than good i therefore waited quietly for more intelligence and resolved to apply to my grandfather to obtain my promotion a few days afterwards i set off for eagle park and arrived about eleven o'clock in the morning i sent in my name and was admitted into the library where i found lord privilege in his easy chair as usual well child said he remaining on his chair and not offering even one finger to me what do you want that you come here without an invitation only my lord to inquire after your health and to thank you for your kindness to me in procuring me and mr o'brien the appointment to a fine frigate yes replied his lordship i recollect i think i did so at your request and i think i heard some one say that you have behaved well and had been mentioned in the despatches yes my lord replied i and i have since passed my examination for lieutenant well child i'm glad to hear it remember me to your father and family and his lordship cast his eyes down upon his book which he had been reading my father's observations appeared to be well grounded but i would not leave the room until i had made some further attempt has your lordship heard from my uncle yes replied he i had a letter from him yesterday the child is quite well i expect them all here in a fortnight or three weeks to live with me altogether i am old getting very old and i shall have much to arrange with your uncle before i die if i might request a favour of your lordship it would be to beg that you would interest yourself a little in obtaining my promotion a letter from your lordship to the first lord only a few lines well child i see no objection only i am very old too old to write now and his lordship again commenced reading i must do lord privilege the justice to state that he evidently was fast verging to a state of second childhood he was much bowed down since i had last seen him and appeared infirm in body as well as mind i waited at least a quarter of an hour before his lordship looked up what not gone yet child i thought you had gone home your lordship was kind enough to say that you had no objection to write a few lines to the first lord in my behalf i trust your lordship will not refuse me well replied he peevishly so i did but i am too old too old to write i cannot see i can hardly hold a pen will your lordship allow me the honour of writing the letter for your lordship's signature well child yes i've no objection write as follows no write anything you please and i'll sign it i wish your uncle william was come this was more than i did i had a great mind to show him o'brien's letter but i thought it would be cruel to raise doubts and harass the mind of a person so close to the brink of the grave the truth would never be ascertained during his life i thought and why therefore should i give him pain at all events although i had the letter in my pocket i resolved not to make use of it except as a dernier resort i went to another table and sat down to write the letter as his lordship had said that i might write what i pleased it occurred to me that i might assist o'brien and i felt sure that his lordship would not take the trouble to read the letter i therefore wrote as follows while lord privilege continued to read his book my lord you will confer a very great favour upon me if you will hasten the commission which i have no doubt is in preparation for my grandson mr simple who has passed his examination and has been mentioned in the public despatches and also that you will not lose sight of lieutenant o'brien who has so distinguished himself by his gallantry in the various cutting out expeditions in the west indies trusting that your lordship will not fail to comply with my earnest request i have the honour to be your lordship's very obedient humble servant i brought this letter with a pen full of ink and the noise of my approach induced his lordship to look up he stared at first as having forgotten the whole circumstance then said o yes i recollect so i did give me the pen with a trembling hand he signed his name and gave me back the letter without reading it as i expected there child don't tease me any more good bye remember me to your father i wished his lordship a good morning and went away well satisfied with the result of my expedition on my arrival i showed the letter to my father who was much surprised at my success and he assured me that my grandfather's interest was so great with the administration that i might consider my promotion as certain that no accident might happen i immediately set off for london and delivered the letter at the door of the first lord with my own hands leaving my address with the porter chapter forty o'brien and myself take a step each pari passu a family reunion productive of anything but unity my uncle not always the best friend a few days afterwards i left my card with my address with the first lord and the next day received a letter from his secretary which to my delight informed me that my commission had been made out some days before i hardly need say that i hastened to take it up and when paying my fee to the clerk i ventured at a hazard to inquire whether he knew the address of lieutenant o'brien no replied he i wish to find it out for he has this day been promoted to the rank of commander i almost leaped with joy when i heard this good news i gave o'brien's address to the clerk hastened away with my invaluable piece of parchment in my hand and set off immediately for my father's house but i was met with sorrow my mother had been taken severely ill and i found the house in commotion doctors and apothecaries and nurses running to and fro my father in a state of excitement and my dear sister in tears spasm succeeded spasm and although every remedy was applied the next evening she breathed her last i will not attempt to describe the grief of my father who appeared to feel remorse at his late unkind treatment of her my sister and myself these scenes must be imagined by those who have suffered under similar bereavements i exerted myself to console my poor sister who appeared to cling to me as to her only support and after the funeral was over we recovered our tranquillity although the mourning was still deeper in our hearts than in our outward dress i had written to o'brien to announce the mournful intelligence and like a true friend he immediately made his appearance to console me o'brien had received the letter from the admiralty acquainting him with his promotion and two days after he arrived went to take up his commission i told him frankly by what means he had obtained it and he again concluded his thanks by a reference to the mistake of the former supposition that of my being the fool of the family by the powers it would be well for any man if he had a few of such foolish friends about him continued he but i won't blarney you peter you know what my opinion always has been so we'll say no more about it when he came back we had a long consultation as to the best method of proceeding to obtain employment for o'brien was anxious to be again afloat and so was i i regretted parting with my sister but my father was so morose and ill tempered that i had no pleasure at home except in her company indeed my sister was of opinion that it would be better if i were away as my father's misanthropy now unchecked by my mother appeared to have increased and he seemed to view me with positive dislike it was therefore agreed unanimously between my sister and me and o'brien who was always of our councils that it would be advisable that i should be again afloat i can manage him much better when alone peter i shall have nothing to occupy me and take me away from him as your presence does now and painful as it is to part with you my duty to my father and my wish for your advancement induce me to request that you will if possible find some means of obtaining employment spoken like a hero as ye are miss ellen notwithstanding your pretty face and soft eyes said o'brien and now peter for the means to bring it about if i can get a ship there is no fear for you as i shall choose you for my lieutenant but how is that to be managed do you think that you can come over the old gentleman at eagle park at all events i'll try replied i i can but be floored o'brien accordingly the next day i set off for my grandfather's and was put down at the lodge at the usual hour about eleven o'clock i walked up the avenue and knocked at the door when it was opened i perceived a hesitation among the servants and a constrained air which i did not like i inquired after lord privilege the answer was that he was pretty well but did not see any body is my uncle here said i yes sir replied the servant with a significant look and all his family are here too are you sure that i cannot see my grandfather said i laying a stress upon the word i will tell him that you are here sir replied the man but even that is against orders i had never seen my uncle since i was a child and could not even recollect him my cousins or my aunt i had never met with in a minute an answer was brought requesting that i would walk into the library when i was ushered in i found myself in the presence of lord privilege who sat in his usual place and a tall gentleman whom i knew at once to be my uncle from his likeness to my father here is the young gentleman my lord said my uncle looking at me sternly heh what oh i recollect well child so you've been behaving very ill sorry to hear it good bye behaving ill my lord replied i i am not aware of having so done reports are certainly very much against you nephew observed my uncle dryly some one has told your grandfather what has much displeased him i know nothing about it myself then some rascal has slandered me sir replied i my uncle started at the word rascal and then recovering himself replied well nephew what is it that you require of lord privilege for i presume this visit is not without a cause sir replied i my visit to lord privilege was first to thank him for having procured me my commission as lieutenant and to request the favour that he would obtain me active employment which a line from him will effect immediately i was not aware nephew that you had been made lieutenant but i agree with you that the more you are at sea the better his lordship shall sign the letter sit down shall i write it sir said i to my uncle i know what to say yes and bring it to me when it is written i felt convinced that the only reason which induced my uncle to obtain me employment was the idea that i should be better out of the way and that there was more risk at sea than on shore i took a sheet of paper and wrote as follows my lord may i request that your lordship will be pleased to appoint the bearer of this to a ship as soon as convenient as i wish him to be actively employed i am my lord etcetera etc why not mention your name it is of no consequence replied i as it will be delivered in person and that will insure my speedy appointment the letter was placed before his lordship for signature it was with some difficulty that he was made to understand that he was to sign it the old gentleman appeared much more imbecile than when i last saw him i thanked him folded up the letter and put it in my pocket at last he looked at me and a sudden flash of recollection appeared to come across his mind well child so you escaped from the french prison heh and how's your friend what is his name heh o'brien my lord o'brien cried my uncle he is your friend then sir i presume it is you am indebted for all the inquiries and reports which are so industriously circulated in ireland the tampering with my servants and other impertinences i did not choose to deny the truth although i was a little fluttered by the sudden manner in which it came to light i replied i never tamper with any people's servants sir no said he but you employ others so to do i discovered the whole of your proceedings after the scoundrel left for england if you apply the word scoundrel to captain o'brien sir in his name i contradict it as you please sir replied my uncle in a passion but you will oblige me by quitting this house immediately and expect nothing more either from the present or the future lord privilege except that retaliation which your infamous conduct has deserved i felt much irritated and replied very sharply from the present lord privilege i certainly expect nothing more neither do i from his successor but after your death uncle i expect that the person who succeeds to the title will do all he can for your humble servant i wish you a good morning uncle my uncle's eyes flashed fire as i finished my speech which indeed was a very bold and a very foolish one too as it afterwards proved i hastened out of the room not only from the fear of being turned out of the house before all the servants but also from the dread that my letter to the first lord might be taken from me by force but i never shall forget the scowl of vengeance which crossed my uncle's brows as i turned round and looked at him as i shut the door i found my way out without the assistance of the servants and hastened home as fast as i could o'brien said i on my return there is no time to be lost the sooner you hasten to town with this letter of introduction the better it will be for depend upon it my uncle will do me all the harm that he can i then repeated to him all that had passed and it was agreed that o'brien should take the letter which having reference to the bearer would do as well for him as for me and if o'brien obtained on appointment i was sure not only of being one of his lieutenants but also of sailing with a dear friend the next morning o'brien set off for london and fortunately saw the first lord the day after his arrival which was a levee day the first lord received the letter from o'brien and requested him to sit down he then read it inquired after his lordship asked whether his health was good etc o'brien replied that with the blessing of god his lordship might live many years that he had never heard him complain of ill health all which was not false if not true i could not help observing to o'brien when he returned home and told me what had passed that i thought considering what he had expressed with respect to white lies and black lies that he had not latterly adhered to his own creed that's very true peter and i've thought of it myself but it is my creed nevertheless we all know what's right but we don't always follow it the fact is i begin to think that it is absolutely necessary to fight the world with it own weapons i spoke to father mcgrath on the subject and he replied that if any one by doing wrong necessitated another to do wrong to circumvent him that the first party was answerable not only for his own sin but also for the sin committed in self defence' but o'brien i do not fix my faith so implicitly upon father mcgrath and i do not much admire many of his directions no more do i peter when i think upon them but how am i to puzzle my head upon these points all i know is that when you are divided between your inclination and your duty it's mighty convenient to have a priest like father mcgrath to decide for you and to look after your soul into the bargain it occurred to me that i myself when finding fault with o'brien had in the instance of both the letters from lord privilege been also guilty of deceit i was therefore blaming him for the same fault committed by myself and i am afraid that i was too ready in consoling myself with father mcgrath's maxim that one might do evil that good might come but to return to o'brien's interview after some little conversation the first lord said captain o'brien i am always very ready to oblige lord privilege and the more so as his recommendation is of an officer of your merit in a day or two if you will call at the admiralty you will hear further o'brien wrote to us immediately and we waited with impatience for his next letter but instead of this letter he made his appearance on the third day and first hugging me in his arms he then came to my sister embraced her and skipped and danced about the room what is the matter o'brien said i while ellen retreated in confusion o'brien pulled a parchment out of his pocket here peter my dear peter now for honour and glory an eighteen gun brig peter the rattlesnake captain o'brien west india station by the holy father my heart's bursting with joy and down he sank into an easy chair a'n't i almost beside myself inquired he after a short pause ellen thinks so i daresay replied i looking at my sister who stood in a corner of the room thinking o'brien was really out of his senses and still red with confusion o'brien who then called to mind what a slip of decorum he had been guilty of immediately rose and resuming his usual unsophisticated politeness as he walked up to my sister took her hand and said excuse me my dear miss ellen i must apologise for my rudeness but my delight was so great and my gratitude to your brother so intense that i am afraid that in my warmth i allowed the expressions of my feelings to extend to one so dear to him and so like him in person and in mind will you only consider that you received the overflowings of a grateful heart towards your brother and for his sake pardon my indiscretion ellen smiled and held out her hand to o'brien who led her to the sofa where we all three sat down and o'brien commenced a more intelligible narrative of what had passed he had called on the day appointed and sent up his card the first lord could not see him but referred him to the private secretary who presented him with his commission to the rattlesnake eighteen gun brig the secretary smiled most graciously and told o'brien in confidence that he would proceed to the west india station as soon as his vessel was manned and ready for sea he inquired of o'brien whom he wished as his first lieutenant o'brien replied that he wished for me but as in all probability i should not be of sufficient standing to be first lieutenant that the admiralty might appoint any other to the duty provided i joined the ship the secretary made a minute of o'brien's wish and requested him if he had a vacancy to spare as midshipman to allow him to send one on board to which o'brien willingly acceded shook hands with him and o'brien quitted the admiralty to hasten down to us with the pleasing intelligence and now said o'brien i have made up my mind how to proceed i shall first run down to plymouth and hoist my pennant then i shall ask for a fortnight's leave and go to ireland to see how they get on and what father mcgrath may be about so peter let's pass this evening as happily as we can for though you and i shall soon meet again yet it may be years or perhaps never that we three shall sit down on the same sofa as we do now ellen who was still nervous from the late death of my mother looked down and i perceived the tears start in her eyes at the remark of o'brien that perhaps we should never meet again and i did pass a happy evening my father dined out and did not interrupt us i had a dear sister on one side of me and a sincere friend on the other how few situations more enviable o'brien left us early the next morning and at breakfast time a letter was handed to my father it was from my uncle coldly communicating to him that lord privilege had died the night before very suddenly and informing him that the burial would take place on that day week and that the will would be opened immediately after the funeral my father handed the letter over to me without saying a word and sipped his tea with his tea spoon i cannot say that i felt very much on the occasion but i did feel because he had been kind to me at one time as for my father's feelings i could not or rather i should say i did not wish to analyse them as soon as he had finished his cup of tea he left the breakfast table and went into his study i then communicated the intelligence to my sister ellen my god said she after a pause putting her hand up to her eyes what a strange unnatural state of society must we have arrived at when my father can thus receive the intelligence of a parent's death is it not dreadful it is my dearest girl replied i but every feeling has been sacrificed to worldly considerations and an empty name the younger sons have been neglected if not deserted virtue talent everything set at naught intrinsic value despised and the only claim to consideration admitted that of being the heir entail when all the ties of nature are cast loose by the parents can you be surprised if the children are no longer bound by them most truly do you observe that it is a detestable state of society i did not say detestable brother i said strange and unnatural had you said what i said ellen you would not have been wrong i would not for the title and wealth which it brings be the heartless isolated i may say neglected being that my grandfather was were it offered now i would not barter for it ellen's love ellen threw herself in my arms we then walked into the garden where we had a long conversation relative to our future wishes hopes and prospects chapter forty one pompous obsequies the reading of the will not exactly after wilkie i am left a legacy what becomes of it my father very warm writes a sermon to cool himself i join o'brien's brig and fall in with swinburne on that day week i accompanied my father to eagle park to assist at the burial of lord privilege we were ushered into the room where the body had lain in state for three days the black hangings the lofty plumes the rich ornaments on the coffin and the number of wax candles with which the room was lighted produced a solemn and grand effect i could not help as i leaned against the balustrade before the coffin and thought of its contents calling to mind when my poor grandfather's feelings seemed as it were inclined to thaw in my favour when he called me his child and in all probability had not my uncle had a son would have died in my arms fond and attached to me for my own sake independently of worldly considerations i felt that had i known him longer i could have loved him and that he would have loved me and i thought to myself how little all these empty honours after his decease could compensate for the loss of those reciprocal feelings which would have so added to his happiness during his existence but he had lived for pomp and vanity and pomp and vanity attended him to his grave i thought of my sister ellen and of o'brien and walked away with the conviction that peter simple might have been an object of envy to the late right honourable lord viscount privilege baron corston lord lieutenant of the county and one of his majesty's most honourable privy councillors when the funeral which was very tedious and very splendid was over we all returned in the carriages to eagle park when my uncle who had of course assumed the title and who had attended as chief mourner was in waiting to receive us we were shown into the library and in the chair so lately and constantly occupied by my grandfather sat the new lord near to him were the lawyers with parchments lying before them as we severally entered he waved his hand to unoccupied chairs intimating to us to sit down but no words were exchanged except an occasional whisper between him and the lawyers when all the branches of the family were present down to the fourth and fifth cousins the lawyer on the right of my uncle put on his spectacles and unrolling the parchment commenced reading the will i paid attention to it at first but the legal technicalities puzzled me and i was soon thinking of other matters until after half an hour's reading i was startled at the sound of my own name it was a bequest by codicil to me of the sum of ten thousand pounds my father who sat by me gave me a slight push to attract my attention and i perceived that his face was not quite so mournful as before i was rejoicing at this unexpected intelligence i called to mind what my father had said to me when we were returning from eagle park that my grandfather's attentions to me were as good as ten thousand pounds in his will and was reflecting how strange it was that he had hit upon the exact sum i also thought of what my father had said of his own affairs and his not having saved anything for his children and congratulated myself that i should now be able to support my dear sister ellen in case of any accident happening to my father when i was roused by another mention of my name it was a codicil dated about a week back in which my grandfather not pleased at my conduct revoked the former codicil and left me nothing i knew where the blow came from and i looked my uncle in the face a gleam of malignant pleasure was in his eyes which had been fixed on me waiting to receive my glance i returned it with a smile expressive of scorn and contempt and then looked at my father who appeared to be in a state of misery his head had fallen upon his breast and his hands were clasped although i was shocked at the blow for i knew how much the money was required i felt too proud to show it indeed i felt that i would not for worlds have exchanged situations with my uncle much less feelings for when those who remain meet to ascertain the disposition made by one who is summoned away to the tribunal of his maker of those worldly and perishable things which he must leave behind him feelings of rancour and ill will might for the time be permitted to subside and the memory of a departed brother be productive of charity and good will after a little reflection i felt that i could forgive my uncle not so my father the codicil which deprived me of my inheritance was the last of the will and the lawyer rolled up the parchment and took off his spectacles everybody rose my father seized his hat and telling me in a harsh voice to follow him tore off the crape weepers and then threw them on the floor as he walked away i also took off mine and laid them on the table and followed him my father called his carriage waiting in the hall till it was driven up and jumped into it i followed him he drew up the blind and desired them to drive home not a sixpence by the god of heaven not a sixpence my name not even mentioned except for a paltry mourning ring and yours pray sir what have you been about after having such a sum left you to forfeit your grandfather's good opinion heh sir tell me directly continued he turning round to me in a rage nothing my dear father that i am aware of my uncle is evidently my enemy and why should he be particularly your enemy peter there must be some reason for his having induced your grandfather to alter his bequest in your favour i insist upon it sir that you tell me immediately my dear father when you are more calm i will talk this matter over with you i hope i shall not be considered wanting in respect when i say that as a clergyman of the church of england damn the church of england and those who put me into it replied my father maddened with rage i was shocked and held my tongue my father appeared also to be confused at his hasty expressions he sank back in his carriage and preserved a gloomy silence until we arrived at our own door as soon as we entered my father hastened to his own room and i went up to my sister ellen who was in her bed room i revealed to her all that had passed and advised with her on the propriety of my communicating to my father the reasons which had occasioned my uncle's extreme aversion towards me after much argument she agreed with me that the disclosure had now become necessary after the dinner cloth had been removed my sister left the room and went upstairs and i then communicated to my father the circumstances which had come to our knowledge relative to my uncle's establishment in ireland he heard me very attentively took out tablets and made notes well peter said he after a few minutes' silence when i had finished i see clearly through this whole business i have no doubt but that a child has been substituted to defraud you and me of our just inheritance of the title and estates but i will now set to work and try if i cannot find out the secret and with the help of captain o'brien and father mcgrath i think it is not at all impossible o'brien will do all that he can sir replied i and i expect soon to hear from him he must have now been a week in ireland i shall go there myself replied my father and there are no means that i will not resort to to discover this infamous plot no exclaimed he striking his fist on the table so as to shiver two of the wine glasses into fragments no means but i will resort to that is replied i my dear father no means which may be legitimately employed by one of your profession i tell you no means that can be used by man to recover his defrauded rights tell me not of legitimate means when i am to lose a title and property by a spurious and illegitimate substitution by the god of heaven i will meet them with fraud for fraud with false swearing for false swearing and with blood for blood if it should be necessary my brother has dissolved all ties and i will have my right even if i demand it with a pistol at his ear for heaven's sake my dear father do not be so violent recollect your profession i do replied he bitterly and how i was forced into it against my will i recollect my father's words the solemn coolness with which he told me i had my choice of the church or to starve' but i have my sermon to prepare for to morrow and i can sit here no longer tell ellen to send me in some tea i did not think my father was in a very fit state of mind to write a sermon but i held my tongue my sister joined me and we saw no more of him till breakfast the next day before we met i received a letter from o'brien my dear peter i ran down to plymouth hoisted my pennant drew my jollies from the dock yard and set my first lieutenant to work getting in the ballast and water tanks i then set off for ireland and was very well received as captain o'brien by my family who were all flourishing now that my two sisters are so well married off my father and mother are very comfortable but very lonely for i believe i told you long before that it had pleased heaven to take all the rest of my brothers and sisters except the two now married and one who bore up for a nunnery dedicating her service to god after she was scarred with the small pox and no man would look at her ever since the family have been grown up my father and mother have been lamenting and sorrowing that none of them would go off and now that they're all gone off one way or another they cry all day because they are left all alone with no one to keep company with them except father mcgrath and the pigs we never are to be contented in this world that's sartin and now that they are comfortable in every respect they find that they are very uncomfortable and having obtained all their wishes they wish everything back again but as old maddocks used to say a good growl is better than a bad dinner' with some people and the greatest pleasure that they now have is to grumble and if that makes them happy they must be happy all day long for the devil a bit do they leave off from morning till night the first thing that i did was to send for father mcgrath who had been more away from home than usual i presume not finding things quite so comfortable as they used to be he told me that he had met with father o'toole and had a bit of a dialogue with him which had ended in a bit of a row and that he had cudgelled father o'toole well and tore his gown off his back and then tore it into shivers that father o'toole had referred the case to the bishop and that was how the matter stood just then but' says he the spalpeen has left this part of the country and what is more has taken ella and her mother with him and what is still worse no one could find out where they were gone but it was believed that they had all been sent over the water' so you see peter that this is a bad job in one point which is that we have no chance of getting the truth out of the old woman for now that we have war with france who is to follow them on the other hand it is good news for it prevents me from decoying that poor young girl and making her believe what will never come to pass and i am not a little glad on that score for father mcgrath was told by those who were about her that she did nothing but weep and moan for two days before she went away scolded as she was by her mother and threatened by that blackguard o'toole it appears to me that all our hopes now are in finding out the soldier and his wife the wet nurse who were sent to india no doubt with the hope that the climate and the fevers may carry them off that uncle of yours is a great blackguard every bit of him i shall leave here in three days and you must join me at plymouth make my compliments to your father and my regards to your sister whom may all the saints preserve god bless her for ever and ever amen yours ever terence o'brien i put this letter into my father's bands when he came out of his room this is a deep laid plot said he and i think we must immediately do as o'brien states look after the nurse who was sent to india do you know the regiment to which her husband belongs yes sir replied i it is the rd and she sailed for india about three months back the name you say i think is o'sullivan said he pulling out his tablets well i will write immediately to captain fielding and beg him to make the minutest inquiries i will also write to your sister lucy for women are much keener than men in affairs of this sort if the regiment is ordered to ceylon all the better if not he must obtain furlough to prosecute his inquiries when that is done i will go myself to ireland and try if we cannot trace the other parties my father then left the room and i retired with ellen to make preparations for joining my ship at plymouth a letter announcing my appointment had come down and i had written to request my commission to be forwarded to the clerk of the cheque at plymouth that i might save a useless journey to london on the following day i parted with my father and my dear sister and without any adventure arrived at plymouth dock where i met with o'brien the same day i reported myself to the admiral and joined my brig which was lying alongside the hulk with her topmasts pointed through returning from the brig as i was walking up fore street i observed a fine stout sailor whose back was turned to me reading the handbill which had been posted up everywhere announcing that the rattlesnake captain o'brien about to proceed to the west india station where doubloons were so plentiful that dollars were only used for ballast was in want of a few stout hands it might have been said of a great many for we had not entered six men and were doing all the work with the marines and riggers of the dockyard but it is not the custom to show your poverty in this world either with regard to men or money i stopped and overheard him say ay as for the doubloons that cock won't fight i've served long enough in the west indies not to be humbugged but i wonder whether captain o'brien was the second lieutenant of the sanglier if so i shouldn't mind trying a cruise with him i thought that i recollected the voice and touching him on the shoulder he turned round and it proved to be swinburne what swinburne said i shaking him by the hand for i was delighted to see him is it you why mr simple well then i expect that i'm right and that mr o'brien is made and commands this craft when you meet the pilot fish the shark ain't far off you know you're very right swinburne said i in all except calling captain o'brien a shark he's no shark no that he ain't except in one way that is that i expect he'll soon show his teeth to the frenchmen but i beg your pardon sir and swinburne took off his hat oh i understand you did not perceive before that i had shipped the swab yes i'm lieutenant of the rattlesnake swinburne and hope you'll join us there's my hand upon it mr simple said he smacking his great fist into mine so as to make it tingle i'm content if i know that the captain's a good officer but when there's two i think myself lucky i'll just take a boat and put my name on the books and then i'll be on shore again to spend the rest of my money and try if i can't pick up a few hands as volunteers for i know where they all be stowed away i was looking at the craft this morning and rather took a fancy to her she has a damned pretty run but i hope captain o'brien will take off her fiddle head and get one carved i never knew a vessel do much with a fiddle head i rather think that captain o'brien has already applied to the commissioner on the subject replied i at all events it won't be very difficult to make the alteration ourselves to be sure not replied swinburne a coil of four inch will make the body of the snake i can carve out the head and as for a rattle be blessed if i don't rob one of those beggars of watchmen this very night so good bye mr simple till we meet again swinburne kept his word he joined the ship that afternoon and the next day came off with six good hands who had been induced from his representations to join the brig tell captain o'brien said he to me not to be in too great a hurry to man his ship i know where there are plenty to be had but i'll try fair means first this he did and every day almost he brought off a man and all he did bring off were good able seamen others volunteered and we were now more than half manned and ready for sea the admiral then gave us permission to send pressgangs on shore mr simple said swinburne i've tried all i can to persuade a lot of fine chaps to enter but they won't now i'm resolved that my brig shall be well manned and if they don't know what's good for them i do and i'm sure that they'll thank me for it afterwards so i'm determined to take every mother's son of them the same night we mustered all swinburne's men and went on shore to a crimp's house which they knew surrounded it with our marines in blue jackets and took out of it twenty three fine able seamen which nearly filled up our complement the remainder we obtained by a draft from the admiral's ship and i do not believe that there was a vessel that left plymouth harbour and anchored in the sound better manned than the rattlesnake so much for a good character which is never lost upon seamen o'brien was universally liked by those who had sailed with him and swinburne who knew him well persuaded many and forced the others to enter with him whether they liked it or not this they in the event did and with the exception of those drafted from the flag ship we had no desertions indeed none deserted whom we could have wished to retain and their vacancies were soon filled up with better men chapter forty two we sail for the west indies a volunteer for the ship refused and sent on shore again for reasons which the chapter will satisfactorily explain to the reader we were very glad when the master attendant came on board to take us into the sound and still more glad to perceive that the brig which had just been launched before o'brien was appointed to her appeared to sail very fast as she ran out so it proved after we went to sea she sailed wonderfully well beating every vessel that she met and overhauling in a very short time everything that we chased turning to windward like magic and tacking in a moment three days after we anchored in the sound the ship's company were paid and our sailing orders came down to proceed with despatches by next evening's post to the island of jamaica we started with a fair wind and were soon clear of the channel our whole time was now occupied in training our new ship's company at the guns and teaching them to pull together and by the time that we had run down the trades we were in a very fair state of discipline the first lieutenant was rather an odd character his brother was a sporting man of large property and he had contracted from his example a great partiality for such pursuits he knew the winning horses of the derby and the oaks for twenty years back was an adept at all athletic exercises a capital shot and had his pointer on board in other respects he was a great dandy in his person always wore gloves even on service very gentlemanlike and handsome and not a very bad sailor that is he knew enough to carry on his duty very creditably and evidently now that he was the first lieutenant and obliged to work learnt more of his duty every day i never met a more pleasant messmate or a more honourable young man a brig is only allowed two lieutenants the master was a rough kind hearted intelligent young man always in good humour the surgeon and purser completed our mess they were men of no character at all except perhaps that the surgeon was too much of a courtier and the purser too much of a skin flint but pursers are generally speaking more sinned against than sinning but i have been led away while talking of the brig and the officers and had almost forgotten to narrate a circumstance which occurred two days before we sailed i was with o'brien in the cabin when mr osbaldistone the first lieutenant came in and reported that a boy had come on board to volunteer for the ship what sort of a lad is he said o'brien a very nice lad very slight sir replied the first lieutenant we have two vacancies well see what you make of him and if you think he will do you may put him on the books i have tried him sir he says that he has been a short time at sea i made him mount the main rigging but he did not much like it well do as you please osbaldistone replied o'brien and the first lieutenant quitted the cabin in about a quarter of an hour he returned if you please sir said he laughing i sent the boy down to the surgeon to be examined and he refused to strip the surgeon says that he thinks she is a woman i have had her up on the quarter deck and she refused to answer any questions and requires to speak with you with me said o'brien with surprise oh one of the men's wives i suppose trying to steal a march upon us well send her down here osbaldistone and i'll prove to her the moral impossibility of her sailing in his majesty's brig rattlesnake in a few minutes the first lieutenant sent her down to the cabin door and i was about to retire as she entered but o'brien stopped me stay peter my reputation will be at stake if i'm left all alone said he laughing the sentry opened the door and whether boy or girl a more interesting face i never beheld but the hair was cut close like a boy's and i could not tell whether the surgeon's suspicions were correct you wish to speak holy saint patrick cried o'brien looking earnestly at her features and o'brien covered his face and bent over the table exclaiming my god my god in the meantime the colour of the young person fled from her countenance and then rushed into it again alternately leaving it pale and suffused with blushes i perceived a trembling over the frame the knees shook and knocked together and had i not hastened she for a female it was would have fallen on the deck i perceived that she had fainted i therefore laid her down on the deck and hastened to obtain some water o'brien ran up and went to her my poor poor girl said he sorrowfully oh peter this is all your fault all my fault how could she have come here by all the saints who pray for us dearly as i prize them i would give up my ship and my commission that this could be undone as o'brien hung over her the tears from his eyes fell upon her face while i bathed it with the water i had brought from the dressing room i knew who it must be although i had never seen her it was the girl to whom o'brien had professed love to worm out the secret of the exchange of my uncle's child and as i beheld the scene i could not help saying to myself who now will assert that evil may be done that good may come the poor girl showed symptoms of recovering and o'brien waved his hand to me saying leave us peter and see that no one comes in i remained nearly an hour at the cabin door by the sentry and prevented many from entering when o'brien opened the door and requested me to order his gig to be manned and then to come in the poor girl had evidently been weeping bitterly and o'brien was much affected all is arranged peter you must go on shore with her and not leave her till you see her safe off by the night coach do me that favour peter you ought indeed continued he in a low voice for you have been partly the occasion of this i shook o'brien's hand and made no answer the boat was reported ready and the girl followed me with a firm step i pulled on shore saw her safe in the coach without asking her any question and then returned on board come on board sir said i entering the cabin with my hat in my hand and reporting myself according to the regulations of the service thank you replied o'brien shut the door peter tell me how did she behave what did she say she never spoke and i never asked her a question she seemed to be willing to do as you had arranged sit down peter i never felt more unhappy or more disgusted with myself in all my life i feel as if i never could be happy again a sailor's life mixes him up with the worst part of the female sex and we do not know the real value of the better i little thought when i was talking nonsense to that poor girl that i was breaking one of the kindest hearts in the world and sacrificing the happiness of one who would lay down her existence for me peter since you have been gone it's twenty times that i've looked in the glass just to see whether i don't look like a villain but by the blood of st patrick i thought woman's love was just like our own and that a three months' cruise would set all to rights again i thought she had gone over to france so did i but now she has told me all about it father o'toole and her mother brought her down to the coast near here to embark in a smuggling boat for dieppe when the boat pulled in shore in the night to take them in the mother and the rascally priest got in but she felt as if it were leaving the whole world to leave the country i was in and she held back the officers came down one or two pistols were fired the boat shoved off without her and she with their luggage was left on the beach she went back to the next town with the officers where she told the truth of the story and they let her go in father o'toole's luggage she found letters which she read and found out that she and her mother were to have been placed in a convent at dieppe and as the convent was named in the letters which she says are important but i have not had courage to read them yet she went to the people from whose house they had embarked requesting them to forward the luggage and a letter to her mother sending everything but the letters which she reserved for me she has since received a letter from her mother telling her that she is safe and well in the convent and begging her to come over to her as soon as possible the mother took the vows a week after she arrived there so we know where to find her peter and where is the poor girl going to stay now o'brien that's all the worst part of it it appears that she hoped not to be found out till after we had sailed and then to have as she said poor thing to have laid at my feet and watched over me in the storms but i pointed out to her that it was not permitted and could not be and that i would not be allowed to marry her oh peter this is a very sad business continued o'brien passing his hand across his eyes well but o'brien what is to become of the poor girl she is going home to be with my father and mother hoping one day that i shall come back and marry her i have written to father mcgrath to see what he can do have you then not undeceived her father mcgrath must do that i could not it would have been the death of her it would have stabbed her to the heart and it's not for me to give that blow i'd sooner have died sooner have married her than have done it peter perhaps when i'm far away she'll bear it better father mcgrath will manage it o'brien i don't like that father mcgrath well peter you maybe right i don't exactly like all he says myself but what is a man to do either he is a catholic and believes as a catholic or he is not one will i abandon my religion now that it is persecuted never peter i hope not without i find a much better at all events still i do not like to feel that this advice of my confessor is at variance with my own conscience father mcgrath is a wordly man but that only proves that he is wrong not that our religion is and i don't mind speaking to you on this subject no one knows that i'm a catholic except yourself and at the admiralty they never asked me to take that oath which i never would have taken although father mcgrath says i may take any oath i please with what he calls heretics and he will grant me absolution peter my dear fellow say no more about it i did not but i may as well end the history of poor ella flanagan at once as she will not appear again about three months afterwards we received a letter from father mcgrath stating that the girl had arrived safe and had been a great comfort to o'brien's father and mother who wished her to remain with them altogether that father mcgrath had told her that when a man took his commission as captain it was all the same as going into a monastery as a monk for he never could marry the poor girl believed him and thinking that o'brien was lost to her for ever with the advice of father mcgrath had entered as a nun in one of the religious houses in ireland that as she said she might pray for him night and day many years afterwards we heard of her she was well and not unhappy but o'brien never forgot his behaviour to this poor girl it was a source of continual regret and i believe until the last day of his existence his heart smote him for his inconsiderate conduct towards her but i must leave this distressing topic and return to the rattlesnake which had now arrived at the west indies and joined the admiral at jamaica chapter forty three description of the coast of martinique popped at for peeping no heroism in making oneself a target board a miniature noah's ark under yankee colours capture a french slaver parrot soup in lieu of mock turtle we found orders at barbadoes to cruise off martinique to prevent supplies being furnished to the garrison of the island and we proceeded there immediately i do not know anything more picturesque than running down the east side of this beautiful island the ridges of hill spreading down to the water's edge covered with the freshest verdure divided at the base by small bays with the beach of dazzling white sand and where the little coasting vessels employed to bring the sugar from the neighbouring estates were riding at an anchor each hill at its ajutment towards the sea was crowned with a fort on which waves the tri colour certainly in appearance one of the most warlike flags in the world on the third morning we had rounded the diamond rock and were scudding along the lee side of the island just opening fort royal bay when hauling rather too close round its eastern entrance formed by a promontory called solomon's point which was covered with brushwood we found ourselves nearer than agreeable to a newly constructed battery a column of smoke was poured along the blue water and it was followed by the whizzing of a shot which passed through our boom mainsail first cutting away the dog vane which was close to old swinburne's head as he stood on the carronade conning the brig i was at dinner in the cabin with o'brien and the first lieutenant where the devil have they got the brig now said o'brien rising from his chair and going on deck we both followed but before we were on deck three or four more shots passed between the masts if you please sir said the master's mate in charge of the deck whose name was o'farrel the battery has opened upon us thank you very much for your information mr o'farrel replied o'brien but the french have reported it before you may i ask if you've any particular fancy to be made a target of or if you think that his majesty's brig rattlesnake was sent here to be riddled for nothing at all starboard the helm quarter master the helm was put up and the brig was soon run out of the fire not however until a few more shot were pitched close to us and one carried away the fore topmast backstay no mr o'farrel replied o'brien i only wish to point out to you that i trust neither i nor any one in this ship cares a fig about the whizzing of a shot or two about our ears when there is anything to be gained for it either for ourselves or for our country but i do care a great deal about losing even the leg or the arm much more the life of any of my men when there's no occasion for it so in future recollect it's no disgrace to keep out of the way of a battery when all the advantage is on their side i've always observed that chance shots pick out the best men lower down the mainsail and send the sailmaker aft to repair it when o'brien returned to the cabin i remained on deck for it was my afternoon watch and although o'farrel had permission to look out for me i did not choose to go down again the bay of fort royal was now opened and the view was extremely beautiful swinburne was still on the carronade and as i knew he had been there before i applied to him for information as to the locale he told me the names of the batteries above the town pointed out fort edward and negro point and particularly pigeon island the battery at the top of which wore the appearance of a mural crown it's well i remember that place mr simple said he it was in ' when i was last here the sodgers had 'sieged it for a whole month and were about to give it up 'cause they couldn't get a gun up on that 'ere hill you sees there so poor captain faulkner says there's many a clear head under a tarpaulin hat and i'll give any chap five doubloons that will hitch up a twenty four pounder to the top of that hill' not quite so easy a matter as you may perceive from here mr simple it certainly appears to me to have been almost impossible swinburne replied i and so it did to most of us mr simple but there was one dick smith mate of a transport who had come on shore and he steps out saying i've been looking at your men handling that gun and my opinion is that if you gets a butt crams in a carronade well woulded up and fill it with old junk and rope yarns you might parbuckle it up to the very top' so captain faulkner pulls out five doubloons and gives them to him saying you deserve the money for the hint even if it don't succeed' but it did succeed mr simple and the next day to their surprise we opened fire on the french beggars and soon brought their boasting down one of the french officers after he was taken prisoner axed me how we had managed to get the gun up there but i wasn't going to blow the gaff so i told him as a great secret that we got it up with a kite upon which he opened all his eyes and crying sacre bleu' walked away believing all i said was true but a'n't that a sail we have opened with the point mr simple it was so and i reported it to o'brien who came up and gave chase in half an hour we were alongside of her when she hoisted american colours and proved to be a brigantine laden up to her gunwale which was not above a foot out of the water her cargo consisted of what the americans called notions that is in english an assorted cargo halfway up her masts down to the deck were hung up baskets containing apples potatoes onions and nuts of various kinds her deck was crowded with cattle sheep pigs and donkeys below was full of shingle lumber and a variety of different articles too numerous to mention i boarded her and asked the master whither he was bound why replied he i'm bound for a market nowise particular and i guess you won't stop me not if all's right replied i but i must look at your log well i've a notion there's no great objection to that replied he and he brought it up on deck i had no great time to examine it but i could not help being amused at the little i did read such as horse latitudes water very short killed white faced bullock caught a dolphin and ate him for dinner broached molasses cask number letter a fine night saw little round things floating on the water took up a bucket full guessed they were pearls judge i guessed wrong only little portuguese men of war threw them overboard again heard a scream guessed it was a mermaid looked out saw nothing witnessed a very strange rippling a head calculated it might be the sea serpent stood on to see him plain and nearly ran on barbuda hauled off again met a britisher treated politely having overhauled his log i then begged to overhaul his men to ascertain if there were any englishmen among his crew this was not pleasing and he grumbled very much but they were ordered aft one man i was satisfied was an englishman and told him so but the man as well as the master persisted to the contrary nevertheless i resolved to take him on board for o'brien to decide and ordered him into the boat well if you will use force i can't help it my decks a'n't clear as you see or else i tell you what mr lieutenant your vessel there will be another hermione i've a notion if you presses true blooded yankees and what's more the states will take it up as sure as there's snakes in virginny notwithstanding this remonstrance i took them on board to o'brien who had a long conversation with the american in the cabin when they returned on deck he was allowed to depart with his man and we again made sail i had the first watch that night and as we ran along the coast i perceived a vessel under the high land in what the sailors called the doldrums this is almost becalmed or her sails flapping about in every direction with the eddying winds we steered for her and were very soon in the same situation not more than a quarter of a mile from her the quarter boat was lowered down and i proceeded to board her but as she was large and rakish o'brien desired me to be careful and if there were the least show of resistance to return as i pulled up to her bows they hailed me in french and desired me to keep off or they would fire this was quite sufficient and in obedience to my orders i returned to the brig and reported to o'brien we lowered down all the quarter boats and towed round the brig's broadside to her and then gave her half a dozen carronades of round and grape hearing great noise and confusion on board after we had ceased firing o'brien again sent me to know if they had surrendered they replied in the affirmative and i boarded her she proved to be the commerce de bordeaux with three hundred and thirty slaves on board out of five hundred embarked from the coast bound to martinique the crew were very sickly and were most of them in their hammocks latterly they had been killing parrots to make soup for them a few that were left of the grey species spoke remarkably well when they left the coast they had nearly one thousand parrots on board o'brien perceiving that i had taken possession sent another boat to know what the vessel was i desired the surgeon to be sent on board as some of the men and many of the poor slaves were wounded by our shot of all the miserable objects i know of none to be compared to the poor devils of slaves on board of a slave vessel the state of suffocation between decks the dreadful stench arising from their filth which is hardly ever cleared away the sick lying without help and looked upon by those who are stronger with the utmost indifference men women and children all huddled and crowded together in a state of nudity worn to skin and bone from stench starvation and living in an atmosphere that none but a negro could exist in if all that occurs on a slave ship were really known i think it would be acknowledged that to make the slave trade piracy would be nothing more than a just retribution and this is certain that unless it be made piracy it never will be discontinued by daylight the vessel was ready and o'brien determined to take her to dominica so that the poor devils might be immediately set on shore we anchored with her in a few days in prince rupert's bay where we only had twenty four hours to obtain some refreshments and arrange about our prize which i hardly need say was of some value during the short time that i was on shore purchasing some fowls and vegetables for o'brien and our own mess i was amused at witnessing a black sergeant drilling some of his regiment of free negroes and mulattoes he appeared resolved to make the best appearance that he could for he began by saying you hab shoe and 'tocking stand in front you hab shoe no 'tocking stand in centre you hab no shoe no 'tocking stand in um rear face to mountain back to sea beach why you no 'tep out sar you hangman i was curious to count the numbers qualified for the front rank there were only two mulattoes in the second rank there were also only two no shoe and no 'tocking appeared to be the fashion as usual we were surrounded by the negroes and although we had been there but a few hours they had a song composed for us which they constantly repeated don't you see the rattlesnake coming under sail don't you see the rattlesnake with prizes at um tail rattlesnake hab all the money ding ding she shall hab all that's funny ding ding chapter forty four money can purchase anything in the new country american information not always to be depended upon a night attack we are beaten off it proves a cut up instead of a cut out after all we save something out of the fire the next morning we weighed anchor and returned to our station off martinique we had run within three miles of st pierre's when we discovered a vessel coming out under jury masts she steered directly for us and we made her out to be the american brigantine which we had boarded some time before o'brien sent a boat to bring the master of her on board well captain said he so you met with a squall i calculate not replied he why then what the devil have you been about why i guess i sold all my cargo and what's more i've sold my masts sold your masts whom did you sell them to to an almighty pretty french privateer lying in st pierre's which had lost her spars when she was chased by one of your brass bottomed sarpents and i've a notion they paid pretty handsomely too but how do you mean to get home again i calculate to get into the stream and then i'll do very well if i meet a nor wester why then i'll make a signal of distress and some one will tow me in i guess well replied o'brien but step down into the cabin and take something captain with particular pleasure replied this strange mortal and down they went in about half an hour they returned on deck and the boat took the american on board soon afterwards o'brien desired osbaldistone and myself to step down into the cabin the chart of the harbour of st pierre's lay on the table and o'brien said i have had a long conversation with the american and he states that the privateer is at anchor in this spot pointing to a pencil mark on the chart if so she is well out and i see no difficulty in capturing her you see that she lies in four fathoms water and so close under the outer battery that the guns could not be pointed down upon the boats i have also inquired if they keep a good look out and the american says that they feel so secure that they keep no look out at all that the captain and officers belonging to her are on shore all night drinking smoking and boasting of what they will do now the question is whether this report be correct the american has been well treated by us and i see no reason to doubt him indeed he gave the information voluntarily as if he wished to serve us i allowed osbaldistone to speak first he coincided with o'brien i did not the very circumstance of her requiring new masts made me doubt the truth of his assertion as to where she lay and if one part of his story were false why not the whole o'brien appeared struck with my argument and it was agreed that if the boats did go away it should be for a reconnaissance and that the attempt should only be made provided it was found that the privateer lay in the same spot pointed out by the american master it was however decided that the reconnaissance should take place that very night as allowing the privateer to be anchored on the spot supposed there was every probability that she would not remain there but haul further in to take in her new masts the news that an expedition was at hand was soon circulated through the ship and all the men had taken their cutlasses from the capstan to get them ready for action the fighting boats' crews without orders were busy with their boats some cutting up old blankets to muffle the oars others making new grummets the ship's company were as busy as bees bustling and buzzing about the decks and reminding you of the agitation which takes place in a hive previous to a swarm at last osbaldistone came on deck and ordered the boats' crews to be piped away and prepare for service i was to have the command of the expedition in the launch i had charge of the first cutter o'farrel of the second and swinburne had the charge of the jolly boat at dusk the head of the brig was again turned towards st pierre's and we ran slowly in at ten we hove to and about eleven the boats were ordered to haul up o'brien repeating his orders to mr osbaldistone not to make the attempt if the privateer were found to be anchored close to the town the men were all mustered on the quarter deck to ascertain if they had the distinguishing mark on their jackets that is square patches of canvas sewed on the left arm so that we might recognise friend from foe a very necessary precaution in a night expedition and then they were manned and ordered to shove off the oars were dropped in the water throwing out a phosphorescent light so common in that climate and away we went after an hour's pulling osbaldistone lay on his oars in the launch and we closed with him we are now at the mouth of the harbour said he and the most perfect silence must be observed at the mouth of the harbour sir said swinburne i reckon we are more than half way in we passed the point at least ten minutes ago and this is the second battery we are now abreast of to this osbaldistone did not agree nor indeed did i think that swinburne was right but he persisted in it and pointed out to us the lights in the town which were now all open to us and which would not be the case if we were only at the mouth of the harbour still we were of a different opinion and swinburne out of respect to his officers said no more we resumed our oars pulling with the greatest caution the night was intensely dark and we could distinguish nothing after pulling ten minutes more we appeared to be close to the lights in the town still we could see no privateer or any other vessel again we lay upon our oars and held a consultation swinburne declared that if the privateer lay where we supposed we had passed her long ago but while we were debating o'farrel cried out i see her and he was right she was not more than a cable's length from us without waiting for orders o'farrel desired his men to give way and dashed alongside of the privateer before he was half way on board of her lights flew about in every direction and a dozen muskets were discharged we had nothing to do but to follow him and in a few seconds we were all alongside of her but she was well prepared and on the alert boarding nettings were triced up all round every gun had been depressed as much as possible and she appeared to be full of men a scene of confusion and slaughter now occurred which i trust never again to witness all our attempts to get on board were unavailing if we tried at a port a dozen pikes thrust us back if we attempted the boarding nettings we were thrown down killed or wounded into the boats from every port and from the decks of the privateer the discharge of musketry was incessant pistols were protruded and fired in our faces while occasionally her carronades went off stunning us with their deafening noise and rocking the boats in the disturbed water if they had no other effect for ten minutes our exertions never ceased at last with half our numbers lying killed and wounded in the bottom of the boats the men worn out and dispirited at their unavailing attempts sat down most of them on the boats' thwarts loading their muskets and discharging them into the ports osbaldistone was among the wounded and perceiving that he was not in the launch of whose crew not six remained i called to swinburne who was alongside of me and desired him to tell the other boats to make the best of their way out of the harbour this was soon communicated to the survivors who would have continued the unequal contest to the last man if i had not given the order the launch and second cutter shoved off o'farrel also having fallen and as soon as they were clear of the privateer and had got their oars to pass i proceeded to do the same amidst the shots and yells of the frenchmen who now jumped on their gunwale and pelted us with their musketry cheering and mocking us stop sir cried swinburne we'll have a bit of revenge so saying he hauled to the launch and wending her bow to the privateer directed her carronade which they had no idea that we had on board as we had not fired it to where the frenchmen were crowded the thickest stop one moment swinburne put another dose of cannister in we did so and then discharged the gun which had the most murderous effect bringing the major part of them down upon the deck i feel convinced from the cries and groans which followed that if we had had a few more men we might have returned and captured the privateer but it was too late the batteries were all lighted up and although they could not see the boats fired in the direction where they supposed us to be for they were aware from the shouting on board the vessel that we had been beaten off the launch had but six hands capable of taking an oar the first cutter had but four in my own boat i had five swinburne had two besides himself in the jolly boat this is a sorry business sir said swinburne now what's best to he done my idea is that we had better put all the wounded men into the launch man the two cutters and jolly boat and tow her off and mr simple instead of keeping on this side as they will expect in the batteries let us keep close inshore upon the near side and their shot will pass over us this advice was too good not to be followed it was now two o'clock and we had a long pull before us and no time to lose we lifted the dead bodies and the wounded men out of the two cutters and jolly boat into the launch i had no time for examination but i perceived that o'farrel was quite dead and also a youngster of the name of pepper who must have smuggled himself into the boats i did however look for osbaldistone and found him in the stern sheets of the launch he had received a deep wound in the breast apparently with a pike he was sensible and asked me for a little water which i procured from the breaker which was in the launch and gave it to him at the word water and hearing it poured out from the breaker many of the wounded men faintly called out for some having no time to spare i left two men in the launch one to steer and the other to give them water and then taking her in tow pulled directly in for the batteries as advised by swinburne who now sat alongside of me as soon as we were well in shore i pulled out of the harbour with feelings not by any means enviable swinburne said to me in a low voice this will be a hard blow for the captain mr simple i've always been told that a young captain losing his men without bringing any dollars to his admiral is not very well received i am more sorry for him than i can well express swinburne replied i but what is that a head a vessel under weigh swinburne stood up in the stern of the cutter and looked for a few seconds yes a large ship standing in under royals she must be a frenchman now's our time sir so long as we don't go out empty handed all will be well oars all of you shall we cast off the launch sir yes replied i and now my lads let us only have that vessel and we shall do she is a merchantman that's clear not that i was sure of it swinburne i think it will be better to let her pass us in shore they will all be looking out of the other side for they must have seen the firing well thought of sir replied swinburne we lay on our oars and let her pass us which she did creeping in at the rate of two miles an hour we then pulled for her quarter in the three boats leaving the launch behind us and boarded as we premised the crew were on deck and all on the other side of the vessel so anxiously looking at the batteries which were still firing occasional random shot that they did not perceive us until we were close to them and then they had no time to seize their arms there were several ladies on board some of the people protected them others ran below in two minutes we had possession of her and had put her head the other way to our surprise we found that she mounted fourteen guns one hatch we left open for the ladies some of whom had fainted to be taken down below the others were fastened down by swinburne as soon as we had the deck to ourselves we manned one of the cutters and sent it for the launch and as soon as she was made fast alongside we had time to look about us the breeze freshened and in half an hour we were out of gun shot of all the batteries i then had the wounded men taken out of the launch and swinburne and the other men bound up their wounds and made them as comfortable as they could chapter forty five some remarkable occurrences take place in the letter of marque old friends with improved faces the captor a captive but not carried away though the captive is by the ship's boat the whole chapter a mixture of love war and merchandise we had had possession of the vessel about an hour when the man who was sentry over the hatchway told me that one of the prisoners wished to speak with the english commanding officer and asked leave to come on deck i gave permission and a gentleman came up stating that he was a passenger that the ship was a letter of marque from bordeaux that there were seven lady passengers on board who had come out to join their husbands and families and that he trusted i would have no objection to put them on shore as women could hardly be considered as objects of warfare as i knew that o'brien would have done so and that he would be glad to get rid of both women and prisoners if he could i replied most certainly that i would heave to that they might not have so far to pull on shore and that i would permit the ladies and other passengers to go on shore i begged that they would be as quick as possible in getting their packages ready and that i would give them two of the boats belonging to the ship with a sufficient number of french seamen belonging to her to man the boats the frenchman was very grateful thanked me in the name of the ladies and went down below to impart the intelligence i then hove to lowered down the boats from the quarters and waited for them to come up it was daylight before they were ready but that i did not care about i saw the brig in the offing about seven miles off and i was well clear of the batteries at last they made their appearance one by one coming up the ladder escorted by french gentlemen they had to wait while the packages and bundles were put into the boats the first sight which struck them with horror was the many dead and wounded englishmen lying on the decks expressing their commiseration i told them we had attempted to take the privateer and had been repulsed and that it was coming out of the harbour that i had fallen in with their ship and captured it all the ladies had severally thanked me for my kindness in giving them their liberty except one whose eyes were fixed upon the wounded men when the french gentleman went up to her and reminded her that she had not expressed her thanks to the commanding officer she turned round to me i started back i certainly had seen that face before i could not be mistaken yet she had now grown up into a beautiful young woman celeste said i trembling are you not celeste yes replied she looking earnestly at me as if she would discover who i was but which it was not very easy to do begrimed as my face was with dust and gunpowder have you forgotten peter simple o no no never forgot you cried celeste bursting into tears and holding out her hands this scene occasioned no small astonishment to the parties on deck who could not comprehend it she smiled through her tears as i told her how happy i was to have the means of being of service to her and where is the colonel said i there replied she pointing to the island he is now general and commands the force in the garrison and where is mr o'brien interrogated celeste there replied i he commands that man of war of which i am the second lieutenant a rapid exchange of inquiries took place and the boats were stopped while we were in conversation swinburne reported that the brig was standing in for us and i felt that in justice to the wounded i could no longer delay still i found time to press her hand to thank her for the purse she had given me when i was on the stilts and to tell her that i had never forgotten her and never would with many remembrances to her father i was handing her into the boat when she said i don't know whether i am right to ask it but you could do me such a favour what is it celeste you have allowed more than one half of the men to pull us on shore some must remain and they are so miserable indeed it is hardly yet decided which of them are to go could you let them all go that i will for your sake celeste as soon as your two boats have shoved off i will lower down the boat astern and send the rest after you but i must make sail now god bless you the boats then shoved off the passengers waving their handkerchiefs to us and i made sail for the brig as soon as the stern boat was alongside the rest of the crew were called up and put into her and followed their companions i felt that o'brien would not be angry with me for letting them all go and especially when i told him who begged for them the vessel's name was the victorine mounting fourteen guns and twenty four men with eleven passengers she was chiefly laden with silks and wine and was a very valuable prize celeste had time to tell me that her father had been four years in martinique and had left her at home for her education and that she was then coming out to join him the other ladies were all wives or daughters of officers of the french garrison on the island and the gentlemen passengers were some of them french officers but as this was told me in secrecy of course i was not bound to know it as they were not in uniform as soon as we had closed with the brig i hastened on board to o'brien and as soon as a fresh supply of hands to man the boat and the surgeon and his assistant had been despatched on board of the prize to superintend the removal of the wounded i went down with him into the cabin and narrated what had occurred well said o'brien all's well that ends well but this is not the luckiest hit in the world your taking the ship has saved me peter and i must make as flourishing a despatch as i can by the powers but it's very lucky that she has fourteen guns it sounds grand i must muddle it all up together so that the admiral must think we intended to cut them both out and so we did sure enough if we had known she had been there but i am most anxious to hear the surgeon's report and whether poor osbaldistone will do well peter oblige me by going on board and put two marines sentry over the hatchway so that no one goes down and pulls the traps about for i'll send on shore everything belonging to the passengers for colonel o'brien's sake the surgeon's report was made six killed and sixteen wounded the killed were o'farrel and pepper midshipmen two seamen and two marines the first lieutenant osbaldistone was severely wounded in three places but likely to do well five other men were dangerously wounded the other ten would in all probability return to their duty in less than a month as soon as the wounded were on board o'brien returned with me to the prize and we went down into the cabin all the passengers' effects were collected the trunks which had been left open were nailed down and o'brien wrote a handsome letter to general o'brien containing a list of the packages sent on shore we sent the launch with a flag of truce to the nearest battery after some demur it was accepted and the effects landed we did not wait for an answer but made all sail to join the admiral at barbadoes the next morning we buried those who had fallen o'farrel was a fine young man brave as a lion but very hot in his temper he would have made a good officer had he been spared poor little pepper was also much regretted he was but twelve years old he had bribed the bowman of the second cutter to allow him to conceal himself under the foresheets of the boat his day's allowance of spirits had purchased him this object of his ambition which ended so fatally but as soon as the bodies had disappeared under the wave and the service was over we all felt happier there is something very unpleasant particularly to sailors in having a corpse on board we now sailed merrily along the prize keeping company with us and before we reached barbadoes most of the men were convalescent osbaldistone's wounds were however very severe and he was recommended to return home which he did and obtained his promotion as soon as he arrived he was a pleasant messmate and i was sorry to lose him although the lieutenant appointed in his room being junior to me i was promoted to be first lieutenant of the brig soon after osbaldistone went home his brother broke his neck when hunting and osbaldistone came into the property he then quitted the service we found the admiral at barbadoes who received o'brien and his despatch very well o'brien had taken two good prizes and that was sufficient to cover a multitude of sins even if he had committed any but the despatch was admirably written and the admiral in his letter to the admiralty commented upon captain o'brien's successful and daring attack whereas if the truth had been known it was swinburne's advice of pulling up the weather shore which was the occasion of our capturing the victorine but it was very hard to come at the real truth of these sort of things as i found out during the time that i was in his majesty's service chapter forty six o'brien tells his crew that one englishman is as good as three frenchmen on salt water they prove it we fall in with an old acquaintance although she could not be considered as a friend our next cruise was on the coast of guinea and gulf of mexico where we were running up and down for three months without falling in with anything but west indiamen bound to demerara berbice and surinam and occasionally chasing a privateer but in the light winds they were too fast for us still we were useful in protecting the trade and o'brien had a letter of thanks from the merchants and a handsome piece of plate upon his quitting the station we had made sail for barbadoes two days and were within sight of the island of trinidad when we perceived six sail on the lee bow we soon made them out to be three large ships and three schooners and immediately guessed which afterwards proved to be correct that they were three privateers with west india ships which they had captured we made all sail and at first the three privateers did the same but afterwards having made out our force and not liking to abandon their prizes they resolved to fight the west indiamen hauled to the wind on the other tack and the three privateers shortened sail and awaited our coming we beat to quarters and when everything was ready and we were within a mile of the enemy who had now thrown out the tricoloured flag o'brien ordered all the men aft on the quarter deck and addressed them now my men you see that there are three privateers and you also see that there are three indiamen which they have captured as for the privateers it's just a fair match for you one englishman can always beat three frenchmen we must lick the privateers for honour and glory and we must re capture the ships for profit because you'll all want some money when you get on shore again so you've just half a dozen things to do and then we'll pipe to dinner this harangue suited the sailors very well and they returned to their guns now peter said o'brien just call away the sail trimmers from the guns for i mean to fight these fellows under sail and out manoeuvre them if i can tell mr webster i want to speak with him mr webster was the second lieutenant a very steady quiet young man and a good officer mr webster said o'brien remember that all the foremost guns must be very much depressed i prefer that the shot should strike the water before it reaches them rather than it should go over them see that your screws are run up at once and i will take care that no broadside is thrown away starboard swinburne starboard it is sir steady so that's right for the stern of the leeward vessel we were within two cable lengths of the privateers who still remained hove to within half a cable's length of each other they were very large schooners full of men with their boarding netting triced up and showing a very good set of teeth as it afterwards proved one mounted sixteen and the other two fourteen guns now my lads over to the lee guns and fire as they bear when we round to hands by the lee head braces and jib sheet stretch along the weather braces quarter master abaft tend the boom sheet port hard swinburne port it is sir replied swinburne and the brig rounded up on the wind shooting up under the sterns of the two weathermost schooners and discharging the broadside into them as the guns bore be smart and load my lads and stand by the same guns round in the weather head braces peter i don't want her to go about stand by to haul over the boom sheet when she pays off swinburne helm a midships by this time another broadside was poured into the schooner who had not yet returned our fire which having foolishly remained hove to the wind they could not do the brig had now stern way and o'brien then executed a very skilful manoeuvre he shifted the helm and made a stern board so as to back in between the two weather schooners and the one to leeward bracing round at the same time on the other tack man both sides my lads and give them our broadsides as we pass the men stationed to the starboard guns flew over and the other side being again loaded we exchanged broadsides with the leeward and one of the windward schooners the brig continuing her stern way until we passed a head of them by the time that we had reloaded the brig had gathered headway and again passed between the same two schooners giving broadsides and then passing astern of them capital my lads capital said o'brien this is what i call good fighting and so it was for o'brien had given two raking broadsides and four others receiving only two in return for the schooners were not ready for us when we passed between them the last time the smoke had now rolled away to leeward and we were able to see the effect of our broadsides the middle schooner had lost her main boom and appeared very much cut up in the hull the schooner to leeward did not appear to have suffered much but they now perceived their error and made sail they had expected that we should have run in between them and fought broadside to broadside by which means the weathermost schooner would have taken a raking position while the others engaged us to windward and to leeward our own damages were trifling two men slightly wounded and one main shroud cut away we ran about half a mile astern from them then with both broadsides ready we tacked and found that as we expected we could weather the whole of them this we did o'brien running the brig within biscuit throw of the weather schooner engaging him broadside to broadside with the advantage that the other two could not fire a shot into us without standing a chance of striking their consort if he made more sail so did we if he shortened so did we so as to keep our position with little variation the schooner fought well but her metal was not to be compared with our thirty two pound carronades which ploughed up her sides at so short a distance driving two ports into one at last her foremast went by the board and she dropped astern in the meantime the other schooners had both tacked and were coming up under our stern to rake us but the accident which happened to the one we had engaged left us at liberty we knew that she could not escape so we tacked and engaged the other two nearing them as fast as we could the breeze now sprang up fast and o'brien put up the helm and passed between them giving them both a raking broadside of grape and cannister which brought the sticks about their ears this sickened them the smallest schooner which had been the leewardest at the commencement of the action made all sail on a wind we clapped on the royals to follow her when we perceived that the other schooner which had been in the middle and whose main boom we had shot away had put her helm up and was crowding all sail before the wind o'brien then said must not try for too much or we shall lose all put her about peter we must be content with the one that is left us we went about and ranged up to the schooner which had lost her foremast but she finding that her consort had deserted her hauled down her colours just as we were about to pour in our broadside our men gave three cheers and it was pleasant to see them all shaking hands with each other congratulating and laughing at the successful result of our action now my lads be smart we've done enough for honour now for profit peter take the two cutters full of men and go on board of the schooner while i get hold of the three west indiamen rig something jury forward and follow me in a minute the cutters were down and full of men i took possession of the schooner while the brig again tacked and crowding all sail stood after the captured vessels the schooner which was the largest of the three was called the jean d'arc mounting sixteen guns and had fifty three men on board the remainder being away in the prizes the captain was wounded very badly and one officer killed out of her ship's company she had but eight killed and five wounded they informed me that they had sailed three months ago from st pierre's martinique and had fallen in with the two other privateers and cruised in company having taken nine west indiamen since they had come out pray said i to the officer who gave the information were you ever attacked by boats when you laid at st pierre's he replied yes and that they had beaten them off did you purchase these masts of an american he replied in the affirmative so that we had captured the very vessel in attempting to cut out which we had lost so many men we were all very glad of this and swinburne said well hang me if i didn't think that i had seen that port hole before there it was that i wrenched a pike out of one of the rascal's hands who tried to stab me and into that port hole i fired at least a dozen muskets well i'm damned glad we've got hold of the beggar at last we secured the prisoners below and commenced putting the schooner in order in half an hour we had completed our knotting and splicing and having two of the carpenters with us in an hour we had got up a small jury mast forward sufficient for the present we lowered the mainsail put try sails on her and stood after the brig which was now close to the prizes but they separated and it was not till dark that she had possession of two the third was then hull down on the other tack with the brig in chase we followed the brig as did the two recaptured vessels and even with our jury up we found that we could sail as fast as they the next morning we saw the brig hove to and about three miles a head with the three vessels in her possession we closed and i went on board webster was put in charge of the privateer and after lying to for that day to send our prize masters and men on board to remove the prisoners we got up a proper jury mast and all made sail together for barbadoes on my return on board i found that we had but one man and one boy killed and six wounded which i was not aware of i forgot to say that the names of the other two privateers were l'etoille and la madeleine in a fortnight we arrived with all our prizes safe in carlisle bay where we found the admiral who had anchored but two days before i hardly need say that o'brien was well received and gained a great deal of credit for the action i found several letters from my sister the contents of which gave me much pain my father had been some months in ireland and had returned without gaining any information my sister said that he was very unhappy paid no attention to his clerical duties and would sit for days without speaking that he was very much altered in his appearance and had grown thin and care worn in short said she my dear peter i am afraid that he is fretting himself to death of course i am very lonely and melancholy i cannot help reflecting upon what will be my situation if any accident should happen to my father accept my uncle's protection i will not yet how am i to live for my father has saved nothing i have been very busy lately trying to qualify myself for a governess and practise the harp and piano for several hours every day i shall be very very glad when you come home again i showed the letters to o'brien who read them with much attention i perceived the colour mount into his cheeks when he read those parts of her letters in which she mentioned his name and expressed her gratitude for his kindness towards me never mind peter said o'brien returning me the letters to whom is it that i am indebted for my promotion and this brig but to you and for all the prize money which i have made and which by the head of st patrick comes to a very dacant sum but to you make yourself quite easy about your dear little sister we'll club your prize money and mine together and she shall marry a duke if there is one in england deserving her and it's the french that shall furnish her dowry as sure as the rattlesnake carries a tail chapter forty seven i am sent away after prizes and meet with a hurricane am driven on shore with the loss of more than half my men where is the rattlesnake in three weeks we were again ready for sea and the admiral ordered us to our old station off martinique we had cruised about a fortnight off st pierre's and as i walked the deck at night often did i look at the sights in the town and wonder whether any of them were in the presence of celeste when one evening being about six miles off shore we observed two vessels rounding negro point close in shore it was quite calm and the boats were towing ahead it will be dark in half an hour peter said o'brien and i think we might get them before they anchor or if they do anchor it will be well outside what do you think i agreed with him for in fact i always seemed to be happier when the brig was close in shore as i felt as if i was nearer to celeste and the further we were off the more melancholy i became continually thinking of her and the sight of her after so many years' separation had changed my youthful attachment into strong affection i may say that i was deeply in love the very idea of going into the harbour therefore gave me pleasure and there was no mad or foolish thing that i would not have done only to gaze upon the walls which contained the constant objects of my thoughts these were wild and visionary notions and with little chance of ever arriving at any successful issue but at one or two and twenty we are fond of building castles and very apt to fall in love without considering our prospect of success i replied that i thought it very possible and wished he would permit me to make the attempt as if i found there were much risk i would return i know that i can trust you peter said o'brien and it's a great pleasure to know that you have an officer you can trust but hav'n't i brought you up myself and made a man of you as i promised i would when you were a little spalpeen with a sniffling nose and legs in the shape of two carrots so hoist out the launch and get the boats ready the sooner the better what a hot day this has been not a cat's paw on the water and the sky all of a mist only look at the sun how he goes down puffed out to three times his size as if he were in a terrible passion i suspect we shall have the land breeze off strong in half an hour i shoved off with the boats it was now quite dark and i pulled towards the harbour of st pierre the heat was excessive and unaccountable not the slightest breath of wind moved in the heavens or below no clouds to be seen and the stars were obscured by a sort of mist there appeared a total stagnation of the elements the men in the boats pulled off their jackets for after a few moments' pulling they could bear them no longer as we pulled in the atmosphere became more opaque and the darkness more intense we supposed ourselves to be at the mouth of the harbour but could see nothing not three yards a head of the boat swinburne who always went with me was steering the boat and i observed to him the unusual appearance of the night i've been watching it sir replied swinburne and i tell you mr simple that if we only know how to find the brig that i would advise you to get on board of her immediately she'll want all her hands this night or i'm much mistaken why do you say so replied i because i think nay i may say that i'm sartin we'll have a hurricane afore morning it's not the first time i've cruised in these latitudes i recollect in but i interrupted him swinburne i believe that you are right at all events i'll turn back perhaps we may reach the brig before it comes on she carries a light and we can find her out i then turned the boat round and steered as near as i could guess for where the brig was lying but we had not pulled out more than two minutes before a low moaning was heard in the atmosphere now here now there and we appeared to be pulling though solid darkness if i may use the expression swinburne looked around him and pointed out on the starboard bow it's a coming mr simple sure enough many's the living being that will not rise on its legs to morrow see sir i looked and dark as it was it appeared as if a sort of black wall was sweeping along the water right towards us the moaning gradually increased to a stunning roar and then at once it broke upon us with a noise to which no thunder can bear a comparison the sea was perfectly level but boiling and covered with a white foam so that we appeared in the night to be floating on milk the oars were caught by the wind with such force that the men were dashed forward under the thwarts many of them severely hurt fortunately we pulled with tholes and pins or the gunwale and planks of the boats would have been wrenched off and we should have foundered the wind soon caught the boat on her broadside and had there been the least sea would have inevitably thrown her over but swinburne put the helm down and she fell off before the hurricane darting through the boiling water at the rate of ten miles an hour all hands were aghast they had recovered their seats but were obliged to relinquish them and sit down at the bottom holding on by the thwarts the terrific roaring of the hurricane prevented any communication except by gesture the other boats had disappeared lighter than ours they had flown away faster before the sweeping element but we had not been a minute before the wind before the sea rose in a most unaccountable manner it appeared to be by magic of all the horrors that ever i witnessed nothing could be compared to the scene of this night we could see nothing and heard only the wind before which we were darting like an arrow to where we knew not unless it was to certain death swinburne steered the boat every now and then looking back as the waves increased in a few minutes we were in a heavy swell that at one minute bore us all aloft and at the next almost sheltered us from the hurricane and now the atmosphere was charged with showers of spray the wind cutting off the summits of the waves as if with a knife and carrying them along with it as it were in its arms the boat was filling with water and appeared to settle down fast the men baled with their hats in silence when a large wave culminated over the stern filling us up to our thwarts the next moment we all received a shock so violent that we were jerked from our seats swinburne was thrown over my head every timber of the boat separated at once and she appeared to crumble from under us leaving us floating on the raging waters we all struck out for our lives but with little hope of preserving them but the next wave dashed us on the rocks against which the boat had already been hurled that wave gave life to some and death to others me in heaven's mercy it preserved i was thrown so high up that i merely scraped against the top of the rock breaking two of my ribs swinburne and eight more escaped with me but not unhurt two had their legs broken three had broken arms and the others were more or less contused swinburne miraculously received no injury we had been eighteen in the boat of which ten escaped the others were hurled up at our feet and the next morning we found them dreadfully mangled one or two had their skulls literally shattered to pieces against the rocks i felt that i was saved and was grateful but still the hurricane howled still the waves were washing over us i crawled further up upon the beach and found swinburne sitting down with his eyes directed seaward he knew me took my hand squeezed it and then held it in his for some moments we remained in this position when the waves which every moment increased in volume washed up to us and obliged us to crawl further up i then looked around me the hurricane continued in its fury but the atmosphere was not so dark i could trace for some distance the line of the harbour from the ridge of foam upon the shore and for the first time i thought of o'brien and the brig i put my mouth close to swinburne's ear and cried out o'brien swinburne shook his head and looked up again at the offing i thought whether there was any chance of the brig's escape she was certainly six if not seven miles off and the hurricane was not direct on the shore she might have a drift of ten miles perhaps but what was that against such tremendous power i prayed for those on board of the brig and returned thanks for my own preservation i was or soon should be a prisoner no doubt but what was that i thought of celeste and felt almost happy in about three hours the force of the wind subsided it still blew a heavy gale but the sky cleared up the stars again twinkled in the heavens and we could see to a considerable distance it's breaking now sir said swinburne at last satisfied with the injury it has done and that's no little this is worst than ' now i'd give all my pay and prize money if it were only daylight and i could know the fate of the poor rattlesnake what do you think swinburne all depends upon whether they were taken unprepared sir captain o'brien is as good a seaman as ever trod a plank but he never has been in a hurricane and may not have known the signs and warnings which god in his mercy has vouchsafed unto us your flush vessels fill easily but we must hope for the best most anxiously did we look out for the day which appeared to us as if it never would break at last the dawn appeared and we stretched our eyes to every part of the offing as it was lighted up but we could not see the brig the sun rose and all was bright and clear but we looked not around us our eyes were directed to where we had left the brig the sea was still running high but the wind abated fast thank god ejaculated swinburne when he had directed his eyes along the coast she is above water at all events and looking in the direction where he pointed i perceived the brig within two miles of the shore dismantled and tossing in the waves i see her replied i catching my breath with joy but still i think she must go on shore all depends upon whether she can get a little bit of sail up to weather the point replied swinburne and depend upon it captain o'brien knows that as well as we do we were now joined by the other men who were saved we all shook hands they pointed out to me the bodies of our shipmates who had perished i directed them to haul them further up and put them altogether and continued with swinburne to watch the brig in about half an hour we perceived a triangle raised and in ten minutes afterwards a jury mast abaft a try sail was hoisted and set then the shears were seen forward and in as short a time another try sail and a storm jib were expanded to the wind that's all he can do now mr simple observed swinburne he must trust to them and to providence they are not more than a mile from the beach it will be touch and go anxiously did we watch for more than half an hour the other men returned to us and joined in our speculations at one time we thought it impossible at another we were certain that she would weather the point at last as she neared it she forged a head my anxiety became almost insupportable i stood first on one leg and then on the other breathless with suspense she appeared to be on the point actually touching the rocks god she's struck said i no replied swinburne and then we saw her pass on the other side of the outermost rock and disappear safe mr simple weathered by god cried swinburne waving his hat with joy god be thanked replied i overcome with delight chapter forty eight the devastations of the hurricane peter makes friends at destroying or saving nothing like british seamen peter meets with general o'brien much to his satisfaction has another meeting still more so a great deal of pressing of hands and all that as pope says now that the brig was safe we thought of ourselves my first attention was directed to the dead bodies and as i looked at their mangled limbs i felt grateful to heaven that i had been so miraculously spared we then cast our eyes along the beach to see if we could trace any remnants of the other boats but in vain we were about three miles from the town which we could perceive had received considerable damage and the beach below it was strewed with wrecks and fragments i told the men that we might as well walk into the town and deliver ourselves up as prisoners to which they agreed and we set forward promising to send for the poor fellows who were too much hurt to accompany us as soon as we climbed up the rocks and gained the inland what a sight presented itself to us trees torn up by the roots in every direction cattle lying dead here and there the remains of a house of which the other parts had been swept away for miles everything not built of solid masonry had disappeared we passed what had been a range of negro huts but they were levelled to the ground the negroes were busily searching for their property among the ruins while the women held their infants in their arms and the other children by their sides here and there was the mother wailing over the dead body of some poor little thing which had been crushed to death they took no notice of us about half a mile further on to our great delight we fell in with the crews of the other boats who were sitting by the side of the road they had all escaped unhurt their boats being so much more buoyant than ours had been thrown up high and dry they joined us and we proceeded on our way on our road we fell in with a cart blown over under the wheel of which was the leg of the negro who conducted it we released the poor fellow his leg was fractured we laid him by the side of the road in the shade and continued our march our whole route was one scene of desolation and distress but when we arrived at the town we found that there it was indeed accumulated there was not one house in three standing entire the beach was covered with the remnants of bodies and fragments of vessels whose masts lay forced several feet into the sand and broken into four or five pieces parties of soldiers were busy taking away the bodies and removing what few valuables had been saved we turned up into the town for no one accosted or even noticed us and here the scene was even more dreadful in some streets they were digging out those who were still alive and whose cries were heard among the ruins in others they were carrying away the dead bodies the lamentations of the relatives the howling of the negroes the cries of the wounded the cursing and swearing of the french soldiers and the orders delivered continually by officers on horseback with all the confusion arising from crowds of spectators mingling their voices together formed a scene as dreadful as it was novel after surveying it for a few minutes i went up to an officer on horseback and told him in french that i wished to surrender myself as a prisoner we have no time to take prisoners now replied he hundreds are buried in the ruins and we must try to save them we must now attend to the claims of humanity will you allow my men to assist you sir replied i they are active and strong fellows sir said he taking off his hat i thank you in the name of my unfortunate countrymen show us then where we may be most useful he turned and pointed to a house higher up the offices of which were blown down there are living beings under those ruins come my lads said i and sore as they were my men hastened with alacrity to perform their task i could not help them myself my side was so painful but i stood by giving them directions in half an hour we had cleared away so as to arrive at a poor negro girl whose cries we had distinctly heard we released her and laid her down in the street but she fainted her left hand was dreadfully shattered i was giving what assistance i could and the men were busy clearing away throwing on one side the beams and rafters when an officer on horseback rode up he stood and asked me who we were i told him that we belonged to the brig and had been wrecked and that we were giving what assistance we could until they were at leisure to send us to prison you english are fine brave fellows replied he as he rode on another unfortunate object had been recovered by our men an old white headed negro but he was too much mangled to live we brought him out and were laying him beside the negro girl when several officers on horseback rode down the street the one who was foremost in a general's uniform i immediately recognised as my former friend then colonel o'brien they all stopped and looked at us i told who we were general o'brien took off his hat to the sailors and thanked them he did not recognise me and he was passing on when i said to him in english general o'brien you have forgotten me but i shall never forget your kindness my god said he is it you my dear fellow and he sprang from his horse and shook me warmly by the hand no wonder that i did not know you you are a very different person from little peter simple who dressed up as a girl and danced on stilts but i have to thank you and so has celeste for your kindness to her i will not ask you to leave your work of charity and kindness but when you have done what you can come up to my house any one will show it to you and if you do not find me you will find celeste as you must be aware i cannot leave this melancholy employment god bless you he then rode off followed by his staff come my lads said i depend upon it we shall not be very cruelly treated let us work hard and do all the good we can and the frenchmen won't forget it we had cleared that house and went back to where the other people were working under the orders of the officer on horseback i went up to him and told him we had saved two and if he had no objection would assist his party he thankfully accepted our services and now my lads said swinburne let us forget all our bruises and show these french follows how to work and they did so they tossed away the beams and rafters right and left with a quickness and dexterity which quite astonished the officer and other inhabitants who were looking on and in half an hour had done more work than could have possibly been expected several lives were saved and the french expressed their admiration at our sailors' conduct and brought them something to drink which they stood much in need of poor fellows after they had worked double tides as we say and certainly were the means of saving many lives which otherwise would have been sacrificed the disasters occasioned by this hurricane were very great owing to its having taken place at night when the chief of the inhabitants were in bed and asleep i was told that most of the wood houses were down five minutes after the hurricane burst upon them about noon there was no more work for us to do and i was not sorry that it was over my side was very painful and the burning heat of the sun made me feel giddy and sick at the stomach i inquired of a respectable looking old frenchman which was the general's house he directed me to it and i proceeded there followed by my men when i arrived i found the orderly leading away the horse of general o'brien who had just returned i desired a serjeant who was in attendance at the door to acquaint the general that i was below he returned and desired me to follow him i was conducted into a large room where i found him in company with several officers he again greeted me warmly and introduced me to the company as the officer who had permitted the ladies who had been taken prisoners to come on shore i have to thank you then for my wife said an officer coming up and offering his hand another came up and told me that i had also released his we then entered into a conversation in which i stated the occasion of my having been wrecked and all the particulars also that i had seen the brig in the morning dismasted but that she had weathered the point and was safe that brig of yours i must pay you the compliment to say has been very troublesome and my namesake keeps the batteries more upon the alert than ever i could have done said general o'brien i don't believe there is a negro five years old upon the island who does not know your brig we then talked over the attack of the privateer in which we were beaten off ah replied the aide de camp you made a mess of that he has been gone these four months captain carnot swears that he'll fight you if he falls in with you he has kept his word replied i and then i narrated our action with the three french privateers and the capture of the vessel which surprised and i think annoyed them very much well my friend said general o'brien you must stay with me while you are on the island if you want anything let me know i am afraid that i want a surgeon replied i for my side is so painful that i can scarcely breathe are you hurt then said general o'brien with an anxious look not dangerously i believe said i but rather painfully let me see said an officer who stepped forward i am surgeon to the forces here and perhaps you will trust yourself in my hands take off your coat i did so with difficulty you have two ribs broken said he feeling my side and a very severe contusion you must go to bed or lie on a sofa for a few days in a quarter of an hour i will come and dress you and promise you to make you all well in ten days in return for your having given me my daughter who was on board of the victorine with the other ladies the officers now made their bows and left me alone with general o'brien recollect said he that i tell you once for all that my purse and everything is at your command if you do not accept them freely i shall think you do not love us it is not the first time peter and you repaid me honourably however of course i was no party to that affair it was celeste's doing continued he laughing of course i could not imagine that it was you who was dressed up as a woman and so impudently danced through france on stilts but i must hear all your adventures by and bye celeste is most anxious to see you will you go now or wait till after the surgeon comes oh now if you please general may i first beg that some care may be taken of my poor men they have had nothing to eat since yesterday are very much bruised and have worked hard and that a cart may be sent for those who lie on the beach i should have thought of them before replied he and i will also order the same party to bury the other poor fellows who are lying on the beach come now i will take you to celeste chapter forty nine broken ribs not likely to produce broken hearts o'brien makes something like a declaration of peace peter simple actually makes a declaration of love rash proceedings on all sides i followed the general into a handsomely furnished apartment where i found celeste waiting to receive me she ran to me as soon as i entered and with what pleasure did i take her hand and look on her beautiful expressive countenance i could not say a word neither did celeste for a minute i held her hand in mine looking at her the general stood by regarding us alternately he then turned round and walked to the window i lifted the hand to my lips and then released it it appears to be a dream almost said celeste i could not make any reply but continued to gaze upon her she had grown up into such a beautiful creature her figure was perfect and the expression of her countenance was so varied so full of intellect and feeling it was angelic her eyes suffused with tears beamed so softly so kindly on me i could have fallen down and worshipped her come said general o'brien come my dear friend now that you have seen celeste the surgeon must see you the surgeon cried celeste with alarm yes my love it is of no consequence only a couple of ribs broken i followed general o'brien out of the room and as i came to the door i turned round to look at celeste she had retreated to the sofa and her handkerchief was up to her eyes the surgeon was waiting for me he bandaged me and applied some cooling lotion to my side which made me feel quite comfortable i must now leave you said general o'brien you had better lie down for an hour or two and then if i am not back you know your way to celeste i lay down as he requested but as soon as i heard the clatter of the horses hoofs as he rode off i left the room and hurried to the drawing room celeste was there and hastened to inquire if i was much hurt i replied in the negative and told her that i had come down to prove it to her we then sat down on the sofa together i have the misfortune never to appear before you celeste except in a very unprepossessing state when you first saw me i was wounded at our next meeting i was in woman's clothes the last time we met i was covered with dirt and gunpowder and now i return to you wounded and in rags i wonder wether i shall ever appear before you as a gentleman it is not the clothes which make the gentleman peter i am too happy to see you to think of how you are dressed i have never yet thanked you for your kindness to us when we last met my father will never forget it nor have i thanked you celeste for your kindness in dropping the purse into the hat when you met me trying to escape from france i have never forgotten you and since we met the last time you have hardly ever been out of my thoughts you don't know how thankful i am to the hurricane for having blown me into your presence when we cruised in the brig i have often examined the town with my glass trying to fancy that i had my eye upon the house you were in and have felt so happy when we were close in shore because i knew that i was nearer to you and peter i am sure i have often watched the brig and have been so glad to see it come nearer and then so afraid that the batteries would fire at you what a pity it is that my father and you should be opposed to each other we might be so happy and may be yet celeste replied i we conversed for two hours which appeared to be but ten minutes i felt that i was in love but i do not think that celeste had any idea at the time that she was but i leave the reader to judge from the little conversation i have quoted wether she was not or something very much approaching to it the next morning i went out early to look for the brig and to my great delight saw her about six miles off the harbour's mouth standing in for the land she had now got up very respectable jury masts with topgallants for topsails and appeared to be well under command when she was within three miles of the harbour she lowered the jolly boat the only one she had left and it pulled in shore with a flag of truce hoisted at the bows i immediately returned to my room and wrote a detailed account of what had taken place ready to send to o'brien when the boat returned and i of course requested him to send me my effects as i had nothing but what i stood in i had just completed my letter when general o'brien came in my dear friend said he i have just received a flag of truce from captain o'brien requesting to know the fate of his boats' crews and permission to send in return the clothes and effects of the survivors i have written down the whole circumstances for him and made the same request to him replied i and i handed him my letter he read it over and returned it but my dear lad you must think very poorly of us frenchmen if you imagine that we intend to detain you here as a prisoner in the first place your liberation of so many french subjects when you captured the victorine would entitle you to a similar act of kindness and in the next place you have not been fairly captured but by a visitation of providence which by the means of the late storm must destroy all natural antipathies and promote that universal philanthropy between all men which your brave fellows proved that they possess you are therefore free to depart with all your men and we shall still hold ourselves your debtors how is your side to day oh very bad indeed replied i for i could not bear the idea of returning to the brig so soon for i had been obliged to quit celeste very soon after dinner the day before and go to bed i had not yet had much conversation with her nor had i told general o'brien how it was that we escaped from france i don't think i can possibly go on board to day but i feel very grateful to you for your kindness well well replied the general who observed my feelings i do not think it is necessary that you should go on board to day i will send the men and your letter and i will write to captain o'brien to say that you are in bed and will not bear moving until the day after to morrow will that do i thought it but a very short time but i saw that the general looked as if he expected me to consent so i did the boat can come and return again with some of your clothes continued the general and i will tell captain o'brien that if he comes off the mouth of the harbour the day after to morrow i will send you on board in one of our boats he then took my letter and quitted the room as soon as he was gone i found myself quite well enough to go to celeste who waited for me and i told her what had passed that morning i sat with her and the general and narrated all my adventures which amused the general very much i did not conceal the conduct of my uncle and the hopes which i faintly entertained of being able some day or another to discover the fraud which had been practised or how very unfavourable were my future prospects if i did not succeed at this portion of my narrative the general appeared very thoughtful and grave when i had finished it was near dinner time and i found that my clothes had arrived with a letter from o'brien who stated how miserable he had been at the supposition of my loss and his delight at my escape he stated that on going down into the cabin after i had shoved off he by chance cast his eyes on the barometer and to his surprise found that it had fallen two inches which he had been told was the case previous to a hurricane this combined with the peculiar state of the atmosphere had induced him to make every preparation and that they had just completed their work when it came on the brig was thrown on her beam ends and lay there for half an hour when they were forced to cut away the masts to right her that they did not weather the point the next morning by more than half a cable's length and concluded by saying that the idea of my death had made him so unhappy that if it had not been for the sake of the men it was almost a matter of indifference to him whether he had been lost or not he had written to general o'brien thanking him for his kindness and that if fifty vessels should pass the brig he would not capture one of them until i was on board again even if he were dismissed the service for neglect of duty he said that the brig sailed almost as fast under jury masts as she did before and that as soon as i came on board he should go back to barbadoes as for your ribs being so bad peter that's all bother continued he i know that you are making arrangements for another sort of rib as soon as you can manage it but you must stop a little my boy you shall be a lord yet as i always promised you that you should it's a long lane that has no turning so good bye when i was alone with celeste i showed her o'brien's letter i had read the part of it relative to his not intending to make any capture while i was on shore to general o'brien who replied that under such circumstances he thought he should do right to detain me a little longer but said he o'brien is a man of honour and is worthy of his name when celeste came to that part of the letter in which o'brien stated that i was looking after another rib and which i had quite forgotten she asked me to explain it for although she could read and speak english very well she had not been sufficiently accustomed to it to comprehend the play upon words i translated and then said indeed celeste i had forgotten that observation of o'brien's or i should not have shown you the letter but he has stated the truth after all your kindness to me how can i help being in love with you and need i add that i should consider it the greatest blessing which heaven could grant me if you could feel so much regard for me as one day to become my wife don't be angry with me for telling you the truth continued i for celeste coloured up as i spoke to her o no i am not angry with you peter far from it it is very complimentary to me what you have just said i am aware continued i that at present i have little to offer you indeed nothing i am not even such a match as your father might approve of but you know my whole history and what my desires are my dear father loves me peter and he loves you too very much he always did from the hour he saw you he was so pleased with your candour and honesty of character he has often told me so and very often talked of you well celeste tell me may i when far away be permitted to think of you and indulge a hope that some day we may meet never to part again and i took celeste by the hand and put my arm round her waist i don't know what to say replied she i will speak to my father or perhaps you will but i will never marry anybody else if i can help it i drew her close to me and kissed her celeste burst into tears and laid her head upon my shoulder when general o'brien came in i did not attempt to move nor did celeste general said i you may think me to blame but i have not been able to conceal what i feel for celeste you may think that i am imprudent and that i am wrong in thus divulging what i ought to have concealed until i was in a situation to warrant my aspiring to your daughter's hand but the short time allowed me to be in her company the fear of losing her and my devoted attachment will i trust plead my excuse the general took one or two turns up and down the room and then replied what says celeste celeste will never do anything to make her father unhappy replied she going up to him and hiding her face in his breast with her arm round his neck the general kissed his daughter and then said i will be frank with you mr simple i do not know any man whom i would prefer to you as a son in law but there are many considerations which young people are very apt to forget i do not interfere in your attachment which appears to be mutual but at the same time i will have no promise and no engagement you may never meet again however celeste is very young and i shall not put any constraint upon her and at the same time you are equally free if time and circumstances should alter your present feelings i can ask no more my dear sir replied i taking the general by the hand it is candid more than i had any reason to expect i shall now leave you with a contented mind and the hopes of one day claiming celeste shall spur me to exertion now if you please we will drop the subject said the general celeste my dear we have a large party to dinner as you know you had better retire to your room and get ready i have asked all the ladies that you liberated peter and all their husbands and fathers so you will have the pleasure of witnessing how many people you made happy by your gallantry now that celeste has left the room peter i must beg that as a man of honour you do not exact from her any more promises or induce her to tie herself down to you by oaths her attachment to you has grown up with her unaccountably and she is already too fond of you for her peace of mind should accident or circumstances part you for ever let us hope for the best and depend upon it that it shall be no trifling obstacle which will hinder me from seeing you one day united i thanked the general with tears he shook me warmly by the hand as i gave my promise and we separated how happy did i feel when i went into my room and sat down to compose my mind and think over what had happened true at one moment the thought of my dependent situation threw a damp over my joy but in the next i was building castles inventing a discovery of my uncle's plot fancying myself in possession of the title and property and laying it at the feet of my dear celeste hope sustained my spirits and i felt satisfied for the present with the consideration that celeste returned my love i decked myself carefully and went down where i found all the company assembled we had a very pleasant happy party and the ladies entreated general o'brien to detain me as a prisoner very kind of them and i felt very much disposed to join in their request chapter fifty peter simple first takes a command then three west indiamen and twenty prisoners one good turn deserves another the prisoners endeavour to take him but are themselves taken in the next day i was very unhappy the brig was in the offing waiting for me to come on board i pointed her out to celeste as we were at the window and her eyes met mine an hour's conversation could not have said more general o'brien showed that he had perfect confidence in me for he left us together celeste said i i have promised your father i know what has passed interrupted she he told me everything how kind he is but i did not say that i would not bind myself celeste no but my father made me promise that you should not that if you attempted i was immediately to prevent you and so i shall then you shall keep your word celeste imagine everything that can be said in this and i kissed her don't think me forward peter but i wish you to go away happy said celeste and therefore in return imagine all i could say in this and she returned my salute kissing my cheek after this we had a conversation of two hours but what lovers say is very silly except to themselves and the reader need not be troubled with it general o'brien came in and told me the boat was ready i rose up i was satisfied with what had passed and with a firm voice i said good bye celeste god bless you and followed the general who with some of his officers walked down with me to the beach i thanked the general who embraced me paid my adieus to the officers and stepped into the boat in half an hour i was on board of the brig and in o'brien's arms we put the helm up and in a short time the town of st pierre was shut out from my longing sight and we were on our way to barbadoes that day was passed in the cabin with o'brien giving me a minute detail of all that had passed when we anchored once more in carlisle bay we found that the hurricane had been much more extensive in the windward islands than we had imagined several men of war were lying there having lost one or more of their masts and there was great difficulty in supplying the wants of so many as we arrived the last of course we were last served and there being no boats left in store there was no chance of our being ready for sea under two or three months the joan d'arc schooner privateer was still lying there but had not been fitted out for want of men and the admiral proposed to o'brien that he should man her with a part of his ship's company and send one of his lieutenants out to cruise in her this was gladly assented to by o'brien who came on board and asked me whether i should like to have her which i agreed to as i was quite tired of barbadoes and fried flying fish i selected two midshipmen swinburne and twenty men and having taken on board provisions and water for three months i received my written instructions from o'brien and made sail we soon discovered that the masts which the american had sold to the schooner were much too large for her she was considerably overmasted and we were obliged to be very careful i stood for trinidad off which island was to be my cruising ground and in three weeks had recaptured three west indiamen when i found myself so short of hands that i was obliged to return to barbadoes i had put four hands into the first vessel which with the englishmen prisoners were sufficient and three hands into the two others but i was very much embarrassed with my prisoners who amounted to nearly double my ship's company remaining on board both the midshipmen i had sent away and i consulted with swinburne as to what was best to be done why the fact is mr simple captain o'brien ought to have given us more hands twenty men are little enough for a vessel with a boom mainsail like the one we have here and now we have only ten left but i suppose he did not expect us to be so lucky and it's true enough that he has plenty of work for the ship's company now that he has to turn everything in afresh as for the prisoners i think we had better run close in and give them two of our boats to take them on shore at all events we must be rid of them and not be obliged to have one eye aloft and the other down the hatchway as we must now this advice corresponded with my own ideas and i ran in shore gave them the stern boat and one of the larger ones which held them all and sent them away leaving only one boat for the schooner which was hoisted up on the starboard chess tree it fell a dead calm as we sent away the prisoners we saw them land and disappear over the rocks and thought ourselves well rid of them as they were twenty two in number most of them spaniards and very stout ferocious looking fellows it continued calm during the whole day much to our annoyance as i was very anxious to get away as soon as i could still i could not help admiring the beauty of the scenery the lofty mountains rising abruptly from the ocean and towering in the clouds reflecting on the smooth water as clear as in a looking glass every colour every tint beautifully distinct the schooner gradually drifted close in shore and we could perceive the rocks at the bottom many fathoms deep not a breath of wind was to be seen on the surface of the water for several miles round although the horizon in the offing showed that there was a smart breeze outside night came on and we still lay becalmed i gave my orders to swinburne who had the first watch and retired to my standing bed place in the cabin i was dreaming and i hardly need say who was the object of my visions i thought i was in eagle park sitting down with her under one of the large chestnut trees which formed the avenue when i felt my shoulder roughly pushed i started up what is the matter who's that swinburne yes sir on with your clothes immediately as we have work on hand i expect and swinburne left the cabin immediately i heard him calling the other men who were below i knew that swinburne would not give a false alarm in a minute i was on deck where i found he had just arrived and was looking at the stern of the schooner what is that swinburne said i silence sir hark don't you hear them yes replied i the sound of oars exactly sir depend upon it those spaniards have got more help and are coming back to take the vessel they know we have only ten hands on board by this time the men were all on deck i directed swinburne to see all the muskets loaded and ran down for my own sword and pistols the water was so smooth and the silence so profound that swinburne had heard the sound of the oars at a considerable distance fortunate it was that i had such a trusty follower another might have slumbered and the schooner have been boarded and captured without our being prepared when i came on deck again i spoke to the men exhorted them to do their duty and pointed out to them that these cut throat villains would certainly murder us all if we were taken which i firmly believe would have been the case the men declared that they would sell their lives as dearly as they could we had twenty muskets and the same number of pistols all of which were now loaded our guns were also ready but of no use now that the schooner had not steerage way the boats were in sight about a quarter of a mile astern when swinburne said there's a cat's paw flying along the water mr simple if we could only have a little wind how we would laugh at them but i'm afraid there's no such luck shall we let them know that we are ready let every one of us take two muskets said i when the first boat is under the counter take good aim and discharge into one of the boats then seize the other musket and discharge it at the other boat after that we must trust to our cutlasses and pistols for if they come on there will be no time to load again keep silence all of you the boats now came up full of men but as we remained perfectly quiet they pulled up gently hoping to surprise us fortunately one was a little in advance of the other upon which i altered my directions and desired my men to fire their second musket upon the first boat as if we could disable her we were an equal match for those in the other when the boat was within six yards of the schooner's counter now said i and all the muskets were discharged at once and my men cheered several of the oars dropped and i was sure we had done great execution but they were laid hold of by the other men who had not been pulling and again the boat advanced to the counter good aim my lads this time cried swinburne the other boat will be alongside as soon as you have fired mr simple the schooner has headway and there's a strong breeze coming up again we discharged our ten muskets into the boat but this time we waited until the bowman had hooked on the planeshear with his boat hook and our fire was very effective i was surprised to find that the other boat was not on board of us but a light breeze had come up and the schooner glided through the water still she was close under our counter and would have been aboard in a minute in the meantime the spaniards who were in the first boat were climbing up the side and were repulsed by my men with great success the breeze freshened and swinburne ran to the helm i perceived the schooner was going fast through the water and the second boat could hardly hold her own i ran to where the boat hook was fixed on the planeshear and unhooked it the boat fell astern leaving two spaniards clinging to the side who were cut down and they fell into the water hurrah all safe cried swinburne and now to punish them the schooner was now darting along at the rate of five miles with an increasing breeze we stood in for two minutes then tacked and ran for the boats swinburne steered and i continued standing in the bows surrounded by the rest of the men starboard a little swinburne starboard it is steady steady i see the first boat she is close under our bows steady port port port a little port look out my lads and cut down all who climb up crash went the schooner on to the boat the men in her in vain endeavouring to escape us for a second or two she appeared to right until her further gunwale was borne down under the water she turned up and the schooner went over her sending every soul in her to their account one man clung on to a rope and was towed for a few seconds but a cutlass divided the rope at the gunwale and with a faint shriek he disappeared the other boat was close to us and perceived what had been done they remained with their oars poised all ready to pull so as to evade the schooner we steered for her and the schooner was now running at the rate of seven miles an hour when close under our bows by very dexterously pulling short round with their starboard oars we only struck her with our bow and before she went down many of the spaniards had gained the deck or were clinging to the side of the vessel they fought with desperation but we were too strong for them it was only those who had gained the deck which we had to contend with the others clung for a time and unable to get up the sides one by one dropped into the water and went astern in a minute those on deck were lying at our feet and in a minute more they were tossed overboard after their companions not however until one of them struck me through the calf of the leg with his knife as we were lifting him over the gunwale i do not mean to say that the spaniards were not justified in attempting to take the schooner but still as we had liberated them but a few hours before we felt that it was unhandsome and treacherous on their part and therefore showed them no quarter there were two of my men wounded as well as myself but not severely which was fortunate as we had no surgeon on board and only about half a yard of diachylum plaster in the vessel well out of that sir said swinburne as i limped aft by the lord harry it might have been a pretty go having shaped our course for barbadoes i dressed my leg and went down to sleep this time i did not dream of celeste but fought the spaniard over again thought i was wounded and awoke with the pain of my leg chapter fifty one peter turned out of his command by his vessel turning bottom up a cruise on a main boom with sharks en attendant self and crew with several flying fish taken on board a negro boat peter regenerates by putting on a new outward man we made barbadoes without any further adventure and were about ten miles off the bay steering with a very light breeze and i went down into the cabin expecting to be at anchor before breakfast the next morning it was just daylight when i found myself thrown out of my bed place on the deck on the other side of the cabin and heard the rushing of water i sprang up i knew the schooner was on her beam ends and gained the deck i was correct in my supposition she had been upset by what is called a white squall and in two minutes would be down all the men were up on deck some dressed others like myself in their shirts swinburne was aft he had an axe in his hand cutting away the rigging of the main boom i saw what he was about i seized another and disengaged the jaw rope and small gear about the mast we had no other chance our boat was under the water being hoisted up on the side to leeward all this however was but the work of two minutes and i could not help observing by what trifles lives are lost or saved had the axe not been fortunately at the capstan i should not have been able to cut the jaw rope swinburne would not have had time and the main boom would have gone down with the schooner fortunately we had cleared it the schooner filled righted a little and then sank dragging us and the main boom for a few seconds down in its vortex and then we rose to the surface the squall still continued but the water was smooth it soon passed over and again it was nearly calm i counted the men clinging to the boom and found that they were all there swinburne was next to me he was holding with one hand while with the other he felt in his pocket for his quid of tobacco which he thrust into his cheek i wasn't on deck at the time mr simple said he or this wouldn't have happened i had just been relieved and i told collins to look out sharp for squalls i only mention it that if you are saved and i am not you mayn't think i was neglectful of my duty we ain't far from the land but still we are more likely to fall in with a shark than a friend i'm thinking this indeed had been my thoughts but i had concealed them but after swinburne had mentioned the shark i very often looked along the water for their fins and down below to see if they were coming up to tear us to pieces it was a dreadful feeling it was not your fault swinburne i am sure i ought to have relieved you myself but i kept the first watch and was tired we must put our trust in god perhaps we may yet be spared it was now almost calm and the sun had mounted in the heavens the scorching rays were intolerable upon our heads for we had not the defence of hats i felt my brain on fire and was inclined to drop into the water to screen myself from the intolerable heat as the day advanced so did our sufferings increase it was a dead calm the sun perpendicular over us actually burning that part of our bodies which rose clear of the water i could have welcomed even a shark to relieve me of my torment but i thought of celeste and i clung to life towards the afternoon i felt sick and dizzy my resolution failed me my vision was imperfect but i was roused by swinburne who cried out a boat by all that's gracious hang on a little longer my men and you are saved it was a boat full of negroes who had come out to catch flying fish they had perceived the spar on the water and hastened to secure the prize they dragged us all in gave us water which appeared like nectar and restored us to our fleeting senses they made fast the boom and towed it in shore we had not been ten minutes on our way when swinburne pointed to the fin of a large shark above the water look there mr simple i shuddered and made no answer but i thanked god in my heart in two hours we were landed but were too ill to walk we were carried up to the hospital bled and put into cots i had a brain fever which lasted six or seven days during which o'brien never left my bedside my head was shaved all the skin came off my face like a mask as well as off my back and shoulders we were put into baths of brandy and water and in three weeks were all recovered that was but an unlucky schooner from beginning to end observed o'brien after i had narrated the events of my cruise we had a bad beginning with her and we had a bad ending she's gone to the bottom and the devil go with her however all's well that ends well and peter you're worth a dozen dead men yet but you occasion me a great deal of trouble and anxiety that's the truth of it and i doubt if i shall ever rear you after all i returned to my duty on board of the brig which was now nearly ready for sea one morning o'brien came on board and said peter i've a piece of news for you our gunner is appointed to the araxes and the admiral has given me a gunner's warrant for old swinburne send for him on deck swinburne was summoned and came rolling up the hatchway swinburne said o'brien you have done your duty well and you are now gunner of the rattlesnake here is your warrant and i've great pleasure in getting it for you swinburne turned the quid in his cheek and then replied may i be so bold as to ax captain o'brien whether i must wear one of them long tog swallow tailed coats because if so i'd prefer being a quarter master a gunner may wear a jacket swinburne if he likes when you go on shore you may bend the swallow tail if you please well sir then if that's the case i'll take the warrant because i know it will please the old woman so saying swinburne hitched up his trowsers and went down below i may here observe that swinburne kept to his round jacket until our arrival in england when the old woman his wife who thought her dignity at stake soon made him ship the swallow tail and after it was once on swinburne took a fancy to it himself and always wore it except when he was at sea the same evening as i was coming with o'brien from the governor's house where i had dined we passed a building lighted up what can that be observed o'brien not a dignity ball there is no music our curiosity induced us to enter and we found it to be fitted up as a temporary chapel filled with black and coloured people who were ranged on the forms and waiting for the preacher it is a methodist meeting said i to o'brien never mind said he let us hear what is going on in a moment afterwards the pulpit was filled not by a white man as we had anticipated but by a tall negro he was dressed in black and his hair which it was impossible to comb down straight was plaited into fifty little tails with lead tied at the end of them like you sometimes see the mane of a horse this produced a somewhat more clerical appearance his throat was open and collar laid back the wristbands of his shirt very large and white and he flourished a white cambric handkerchief what a dandy he is whispered o'brien i thought it almost too absurd when he said he would take the liberty to praise god in the th hymn and beg all the company to join chorus he then gave out the stanzas in the most strange pronunciation gentle jesus god um lub etc when the hymn was finished which was sung by the whole congregation in most delightful discord for every one chose his own key he gave an extempore prayer which was most unfortunately incomprehensible and then commenced his discourse which was on faith i shall omit the head and front of his offending which would perhaps hardly be gratifying although ludicrous he reminded me of a monkey imitating a man but what amused me most was his finale in which he told his audience that there could be no faith without charity for a little while he descanted upon this generally and at last became personal his words were as well as i can recollect nearly as follows and now you see my dear bredren how unpossible to go to heaven with all the faith in the world without charity charity mean give away suppose you no give you no ab charity suppose you no ab charity you no ab faith suppose you no ab faith you all go to hell and be damned now den let me see if you ab charity here you see i come to save all your soul from hell fire and hell fire dam hot i

one roaring lion seeking what he may lay hold off and cram into his dam fiery jaw that will do peter said o'brien we have the cream of it i think we left the house and walked down to the boat surely o'brien said i this should not be permitted he's no worse than his neighbours replied o'brien and perhaps does less harm i admired the rascal's ingenuity he gave his flock what in ireland we should call a pretty broad hint yes there was no mistaking him but is he a licensed preacher very little license in his preaching i take it no i suppose he has had a call a call what do you mean i mean that he wants to fill his belly hunger is a call of nature peter he seems to want a good many things if we were to judge by his catalogue what a pity it is that these poor people are not better instructed that they never will be peter while there is what may be called free trade in religion you speak like a catholic o'brien i am one replied he and here our conversation ended for we were close to the boat which was waiting for us on the beach the next day a man of war brig arrived from england bringing letters for the squadron on the station i had two from my sister ellen which made me very uncomfortable she stated that my father had seen my uncle lord privilege and had had high words with him indeed as far as she could ascertain of the facts my father had struck my uncle and had been turned out of the house by the servants that he had returned in a state of great excitement and had been ill ever since that there was a great deal of talk in the neighbourhood on the subject people generally highly blaming my father's conduct and thinking that he was deranged in his intellect a supposition very much encouraged by my uncle she again expressed her hopes of my speedy return i had now been absent nearly three years and she had been so uncomfortable that she felt as if it had been at least ten o'brien also received a letter from father mcgrath which i shall lay before the reader my dear son long life and all the blessings of all the saints be upon you now and for evermore amen and may you live to be married and may i dance at your wedding and may you never want children and may they grow up as handsome as their father and their mother whoever she may hereafter be and may you die of a good old age and in the true faith and be waked handsomely as your own father was last friday s'ennight seeing as how he took it into his head to leave this world for a better it was a very dacent funeral procession my dear terence and your father must have been delighted to see himself so well attinded no man ever made a more handsome corpse considering how old and thin and haggard he had grown of late and how grey his hair had turned he held the nosegay between his fingers across his breast as natural as life and reminded us all of the blessed saint pope gregory who was called to glory some hundred years before either you or i was born your mother's quite comfortable and there she sits in the ould chair rocking to and fro all day long and never speaking a word to nobody thinking about heaven i dare to say which is just what she ought to do seeing that she stands a very pretty chance of going there in the course of a month or so divil a word has she ever said since your father's departure but then she screamed and yelled enough to last for seven years at the least she screamed away all her senses any how for she has done nothing since but cough cough and fumble at her pater nosters a very blessed way to pass the remainder of her days seeing that i expect her to drop every minute like an over ripe sleepy pear so don't think any more about her my son for without you are back in a jiffy her body will be laid in consecrated ground and her happy blessed soul in purgatory pax vobiscum amen amen and now having disposed of your father and your mother so much to your satisfaction i'll just tell you that ella's mother died in the convent at dieppe but whether she kept her secret or not i do not know but this i do know that if she didn't relieve her soul by confession she's damned to all eternity thanks be to god for all his mercies amen ella flanagan is still alive and for a nun is as well as can be expected i find that she knows nothing at all about the matter of the exchanging the genders of the babbies only that her mother was on oath to father o'toole who ought to be hanged drawn and quartered instead of those poor fellows whom the government called rebels but who were no more rebels than father mcgrath himself who'll uphold the pretender as they call our true catholic king as long as there's life in his body or a drop of whisky left in ould ireland to drink his health wid talking about father o'toole puts me in mind that the bishop has not yet decided our little bit of dispute saying that he must take time to think about it now considering that it's just three years since the row took place the old gentleman must be a very slow thinker not to have found out by this time that i was in the right and that father o'toole the baste is not good enough to be hanged your two married sisters are steady and diligent young women having each made three children since you last saw them fine boys every mother's son of them with elegant spacious features and famous mouths for taking in whole potatoes by the powers but the effects of the tree of the o'briens begin to make a noise in the land anyhow as you would say if you only heard them roaring for their bit of suppers and now my dear son terence to the real purport of this letter which is just to put to your soul's conscience as a dutiful son whether you ought not to send me a small matter of money to save your poor father's soul from pain and anguish for it's no joke that being in purgatory i can tell you and you wouldn't care how soon you were tripped out of it yourself i only wish you had but your little toe in it and then you'd burn with impatience to have it out again but you're a dutiful son so i'll say no more about it a nod's as good as a wink to a blind horse when your mother goes which with the blessing of god will be in a very little while seeing that she has only to follow her senses which are gone already i'll take upon myself to sell everything as worldly goods and chattels are of no use to dead people and i have no doubt but that what with the furniture and the two cows and the pigs and the crops in the ground there will be enough to save her soul from the flames and bury her dacently into the bargain however as you are the heir at law seeing that the property is all your own i'll keep a debtor and creditor account of the whole and should there be any over i'll use it all out in masses so as to send her up to heaven by express and if there's not sufficient she must remain where she is till you come back and make up the deficiency in the meanwhile i am your loving father in faith urtagh mcgrath chapter fifty two good sense in swinburne no man a hero to his valet de chambre or a prophet in his own country o'brien takes a step by strategy o'brien parts with his friend and peter's star is no longer in the ascendant o'brien was sorry for the death of his father but he could not feel as most people would have done as his father had certainly never been a father to him he was sent to sea to be got rid of and ever since he had been there had been the chief support of his family his father was very fond of whisky and not very fond of exertion he was too proud of the true milesian blood in his veins to do anything to support himself but not too proud to live upon his son's hard earned gains for his mother o'brien felt very much she had always been kind and affectionate and was very fond of him sailors however are so estranged from their families when they have been long in their profession and so accustomed to vicissitudes that no grief for the loss of a relation lasts very long and in a week o'brien had recovered his usual spirits when a vessel brought us the intelligence that a french squadron had been seen off st domingo this put us all on the qui vive o'brien was sent for by the admiral and ordered to hasten his brig for sea with all possible despatch as he was to proceed with despatches to england forthwith in three days we were reported ready received our orders and at eight o'clock in the evening made sail from carlisle bay well mr swinburne said i how do you like your new situation why mr simple i like it well enough and it's not disagreeable to be an officer and sit in your own cabin but still i feel that i should get on better if i were in another ship i've been hail fellow well met with the ship's company so long that i can't top the officer over them and we can't get the duty done as smart as i could wish and then at night i find it very lonely stuck up in my cabin like a parson's clerk and nobody to talk to for the other warrants are particular and say that i'm only acting and may not be confirmed so they hold aloof i don't much like being answerable for all that lot of gunpowder it's queer stuff to handle very true swinburne but still if there were no responsibility we should require no officers you recollect that you are now provided for for life and will have half pay that's what made me bite mr simple i thought of the old woman and how comfortable it would make her in her old age and so d'ye see i sacrificed myself how long have you been married swinburne ever since christmas ' i wasn't going to be hook'd carelessly so i nibbled afore i took the bait had four years' trial of her first and finding that she had plenty of ballast i sailed her as my own how do you mean by plenty of ballast i don't mean mr simple a broad bow and square hulk you know very well that if a vessel has not ballast she's bottom up in no time now what keeps a woman stiff under her canvas is her modesty very true swinburne but it's a rare commodity on the beach and why mr simple because liquor is more valued many a good man has found it to be his bane and as for a woman when once she takes to it she's like a ship without a rudder and goes right before the wind to the devil not that i think a man ought not to take a nor wester or two when he can get them rum was not given by god almighty only to make the niggers dance but to make all our hearts glad neither do i see why a woman is to stand out neither what's good for jack can't hurt poll only there is a medium as they say in all things and half and half is quite strong enough i should think it was replied i laughing but don't be letting me prevent you from keeping a look out mr simple you hoskins you're half a point off the wind luff you may i think mr simple that captain o'brien didn't pick out the best man when he made tom alsop a quarter master in my place why he is a very steady good man swinburne yes so he is but he has natural defects which shouldn't be overlooked i was not aware of that no but i was alsop wants to sarve out his time for his pension and when he has sarved you see if when the surgeons examine him they don't invalid him as blind as a bat i should like to have him as gunner's mate and that's just what he's fit for but mr simple i think we shall have some bad weather the moon looks greasy and the stars want snuffing you'll have two reefs in the topsails afore morning there's five bells striking now i'll turn in if i didn't keep half the first and half the morning watch i shouldn't sleep all the night i miss my regular watch very much mr simple habit's every thing and i don't much fancy a standing bed place it's so large and i feel so cold of my sides nothing like a hammock after all good night mr simple good night swinburne our orders were to proceed with all possible despatch and o'brien carried on day and night generally remaining up himself till one or two o'clock in the morning we had very favourable weather and in a little more than a month we passed the lizard the wind being fair we passed plymouth ran up channel and anchored at spithead after calling upon the admiral o'brien set off for town with his despatches and left me in command of the ship in three days i received a letter from him informing me that he had seen the first lord who had asked him a great many questions concerning the station he had quitted that he had also complimented o'brien on his services on that hint i spake continued o'brien i ventured to insinuate to his lordship that i had hoped that i had earned my promotion and as there is nothing like quartering on the enemy i observed that i had not applied to lord privilege as i considered my services would have been sufficient without any application on his part his lordship returned a very gracious answer said that my lord privilege was a great ally of his and very friendly to the government and inquired when i was going to see him i replied that i certainly should not pay my respects to his lordship at present unless there was occasion for it as i must take a more favourable opportunity so i hope that good may come from the great lord's error which of course i shall not correct as i feel i deserve my promotion and you know peter if you can't gain it by hook you must by crook he then concluded his letter but there was a postscript as follows wish me joy my dear peter i have this moment received a letter from the private secretary to say that i am posted and appointed to the semiramis frigate about to set sail for the east indies she is all ready to start and now i must try and get you with me of which i have no doubt as although her officers have been long appointed there will be little difficulty of success when i mention your relationship to lord privilege and while they remain in error as to his taking an interest in my behalf i sincerely rejoiced at o'brien's good fortune his promotion i had considered certain as his services had entitled him to it but the command of so fine a frigate must have been given upon the supposition that it would be agreeable to my uncle who was not only a prime supporter but a very useful member of the tory government i could not help laughing to myself at the idea of o'brien obtaining his wishes from the influence of a person who probably detested him as much as one man could detest another and i impatiently waited for o'brien's next letter by which i hoped to find myself appointed to the semiramis but a sad contre temps took place o'brien did not write but came down two days afterwards hastened on board the semiramis read his commission and assumed the command before even he had seen me he then sent his gig on board of the rattlesnake to desire me to come to him directly i did so and we went down into the cabin of the frigate peter said he i was obliged to hasten down and read myself captain of this ship as i am in fear that things are not going on well i had called to pay my respects at the admiralty previous to joining and was kicking my heels in the waiting room when who should walk up the passage as if he were a captain on his own quarter deck but your uncle lord privilege his eye met mine he recognised me immediately and if it did not flash fire it did something very like it he asked a few questions of one of the porters and was giving his card when my name was called for i passed him and up i went to the first lord thanked him for the frigate and having received a great many compliments upon my exertions on the west india station made my bow and retired i had intended to have requested your appointment but i knew that your name would bring up lord privilege's and moreover your uncle's card was brought up and laid upon the table while i was sitting there the first lord i presume thought that his lordship was come to thank him for his kindness to me which only made him more civil i made my bow and went down and met the eye of lord privilege who looked daggers at me as he walked upstairs for of course he was admitted immediately after my audience was finished instead of waiting to hear the result of the explanation i took a post chaise and have come down here as fast as four horses can bring me and have read myself in for peter i feel sure that if not on board my commission will be cancelled and i know that if once in command as i am now i can call for a court martial to clear my character if i am superseded i know that the admiralty can do anything but still they will be cautious in departing from the rules of the service to please even lord privilege i looked up at the sky as soon as i left the admiralty portico and was glad to see that the weather was so thick and the telegraph not at work or i might have been too late now i'll go on shore and report myself to the admiral as having taken the command of the semiramis o'brien went on shore to report himself was well received by the admiral who informed him that if he had any arrangements to make he could not be too soon as he should not be surprised if his sailing orders came down the next morning this was very annoying as i could not see how i should be able to join o'brien's ship even if i could effect an exchange in so short a time i therefore hastened on board of the semiramis and applied to the officers to know if any of them were willing to exchange into the rattlesnake but although they did not much like going to the east indies they would not exchange into a brig and i returned disappointed the next morning the admiral sent for o'brien and told him confidentially for he was the same admiral who had received o'brien when he escaped from prison with me and was very kind to him that there was some hitch about his having the semiramis and that orders had come down to pay her off all standing and examine her bottom if captain o'brien had not joined her do you understand what this means said the admiral who was anxious to know the reason o'brien answered frankly that lord privilege by whose interest he had obtained his former command was displeased with him and that as he saw him go up to the first lord after his own audience he had no doubt but that his lordship had said something to his disadvantage as he was a very vindictive man well said the admiral it's lucky that you have taken the command as they cannot well displace you or send her into dock without a survey and upon your representation and so it proved the first lord when he found that o'brien had joined took no further steps but allowed the frigate to proceed to her intended destination but all chance of my sailing with him was done away and now for the first time i had to part with o'brien i remained with him the whole time that i could be spared from my duties o'brien was very much annoyed but there was no help never mind peter said he i've been thinking that perhaps it's all for the best you will see more of the world and be no longer in leading strings you are now a fine man grown up big enough and ugly enough as they say to take care of yourself we shall meet again and if we don't why then god bless you my boy and don't forget o'brien three days afterwards o'brien's orders came down i accompanied him on board and it was not until the ship was under weigh and running towards the needles with a fair wind that i shook hands with him and shoved off parting with o'brien was a heavy blow to me but i little knew how much i was to suffer before i saw him again chapter fifty three i am pleased with my new captain obtain leave to go home find my father afflicted with a very strange disease and prove myself a very good doctor although the disorder always breaks out in a fresh place the day after o'brien had sailed for the east indies the dock yard men came on board to survey the brig and she was found so defective as to be ordered into dock i had received letters from my sister who was overjoyed at the intelligence of my safe return and the anticipation of seeing me the accounts of my father were however very unsatisfactory my sister wrote that disappointment and anxiety had had such an effect upon him that he was deranged in his intellect our new captain came down to join us he was a very young man and had never before commanded a ship his character as lieutenant was well known and not very satisfactory being that of a harsh unpleasant officer but as he had never been first lieutenant it was impossible to say what he might prove when in command of a ship still we were a little anxious about it and severely regretted the loss of o'brien he came on board the hulk to which the ship's company had been turned over and read his commission he proved to be all affability condescension and good nature to me he was particularly polite stating that he should not interfere with me in carrying on the duty as i must be so well acquainted with the ship's company we thought that those who gave us the information must have been prejudiced or mistaken in his character during the half hour that he remained on board i stated that now that the brig was in dock i should like very much to have an opportunity of seeing my friends if he would sanction my asking for leave to this he cheerfully consented adding that he would extend it upon his own responsibility my letter to the admiralty was therefore forwarded through him and was answered in the affirmative the day afterwards i set off by the coach and once more embraced my dear sister after the first congratulations were over i inquired about my father she replied that he was so wild that nobody could manage him that he was melancholy and irritable at the same time and was certainly deranged fancying himself to be made of various substances or to be in a certain trade or capacity that he generally remained in this way four or five days when he went to bed and slept for twenty four hours or more and awoke with some new strange imagination in his head his language was violent but that in other respects he seemed to be more afraid of other people than inclined to be mischievous and that every day he was getting more strange and ridiculous he had now just risen from one of his long naps and was in his study that before he had fallen asleep he had fancied himself to be a carpenter and had sawed and chopped up several articles of furniture in the house i quitted my sister to see my father whom i found in his easy chair i was much shocked at his appearance he was thin and haggard his eyes were wild and he remained with his mouth constantly open a sick nurse who had been hired by my sister was standing by him pish pish pish pish cried my father what can you a stupid old woman know about my inside i tell you the gas is generating fast and even now i can hardly keep on my chair i'm lifting lifting now and if you don't tie me down with cords i shall go up like a balloon indeed sir replied the woman it's only the wind in your stomach you'll break it off directly it's inflammable gas you old hecate i know it is tell me will you get a cord or will you not hah who's that peter why you've dropped from the clouds just in time to see me mount up to them i hope you feel yourself better sir said i i fell myself a great deal lighter every minute get a cord peter and tie me to the leg of the table i tried to persuade him that he was under a mistake but it was useless he became excessively violent and said i wished him in heaven as i had heard that it was better to humour people afflicted with hypochondriacism which was evidently the disease under which my father laboured i tried that method it appears to me sir said i that if we could remove the gas every ten minutes it would be a very good plan yes but how replied he shaking his head mournfully why with a syringe sir said i which will if empty of course draw out the gas when inserted into your mouth my dear peter you have saved my life replied my father be quick though or i shall go up right through the ceiling fortunately there was an instrument of that description in the house i applied it to his mouth drew up the piston and then ejected the air and re applied it in two minutes he pronounced himself better and i left the old nurse hard at work and my father very considerably pacified i returned to my sister to whom i recounted what had passed but it was no source of mirth to us although had it happened to an indifferent person i might have been amused the idea of leaving her as i must soon do having only a fortnight's leave to be worried by my father's unfortunate malady was very distressing but we entered into a long conversation in which i recounted the adventures that had taken place since i had left her and for the time forgot our source of annoyance and regret for three days my father insisted upon the old woman pumping the gas out of his body after that he again fell into one of his sound sleeps which lasted nearly thirty hours when he arose i went again to see him it was eight o'clock in the evening and i entered with a candle take it away quick take it away put it out carefully why what's the matter sir don't come near me if you love me don't come near me put it out i say put it out i obeyed his orders and then asked him the reason reason said he now that we were in the dark can't you see no father i can see nothing in the dark well then peter i'm a magazine full of gun powder the least spark in the world and i am blown up consider the danger you surely would not be the destruction of your father peter and the poor old gentleman burst into tears and wept like a child i knew that it was in vain to reason with him my dear father said i on board ship when there is any danger of this kind we always float the magazine now if you were to drink a good deal of water the powder would be spoiled and there would be no danger my father was satisfied with my proposal and drank a tumbler of water every half hour which the old nurse was obliged to supply as fast as he called for it and this satisfied him for three or four days and i was again left to the company of my dear ellen when my father again fell into his stupor and we wondered what would be his next fancy i was hastily summoned by the nurse and found my poor father lying in bed and breathing in a very strange manner what is the matter my dear sir inquired i why don't you see what is the matter how is a poor little infant just born to live unless its mother is near to suckle it and take care of it indeed sir do you mean to say that you are just born to be sure i do i'm dying for the breast this was almost too absurd but i gravely observed that it was all very true but unfortunately his mother had died in child birth and that the only remedy was to bring him up by hand he agreed with me i desired the nurse to make some gruel with brandy and feed him which she did and he took the gruel just as if he were a baby this fit lasted about six days for he went to sleep because a baby always slept much and i was in hopes it would last much longer but he again went off into his lethargic fit and after a long sleep awoke with a new fancy my time had nearly expired and i had written to my new captain requesting an extension of leave but i received an answer stating that it could not be granted and requesting me to join the brig immediately i was rather surprised at this but of course was compelled to obey and embracing my dear sister once more set off for portsmouth i advised her to humour my father and this advice she followed but his fancies were such occasionally as would have puzzled the most inventive genius to combat or to find the remedy which he might acknowledge to be requisite his health became certainly worse and worse and his constitution was evidently destroyed by a slow undermining bodily and mental fever the situation of my poor sister was very distressing and i must say that i quitted her with melancholy forebodings i ought here to observe that i received all my prize money amounting to pounds a large sum for a lieutenant i put it into the funds and gave a power of attorney to ellen requesting her to use it as her own we consulted as to what she should do if my father should die and agreed that all his debts which we knew to amount to three or four hundred pounds should be paid and that she should manage how she could upon what was left of my father's property and the interest of my prize money chapter fifty four we receive our sailing orders and orders of every description a quarter deck conversation listeners never hear any good of themselves when i arrived at portsmouth i reported myself to the captain who lived at the hotel i was ushered into his room to wait for him as he was dressing to dine with the admiral my eyes naturally turned to what lay on the table merely from the feeling which one has to pass away the time not from curiosity and i was much surprised to see a pile of letters the uppermost of which was franked by lord privilege this however might be merely accidental but my curiosity was excited and i lifted up the letter and found that the second the third and indeed at least ten of them were franked by my uncle i could not imagine how there could be any intimacy between him and my uncle and was reflecting upon it when captain hawkins for that was his name entered the room he was very kind and civil apologised for not being able to extend my leave which he said was because he had consulted the admiral who would not sanction the absence of the first lieutenant and had very peremptorily desired he would recall me immediately i was satisfied he shook my hand and we parted on my arrival on board the hulk for the brig was still in dock i was warmly received by my messmates they told me that the captain had generally speaking been very civil but that occasionally the marks of the cloven foot appeared webster said i to the second lieutenant do you know anything about his family or connections it is a question i have asked of those who have sailed with him and they all say that he never speaks of his own family but very often boasts of his intimacy with the nobility some say that he is a bye blow of some great man i reflected very much upon this and connecting it with the numerous franks of lord privilege which i saw on the table had my misgivings but then i knew that i could do my duty and had no reason to fear any man i resolved in my own mind to be very correct and put it out of the power of any one to lay hold of me and then dismissed the subject the brig was repaired and out of dock and for some days i was very busy getting her ready for sea i never quitted her in fact i had no wish i never had any taste for bad company and midnight orgies and i had no acquaintance with the respectable portion of the inhabitants of portsmouth at last the ship's company were removed into the brig we went out of the harbour and anchored at spithead captain hawkins came on board and gave me an order book saying mr simple i have a great objection to written orders as i consider that the articles of war are quite sufficient to regulate any ship still a captain is in a very responsible situation and if any accident occurs he is held amenable i therefore have framed a few orders of my own for the interior discipline of the vessel which may probably save me harmless in case of being hauled over the coals but not with any wish that they should interfere with the comforts of the officers only to guard against any mischance of which the onus may fall upon myself i received the order book and the captain went ashore when i went down into the gun room to look through it i at once perceived that if rigidly conformed to every officer in the ship would be rendered uncomfortable and if not conformed to i should be the party that was answerable i showed it to webster who agreed with me and gave it as his opinion that the captain's good nature and amiability were all a blind and that he was intending to lay hold of us as soon as it was in his power i therefore called all the officers together and told them my opinion webster supported me and it was unanimously agreed that the orders should be obeyed although not without remonstrance the major part of the orders however only referred to the time that the brig was in harbour and as we were about to proceed to sea it was hardly worth while saying anything at present the orders for the sailing of the brig came down and by the same post i received a letter from my sister ellen stating that they had heard from captain fielding who had immediately written to bombay where the regiment was stationed and had received an answer informing him that there was no married man in the regiment of the name of sullivan and no woman who had followed that regiment of that name this at once put an end to all our researches after the wet nurse who had been confined in my uncle's house where she had been sent it was of course impossible to say but i gave up all chance of discovering my uncle's treachery and as i thought of celeste sighed at the little hope i had of ever being united to her i wrote a long letter to o'brien and the next day we sailed for our station in the north sea the captain added a night order book to the other and sent it up every evening to be returned in the morning with the signature of every officer of the night watches he also required all our signatures to his general order book that we might not say we had not read them i had the first watch when swinburne came up to me well mr simple i do not think we have made much by our exchange of captains and i have a shrewd suspicion we shall have squalls ere long we must not judge too hastily swinburne replied i no no i don't say that we should but still one must go a little by looks in the world and i'm sure his looks wouldn't help him much he is just like a winter's day short and dirty and he walks the decks as if plank were not good enough for his feet mr william says he looks as if he were big with the fate of cato and of rome' what that means i don't know some joke i suppose for the youngsters are always joking were you ever up the baltic mr simple now i think of it i know you never were i've seen some tight work up there with the gun boats and so we should now with captain o'brien but as for this little man i've an idea 'twill be more talk than work you appear to have taken a great dislike to the captain swinburne i do not know whether as first lieutenant i ought to listen to you it's because you're first lieutenant that i tell it you mr simple i never was mistaken in the main of an officer's character when i could look him in the face and hear him talk for half an hour and i came up on purpose to put you on your guard for i feel convinced that towards you he means mischief what does he mean by having the greasy faced sergeant of marines in his cabin for half an hour every morning his reports as master of arms ought to come through you as first lieutenant but he means him as a spy upon all and upon you in particular the fellow has began to give himself airs already and speaks to the young gentlemen as if they were beneath him i thought you might not know it mr simple so i thought it right to tell you i am much obliged to you swinburne for your good wishes but i can do my duty and why should i fear anything a man may do his duty mr simple but if a captain is determined to ruin him he has the power i have been longer in the service than you have and have been wide awake only be careful of one thing mr simple i beg your pardon for being so free but in no case lose your temper no fear of that swinburne replied i it's very easy to say no fear of that' mr simple but recollect you have not yet had your temper tried as some officers have you have always been treated like a gentleman but should you find yourself treated otherwise you have too good blood in your veins not to speak i am sure of that i've seen officers insulted and irritated till no angel could put up with the treatment and then for an unguarded word which they would have been swabs not to have made use of sent out of the service to the devil but you forget swinburne that the articles of war are made for the captain as well as for everybody else in the ship i know that but still at court martials captains make a great distinction between what a superior says to an inferior and what an inferior says to a superior true replied i quoting shakespeare that's in the captain but a choleric word which in the soldier is rank blasphemy' exactly my meaning i rather think said swinburne if a captain calls you no gentleman you mustn't say the same to him certainly not replied i but i can demand a court martial yes and it will be granted but what do you gain by that it's like beating against a heavy gale and a lee tide thousand to one if you fetch your port and if you do your vessel is strained to pieces sails worn as thin as a newspaper and rigging chafed half through wanting fresh serving no orders for a refit and laid up in ordinary for the rest of your life no no mr simple the best plan is to grin and bear it and keep a sharp look out for depend upon it mr simple in the best ship's company in the world a spy captain will always find spy followers do you refer that observation to me mr swinburne said a voice from under the bulwark i started round and found the captain who had crept upon deck unperceived by us during our conversation swinburne made no reply but touched his hat and walked over to leeward i presume mr simple said the captain turning to me that you consider yourself justified in finding fault and abusing your captain to an inferior officer on his majesty's quarter deck if you heard the previous conversation sir replied i you must be aware that we were speaking generally about court martials i do not imagine that i have been guilty of any impropriety in conversing with an officer upon points connected with the service you mean then to assert sir that the gunner did not refer to me when he said the words spy captain' i acknowledge sir that as you were listening unperceived the term might appear to refer to you but the gunner had no idea at the time that you were listening his observation was that a spy captain would always find spy followers this i take to be a general observation and i am sorry that you think otherwise very well mr simple said captain hawkins and he walked down the companion ladder into his cabin now a'n't it odd mr simple that i should come with the intention of being of service to you and yet get you into such a scrape however perhaps it is all for the best open war is preferable to watching in the dark and stabbing in the back he never meant to have shown his colours but i hit him so hard that he forgot himself i suspect that to be the case swinburne but i think that you had better not talk any more with me to night wish i hadn't talked quite so much as things have turned out replied swinburne good night sir i reflected upon what had passed and felt convinced that swinburne was right in saying that it was better this had occurred than otherwise i now knew the ground which i stood upon and forewarned was being forearmed chapter fifty five we encounter a dutch brig of war captain hawkins very contemplative near the capstan hard knocks and no thanks for it who's afraid men will talk the brig goes about on the wrong tack at daylight the next morning we were off the texel and could see the low sand hills but we had scarcely made them out when the fog in the offing cleared up and we made a strange vessel the hands were turned up and all sail made in chase we made her out to be a brig of war and as she altered her course considerably we had an idea that she was an enemy we made the private signal which was unanswered and we cleared for action the brig making all sail on the starboard tack and we following her she bearing about two miles on out weather bow the breeze was not steady at one time the brig was staggering under her top gallant sails while we had our royals set at another we would have hands by the top gallant sheets and topsail halyards while she expanded every stitch of canvas on the whole however in an hour we had neared about half a mile our men were all at their quarters happy to be so soon at their old work their jackets and hats were thrown off a bandana handkerchief tied round their heads and another or else their black silk handkerchiefs tied round their waists every gun was ready everything was in its place and every soul i was going to say was anxious for the set to but i rather think i must not include the captain who from the commencement showed no signs of pleasure and anything but presence of mind when we first chased the vessel it was reported that it was a merchantman and it was not until we had broad daylight that we discovered her to be a man of war there was one thing to be said in his favour he had never been in action in his life the breeze now fell light and we were both with our sails set when a thick fog obscured her from our sight the fog rolled on till we met it and then we could not see ten yards from the brig this was a source of great mortification as we had every chance of losing her fortunately the wind was settling down fast into a calm and about twelve o'clock the sails flapped against the mast i reported twelve o'clock and asked the captain whether we should pipe to dinner not yet replied he we will put her head about go about sir replied i with surprise yes said he i'm convinced that the chase is on the other tack at this moment and if we do not we shall lose her if she goes about sir said i she must get among the sands and we shall be sure of her sir replied he when i ask your advice you will be pleased to give it i command this vessel i touched my hat and turned the hands up about ship convinced that the captain wished to avoid the action as the only chance of escape for the brig was her keeping her wind in the tack she was on 'bout ship 'bout ship cried the men what the hell are we going about for inquired they of one another as they came up the ladder silence there fore and aft cried i captain hawkins i do not think we can get her round unless we wear the wind is very light then wear ship mr simple there are times when grumbling and discontent among the seamen is so participated by the officer although they do not show it that the expressions made use of are passed unheeded such was the case at present the officers looked at each other and said nothing but the men were unguarded in their expressions the brig wore gradually round and when the men were bracing up the yards sharp on the other tack instead of the hurrah and down with the mark they fell back with a groan brace up those yards in silence there said i to the men which was all i could say the ropes were coiled down and we piped to dinner the captain who continued on deck could not fail to hear the discontented expressions which occasionally were made use of on the lower deck he made no observation but occasionally looked over the side to see whether the brig went through the water this she did slowly for about ten minutes when it fell a perfect calm so that to use a common phrase he gained little by his motion about half past one a slight breeze from the opposite quarter sprung up we turned round to it it increased the fog blew away and in a quarter of an hour the chase was again visible now upon our lee beam the men gave three cheers silence there fore and aft cried the captain angrily mr simple is this the way that the ship's company have been disciplined under their late commander to halloo and bawl whenever they think proper i was irritated at any reflection upon o'brien and i replied yes sir they have been always accustomed to express their joy at the prospect of engaging the enemy very well mr simple replied he how are we to put her head inquired the master touching his hat for the chase of course replied the captain who then descended into his cabin come my lads said swinburne as soon as the captain was below i have been going round and i fine that your pets are all in good fighting order i promise ye you sha'n't wait for powder they'll find that the rattlesnake can bite devilish hard yet i expect ay and without its head too replied one of the men who was the joe miller of the brig the chase perceiving that she could not escape for we were coming up with her hand over hand now shortened sail for action hoisting dutch colours captain hawkins again made his appearance on the quarter deck when we were within half a mile of her are we to run alongside of her or how inquired i mr simple i command her replied he and want no interference whatever very well sir replied i and i walked to the gangway mr thompson cried the captain who appeared to have screwed up his courage to the right pitch and had now taken his position for a moment on one of the carronades you will lay the brig right bang bang whiz whiz bang whiz came three shots from the enemy cleaving the air between our masts the captain jumped down from the carronade and hastened to the capstan without finishing his sentence shall we fire when we are ready sir said i for i perceived that he was not capable of giving correct orders yes yes to be sure replied he remaining where he was thompson said i to the master i think we can manage in our present commanding position to get foul of him so as to knock away his jib boom and fore topmast and then she can't escape we have good way on her i'll manage it simple or my name is not thompson replied the master jumping into the quarter boat conning the vessel in that exposed situation as we received the enemy's fire look out my lads and pour it into her now just as you please said i to the men the seamen were however too well disciplined to take immediate advantage of my permission they waited until we passed her and just as the master put up his helm so as to catch her jib boom between our masts the whole broadside was poured into his bow and chess tree her jib boom and fore topgallant went down and she had so much way through the water that we tore clear from her and rounding to the wind shot a head the enemy although in confusion from the effects of our broadside put up his helm to rake us we perceived his manoeuvre and did the same and then squaring our sail we ran with him before the wind engaging broadside to broadside this continued about half an hour and we soon found that we had no fool to play with the brig was well fought and her guns well directed we had several men taken down below and i thought it would be better to engage her even closer there was about a cable's length between both vessels as we ran before the wind at about six miles an hour with a slight rolling motion thompson said i let us see if we cannot beat them from their guns let's port the helm and close her till we can shy a biscuit on board just my opinion simple we'll see if they won't make another sort of running fight of it in a few minutes we were so close on board of her that the men who loaded the guns could touch each other with their rammers and sponges the men cheered it was gallantly returned by the enemy and havoc was now commenced by the musketry on both sides the french captain who appeared as brave a fellow as ever stepped stood for some minutes on the hammocks i was also holding on by the swifter of the main rigging when he took off his hat and politely saluted me i returned the compliment but the fire became too hot and i wished to get under the shelter of the bulwark still i would not go down first and the french captain appeared determined not to be the first either to quit the post of honour at last one of our marines hit him in the right arm he clasped his hand to the part as if to point it out to me nodded and was assisted down from the hammocks i immediately quitted my post for i thought it foolish to stand as a mark for forty or fifty soldiers i had already received a bullet through the small of my leg but the effects of such close fire now became apparent our guns were only half manned our sides terribly cut up and our sails and rigging in tatters the enemy was even worse off and two broadsides more brought her mainmast by the board our men cheered and threw in another broadside the enemy dropped astern we rounded to rake her she also attempted to round to but could not until she had cleared away her wreck and taken in her foresail and lowered her topsail she then continued the action with as much spirit as ever he's a fine fellow by god exclaimed thompson i never saw a man fight his ship better but we have him webster's down poor fellow i'm sorry for it replied i but i'm afraid that there are many poor fellows who have lost the number of their mess i think it useless throwing away the advantage which we now have he can't escape and he'll fight this way for ever we had better run a head repair damages and then he must surrender in his crippled state when we attack him again i agree with you said thompson the only point is that it will soon be dark i'll not lose sight of him and he cannot get away if he puts before the wind then we'll be at him again we gave him the loaded guns as we forged a head and when we were about half a mile from him hove to to repair damages the reader may now ask but where was the captain all this time my answer is that he was at the capstan where he stood in silence not once interfering during the whole action which was fought by thompson the master and myself how he looked or how he behaved in other points during the engagement i cannot pretend to say for i had no time to observe him even now i was busy knotting the rigging rousing up new sails to bend and getting everything in order and i should not have observed him had he not come up to me for as soon as we had ceased firing he appeared to recover himself he did not however first address me he commenced speaking to the men come be smart my lads send a hand here to swab up the blood here youngster run down to the surgeon and let him know that i wish a report of the killed and wounded by degrees he talked more and at last came up to me this has been rather smartish mr simple very smart indeed sir replied i and then turned away to give directions maintop there send down the hauling line on the starboard side ay ay sir now then my lads clap on and run it up at once maintop there hailed the captain be a little smarter or by god i'll call you down for something this did not come with a good grace from one who had done nothing to those who were working with all their energy mr simple said the captain i wish you would carry on duty with less noise at all events he set us the example during the action muttered the joe miller and the other men laughed heartily at the implication in two hours during which we had carefully watched the enemy who still lay where we left him we were again ready for action shall i give the men their grog now sir said i to the captain they must want it no no replied the captain no no mr simple i don't like what you call dutch courage i don't think he much does and this fellow has shown plenty of it said the joe miller softly and the men about him laughed heartily i think sir observed i that it is an injustice to this fine ship's company to hint at their requiring dutch courage dutch courage is a term for courage screwed up by drinking freely and i most respectfully beg leave to observe that the men have not had their afternoon's allowance and after the fatigues they have undergone really require it i command this ship sir replied he certainly sir i am aware of it rejoined i she is now all ready for action again and i wait your orders the enemy is two miles on the lee quarter the surgeon here came up with his report good heavens said the captain forty seven men killed and wounded mr webster dangerously why the brig is crippled we can do no more positively we can do no more we can take that brig anyhow cried one of the seamen from a dozen of the men who were to leeward expecting orders to renew the attack what man was that cried the captain no one answered by god this ship is in a state of mutiny mr simple will soon be i think said a voice from the crowd which i knew very well but the captain having been but a short time with us did not know it do you hear that mr simple cried the captain i regret to say that i did hear it sir i little thought that ever such an expression would have been make use of on board of the rattlesnake then fearing he would ask me the man's name and to pretend not to have recognised it i said who was that who made use of that expression but no one answered and it was so dark that it was impossible to distinguish the men after such mutinous expressions observed the captain i certainly will not risk his majesty's brig under my command as i should have wished to have done even in her crippled state by again engaging the enemy i can only regret that the officers appear as insolent as the men perhaps captain hawkins you will state in what and when i have proved myself insolent i cannot accuse myself i hope the expression was not applied to me sir said thompson the master touching his hat silence gentlemen if you please mr simple wear round the ship whether the captain intended to attack the enemy or not we could not tell but we were soon undeceived for when we were round he ordered her to be kept away until the dutch brig was on our lee quarter then ordering the master to shape his course for yarmouth he went down into the cabin and sent up word that i might pipe to supper and serve out the spirits the rage and indignation of the men could not be withheld after they went down to supper they gave three heavy groans in concert indeed during the whole of that night the officers who kept the watches had great difficulty in keeping the men from venting their feeling in what might be almost termed justifiable mutiny as for myself i could hardly control my vexation the brig was our certain prize and this was proved for the next day she hauled down her colours immediately to a much smaller man of war which fell in with her still lying in the same crippled state the captain and first lieutenant killed and nearly two thirds of her ship's company either killed or wounded had we attacked her she would have hauled down her colours immediately for it was our last broadside which had killed the captain who had shown so much courage as first lieutenant i should have received my promotion which was now lost i cried for vexation when i thought of it as i lay in bed that his conduct was severely commented upon by the officers in the gun room as well as by the whole ship's company i hardly need say thompson was for bringing him to a court martial which i would most gladly have done if it only were to get rid of him but i had a long conversation with old swinburne on the subject and he proved to me that i had better not attempt it for d'ye see mr simple you have no proof he did not run down below he stood his ground on deck although he did nothing you can't prove cowardice then although there can be no great doubt of it again with regard to his not renewing the attack why is not a captain at liberty to decide what is the best for his majesty's service and if he thought in the crippled state of the brig so close to the enemy's coast that it wasn't advisable why it could only be brought in as an error in judgment then there's another thing which must be remembered mr simple which is that no captains sitting on a court martial will if it be possible to extricate him ever prove cowardice against a brother captain because they feel that it's a disgrace to the whole cloth swinburne's advice was good and i gave up all thoughts of proceeding still it appeared to me that the captain was very much afraid that i would he was so extremely amiable and polite during our run home he said that he had watched how well i had behaved in the action and would not fail to notice it this was something but he did not keep his word for his despatch was published before we quitted the roadstead and not the name of one officer mentioned only generally saying that they conducted themselves to his satisfaction he called the enemy a corvette not specifying whether she was brig or ship corvette and the whole was written in such a bombastic style that any one would have imagined that he had found a vessel of superior force he stated at the end that as soon as he repaired damages he wore round but that the enemy declined further action so she did certainly for the best of all possible reasons that she was too disabled to come down to us all this might have been contested but the enormous list of killed and wounded proved that we had had a hard fight and the capture of the brig afterwards that we had really overpowered her so that on the whole captain hawkins gained a great deal of credit with some although whispers were afloat which came to the ears of the admiralty and prevented him from being posted the more so as he had the modesty not to apply for it chapter fifty six consequences of the action a ship without a fighting captain is like a thing without a head so do the sailors think a mutiny and the loss of our famous ship's company during our stay at yarmouth we were not allowed to put our foot on shore upon the plea that we must repair damages and proceed immediately to our station but the real fact was that captain hawkins was very anxious that we should not be able to talk about the action finding no charges preferred against him he recommenced his system of annoyance his apartments had windows which looked out upon where the brig lay at anchor and he constantly watched all our motions with his spy glass noting down if i did not hoist up boats etcetera exactly at the hour prescribed in his book of orders so as to gather a list of charges against me if he could this we did not find out until afterwards i mentioned before that when swinburne joined us at plymouth he had recommended a figure head being put on the brig this had been done at o'brien's expense not in the cheap way recommended by swinburne but in a very handsome manner it was a large snake coiled up in folds with its head darting out in a menacing attitude and the tail with its rattle appeared below the whole was gilded and had a very good effect but after the dock yard men had completed the repairs and the brig was painted one night the head of the rattlesnake disappeared it had been sawed off by some malicious and evil disposed persons and no traces of it were to be found i was obliged to report this to the captain who was very indignant and offered twenty pounds for the discovery of the offender but had he offered twenty thousand he never would have found out the delinquent it was however never forgotten for he understood what was implied by these manoeuvres a new head was carved but disappeared the night after it was fixed on the rage of the captain was without bounds he turned the hands up and declared that if the offender were not given up he would flog every hand on board he gave the ship's company ten minutes and then prepared to execute the threat mr paul turn the hands up for punishment said the captain in a rage and descended to his cabin for the articles of war when he was down below the officers talked over the matter to flog every man for the crime of one was the height of injustice but it was not for us to oppose him still the ship's company must have seen in our countenances that we shared their feelings the men were talking with each other in groups until they all appeared to have communicated their ideas on the subject the carpenters had been slowly bringing aft the gratings left off the job the boatswain's mates who had come aft rolled the tails of their cats round the red handles and every man walked down below no one was left on the quarter deck but the marines under arms and the officers perceiving this i desired mr paul the boatswain to send the men up to rig the gratings and the quarter masters with their seizings he came up and said that he had called them but that they did not answer perceiving that the ship's company would break out into open mutiny if the captain persisted in his intention i went down into the cabin and told the captain the state of things and wished for his orders or presence on deck the captain whose wrath appeared to render him incapable of reflection immediately proceeded on deck and ordered the marines to load with ball cartridge this was done but as i was afterwards told by thompson who was standing aft the marines loaded with the powder and put the balls into their pockets they wished to keep up the character of their corps for fidelity and at the same time not fire upon men whom they loved as brothers and with whom they coincided in opinion indeed we afterwards discovered that it was a marine who had taken off the head of the snake a second time the captain then ordered the boatswain to turn the hands up the boatswain made his appearance with his right arm in a sling what's the matter with your arm mr paul said i as he passed me tumbled down the hatchway just now can't move my arm i must go to the surgeon as soon as this is over the hands were piped up again but no one obeyed the order thus was the brig in a state of mutiny mr simple go forward to the main hatchway with the marines and fire on the lower deck cried the captain sir said i there are two frigates within a cable's length of us and would it not be better to send for assistance without shedding blood besides sir you have not yet tried the effect of calling up the carpenter's and boatswain's mates by name will you allow me to go down first and bring them to a sense of their duty yes sir i presume you know your power but of this hereafter i went down below and called the men by name sir said one of the boatswain's mates the ship's company say that they will not submit to be flogged i do not speak to the ship's company generally collins replied i but you are now ordered to rig the gratings and come on deck it is an order that you cannot refuse go up directly and obey it quartermasters go on deck with your seizings when all is ready you can then expostulate the men obeyed my orders they crawled on deck rigged the gratings and stood by all is ready sir said i touching my hat to the captain send the ship's company aft mr paul aft then all of you for punishment cried the boatswain yes it is all of us for punishment cried one voice we've all to flog one another and then pay off the jollies note jollies is a slang word for marines this time the men obeyed the order they all appeared on the quarterdeck the men are all aft sir reported the boatswain and now my lads said the captain i'll teach you what mutiny is you see these two frigates alongside of us you had forgotten them i suppose but i hadn't here you scoundrel mr jones this was the joe miller strip sir if ever there were mischief in a ship you are at the head head sir said the man assuming a vacant look what head sir do you mean the snake's head i don't know anything about it sir strip sir cried the captain in a rage i'll soon bring you to your senses if you please your honour what have i done to be tied up said the man strip you scoundrel well sir if you please it's hard to be flogged for nothing the man pulled off his clothes and walked up to the grating the quarter masters seized him up seized up sir reported the scoundrel of a sergeant of marines who acted as the captain's spy the captain looked for the articles of war to read as is necessary previous to punishing a man and was a little puzzled to find one where no positive offence had been committed at last he pitched upon the one which refers to combination and conspiracy and creating discontent we all took off our hats as he read it and he then called mr paul the boatswain and ordered him to give the man a dozen please sir said the boatswain pointing to his arm in a sling i can't flog i can't lift up my arm your arm was well enough when i came on board sir cried the captain yes sir but in hurrying the men up i slipped down the ladder and i'm afraid i've put my shoulder out the captain bit his lips he fully believed it was a sham on the part of the boatswain which indeed it was to get off flogging the men well then where is the chief boatswain's mate collins here sir said collins coming forward a stout muscular man nearly six feet high with a pig tail nearly four feet long and his open breast covered with black shaggy hair give that man a dozen sir said the captain the man looked at the captain then at the ship's company and then at the man seized up but did not commence the punishment do you hear me sir roared the captain if you please your honour i'd rather take my disrating i don't wish to be chief boatswain's mate in this here business obey your orders immediately sir cried the captain or by god i'll try you for mutiny well sir i beg your pardon but what must be must be i mean no disrespect captain hawkins but i cannot flog that man my conscience won't let me your conscience sir beg your pardon captain hawkins i've always done my duty foul weather or fair and i've been eighteen years in his majesty's service without ever being brought to punishment but if i am to be hung now saving your pleasure and with all respect i can't help it i give you but one moment more sir cried the captain do your duty the man looked at the captain and then eyed the yard arm captain hawkins i will do my duty although i must swing for it so saying he threw his cat down on the quarter deck and fell back among the ship's company the captain was now confounded and hardly knew how to act to persevere appeared useless to fall back was almost as impossible a dead silence of a minute ensued everyone was breathless with impatience to know what would be done next the silence was however first broken by jones the joe miller who was seized up beg your honour's pardon sir said he turning his head round but if i am to be flogged will you be pleased to let me have it over i shall catch my death a cold naked here all day this was decided mockery on the part of the man and roused the captain sergeant of marines put jones and that man collins both legs in irons for mutiny my men i perceive that there is a conspiracy in the ship but i shall very soon put an end to it i know the men and by god they shall repent it mr paul pipe down mr simple man my gig and recollect it's my positive orders that no boat goes on shore the captain left the brig looking daggers at me as he went over the side but i had done my duty and cared little for that indeed i was now watching his conduct as carefully as he did mine the captain wishes to tell his own story first said thompson coming up to me now if i were you simple i would take care that the real facts should be known how's that to be done replied i he has ordered no communication with the shore simply by sending an officer on board of each of the frigates to state that the brig is in a state of mutiny and request that they will keep a look out upon her this is no more than your duty as commanding officer you only send the message leave me to state the facts of my own accord recollect that the captains of these frigates will be summoned if there is a court of inquiry which i expect will take place i considered a little and thought the advice good i despatched thompson first to one frigate and then to the other the next day the captain came on board as soon as he stepped on the quarter deck he inquired how i dared disobey his orders in sending the boats away my reply was that his orders were not to communicate with the shore but that as commanding officer i considered it my duty to make known to the other ships that the men were in a state of insubordination that they might keep their eyes upon us he kept his eyes upon me for some time and then turned away without reply as we expected a court of inquiry was called upon his representations to the admiral about twenty of the men were examined but so much came out as to the reason why the head of the snake had been removed for the sailors spoke boldly that the admiral and officers who were appointed strongly recommended captain hawkins not to proceed further than to state that there were some disaffected characters in the ship and move the admiral to have them exchanged into others this was done and the captains of the frigates who immediately gave their advice divided all our best men between them they spoke very freely to me and asked me who were the best men which i told them honestly for i was glad to be able to get them out of the power of captain hawkins these they marked as disaffected and exchanged them for all the worst they had on board the few that were left ran away and thus from having one of the finest and best organised ship's companies in the service we were now one of the very worst jones was sent on board of the frigate and under surveillance he soon proved that his character was as good as i stated it to be and two years afterwards was promoted to the rank of boatswain i must here remark that there is hardly any degree of severity which a captain may not exert towards his seamen provided they are confident of or he has proved to them his courage but if there be a doubt or a confirmation to the contrary all discipline is destroyed by contempt and the ship's company mutiny either directly or indirectly there is an old saying that all tyrants are cowards that tyranny is in itself a species of meanness i acknowledge but still the saying ought to be modified if it is asserted that all mean tyrants are cowards i agree but i have known in the service most special tyrants who were not cowards their tyranny was excessive but there was no meanness in there dispositions on the contrary they were generous open hearted and occasionally when not influenced by anger proved that their hearts if not quite right were not very much out of their places yet they were tyrants but although tyrants the men forgave them and one kind act when they were not led away by the impetuosity of their feelings obliterated a hundred acts of tyranny but such is not the case in our service with men who in their tyranny are mean the seamen show no quarter to them and will undergo all the risk which the severity of the articles of war render them liable to rather than not express their opinion of a man whom they despise i do not like to mention names but i could point out specimens of brave tyrants and of cowardly tyrants who have existed and do even now exist in our service the present regulations have limited tyranny to a certain degree but it cannot check the mean tyrant for it is not in points of consequence likely to be brought before the notice of his superiors that he effects his purpose he resorts to paltry measures he smiles that he may betray he confines himself within the limit that may protect him and he is never exposed unless by his courage being called in question which but rarely occurs and when it does occur it is most difficult as well as most dangerous to attempt to prove it it may be asked why i did not quit the ship after having been aware of the character of the captain and the enmity which he bore to me in reply i can only say that i did often think of it talked over the subject with my messmates but they persuaded me to remain and as i was a first lieutenant and knew that any successful action would in all probability insure my promotion i determined to use a nautical expression to rough it out and not throw away the only chance which i now had of obtaining my rank as commander chapter fifty seven news from home not very agreeable although the reader may laugh we arrive at portsmouth where i fall in with my old acquaintance mrs trotter we sail with a convoy for the baltic i had written to my sister ellen giving her an account of all that had passed and mentioning the character of the captain and his apparent intimacy with my uncle i received an answer from her telling me that she had discovered from a very communicative old maiden lady that captain hawkins was an illegitimate son of my uncle by a lady with whom he had been acquainted about the time that he was in the army i immediately conceived the truth that my uncle had pointed me out to him as an object of his vengeance and that captain hawkins was too dutiful and too dependent a son not to obey him the state of my father was more distressing than ever but there was something very ludicrous in his fancies he had fancied himself a jackass and had brayed for a week kicking the old nurse in the stomach so as to double her up like a hedgehog he had taken it into his head that he was a pump and with one arm held out as a spout he had obliged the poor old nurse to work the other up and down for hours together in fact there was a string of strange conceptions of this kind that had accumulated so as to drive my poor sister almost mad and sometimes his ideas would be attended with a very heavy expense as he would send for architects make contracts etcetera for building supposing himself to have come to the title and property of his brother this being the basis of his disease occurred frequently i wrote to poor ellen giving her my best advice and by this time the brig was again ready for sea and we expected to sail immediately i did not forget to write to o'brien but the distance between us was so great that i knew i could not obtain his answer probably for a year and i felt a melancholy foreboding how much i required his advice our orders were to proceed to portsmouth and join a convoy collected there bound up the baltic under the charge of the acasta frigate and two other vessels we did not sail with any pleasure or hopes of gaining much in the way of prize money our captain was enough to make any ship a hell and our ship's company were composed of a mutinous and incorrigible set of scoundrels with of course a few exceptions how different did the officers find the brig after losing such a captain as o'brien and so fine a ship's company but there was no help for it and all we had to do was to make the best of it and hope for better times the cat was at work nearly every day and i must acknowledge that generally speaking it was deserved although sometimes a report from the sergeant of marines of any good man favoured by me was certain to be attended to this system of receiving reports direct from an inferior officer instead of through me as first lieutenant became so annoying that i resolved at all risk to expostulate i soon had an opportunity for one morning the captain said to me mr simple i understand that you had a fire in the galley last night after hours it's very true sir that i did order a stove to be lighted but may i inquire whether the first lieutenant has not a discretionary power in that point and further how is it that i am reported to you by other people the discipline of this ship is carried on by me under your directions and all reports ought to come through me and i cannot understand upon what grounds you permit them through any other channel i command my own ship sir and shall do as i please in that respect when i have officers i can confide in i shall in all probability allow them to report to me if there is anything in my conduct which has proved to you that i am incapable or not trustworthy i would feel obliged to you sir if you would in the first place point it out and in the next bring me to a court martial if i do not correct it i am no court martial man sir replied he but i am not to be dictated to by an inferior officer so you'll oblige me by holding your tongue the sergeant of marines as master at arms is bound to report to me any deviation from the regulations i have laid down for the discipline of the ship granted sir but that report according to the custom of the service should come through the first lieutenant i prefer it coming direct sir it stands less chance of being garbled thank you captain hawkins for the compliment the captain walked away without further reply and shortly after went down below swinburne ranged up alongside of me as soon as the captain disappeared well mr simple so i hear we are bound to the baltic why couldn't they have ordered us to pick the convoy off yarmouth instead of coming all the way to portsmouth we shall be in to morrow with this slant of wind i suppose the convoy are not yet collected swinburne and you recollect there's no want of french privateers in the channel very true sir when were you up the baltic swinburne i was in the old st george a regular old ninety eight she sailed just like a hay stack one mile ahead and three to leeward lord bless you mr simple the cattegat wasn't wide enough for her but she was a comfortable sort of vessel after all excepting on a lee shore so we used always to give the land a wide berth i recollect by the bye mr simple do you recollect how angry you were because i didn't peach at barbadoes when the man sucked the monkey to be sure i do well then i didn't think it fair then as i was one of them but now that i'm a bit of an officer i'll just tell you that when we get to carlscrona there's a method of sucking the monkey there which as first lieutenant with such a queer sort of captain it is just as well that you should be up to in the old st george we had seventy men drunk one afternoon and the first lieutenant couldn't find it out nohow indeed swinburne you must let me into that secret so i will mr simple don't you know there's a famous stuff for cuts and wounds called balsam what riga balsam yes that's it well all the boats will bring that for sale as they did to us in the old st george devilish good stuff it is for wounds i believe but it's not bad to drink and it's very strong we used to take it inwardly mr simple and the first lieutenant never guessed it what you all got tipsy upon riga balsam all that could so i just give you a hint i'm much obliged to you swinburne i certainly never should have suspected it i believe seamen would get drunk upon anything the next morning we anchored at spithead and found the convoy ready for sea the captain went on shore to report himself to the admiral and as usual the brig was surrounded with bum boats and wherries with people who wished to come on board as we were not known on the portsmouth station and had no acquaintance with the people all the bum boats were very anxious to supply the ship and as this is at the option of the first lieutenant he is very much persecuted until he has made his decision certificates of good conduct from other officers were handed up the side from all of them and i looked over the books at the capstan in the second book the name struck me it was that of mrs trotter and i walked to the gangway out of curiosity to ascertain whether it was the same personage who when i was a youngster had taken such care of my shirts as i looked at the boats a voice cried out oh mr simple have you forgot your old friend don't you recollect mrs trotter i certainly did not recollect her she had grown very fat and although more advanced in years was a better looking woman than when i had first seen her for she looked healthy and fresh indeed i hardly did recollect you mrs trotter i've so much to tell you mr simple replied she ordering the boat to pull alongside and as she was coming up desired the man to get the things in as if permission was quite unnecessary i did not counter order it as i knew none of the others and as far as honesty was concerned believed them all to be much on a par on the strength then of old acquaintance mrs trotter was admitted well i'm sure mr simple cried mrs trotter out of breath with climbing up the brig's side what a man you've grown and such a handsome man too dear dear it makes me feel quite old to look at you when i call to mind the little boy whom i had charge of in the cockpit don't you think i look very old and ugly mr simple continued she smiling and smirking indeed mrs trotter i think you wear very well pray how is your husband ah mr simple poor dear mr trotter he's gone poor fellow no what with his drinking and his love for me and his jealousy do you recollect how jealous he was mr simple he wore himself out at last no wonder considering what he had been accustomed to after keeping his carriage and dogs with everybody to be reduced to see his wife go a bumming it broke his heart poor fellow and mr simple i've been much happier ever since for i could not bear to see him fretting lord how jealous he was and all about nothing don't you want some fresh meat for the gun room i've a nice leg of mutton in the boat and some milk for tea recollect mrs trotter i shall not overlook your bringing spirits on board lord mr simple how could you think of such a thing it's very true that these very common people do it but the company i have kept the society i have been in mr simple besides you must recollect that i never drank anything but water i could not exactly coincide with her but i did not contradict her would you like the portsmouth paper mr simple taking one out of her pocket i know gentlemen are fond of the news poor trotter used never to stir from the breakfast table until he had finished the daily paper but that was when we lived in very different style have you any clothes to wash mr simple or have any of the gentlemen i fear we have no time we sail too soon replied i we go with the convoy indeed cried mrs trotter who walked to the main hatchway and called to her man bill i heard her give him directions to sell nothing upon trust in consequence of the intelligence of our immediate sailing i beg your pardon mr simple i was only desiring my head man to send for your steward that he might be supplied with the best and to save some milk for the gun room and i must beg your pardon mrs trotter for i must attend to my duty mrs trotter made her curtsy and walked down the main ladder to attend to her duty and we separated i was informed she had a great deal of custom as she understood how to manage the officers and made herself generally useful to them she had been a bumboat woman for six years and had made a great deal of money indeed it was reported that if a first lieutenant wanted forty or fifty pounds mrs trotter would always lend it to him without requiring his promissory note the captain came on board in the evening having dined with the admiral and left directions for having all ready for unmooring and heaving short at daylight the signal was made from the frigate at sunrise and before twelve o'clock we were all under weigh and running past st helen's with a favourable wind our force consisted of the acasta frigate the isis ship sloop mounting twenty guns the reindeer eighteen and our own brig the convoy amounted to nearly two hundred although the wind was fair and the water smooth we were more than a week before we made anholt light owing to the bad sailing and inattention of many of the vessels belonging to the convoy we were constantly employed repeating signals firing guns and often sent back to tow up the sternmost vessels at last we passed the anholt light with a light breeze and the next morning the mainland was to be distinguished on both bows chapter fifty eight how we passed the sound and what passed in the sound the captain overhears again a conversation between swinburne and me i was on the signal chest abaft counting the convoy when swinburne came up to me have you been here before with a convoy swinburne to be sure i have and it's sharp work that i've seen here mr simple work that i've an idea our captain won't have much stomach for swinburne i beg you will keep your thoughts relative to the captain to yourself recollect the last time it is my duty not to listen to them and i should rather think to report them also mr simple said captain hawkins who had crept up to us and overheard our conversation in this instance there is no occasion for my reporting them sir replied i for you have heard what has passed i have sir replied he and i shall not forget the conversation i turned forward swinburne had made his retreat the moment that he heard the voice of the captain how many sails are there in sight sir inquired the captain one hundred and sixty three sir replied i signal to convoy to close from the acasta reported the midshipman of the watch we repeated it and the captain descended to his cabin we were then running about four miles an hour the water very smooth and anholt lighthouse hardly visible on deck bearing nnw about twenty miles in fact we were near the entrance of the sound which the reader may be aware is a narrow passage leading into the baltic sea my watch was nearly out when the midshipman who was looking round with his glass on the copenhagen side reported three gun boats sweeping out from behind a point i examined them and went down to report them to the captain when i came on deck more were reported until we counted ten two of them large vessels called praams the captain now came on deck and i reported them we made the signal of enemy in sight to the acasta which was answered they divided six of them pulling along shore towards the convoy in the rear and four coming out right for the brig the acasta now made the signal for boats manned and armed to be held in readiness we hoisted out our pinnace and lowered down our cutters the other men of war doing the same in about a quarter of an hour the gun boats opened their fire with their long thirty two pounders and their first shot went right through the hull of the brig just abaft the fore bits fortunately no one was hurt i turned round to look at the captain he was as white as a sheet he caught my eye and turned aft when he was met by swinburne's eye steadily fixed upon him he then walked to the other side of the deck another shot ploughed up the water close to us rose and came through the hammock netting tearing out two of the hammocks and throwing them on the quarter deck when the acasta hoisted out pennants and made the signal to send our pinnace and cutter to the assistance of vessels astern the signal was also made to the isis and reindeer i reported the signal and inquired who was to take the command you mr simple will take the pinnace and order mr swinburne into the cutter mr swinburne sir replied i the brig will in all probability be in action soon and his services as a gunner will be required well then mr hilton may go beat to quarters where is mr webster the second lieutenant was close to us and he was ordered to take the duty during my absence i jumped into the pinnace and shoved off ten other boats from the acasta and the other men of war were pulling in the same direction and i joined them the gun boats had now opened fire upon the convoy astern and were sweeping out to capture them dividing themselves into two parties and pulling towards different portions of the convoy in half an hour we were within gun shot of the nearest which directed its fire at us but the lieutenant of the acasta who commanded the detachment ordered us to lie on our oars for a minute while he divided his force in three divisions of four boats each with instructions that we should each oppose a division of two gun boats this was well arranged i had the command of one division for the first lieutenants had not been sent away from the isis and reindeer and having inquired which of the divisions of gun boats i was to oppose i pulled for them in the meantime we observed that the two praams and two gun boats which had remained behind us and had been firing at the racehorse had also divided one praam attacking the acasta the two gun boats playing upon the isis and the other praam engaging the rattlesnake and reindeer the latter vessel being in a line with us and about half a mile farther out so that she could not return any effectual fire or indeed receive much damage one of the praams mounted ten guns and the other eight the last was opposed to the rattlesnake and the fire was kept up very smartly particularly by the acasta and the enemy in about a quarter of an hour i arrived with my division close to the vessel which was the nearest to the enemy it was a large sunderland built ship the gun boats which were within a quarter of a mile of her sweeping to her as fast as they could as soon as they perceived our approach directed their fire upon us but without success except the last discharge in which we being near enough they had loaded with grape the shot fell a little short but one piece of grape struck one of the bowmen of the pinnace taking off three fingers of his right hand as he was pulling his oar before they could fire again we were sheltered by the vessel pulling close to her side hid from the enemy this continued for some time the enemy not advancing nearer but now firing into the sunderland ship which protected us at last the master of the ship looked over the side and said to me i say my joker do you call this giving me assistance i think i was better off before you came then i had only my share of the enemy's fire but now that you have come i have it all i'm riddled like a sieve and have lost four men already suppose you give me a spell now pull behind the vessel ahead of us i'll take my chance i pulled up to the other vessel a large brig and the captain as soon as we came alongside said i see what you're about and i'll just leave you my vessel to take care of no use losing my men or being knocked on the head all's right you can't do better and we can't do better either his boat was lowered down and getting in with his men he pulled to another vessel and lay behind it all ready to pull back if a breeze sprang up as was to be expected the gun boats shifted their fire to the deserted vessel which the boats lay behind and thus did the action in our quarter continue until it was dark the gun boats not choosing to advance and was restricted from pulling out to attack them but i soon perceived that the gun boats were nearing us every time that they fired and i now discharged grape alone waiting for the flash of the fire to ascertain their direction at last i could perceive their long low hulls not two cables' lengths from us and their sweeps lifting from the water it was plain that they were advancing to board and i resolved to anticipate them if possible i had fired ahead of the brig and i now pulled with all my boats astern giving my orders to the officers and laying on our oars in readiness the gun boats were about half a cable's length from each other pulling up abreast and passing us at about the same distance when i directed the men to give way i had determined to throw all my force upon the nearest boat and in half a minute our bows were forced between their sweeps which we caught hold of to force our way alongside the resistance of the danes was very determined three times did i obtain a footing on the deck and three times was i thrown back into the boats at last we had fairly obtained our ground and were driving them gradually forward when as i ran on the gunwale to obtain a position more in advance of my men i received a blow with the butt end of a musket i believe on the shoulder which knocked me overboard and i fell between the sweeps and sank under the vessel's bottom i rose under the stern but i was so shook with the violence of the blow that i was for some time confused still i had strength to keep myself above water and paddled as it appeared away from the vessel until i hit against a sweep which had fallen overboard this supported me and i gradually recovered myself a light breeze rippled the water and i knew that i had no time to lose in about five minutes i heard the sound of oars and perceived a boat crossing me i hailed as loud as i could they heard me laid on their oars and i hailed again they pulled to me and took me in it was the master of the brig who aware of the capture of one gun boat and the retreat of the other was looking for his vessel or as he told me for what was left of her in a short time we found her and although very much cut up she had received no shot under water here i may as well relate the events of the action one of the other divisions of gun boats had retreated when attacked by the boats the other had beaten off the boats and killed many of the men but had suffered so much themselves as to retreat without making any capture the acasta lost four men killed and seven wounded the isis three men wounded the reindeer had nobody hurt the rattlesnake had six men killed and two wounded including the captain but of that i shall speak hereafter i found that i was by no means seriously hurt by the blow i had received my shoulder was stiff for a week and very much discoloured but nothing more when i fell overboard i had struck against a sweep which had cut my ear half off the captain of the brig gave me dry clothes and in a few hours i was very comfortably asleep hoping to join my ship the next day but in this i was disappointed the breeze was favourable and fresh but we were clear of the sound but a long way astern of the convoy and none of the headmost men of war to be seen i dressed and went on deck and immediately perceived that i had little chance of joining my ship until we arrived at carlscrona which proved to be the case about ten o'clock the wind died away and we had from that time such baffling light winds that it was six days before we dropped our anchor every vessel of the convoy having arrived before us chapter fifty nine the dead man attends at the auction of his own effects and bids the sale to stop one more than was wanted peter steps into his own shoes again captain hawkins takes a friendly interest in peter's papers riga balsam sternly refused to be admitted for the relief of the ship's company as soon as the sails were furled i thanked the master of the vessel for his kindness and requested the boat he ordered it to be manned saying how glad your captain will be to see you i doubted that we shook hands and i pulled to the rattlesnake which lay about two cables' length astern of us i had put on a jacket when i left the brig on service and coming in a merchantman's boat no attention was paid to me indeed owing to circumstances no one was on the look out and i ascended the side unperceived the men and officers were on the quarter deck attending the sale of dead men's effects before the mast and every eye was fixed upon six pairs of nankeen trowsers exposed by the purser's steward which i recognised as my own nine shillings for six pairs of nankeen trowsers cried the purser's steward come my men they're worth more than that observed the captain who appeared to be very facetious it's better to be in his trowsers than in his shoes this brutal remark created a silence for a moment well then steward let them go one would think that pulling on his trowsers would make you as afraid as he was continued the captain laughing shame was cried out by one or two of the officers and i recognised swinburne's voice as one more likely if they put on yours cried i in a loud indignant tone everybody started and turned round captain hawkins staggered to a carronade i beg to report myself as having rejoined my ship sir continued i hurrah my lads three cheers for mr simple said swinburne the men gave them with emphasis the captain looked at me and without saying a word hastily retreated to his cabin i perceived as he went down that he had his arm in a sling i thanked the men for their kind feeling towards me shook hands with thompson and webster who warmly congratulated me and then with old swinburne who nearly wrung my arm off and gave my shoulder such pain as to make me cry out and with the others who extended theirs i desired the sale of my effects to be stopped fortunately for me it had but just begun and the articles were all returned thompson had informed the captain that he knew my father's address and would take charge of my clothes and send them home but the captain would not allow him in a few minutes i received a letter from the captain desiring me to acquaint him in writing for the information of the senior officer in what manner i had escaped i went down below when i found one very melancholy face that of the passed midshipman of the acasta who had received an acting order in my place when i went to my desk i found two important articles missing one my private letter book and the other the journal which i kept of what passed and from which this narrative has been compiled i inquired of my messmates who stated that the desk had not been looked into by any one but the captain who of course must have possessed himself of those important documents i wrote a letter containing a short narrative of what had happened and at the same time another on service to the captain requesting that he would deliver up my property the private journal and letter book in his possession the captain as soon as he received my letters sent up word for his boat to be manned as soon as it was manned i reported it and then begged to know whether he intended to comply with my request he answered that he should not and then went on deck and quitted the brig to pull on board of the senior officer i therefore determined immediately to write to the captain of the acasta acquainting him with the conduct of captain hawkins and requesting his interference this i did immediately and the boat that had brought me on board not having left the brig i sent the letter by it requesting them to put it into the hands of one of the officers the letter was received previous to captain hawkins' visit being over and the captain of the acasta put it into his hands inquiring if the statement were correct captain hawkins replied that it was true that he had detained these papers as there was so much mutiny and disaffection in them and that he should not return them to me that i cannot permit replied the captain of the acasta who was aware of the character of captain hawkins if by mistake you have been put in possession of any of mr simple's secrets you are bound in honour not to make use of them neither can you retain property not your own but captain hawkins was determined and refused to give them to me well then captain hawkins replied the captain of the acasta you will oblige me by remaining on my quarter deck till i come out of the cabin the captain of the acasta then wrote an order directing captain hawkins immediately to deliver up to him the papers of mine in his possession and coming out of the cabin put it into captain hawkins' hands saying now sir here is a written order from your superior officer disobey it if you dare if you do i will put you under an arrest and try you by a court martial captain hawkins bit his lip at the order your boat is manned sir said the captain of the acasta in a severe tone captain hawkins came on board sealed up the books and sent them to the captain of the acasta who redirected them to me on his majesty's service and returned them by the same boat the public may therefore thank the captain of the acasta for the memoirs which they are now reading from my messmates i gained the following intelligence of what had passed after i had quitted the brig the fire of the praam had cut them up severely and captain hawkins had been struck in the arm with a piece of the hammock rail which had been shot away shortly after i left although the skin only was razed he thought proper to consider himself badly wounded and giving up the command to mr webster the second lieutenant had retreated below where he remained until the action was over when mr webster reported the return of the boats with the capture of the gun boat and my supposed death he was delighted that he quite forgot his wound and ran on deck rubbing his hands as he walked up and down at last he recollected himself went down into his cabin and came up again with his arm in a sling during the short time that we remained in port i took care that riga balsam should not be allowed to come alongside and the men were all sober we received orders from the captain of the acasta to join the admiral who was off the texel in pursuance of directions he had received from the admiralty to despatch one of the squadron and we were selected from the dislike which he had taken to captain hawkins chapter sixty an old friend in a new case heart of oak in swedish fir a man's a man all the world over and something more in many parts of it peter gets reprimanded for being dilatory but proves a title to a defence allowed when we were about forty miles off the harbour a frigate hove in sight we made the private signal she hoisted swedish colours and kept away a couple of points to close with us we were within two miles of her when she up courses and took in her topgallant sails as we closed to within two cable's lengths she hove to we did the same and the captain desired me to lower down the boat and board her ask her name by whom she was commanded and offer any assistance if the captain required it this was the usual custom of the service and i went on board in obedience to my orders when i arrived on the quarter deck i asked in french whether there were any one who spoke it the first lieutenant came forward and took off his hat i stated that i was requested to ask the name of the vessel and the commanding officer to insert it in our log and to offer any services that we could command he replied that the captain was on deck and turned round but the captain had gone down below i will inform him of your message i had no idea that he had quitted the deck and the first lieutenant left me i exchanged a few compliments and a little news with the officers on deck who appeared to be very gentlemanlike fellows when the first lieutenant requested my presence in the cabin i descended the door was opened i was announced by the first lieutenant and he quitted the cabin i looked at the captain who was sitting at the table he was a fine stout man with two or three ribands at his button hole and a large pair of mustachios i thought that i had seen him before but i could not recollect when his face was certainly familiar to me but as i had been informed by the officers on deck that the captain was a count shucksen a person i had never heard of i thought that i must be mistaken i therefore addressed him in french paying him a long compliment with all the necessary et ceteras the captain turned round to me took his hand away from his forehead which it had shaded and looking me full in the face replied mr simple i don't understand but very little french spin your yarn in plain english i started i thought that i knew your face replied i am i mistaken no it must be mr chucks you are right my dear mr simple it is your old friend chucks the boatswain whom you now see we shook hands heartily and then he requested me to sit down but said i they told me on deck that the frigate was commanded by a count shucksen that is my present rank my dear peter said he but as you have no time to lose i will explain all i know i can trust to your honour you remember that you left me as you and i supposed dying in the privateer with the captain's jacket and epaulets on my shoulders when the boats came out and you left the vessel they boarded and found me i was still breathing and judging of my rank by my coat they put me into the boat and pushed on shore the privateer sank very shortly after i was not expected to live but in a few days a change took place and i was better they asked me my name and i gave my own which they lengthened into shucksen somehow or another i recovered by a miracle and am now as well as ever i was in my life they were not a little proud of having captured a captain of the british service as they supposed for they never questioned me as to my real rank after some weeks i was sent home to denmark in a running vessel but it so happened that we met with a gale and were wrecked on the swedish coast close to carlscrona the danes were at that time at war having joined the russians and they were made prisoners while i was of course liberated and treated with great distinction but as i could not speak either french or their own language i could not get on very well however i had a handsome allowance and permission to go to england as soon as i pleased the swedes were then at war with the russians and were fitting out their fleet but lord bless them they didn't know much about it at last they all came to me and if they did not understand me entirely i showed them how to do it with my own hands and the fleet began to make a show with their rigging the admiral who commanded was very much obliged and i seemed to come as regularly to my work as if i were paid for it at last the admiral came with an english interpreter and asked me whether i was anxious to go back to england or would i like to join their service i saw what they wanted and i replied that i would prefer an english frigate to a swedish one and that i would not consent unless they offered something more and then with the express stipulation that i should not take arms against my own country they then waited for a week when they offered to make me a count and give me the command of the frigate this suited me as you may suppose peter it was the darling wish of my heart i was to be made a gentleman i consented and was made count shucksen and had a fine large frigate under my command i then set to work with a will superintended the fitting out of the whole fleet and showed them what an englishman could do we sailed and you of course know the brush we had with the russians which i must say did us no discredit i was fortunate to distinguish myself for i exchanged several broadsides with a russian two decked ship and came off with honour when we went into port i got this riband i was out afterwards and fell in with a russian frigate and captured her for which i received this other riband since that i have been in high favour and now that i speak the languages i like the people very much i am often at court when i am in harbour and peter i am married i wish you joy count with all my heart yes and well married too to a swedish countess of very high family and i expect that i have a little boy or girl by this time so you observe peter that i am at last a gentleman and what is more my children will be noble by two descents who would have thought that this would have been occasioned by my throwing the captain's jacket into the boat instead of my own and now my dear mr simple that i have made you my confidant i need not say do not say a word about it to anybody my dear count replied i your secret is safe with me and my pleasure is very great i then in a few words stated where o'brien was and then we parted i went with him on deck count shucksen taking my arm and introducing me as an old shipmate to his officers i hope we may meet again said i but i'm afraid there is little chance who knows replied he see what chance has done for me my dear peter god bless you you are one of the very few whom i always loved god bless you my boy and never forget that all i have is at your command if you come my way i thanked him and saluting the officers went down the side as i expected when i came on board the captain demanded in an angry tone why i had stayed so long i replied that i was shown down into count shucksen's cabin and he conversed so long that i could not get away sooner as it would not have been polite to have left him before he had finished his questions i then gave a very civil message and the captain said no more the very name of a great man always silenced him chapter sixty one bad news from home and worse on board notwithstanding his previous trials peter forced to prepare for another mrs trotter again improves as she grows old captain hawkins and his twelve charges no other event of consequence occurred until we joined the admiral who only detained us three hours with the fleet and then sent us home with his despatches we arrived after a quiet passage at portsmouth where i wrote immediately to my sister ellen requesting to know the state of my father's health i waited impatiently for an answer and by return of post received one with a black seal my father had died the day before from a brain fever and ellen conjured me to obtain leave of absence to come to her in her state of distress the captain came on board the next morning and i had a letter ready written on service to the admiral stating the circumstances and requesting leave of absence i presented it to him and entreated him to forward it at any other time i would not have condescended but the thoughts of my poor sister unprotected and alone and my father lying dead in the house made me humble and submissive captain hawkins read the letter and very coolly replied that it was very easy to say that my father was dead but he required proofs even this insult did not affect me i put my sister's letter in his hand he read it and as he returned it to me he smiled maliciously it is impossible for me to forward your letter mr simple as i have one to deliver to you he put a large folio packet into my hand and went below i opened it it was a copy of a letter demanding a court martial upon me with a long list of the charges preferred by him i was stupefied not so much at his asking for a court martial but at the conviction of the impossibility of my now being able to go to the assistance of my poor sister i went down into the gun room and threw myself on a chair at the same time tossing the letter to thompson the master he read it over carefully and folded it up upon my word simple i do not see that you have much to fear these charges are very frivolous the next morning the official letter from the port admiral came off acquainting me that a court martial had been ordered upon me and that it would take place that day week i immediately resigned the command to the second lieutenant and commenced an examination into the charges preferred they were very numerous and dated back almost to the very day that he had joined the ship there were twelve in all i shall not trouble the reader with the whole of them as many were very frivolous the principal charges were for mutinous and disrespectful conduct to captain hawkins on such a date having in a conversation with an inferior officer on the quarter deck stated that captain hawkins was a spy and had spies in the ship for neglect of duty in disobeying the orders of captain hawkins on the night of the of for having on the of sent away two boats from the ship in direct opposition to the orders of captain hawkins for having again on the morning of the of held mutinous and disrespectful conversation relative to captain hawkins with the gunner of the ship allowing the latter to accuse captain hawkins of cowardice without reporting the same for insulting expressions on the quarter deck to captain hawkins on his rejoining the brig on the morning of the of for not causing the orders of captain hawkins to be put in force on several occasions etcetera etcetera etc and further as captain hawkins' testimony was necessary in two of the charges the king on those charges was the prosecutor two days before my court martial i received a letter from ellen who appeared in a state of distraction from this accumulation of misfortune she told me that my father was to be buried the next day and that the new rector had written to her to know when it would be convenient for the vicarage to be given up that my father's bills had been sent in and amounted to twelve hundred pounds already and that she knew not the extent of the whole claims there appeared to be nothing left but the furniture of the house and she wanted to know whether the debts were to be paid with the money i had left in the funds for her use i wrote immediately requesting her to liquidate every claim as far as my money went sending her an order upon my agent to draw for the whole amount and a power of attorney to him to sell out the stock i had just sealed the letter when mrs trotter who had attended the ship since our return to portsmouth begged to speak with me and walked in after her message without waiting for an answer my dear mr simple said she i know all that is going on and i find that you have no lawyer to assist you now i know that it it is necessary and will very probably be of great service in your defence for when people are in distress and anxiety they have not their wits about them so i have brought a friend of mine from portsea a very clever man who for my sake will undertake your cause and i hope you will not refuse him you recollect giving me a dozen pairs of stockings i did not refuse them nor shall you refuse me now mr trotter's advice was good and although i would not listen to receiving his services gratuitously i agreed to employ him and very useful did he prove against such charges and such a man as captain hawkins he came on board that afternoon carefully examined into all the documents and the witnesses whom i could bring forward showed me the weak side of my defence and took the papers on shore with him every day he came on board to collect fresh evidence and examine into my case at last the day arrived i dressed myself in my best uniform the gun fired from the admiral's ship with the signal for a court martial at nine o'clock and i went on board in a boat with all the witnesses on my arrival i was put under the custody of the provost martial the captains ordered to attend pulled alongside one after another and were received by a party of marines presenting their arms at half past nine the court was all assembled and i was ushered in court martials are open courts although no one is permitted to print the evidence at the head of the long table was the admiral as president on his right hand standing was captain hawkins as prosecutor on each side of the table were six captains sitting near to the admiral according to their seniority at the bottom facing the admiral was the judge advocate on whose left hand i stood as prisoner the court were all sworn and then took their seats stauncheons with ropes covered with green baize passed along were behind the chairs of the captains who composed the court so that they might not be crowded upon by those who came in to listen to what passed the charges were then read as well as the letters to and from the admiral by which the court martial was demanded and granted and then captain hawkins was desired to open his prosecution he commenced with observing his great regret that he had been forced to a measure so repugnant to his feelings his frequent cautions to me and the indifference with which i treated them and after a preamble composed of every falsity that could be devised he commenced with the first charge and stating himself to be the witness gave his evidence i wish said the second captain who was addressed to ask captain hawkins whether when he came on deck he came up in the usual way in which a captain of a man of war comes on his quarter deck or whether he slipped up without noise captain hawkins declared that he came up as he usually did this was true enough for he invariably came up by stealth but captain hawkins do you not think allowing that you came up on deck in your usual way as you term it that you would have done better to have hemmed or hawed so as to let your officers know that you were present i should be very sorry to hear all that might be said of me in my supposed absence to this observation captain hawkins replied that was so astonished at the conversation that he was quite breathless having till then had the highest opinion of me no more questions were asked and they proceeded to the second charge this was a very trifling one for lighting a stove contrary to orders the evidence brought forward was the sergeant of marines when his evidence in favour of the charge had been given the following questions were put by some of the members of the court you have served in other ships before yes did you ever sailing with other captains receive an order from them to report direct to them and not through the first lieutenant the witness here prevaricated answer directly yes or no no the third charge was then brought forward for sending away boats contrary to express orders this was substantiated by captain hawkins' own evidence the order having been verbal by the advice of my counsel i put no questions to captain hawkins neither did the court the fourth charge that of holding mutinous conversation with the gunner and allowing him to accuse the captain of unwillingness to engage the enemy was then again substantiated by captain hawkins as the only witness i again left my reply for my defence and one only question was put by one of the members which was to inquire of captain hawkins as he appeared peculiarly unfortunate in overhearing conversations whether he walked up as usual to the taffrail or whether he crept up captain hawkins gave the same answer as before the fifth charge for insulting expressions to captain hawkins on my rejoining the brig at carlscrona was then brought forward and the sergeant of marines and one of the seamen appeared as witnesses this charge excited a great deal of amusement in the cross examination by the members of the court captain hawkins was asked what he meant by the expression when disposing of the clothes of an officer who was killed in action that the men appeared to think that his trowsers would instil fear nothing more upon my honour sir replied captain hawkins than an implication that they were alarmed lest they should be haunted by his ghost then of course mr simple meant the same in his reply observed the captain sarcastically the remainder of the charges were then brought forward but they were of little consequence chapter sixty two a good defence not always good against a bad accusation peter wins the hearts of his judges yet loses his cause and is dismissed his ship the next day i commenced my defence i preferred calling my own witnesses first and by the advice of my counsel and at the request of swinburne i called him i put the following questions when we were talking on the quarter deck was it fine weather yes it was do you think that you might have heard any one coming on deck in the usual way up the companion ladder sure of it do you mean then to imply that captain hawkins came up stealthily i have an idea he pounced upon us as a cat does a mouse what were the expressions made use of i said that a spy captain would always find spy followers in that remark were you and mr simple referring to your own captain the remark was mine what mr simple was thinking of i can't tell but i did refer to the captain and he has proved that i was right this bold answer of swinburne's rather astonished the court who commenced cross questioning him but he kept to his original assertion that i had only answered generally to repel the second charge i produced two witnesses but to the third charge i brought forward three witnesses to prove that captain hawkins' orders were that i should send no boats on shore not that i should not send them on board of the men of war close to us in answer to the fourth charge i called swinburne who stated that if i did not he would come forward swinburne acknowledged that he accused the captain of being shy and that i reprimanded him for so doing did he say that he would report you inquired one of the captains no sir replied swinburne 'cause he never meant to do it this was an unfortunate answer to the fifth charge i brought several witnesses to prove the words of captain hawkins and the sense in which they were taken by the ship's company and the men calling out shame when he used the expression to refute the other charges i called one or two witnesses and the court then adjourned inquiring of me when i would be ready to commence my defence i requested a day to prepare which was readily granted and the ensuing day the court did not sit i hardly need say that i was busily employed arranging my defence with my counsel at last all was done and i went to bed tired and unhappy but i slept soundly which could not be said of my counsel for he went on shore at eleven o'clock and sat up all night arranging and making a fair copy after all the fairest court of justice is a naval court martial no brow beating of witnesses an evident inclination towards the prisoner every allowance and every favour granted him and no legal quibbles attended to it is a court of equity with very few exceptions and the humbler the individual the greater the chance in his favour i was awoke the following morning by my counsel who had not gone to bed the previous night and who had come off at seven o'clock to read over with me my defence at nine o'clock i again proceeded on board and in a short time the court was sitting i came in handed my defence to the judge advocate who read it aloud to the court i have a copy still by me and will give the whole of it to the reader mr president and gentlemen after nearly fourteen years service in his majesty's navy during which i have been twice made prisoner twice wounded and once wrecked and as i trust i shall prove to you by certificates and the public despatches i have done my duty with zeal and honour i now find myself in a situation in which i never expected to be placed that of being arraigned before and brought to a court martial for charges of mutiny disaffection and disrespect towards my superior officer if the honourable court will examine the certificates i am about to produce they will find that until i sailed with captain hawkins my conduct has always been supposed to have been diametrically opposite to that which is now imputed to me i have always been diligent and obedient to command and i have only to regret that the captains with whom i have had the honour to sail are not now present to corroborate by their oral evidence the truth of these documents allow me in the first place to point out to the court that the charges against me are spread over a large space of time amounting to nearly eighteen months during the whole of which period captain hawkins never stated to me that it was his intention to try me by a court martial and although repeatedly in the presence of a senior officer has never preferred any charge against me the articles of war state expressly that if any officer soldier or marine has any complaint to make he is to do so upon his arrival at any port or fleet where he may fall in with a superior officer i admit that this article of war refers to complaints to be made by inferiors against superiors but at the same time i venture to submit to the honourable court that a superior is equally bound to prefer a charge or to give notice that that charge will be preferred on the first seasonable opportunity instead of lulling the offender into security and disarming him in his defence by allowing the time to run on so long as to render him incapable of bringing forward his witnesses i take the liberty of calling this to your attention and shall now proceed to answer the charges which have been brought against me i am accused of having held a conversation with an inferior officer on the quarter deck of his majesty's brig rattlesnake in which my captain was treated with contempt that it may not be supposed that mr swinburne was a new acquaintance made upon my joining the brig i must observe that he was an old shipmate with whom i had served many years and with whose worth i was well acquainted he was my instructor in my more youthful days and has been rewarded for his merit with the warrant which he now holds as gunner of his majesty's brig rattlesnake the offensive observation in the first place was not mine and in the second it was couched in general terms here mr swinburne has pointedly confessed that he did refer to the captain although the observation was in the plural but that does not prove the charge against me on the contrary adds weight to the assertion of mr swinburne that i was guiltless of the present charge that captain hawkins had acted as a spy his own evidence on this charge as well as that brought forward by other witnesses will decidedly prove but as the truth of the observation does not warrant its utterance i am glad that no such expression escaped my lips upon the second charge i shall dwell but a short time it is true that there is a general order that no stoves shall be alight after a certain hour but i will appeal to the honourable court whether a first lieutenant is not considered to have a degree of licence of judgment in all that concerns the interior discipline of the ship the surgeon sent to say that a stove was required for one of the sick i was in bed at the time and replied immediately in the affirmative does captain hawkins mean to assert to the honourable court that he would have refused the request of the surgeon most certainly not the only error i committed if it were an error was not going through the form of awaking captain hawkins to ask the permission which as first lieutenant i thought myself authorised to give the charge against me of having sent away two boats contrary to his order i have already disproved by witnesses the order of captain hawkins was not to communicate with the shore my reasons for sending away the boats here captain hawkins interposed and stated to the president that my reasons were not necessary to be received the court was cleared and on our return the court had decided that my reasons ought to be given and i continued my reasons for sending away these boats or rather it was one boat which was despatched to the two frigates if i remember well were that the brig was in a state of mutiny the captain had tied up one of the men and the ship's company refused to be flogged captain hawkins then went on shore to the admiral to report the situation of his ship and i conceived it my duty to make it known to the men of war anchored close to us i shall not enter into further particulars as they will only detain the honourable court and i am aware that this court martial is held upon my conduct and not upon that of captain hawkins to the charge of again holding disrespectful language on the quarter deck as overheard by captain hawkins i must refer the honourable court to the evidence in which it is plainly proved that the remarks upon him were not mine but those of mr swinburne and that i remonstrated with mr swinburne for using such unguarded expressions the only point of difficulty is whether it was not my duty to have reported such language i reply that there is no proof that i did not intend to report it but the presence of captain hawkins who heard what was said rendered such report unnecessary on the fifth charge i must beg that the court will be pleased to consider that some allowance ought to be made for a moment of irritation my character was traduced by captain hawkins supposing that i was dead so much so that even the ship's company cried out shame i am aware that no language of a superior officer can warrant a retort from an inferior but as what i intended to imply by that language is not yet known although captain hawkins has given an explanation to his i shall merely say that i meant no more by my insinuations than captain hawkins did at the time by those which he made use of with respect to me upon the other trifling charges brought forward i lay no stress as i consider them fully refuted by the evidence which has been already adduced and i shall merely observe that for reasons best known to himself i have been met with a most decided hostility on the part of captain hawkins from the time that he first joined the ship that on every occasion he has used all his efforts to render me uncomfortable and embroil me with others that not content with narrowly watching my conduct on board he has resorted to his spy glass from the shore and instead of assisting me in the execution of a duty sufficiently arduous he has thrown every obstacle in my way placed inferior officers as spies over my conduct and made me feel so humiliated in the presence of the ship's company over which i have had to superintend and in the disciplining of which i had a right to look to him for support that were it not that some odium would necessarily be attached to the sentence i should feel it as one of the happiest events of my life that i were dismissed from the situation which i now hold under his command i now beg that the honourable court will allow the documents i lay upon the table to be read in support of my character when this was over the court was cleared that they might decide upon the sentence i waited about half an hour in the greatest anxiety when i was again summoned to attend the usual forms of reading the papers were gone through and then came the sentence which was read by the president he and the whole court standing up with their cocked hats on their heads after the preamble it concluded with saying that it was the opinion of that court that the charges had been partly proved and therefore that lieutenant peter simple was dismissed his ship but in consideration of his good character and services his case was strongly recommended to the consideration of the lords commissioners of the admiralty chapter sixty three peter looks upon his loss as something gained goes on board the rattlesnake to pack up and is ordered to pack off polite leave taking between relations mrs trotter better and better goes to london and afterwards falls into all manner of misfortunes by the hands of robbers and of his own uncle i hardly knew whether i felt glad or sorry at this sentence on the one hand it was almost a death blow to my future advancement or employment in the service on the other the recommendation very much softened down the sentence and i was quite happy to be quit of captain hawkins and free to hasten to my poor sister i bowed respectfully to the court which immediately adjourned captain hawkins followed the captains on the quarter deck but none of them would speak to him so much to his disadvantage had come out during the trial about ten minutes afterwards one of the elder captains composing the court called me into the cabin mr simple said he we are all very sorry for you our sentence could not be more lenient under the circumstances it was that conversation with the gunner at the taffrail which floored you it must be a warning to you to be more careful in future how you permit any one to speak of the conduct of your superiors on the quarter deck i am desired by the president to let you know that it is our intention to express ourselves very strongly to the admiral in your behalf so much so that if another captain applies for you you will have no difficulty in being appointed to a ship and as for leaving your present ship under any other circumstances i should consider it a matter of congratulation i returned my sincere thanks and soon afterwards quitted the guardship and went on board of the brig to pack up my clothes and take leave of my messmates on my arrival i found that captain hawkins had preceded me and he was on deck when i came up the side i hastened down into the gun room where i received the condolements of my messmates simple i wish you joy cried thompson loud enough for the captain to hear on deck i wish i had your luck i wish somebody would try me by a court martial as it has turned out replied i in a loud voice and after the communication made to me by the captains composing the court of what they intend to say to the admiralty i agree with you thompson that it is a very kind act on the part of captain hawkins and i feel quite grateful to him steward come glasses cried thompson and let us drink success to mr simple all this was very annoying to captain hawkins who overheard every word when our glasses were filled simple your good health and may i meet with as good a messmate said thompson at this moment the sergeant of marines put his head in at the gun room door and said in a most insolent tone that i was to leave the ship immediately i was so irritated that i threw my glass of grog in his face and he ran up to the captain to make the complaint but i did not belong to the ship and even if i had i would have resented such impertinence captain hawkins was in a great rage and i believe would have written for another court martial but he had had enough of them he inquired very particularly of the sergeant whether he had told me that i was to leave the ship directly or whether that captain hawkins desired that i should leave the ship immediately and finding that he had not given the latter message which i was aware of for had he given it i dare not have acted as i did he then sent down again by one of the midshipmen desiring me to leave the ship immediately my reply was that i should certainly obey his orders with the greatest pleasure i hastened to pack up my clothes reported myself ready to the second lieutenant who went up for permission to man a boat which was refused by captain hawkins who said i might go on shore in a shore boat i called one alongside shook hands with all my messmates and when i arrived on the quarter deck with swinburne and some of the best men who came forward captain hawkins stood by the binnacle bursting with rage as i went over the planeshear i took my hat off to him and wished him good morning very respectfully adding if you have any commands for my uncle captain hawkins i shall be glad to execute them this observation which showed him that i knew the connection and correspondence between them made him gasp with emotion leave the ship sir or by god i'll put you in irons for mutiny cried he i again took off my hat and went down the side and shoved off as soon as i was a few yards distant the men jumped on the carronade and cheered and i perceived captain hawkins order them down and before i was a cable's length from her the pipe all hands to punishment so i presume some of the poor fellows suffered for their insubordination in showing their good will i acknowledge that i might have left the ship in a more dignified manner and that my conduct was not altogether correct but still i state what i really did do and some allowance must be made for my feelings this is certain that my conduct after the court martial was more deserving of punishment than that for which i had been tried but i was in a state of feverish excitement and hardly knew what i did when i arrived at sally port i had my effects wheeled up to the blue posts and packing up those which i most required i threw off my uniform and was once more a gentleman at large i took my place in the mail for that evening sent a letter of thanks with a few bank notes to my counsel and then sat down and wrote a long letter to o'brien acquainting him with the events which had taken place i had just finished and sealed it up when in came mrs trotter o my dear mr simple i'm so sorry and i have come to console you there's nothing like women when men are in affliction as poor trotter used to say as he laid his head in my lap when do you go to town this evening mrs trotter i hope i am to continue to attend the ship i hope so too mrs trotter i have no doubt but you will now mr simple how are you off for money do you want a little you can pay me by and bye don't be afraid i am not quite so poor as i was when you came down to mess with trotter and me and when you gave me a dozen pairs of stockings i know what it is to want money and what it is to want friends many thanks to you mrs trotter replied i but i have sufficient to take me home and then i can obtain more well i'm glad of it but it was offered in earnest good bye god bless you come mr simple give me a kiss it won't be the first time i kissed her for i felt grateful for her kindness and with a little smirking and ogling she quitted the room i could not help thinking after she was gone how little we know the hearts of others if i had been asked if mrs trotter was a person to have done a generous action from what i had seen of her in adversity i should have decidedly said no yet in this offer she was disinterested for she knew the service well enough to be aware that i had little chance of being a first lieutenant again and of being of service to her and how often does it also occur that those who ought from gratitude or long friendship to do all they can to assist you turn from you in your necessity and prove false and treacherous it is god alone who knows our hearts i sent my letter to o'brien to the admiral's office sat down to a dinner which i could not taste and at seven o'clock got into the mail i was very ill i had a burning fever and a dreadful headache but i thought only of my sister when i arrived in town i was much worse but did not wait more than an hour i took my place in a coach which did not go to the town near which we resided for i had inquired and found that coach was full and i did not choose to wait another day the coach in which i took my place went within forty miles of the vicarage and i intended to post across the country the next evening i arrived at the point of separation and taking out my portmanteau ordered a chaise and set off for what once had been my home i could hardly hold my head up i was so ill and i lay in a corner of the chaise in a sort of dream kept from sleeping from intense pain in the forehead and temples it was about nine o'clock at night when we were in a dreadful jolting road the shocks proceeding from which gave me agonising pain that the chaise was stopped by two men who dragged me out on the grass one stood over me while the other rifled the chaise the post boy who appeared a party to the transaction remained quietly on his horse and as soon as they had taken my effects turned round and drove off they then rifled my person taking away everything that i had leaving me nothing but my trowsers and shirt after a short consultation they ordered me to walk on in the direction in which we had been proceeding in the chaise and to hasten as fast as i could or they would blow my brains out i complied with their request thinking myself fortunate to have escaped so well i knew that i was still thirty miles at least from the vicarage but ill as i was i hoped to be able to reach it on foot i walked during the remainder of the night but i got on but slowly i reeled from one side of the road to the other and occasionally sat down to rest morning dawned and i perceived habitations not far from me i staggered on in my course the fever now raged in me my head was splitting with agony and i tottered to a bank near a small neat cottage on the side of the road i have a faint recollection of some one coming to me and taking my hand but nothing further and it was not till many months afterwards that i became acquainted with the circumstances which i now relate it appears that the owner of the cottage was a half pay lieutenant in the army who had sold out on account of his wounds i was humanely taken into his house laid on a bed and a surgeon requested to come to me immediately i had now lost all recollection and who i was they could not ascertain my pockets were empty and it was only by the mark on my linen that they found that my name was simple for three weeks i remained in a state of alternate stupor and delirium when the latter came on i raved of lord privilege o'brien and celeste mr selwin the officer who had so kindly assisted me knew that simple was the patronymic name of lord privilege and he immediately wrote to his lordship stating that a young man of the name of simple who in his delirium called upon him and captain o'brien was lying in a most dangerous state in his house and that as he presumed i was a relative of his lordship's he had deemed it right to apprise him of the fact my uncle who knew that it must be me thought this too favourable an opportunity provided i should live not to have me in his power he wrote to say that he would be there in a day or two at the same time thanking mr selwin for his kind attention to his poor nephew and requesting that no expense might be spared when my uncle arrived which he did in his own chariot the crisis of the fever was over but i was still in a state of stupor arising from extreme debility he thanked mr selwin for his attention which he said he was afraid was of little avail as i was every year becoming more deranged and he expressed his fears that it would terminate in chronic lunacy his poor father died in the same state continued my uncle passing his hand across his eyes as if much affected i have brought my physician with me to see if he can be moved i shall not be satisfied unless i am with him night and day the physician who was my uncle's valet took me by the hand felt my pulse examined my eyes and pronounced that it would be very easy to move me and that i should recover sooner in a more airy room of course mr selwin raised no objections putting down all to my uncle's regard for me and my clothes were put on me as i lay in a state of insensibility and i was lifted into the chariot it is most wonderful that i did not die from being thus taken out of my bed in such a state but it pleased heaven that it should be otherwise had such an event taken place it would probably have pleased my uncle much better than my surviving when i was in the carriage supported by the pseudo physician my uncle again thanked mr selwin begged that he would command his interest wrote a handsome check for the surgeon who had attended me and getting into the carriage drove off with me still in a state of insensibility that is i was not so insensible but i think i felt i had been removed and i heard the rattling of the wheels but my mind was so uncollected and i was in a state of such weakness that i could not feel assured of it for a minute for some days afterwards for i recollect nothing about the journey i found myself in bed in a dark room and my arms confined i recalled my senses and by degrees was able to recollect all that had occurred until i laid down by the roadside where was i the room was dark i could distinguish nothing that i had attempted to do myself some injury i took for granted or my arms would not have been secured i had been in a fever and delirious i supposed and had now recovered i had been in a reverie for more than an hour wondering why i was left alone when the door of the apartment opened who is there inquired i oh you've come to yourself again said a gruff voice then i'll give you a little daylight he took down a shutter which covered the whole of the window and a flood of light poured in which blinded me i shut my eyes and by degrees admitted the light until i could bear it i looked at the apartment the walls were bare and white washed i was on a truckle bed i looked at the window it was closed up with iron bars why where am i inquired i of the man with alarm where are you replied he why in bedlam chapter sixty four as o'brien said it's a long lane that has no turning i am rescued and happiness pours in upon me as fast as misery before overwhelmed me the shock was too great i fell back on my pillow insensible how long i lay i know not but when i recovered the keeper was gone and i found a jug of water and some bread by the side of the bed i drank the water and the effect it had upon me was surprising i felt that i could get up and i rose my arms had been unpinioned during my swoon it was about noon that the medical people attended by the keepers and others came into my apartment is he quite quiet o lord yes sir as quiet as a lamb replied the man who had before entered i then spoke to the medical gentleman begging him to tell why and how i had been brought here he answered mildly and soothingly saying that i was there at the wish of my friends and that every care would be taken of me that he was aware that my paroxysms were only occasional and that during the time that i was quiet i should have every indulgence that could be granted and that he hoped that i soon should be perfectly well and be permitted to leave the hospital i replied by stating who i was and how i had been taken ill the doctor shook his head advised me to lie down as much as possible and then quitted me to visit the other patients as i afterwards discovered my uncle had had me confined upon the plea that i was a young man who was deranged with an idea that his name was simple and that he was the heir to the title and estates that i was very troublesome at times forcing my way into his house and insulting the servants but in every other respect was harmless that my paroxysms generally ended in a violent fever and that it was more from the fear of my coming to some harm than from any ill will towards the poor young man that he wished me to remain in the hospital and be taken care of the reader may at once perceive the art of this communication i having no idea why i was confined would of course continue to style myself by my true name and as long as i did this so long would i be considered in a deranged state the reader must not therefore be surprised when i tell him that i remained in bedlam for one year and eight months the doctor called upon me for two or three days and finding me quiet ordered me to be allowed books paper and ink to amuse myself but every attempt at explanation was certain to be the signal for him to leave my apartment i found therefore not only by him but from the keeper who paid no attention to anything i said that i had no chance of being listened to or of obtaining my release after the first month the doctor came to me no more i was a quiet patient and he received the report of the keeper i was sent there with every necessary document to prove that i was mad and although a very little may establish a case of lunacy it requires something very strong indeed to prove that you are in your right senses in bedlam i found it impossible at the same time i was well treated was allowed all necessary comforts and such amusement as could be obtained from books etcetera i had no reason to complain of the keeper except that he was too much employed to waste his time in listening to what he did not believe i wrote several letters to my sister and to o'brien during the first two or three months and requested the keeper to put them in the post this he promised to do never refusing to take the letters but as i afterwards found out they were invariably destroyed yet i still bore up with the hopes of release for some time but the anxiety relative to my sister when i thought of her situation my thoughts of celeste and of o'brien sometimes quite overcame me then indeed i would almost become frantic and the keeper would report that i had had a paroxysm after six months i became melancholy and i wasted away i no longer attempted to amuse myself but sat all day with my eyes fixed upon vacancy i no longer attended to my person i allowed my beard to grow my face was never washed unless mechanically when ordered by the keeper and if i was not mad there was every prospect of my soon becoming so life passed away as a blank i had become indifferent to everything i noted time no more the change of seasons was unperceived even the day and the night followed without my regarding them i was in this unfortunate situation when one day the door was opened and as had been often the custom during my imprisonment visitors were going round the establishment to indulge their curiosity in witnessing the degradation of their fellow creatures or to offer their commiseration i paid no heed to them not even casting up my eyes this young man said the medical gentleman who accompanied the party has entertained the strange idea that his name is simple and that he is the rightful heir to the title and property of lord privilege one of the visitors came up to me and looked me in the face and so he is cried he to the doctor who looked with astonishment peter don't you know me i started up it was general o'brien i flew into his arms and burst into tears sir said general o'brien leading me to the chair and seating me upon it i tell you that is mr simple the nephew of lord privilege and i believe the heir to the title if therefore his assertion of such being the case is the only proof of his insanity he is illegally confined i am here a foreigner and a prisoner on parole but i am not without friends my lord belmore said he turning to another of the visitors who had accompanied him i pledge you my honour that what i state is true and i request you will immediately demand the release of this poor young man i assure you sir that i have lord privilege's letter observed the doctor lord privilege is a scoundrel replied general o'brien but there is justice to be obtained in this country and he shall pay dearly for his lettre de cachet my dear peter how fortunate was my visit to this horrid place i have heard so much of the excellent arrangements of this establishment that i agreed to walk round with lord belmore but i find that it is abused indeed general o'brien i have been treated with kindness replied i and particularly by this gentleman it was not his fault general o'brien and lord belmore then inquired of the doctor if he had any objection to my release none whatever my lord even if he were insane although i see now how i have been imposed upon we allow the friends of any patient to remove him if they think that they can pay him more attention he may leave with you this moment i now did feel my brain turn with the revulsion from despair to hope and i fell back in my seat the doctor perceiving my condition bled me copiously and laid me on the bed where i remained more than an hour watched by general o'brien i then got up calm and thankful i was shaved by the barber of the establishment washed and dressed myself and leaning on the general's arm was led out i cast my eyes upon the two celebrated stone figures of melancholy and raving madness as i passed them i trembled and clung more tightly to the general's arm was assisted into the carriage and bade farewell to madness and misery the general said nothing until we approached the hotel where he resided in dover street and then he inquired in a low voice whether i could bear more excitement is it celeste you mean general it is my dear boy she is here and he squeezed my hand alas cried i what hopes have i now of celeste more than you had before replied the general she lives but for you and if you are a beggar i have a competence to make you sufficiently comfortable i returned the general's pressure of the hand but could not speak we descended and in a minute i was led by the father into the arms of the astonished and delighted daughter i must pass over a few days during which i had almost recovered my health and spirits and had narrated my adventures to general o'brien and celeste my first object was to discover my sister what had become of poor ellen in the destitute condition in which she had been left i knew not and i resolved to go down to the vicarage and make inquiries i did not however set off until a legal adviser had been sent for by general o'brien and due notice given to lord privilege of an action to be immediately brought against him for false imprisonment i set off in the mail and the next evening arrived at the town of i hastened to the parsonage and the tears stood in my eyes as i thought of my mother my poor father and the peculiar and doubtful situation of my dear sister i was answered by a boy in livery and found the present incumbent at home he received me politely listened to my story and then replied that my sister had set off for london on the day of his arrival and that she had not communicated her intentions to any one here then was all clue lost and i was in despair i walked to the town in time to throw myself into the mail and the next evening joined celeste and the general to whom i communicated the unpleasant intelligence and requested advice how to proceed lord belmore called the next morning and the general consulted him his lordship took great interest in my concerns and previous to any further steps advised me to step into his carriage and allow him to relate my case to the first lord of the admiralty this was done immediately and as i had now an opportunity of speaking freely to his lordship i explained to him the conduct of captain hawkins and his connexion with my uncle also the reason of my uncle's persecution his lordship finding me under such powerful protection as lord belmore's and having an eye to my future claims which my uncle's conduct gave him reason to suppose were well founded was extremely gracious and said that i should hear from him in a day or two he kept his word and on the third day after my interview i received a note announcing my promotion to the rank of commander i was delighted with this good fortune as was general o'brien and celeste when at the admiralty i inquired about o'brien and found that he was expected home every day he had gained great reputation in the east indies was chief in command at the taking of some of the islands and it was said was to be created a baronet for his services everything wore a favourable aspect excepting the disappearance of my sister this was a weight on my mind i could not remove but i have forgotten to inform the reader by what means general o'brien and celeste arrived so opportunely in england martinique had been captured by our forces about six months before and the whole of the garrison surrendered as prisoners of war general o'brien was sent home and allowed to be on parole although born a frenchman he had very high connections in ireland of whom lord belmore was one when they arrived they had made every inquiry for me without success they knew that i had been tried by a court martial and dismissed my ship but after that no clue could be found for my discovery celeste who was fearful that some dreadful accident had occurred to me had suffered very much in health and general o'brien perceiving how much his daughter's happiness depended upon her attachment for me had made up his mind that if i were found we should be united i hardly need say how delighted he was when he discovered me though in a situation so little to be envied the story of my incarceration of the action to be brought against my uncle and the reports of foul play relative to the succession had in the meantime been widely circulated among the nobility and i found that every attention was paid me and i was repeatedly invited out as an object of curiosity and speculation the loss of my sister also was a subject of much interest and many people from good will made every inquiry to discover her i had returned one day from the solicitor's who had advertised for her in the newspapers without success when i found a letter for me on the table in an admiralty enclosure i opened it the enclosure was one from o'brien who had just cast anchor at spithead and who had requested that the letter should be forwarded to me if any one could tell my address my dear peter where are and what has become of you i have received no letters for these two years and i have fretted myself to death i received your letter about the rascally court martial but perhaps you have not heard that the little scoundrel is dead yes peter he brought your letter out in his own ship and that was his death warrant i met him at a private party he brought up your name i allowed him to abuse you and then told him he was a liar and a scoundrel upon which he challenged me very much against his will but the affront was so public that he couldn't help himself upon which i shot him with all the good will in the world and could he have jumped up again twenty times like jack in the box i would have shot him every time the dirty scoundrel but there's an end of him nobody pitied him for every one hated him and the admiral only looked grave and then was very much obliged to me for giving him a vacancy for his nephew by the bye from some unknown hand but i presume from the officers of his ship i received a packet of correspondence between him and your worthy uncle which is about as elegant a piece of rascality as ever was carried on between two scoundrels but that's not all peter i've got a young woman for you who will make your heart glad not mademoiselle celeste for i don't know where she is but the wet nurse who went out to india her husband was sent home as an invalid and she was allowed her passage home with him in my frigate finding that he belonged to the regiment i talked to him about one o'sullivan who married in ireland and mentioned the girl's name and when he discovered that she was a countryman of mine he told me that his real name was o'sullivan sure enough but that he had always served as o'connell and that his wife on board was the young woman in question upon which i sent to speak to her and telling her that i knew all about it and mentioning the names of ella flanagan and her mother who had given me the information she was quite astonished and when i asked her what had become of the child which she took in place of her own she told me that it had been drowned at plymouth and that her husband was saved at the same time by a young officer whose name i have here' says she and then she pulled out of her neck your card with peter simple on it now' says i do you know good woman that in helping on the rascally exchange of children you ruin that very young man who saved your husband for you deprive him of his title and property' she stared like a stuck pig when i said so and then cursed and blamed herself and declared she'd right you as soon as we came home and most anxious she is still to do so for she loves the very name of you so you see peter a good action has its reward sometimes in this world and a bad action also seeing as how i've shot that confounded villain who dared to ill use you i have plenty more to say to you peter but i don't like writing what perhaps may never be read so i'll wait till i hear from you and then as soon as i get through my business we will set to and trounce that scoundrel of an uncle i have twenty thousand pounds jammed together in the consolidated besides the spice islands which will be a pretty penny and every farthing of it shall go to right you peter and make a lord of you as i promised you often that you should be and if you win you shall pay and if you don't then damn the luck and damn the money too i beg you will offer my best regards to miss ellen and say how happy i shall be to hear that she is well but it has always been on my mind peter that your father did not leave too much behind him and i wish to know how you both get on i left you a carte blanche at my agent's and i only hope that you have taken advantage of it if required if not you're not the peter that i left behind me so now farewell and don't forget to answer my letter in no time ever yours terence o'brien this was indeed joyful intelligence i handed the letter to general o'brien who read it celeste hanging over his shoulder and perusing it at the same time this is well said the general peter i wish you joy and celeste i ought to wish you joy also at your future prospects it will indeed be a gratification if ever i hail you as lady privilege celeste said i you did not reject me when i was penniless and in disgrace o my poor sister ellen if i could but find you how happy should i be i sat down to write to o'brien acquainting him with all that had occurred and the loss of my dear sister the day after the receipt of my letter o'brien burst into the room after the first moments of congratulation were past he said my heart's broke peter about your sister ellen find her i must i shall give up my ship for i'll never give up the search as long as i live i must find her do pray my dear o'brien and i only wish wish what peter shall i tell you what i wish that if i find her you'll give her to me for my trouble we then turned round to general o'brien and celeste captain o'brien said the general sir terence o'brien if you please general his majesty has given me a handle to my name i congratulate you sir terence said the general shaking him by the hand what i was about to say is that i hope you will take up your quarters at this hotel and we will all live together i trust we shall soon find ellen in the meanwhile we have no time to lose in our exposure of lord privilege is the woman in town yes and under lock and key but the devil a fear of her millions would not bribe her to wrong him who risked his life for her husband she's irish general to the back bone nevertheless peter we must go to our solicitor to give the intelligence that he may take the necessary steps for three weeks o'brien was diligent in his search for ellen employing every description of emissary without success in the meanwhile the general and i were prosecuting our cause against lord privilege one morning lord belmore called upon us and asked the general if we would accompany him to the theatre to see two celebrated pieces performed in the latter which was a musical farce a new performer was to come out of whom report spoke highly celeste consented and after an early dinner we joined his lordship in his private box which was above the stage on the first tier the first piece was played and celeste who had never seen the performance of young was delighted the curtain then drew up for the second piece in the second act the new performer a miss henderson was led by the manager on the stage she was apparently much frightened and excited but three rounds of applause gave her courage and she proceeded at the very first notes of her voice i was startled and o'brien who was behind threw himself forward to look at her but as we were almost directly above and her head was turned the other way we could not distinguish her features as she proceeded in her song she gained courage and her face was turned towards us and she cast her eyes up saw me the recognition was mutual i held out my arm but could not speak she staggered and fell down in a swoon 'tis ellen cried o'brien rushing past me and making one spring down on the stage he carried her off before any other person could come to her assistance i followed him and found him with ellen still in his arms and the actresses assisting in her recovery the manager came forward to apologise stating that the young lady was too ill to proceed and the audience who had witnessed the behaviour of o'brien and myself were satisfied with the romance in real life which had been exhibited her part was read by another but the piece was little attended to every one trying to find out the occasion of this uncommon occurrence in the meantime ellen was put into a hackney coach by o'brien and me and we drove to the hotel where we were soon joined by the general and celeste chapter sixty five it never rains but it pours whether it be good or bad news i succeed in everything and to everything my wife my title and estate and all's well that ends well i shall pass over the scenes which followed and give my sister's history in her own words i wrote to you my dear peter to tell you that i had considered it my duty to pay all my father's debts with your money and that there were but sixty pounds left when every claim had been satisfied and i requested you to come to me as soon as you could that i might have your counsel and assistance as to my future arrangements i received your letter ellen and was hastening to you when but no matter i will tell my story afterwards day after day i waited with anxiety for a letter and then wrote to the officers of the ship to know if any accident had occurred i received an answer from the surgeon informing me that you had quitted portsmouth to join me and had not since been heard of you may imagine my distress at this communication as i did not doubt but that something dreadful had occurred as i know too well that nothing would have detained you from me at such a time the new vicar appointed had come down to look over the house and to make arrangements for bringing in his family the furniture he had previously agreed to take at a valuation and the sum had been appropriated in liquidation of our father's debts i had already been permitted to remain longer than was usual and had no alternative but to quit which i did not do until the last moment i could not leave my address for i knew not where i was to go i took my place in the coach and arrived in london my first object was to secure the means of livelihood by offering myself as a governess but i found great difficulties from not being able to procure a good reference and from not having already served in that capacity at last i was taken into a family to bring up three little girls but i soon found out how little chance i had of comfort the lady had objected to me as too good looking for this same reason the gentleman insisted upon my being engaged thus was i a source of disunion the lady treated me with great harshness and the gentleman with too much attention at last her ill treatment and his persecution were both so intolerable that i gave notice that i should leave my situation i beg your pardon miss ellen but will you oblige me with the name and residence of that gentleman said o'brien indeed ellen do no such thing replied i continue your story at last i was engaged as teacher to a school i had better have taken a situation as housemaid i was expected to be everywhere to do everything was up at daylight and never in bed till past midnight fared very badly and was equally ill paid but still it was honest employment and i remained there for more than a year but though as economical as possible my salary would not maintain me in clothes and washing which was all i required there was a master of elocution who came every week and whose wife was the teacher of music they took a great liking to me and pointed out how much better i should be off if i could succeed on the stage of which they had no doubt for months i refused hoping still to have some tidings of you but at last my drudgery became so insupportable and my means so decreased that i unwillingly consented it was then nineteen months since i had heard of you and i mourned you as dead i had no relations except my uncle and i was unknown even to him i quitted the situation and took up my abode with the teacher of elocution and his wife who treated me with every kindness and prepared me for my new career neither at the school which was three miles from london nor at my new residence which was over westminster bridge did i ever see a newspaper it was no wonder therefore that i did not know of your advertisements after three months' preparation i was recommended and introduced to the manager by my kind friends and accepted you know the rest well miss ellen if any one ever tells you that you were on the stage at all events you may reply that you wasn't there long my sister had been with us about three days during which i had informed her of all that had taken place when one evening finding myself alone with her i candidly stated to her what were o'brien's feelings towards her and pleaded his cause with all the earnestness in my power my dear brother replied she i have always admired captain o'brien's character and always have felt grateful to him for his kindness and attachment to you but i cannot say that i love him i have never thought about him except as one to whom we are both much indebted but do you mean to say that you could not love him no i do not and i will do all i can peter i will try i never will if possible make him unhappy who has been so kind to you depend upon it ellen that with your knowledge of o'brien and with feelings of gratitude to him you will soon love him if once you accept him as a suitor may i tell him you may tell him that he may plead his own cause my dear brother and at all events i will listen to no other until he has had fair play but recollect that at present i only like him like him very much it is true but still i only like him i was quite satisfied with my success and so was o'brien when i told him by the powers peter she's an angel and i can't expect her to love an inferior being like myself but if she'll only like me well enough to marry me i'll trust to after marriage for the rest o'brien having thus obtained permission certainly lost no time in taking advantage of it celeste and i were more fondly attached every day the solicitor declared my case so good that he could raise fifty thousand pounds upon it in short all our causes were prosperous when an event occurred the details of which of course i did not obtain until some time afterwards but which i shall narrate here my uncle was very much alarmed when he discovered that i had been released from bedlam still more so when he had notice given him of a suit relative to the succession to the title his emissaries had discovered that the wet nurse had been brought home in o'brien's frigate and was kept so close that they could not communicate with her he now felt that all his schemes would prove abortive his legal adviser was with him and they had been walking in the garden talking over the contingencies when they stopped close to the drawing room windows of the mansion at eagle park but sir observed the lawyer if you will not confide in me i cannot act for your benefit you still assert that nothing of the kind has taken place i do replied his lordship it is a foul invention then my lord may i ask you why you considered it advisable to imprison mr simple in bedlam because i hate him retorted his lordship detest him and for what reason my lord his character is unimpeached and he is your near relative i tell you sir that i hate him would that he were now lying dead at my feet hardly were the words out of my uncle's mouth when a whizzing was heard for a second and then something fell down within a foot of where they stood with a heavy crash they started turned round the adopted heir lay lifeless at their feet and their legs were bespattered with his blood and his brains the poor boy seeing his lordship below had leaned out of one of the upper windows to call to him but lost his balance and had fallen head foremost upon the wide stone pavement which surrounded the mansion for a few seconds the lawyer and my uncle looked upon each other with horror a judgment a judgment cried the lawyer at last looking at his client my uncle covered his face with his hands and fell assistance now came out but there was more than one to help up the violence of his emotion had brought on an apoplectic fit and my uncle although he breathed never spoke again it was in consequence of this tragical event of which we did not know the particulars until afterwards that the next morning my solicitor called and put a letter into my hand saying allow me to congratulate your lordship we were all at breakfast at the time and the general o'brien and myself jumped up all in such astonishment at this unexpected title being so soon conferred upon me that we had a heavy bill for damages to pay and had not ellen caught the tea urn as it was tipped over there would in all probability have been a doctor's bill into the bargain the letter was eagerly read it was from my uncle's legal adviser who had witnessed the catastrophe informing me that all dispute as to the succession was at an end by the tragical event that had taken place and that he had put seals upon everything awaiting my arrival or instructions the solicitor as he presented the letter said that he would take his leave and call again in an hour or two when i was more composed my first movement when i had read the letter aloud was to throw my arms round celeste and embrace her and o'brien taking the hint did the same to ellen and was excused in consideration of circumstances but as soon as she could disengage herself her arms were entwined round my neck while celeste was hanging on her father's having disposed of the ladies the gentlemen now shook hands and although we had not all appetites to finish our breakfasts never was there a happier quintette in about an hour my solicitor returned and congratulated me and immediately set about the necessary preparations i desired him to go down immediately to eagle park attend to the funeral of my uncle and the poor little boy who had paid so dearly for his intended advancement and take charge from my uncle's legal adviser who remained in the house the dreadful accident in high life found its way into the papers of the day and before dinner time a pile of visiting cards was poured in which covered the table the next day a letter arrived from the first lord announcing that he had made out my commission as post captain and trusted that i would allow him the pleasure of presenting it himself at his dinner hour at half past seven very much obliged to him the fool of the family might have waited a long while for it while i was reading this letter the waiter came up to say that a young woman below wanted to speak to me i desired her to be shown up as soon as she came in she burst into tears knelt down and kissed my hand sure it's you oh yes it's you that saved my poor husband when i was assisting to your ruin and a'n't i punished for my wicked doings a'n't my poor boy dead she said no more but remained on her knees sobbing bitterly of course the reader recognises in her the wet nurse who had exchanged her child i raised her up and desired her to apply to my solicitor to pay her expenses and leave her address but do you forgive me mr simple it's not that i have forgiven myself i do forgive you with all my heart my good woman you have been punished enough i have indeed replied she sobbing but don't i deserve it all and more too god's blessing and all the saints' too upon your head for your kind forgiveness anyhow my heart is lighter and she quitted the room she had scarcely quitted the hotel when the waiter came up again another lady my lord wishes to speak with you but she won't give her name really my lord you seem to have an extensive female acquaintance said the general at all events i am not aware of any that i need be ashamed of show the lady up waiter in a moment entered a fat unwieldy little mortal very warm from walking she sat down in a chair threw back her tippet and then exclaimed lord bless you how you have grown gemini if i can hardly believe my eyes and i declare he don't know me i really cannot exactly recollect were i had the pleasure of seeing you before madam well that's what i said to jemima when i went down in the kitchen jemima' says i i wonder if little peter simple will know me' and jemima says i think he would the parrot marm' mrs handycock i believe said i recollecting jemima and the parrot although from a little thin woman she had grown so fat as not to be recognisable oh so you've found me out mr simple my lord i ought to say well i need not ask after your grandfather now for i know he's dead but as i was coming this way for orders i thought i would just step in and see how you looked i trust mr handycock is well ma'am pray is he a bull or a bear lord bless you mr simple my lord i should say he's been neither bull nor bear for these three years he was obliged to waddle if i didn't know much about bulls and bears i know very well what a lame duck is to my cost we're off the stock exchange and mr handycock is set up as a coal merchant indeed yes that is we have no coals but we take orders and have half a crown a chaldron for our trouble as mr handycock says it's a very good business if you only had enough for it perhaps your lordship may be able to give us an order it's nothing out of your pocket and something into ours i shall be very happy when i return again to town mrs handycock i hope the parrot is quite well oh my lord that's a sore subject only think of mr handycock when we retired from the 'change taking my parrot one day and selling it for five guineas saying five guineas was better than a nasty squalling bird to be sure there was nothing for dinner that day but as jemima agreed with me we'd rather have gone without a dinner for a month than have parted with poll since we've looked up a little in the world i saved up five guineas by hook or by crook and tried to get poll back again but the lady said she wouldn't take fifty guineas for him mrs handycock then jumped from her chair saying good morning my lord i'll leave one of mr handycock's cards jemima would be so glad to see you as she left the room celeste laughingly asked me whether i had any more such acquaintances i replied that i believed not but i must acknowledge that mrs trotter was brought to my recollection and i was under some alarm lest she should also come and pay me her respects the next day i had another unexpected visit we had just sat down to dinner when we heard a disturbance below and shortly after the general's french servant came up in great haste saying that there was a foreigner below who wished to see me that he had been caning one of the waiters of the hotel for not paying him proper respect who can that be thought i and i went out of the door and looked over the banisters as the noise still continued you must not come here to beat englishmen i can tell you roared one of the waiters what do we care for your foreign counts sacre canaille cried the other party in a contemptuous voice which i well knew ay canal we'll duck you in the canal if you don't mind you will said the stranger who had hitherto spoken french allow me to observe in the most delicate manner in the world just to hint that you are a damned trencher scraping napkin carrying shilling seeking up and down stairs son of a bitch and take this for your impudence the noise of the cane was again heard and i hastened downstairs where i found count shucksen thrashing two or three of the waiters without mercy at my appearance the waiters who were showing fight retreated to a short distance out of reach of the cane my dear count exclaimed i is it you and i shook him by the hand my dear lord privilege will you excuse me but these fellows are saucy then i'll have them discharged replied i if a friend of mine and an officer of your rank and distinction cannot come to see me without insult i will seek another hotel this threat of mine and the reception i gave the count put all to rights the waiters sneaked off and the master of the hotel apologised it appeared that they had desired him to wait in the coffee room until they could announce him which had hurt the count's dignity we are sitting down to dinner count will you join us as soon as i have improved my toilet my dear lord replied he you must perceive that i am off a journey the master of the hotel bowed and proceeded to show the count to a dressing room when i returned up stairs what was the matter inquired o'brien o nothing a little disturbance in consequence of a foreigner not understanding english in about five minutes the waiter opened the door and announced count shucksen now o'brien you'll be puzzled said i and in came the count my dear lord privilege said he coming up and taking me by the hand let me not be the last to congratulate you upon your accession i was running up the channel in my frigate when a pilot boat gave me the newspaper in which i saw your unexpected change of circumstances i made an excuse for dropping my anchor at spithead this morning and i have come up post to express how sincerely i participate in your good fortune count shucksen then politely saluted the ladies and the general and turned round to o'brien who had been staring at him with astonishment count shucksen allow me to introduce sir terence o'brien by the piper that played before moses but it's a puzzle said o'brien earnestly looking in the count's face blood and thunder if it a'n't chucks my dear fellow when did you rise from your grave fortunately replied the count as they shook each other's hands for some time i never went into it sir terence but now with your permission my lord i'll take some food as i really am not a little hungry after dinner captain o'brien you shall hear my history his secret was confided to the whole party upon my pledging myself for their keeping it locked up in their own breasts which was a bold thing on my part considering that two of them were ladies the count stayed with us for some time and was introduced by me everywhere it was impossible to discover that he had not been bred up in a court his manners were so good he was a great favourite with the ladies and his mustachios bad french and waltzing an accomplishment he had picked up in sweden were quite the vogue all the ladies were sorry when the swedish count announced his departure by a ppc before i left town i called upon the first lord of the admiralty and procured for swinburne a first rate building that is to say ordered to be built this he had often said he wished as he was tired of the sea after a service of forty five years subsequently i obtained leave of absence for him every year and he used to make himself very happy at eagle park most of his time was however passed on the lake either fishing or rowing about telling long stories to all who would join him in his water excursions a fortnight after my assuming my title we set off for eagle park and celeste consented to my entreaties that the wedding should take place that day month upon this hint o'brien spake and to oblige me ellen consented that we should be united on the same day o'brien wrote to father mcgrath but the letter was returned by post with dead marked upon the outside o'brien then wrote to one of his sisters who informed him that father mcgrath would cross the bog one evening when he had taken a very large proportion of whisky and that he was seen out of the right path and had never been heard of afterwards on the day appointed we were all united and both unions have been attended with as much happiness as this world can afford both o'brien and i are blessed with children which as o'brien observed have come upon us like old age until we now can muster a large christmas party in the two families the general's head is white and he sits and smiles happy in his daughter's happiness and in the gambols of his grandchildren such reader is the history of peter simple viscount privilege no longer the fool but the head of the family who now bids you farewell
